1
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,000
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 42

3
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,000
This Tang Dynasty Sancai has a plump body...

4
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,720
...and shiny glaze.

5
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,720
It's beautiful.

6
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,160
You're an expert.

7
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,360
An expert,indeed.

8
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,010
Fine,I'll buy this.

9
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,530
Do you have more?

10
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,840
We don't have much this year.

11
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,200
Yes,Tang Dynasty Sancai of this quality...

12
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,400
...is rare.

13
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,240
It's hard to find. -You're right.

14
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,840
I'll be honest. My father is an antiques collector.

15
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,280
Me,too. -He likes the Tang Dynasty Sancai.

16
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,800
I flew around the world to find this for him.

17
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,180
You're filial.

18
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,720
Let's do  this. All the Tang Dynasty Sancai you have,...

19
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,640
...I'll buy them all.

20
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,000
Boss Li, as sons and daughters,...

21
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,040
...we only want to make our parents happy.

22
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,000
I hope you can help us.

23
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,530
What about this?

24
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,560
The quantity is limited but I do have them.

25
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,400
There'll be the time constraint.

26
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,120
Give me two days. I'll find some for you.

27
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,720
All right. I'll await your good news.

28
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,600
Okay.

29
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,480
So will you pay a deposit or.....

30
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,760
I don't understand. A boss that earns billions...

31
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,600
...is staying here? -This place is hidden.

32
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,940
No one will come here or investigate.

33
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,520
There's nothing special with this Boss Li.

34
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,920
He doesn't look like who we're looking for.

35
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,900
What's wrong? Are your eyes uncomfortable?

36
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,240
I looked earlier and there was the word Feng carved inside.

37
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,800
If Boss Li...

38
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,200
...believes that we are rich and ignorant people,...

39
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,840
...he'll be on his move soon.

40
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,250
Let's go.

41
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,520
Xiaofei,let us find a hiding spot.

42
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,120
If he comes out, we'll follow him.

43
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,720
Okay. -Wait.

44
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,100
Bring Zhuang Rui back to rest.

45
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,280
Xiaoyun and I will monitor them.

46
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,320
Yes,hurry back and rest well.

47
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,240
Leave this to us.

48
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,700
Off you go. -All right.

49
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,700
Come,let's get in the car.

50
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,640
Get in the car? -Why not?

51
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,280
We'll attract attention in this village.

52
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,280
Are you trying to expose ourselves?

53
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,840
Let's go. Come on.

54
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,360
Let's go. -Hurry.

55
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,240
Take your shoes off. -Why?

56
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,850
Just take it off!

57
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,440
I.....

58
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,220
Are you really doing this?

59
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,320
It's daytime. Why are the doors closed?

60
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,930
It's eerily silent.

61
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,240
Boss Li clearly came through here.

62
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,880
He's gone now. -Whose fault is it?

63
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,400
You're too slow, now we've lost him.

64
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,560
I'm walking barefoot. My feet are freezing.

65
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,480
There's shoes for you to wear.

66
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,080
Shoes?

67
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,730
Do you mean this?

68
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,530
Do you think Xiaorui can walk in these?

69
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,120
What now? I'm cold and hungry.

70
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,330
There's a restaurant here.

71
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,320
No,don't close up!

72
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,400
We're starving. Let us in for some food.

73
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,600
We're closed. -No,just give us some food.

74
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,260
We'll leave after that,okay?

75
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,360
We're sold out. Come back tomorrow.

76
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,280
No,please let us in. We just need to rest.

77
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,280
We're new to this place. There's no one here.

78
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,810
You look like a nice person.

79
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,120
Fine,come in. -Thank you.

80
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,160
I just received a huge order.

81
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,480
Make a new batch within six days.

82
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
Don't delay this.

83
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,720
Listen well.

84
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,520
If you dare carve word on another piece,...

85
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
...I'll kill you.

86
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,120
You don't look like locals. Why did you come here?

87
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,080
Sister,I need to tell you this.

88
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,240
My wife is pregnant. The city has too much pressure.

89
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,840
We can't afford a car or a house. There's haze,too.

90
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,640
I can't allow my wife and our baby...

91
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,840
...to suffer,right?

92
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,120
You're a good husband.

93
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,320
You gave your shoes to her and walked barefoot.

94
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,160
You can't wear those shoes while pregnant.

95
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,400
Sister,you know me so well.

96
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,400
We were thinking of moving...

97
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,810
...to a place with beautiful scenery.

98
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,880
We found photos online. The place look good.

99
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,040
When we came and looked around Garden Village,...

100
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,240
...there's no garden in sight. We even got lost!

101
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,840
You must have seen old pictures.

102
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,960
This place used to have a beautiful scenery.

103
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,360
Did it?

104
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,600
Why did it become the way it is now?

105
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,960
Someone bought the factory in the North of the village.

106
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,760
At first,everyone wanted to work there.

107
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,440
Later,there were ghosts sightings and people left.

108
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,480
It has become abandoned since.

109
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,760
Abandoned factory?

110
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,600
Do you know where it is? Is someone there?

111
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,960
It's at the abandoned land northwards. It's abandoned,...

112
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,360
...so who would be there?

113
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,680
Some heard sounds coming from the factory at night.

114
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,760
There's smoke,flames and even shadows.

115
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,040
Someone went missing a few days earlier.

116
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,720
Everyone got scared after that.

117
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,720
So we close our doors before nightfall.

118
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,480
Wife,...

119
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,090
...let us leave this place.

120
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,480
Mr. Yamaki,have a look.

121
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,080
You won't be disappointed.

122
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,240
It's a quality item.

123
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,120
Definitely a quality item.

124
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,240
I can't believe this.

125
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,090
The long-forgotten skill of making Tang Dynasty Sancai...

126
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,560
...has resurfaced.

127
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,960
What do you say? This deal will only bring you profit.

128
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,760
Once you sign the agreement, the factory will be yours.

129
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,680
Boss Li,you're agreeable.

130
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,080
However,you should know this.

131
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,060
There are factories everywhere.

132
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,560
Why did you think I agreed to work with you?

133
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,360
I'm not just interested in the factory,...

134
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,880
...but more importantly, the fine craftsmanship of...

135
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,120
...making pottery.

136
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,120
Of course, speaking of skills,...

137
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,320
...they are indeed priceless.

138
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,400
Priceless treasures...

139
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,040
...should go places...

140
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,000
...so more people know about it,isn't it?

141
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,720
I believe no one has offered a higher price.

142
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,200
Here's RMB5 million.

143
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:36,400
I hope you will hand over the factory...

144
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,280
...and all employees to me.

145
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,720
RMB5 million seems too little.

146
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,800
Of course, this is just the deposit.

147
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,120
Deposit?

148
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,480
I know how things are done here.

149
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,760
As long as you sign the agreement,...

150
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,840
...there's much more to anticipate.

151
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,600
You'll be part of it,too.

152
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,880
Okay,once I sign this,...

153
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,640
...I'll hand over our employees' records.

154
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,800
What? Ghost sightings?

155
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,680
You're joking. -It must be made-up.

156
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,600
Listen to me, the village was strange.

157
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,840
There's not a soul on the street and doors are shut tight.

158
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,640
If the kind lady didn't pity us,...

159
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,040
...we'd have died on the streets,right?

160
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,120
Are you going to continue acting pitiful?

161
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,480
Dear wife,it's the pregnancy mood swings. I understand.

162
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,440
What? Wife?

163
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,280
Why? Only you and Feifei can do it?

164
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,200
Feifei and I can do it,too.

165
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,280
Besides,my acting is better than yours.

166
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,840
Am I right,Feifei?

167
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,080
We followed Boss Li...

168
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,840
...but got lost in the end.

169
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,120
What now? Do we wait for Boss Li to look for us?

170
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,080
No,you mentioned the abandoned factory.

171
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,000
Since it's abandoned, why are there flames and smoke?

172
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,200
Something doesn't sound right. Let's check the place out.

173
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,200
What? Are you looking for ghosts?

174
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,520
All of you can go. I'm not going.

175
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,700
Didn't you say you're not coming?

176
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,280
You're sickly and weak so I need to protect you.

177
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,600
Who's sickly and weak?

178
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,320
Him! I need to protect Xiaorui.

179
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,040
You came because you're afraid of being alone,right?

180
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,800
Me? Afraid?

181
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,440
If any ghosts appear later,...

182
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,560
...I'll beat them up one by one.

183
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,520
None of you will stop me.

184
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,960
I don't believe in ghosts. -We must be careful anyway.

185
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,420
Sometimes,humans are scarier than ghosts.

186
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,680
That looks like it. Let's go in.

187
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,720
Let's go.

188
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,200
This factory looks old.

189
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,120
It doesn't seem like someone's been here.

190
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,400
Why don't we take a look and just leave?

191
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,810
Are these what's left when the factory was in operation?

192
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,400
This piece was smelted not long ago.

193
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:15,400
Smooth white clay is used to make the body of Tang Dynasty Sancai.

194
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,840
This should be made from smelted white clay.

195
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,720
This means that the flame and smoke that villagers saw...

196
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,160
...are the smoke and sparks from smelting the Tang Dynasty Sancai.

197
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,360
The shadows must be that of the smelters.

198
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,640
No,making Tang Dynasty Sancai isn't that easy.

199
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,600
They'd need equipments and tools. This place is abandoned.

200
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,760
Let's go further.

201
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,480
Are you all right?

202
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,120
I'm fine.

203
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,160
How long are we watching this crazy man?

204
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,240
Just a few more days. It'll be over when the batch is ready.

205
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,400
We'll gamble after this. -How many days has it been?

206
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,680
I'll go over there.

207
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,640
Stay here. -Leave it to us.

208
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,520
Pengfei. -All right.

209
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
Hold this for me.

210
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,560
Why didn't the crazy man listen well?

211
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,120
Who are you? -Brother.

212
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,160
Boss Li sent us here. -Boss Li? He said nothing.

213
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,880
Impossible. He told us.....

214
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,480
I didn't get a chance to hit them.

215
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,800
This should be the place.

216
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,640
Calm down. -Let me die!

217
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,880
Kill me. -Calm down. Listen here.

218
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,520
We're not the bad guy and won't harm you.

219
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,520
Why won't you let me die?

220
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,600
Who made the Tang Dynasty Sancai? Was it you?

221
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,360
I don't know.

222
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,760
Did you make these Tang Dynasty Sancai?

223
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,800
It's me. So what?

224
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,360
Hit me! I'm the only one who could make it.

225
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:40,440
Why are there nothing carved inside?

226
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,520
How did you know nothing was carved inside?

227
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,800
Boss,they've entered the factory.

228
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,000
Gather all our men.

229
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,120
Bring them here. Don't let them escape. Go!

230
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,560
Yes,boss.

231
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,440
Who are you?

232
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,200
The Tang Dynasty Sancai you made is exquisite...

233
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,780
...and could pass off for the real thing.

234
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,520
Why are you locked in here?

235
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,920
I'm Feng Guoqin.

236
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,840
This place belonged to my family.

237
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,120
We specialized in creating modern crafts.

238
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,960
Later,business went down and we owed Boss Li money.

239
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,360
I gave this factory to him as mortgage.

240
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,200
I was locked here for days and nights...

241
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,800
...to make imitations of Tang Dynasty Sancai.

242
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,840
My debts should be paid off by now...

243
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,000
...but do you think he'll let me go?

244
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,520
Sir,have you been firing pottery at night?

245
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,280
This means the flame and smoke are true.

246
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,760
Boss Li coerced you to make imitation Tang Dynasty Sancai.

247
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,040
It's a crime.

248
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,320
I wanted to preserve the family's business...

249
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,840
...and lied to myself...

250
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,360
...that I will escape from here and expose everything.

251
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,200
However,he went back on his words...

252
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,880
...and plans to sell this factory to a Japanese.

253
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,240
I won't allow it. Never!

254
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,560
A Japanese? What does he have to do with this?

255
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,360
This factory has been out of operation and has ghost sightings.

256
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,600
This deal must not be an innocent one.

257
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,640
I believe he wants your craftsmanship.

258
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,980
Your craftsmanship of making Tang Dynasty Sancai.

259
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,760
I will not let that happen.

260
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,240
They've used me to do many bad things.

261
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,720
I will not allow my family heirloom to be sold off.

262
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,600
Mr. Feng,don't worry. Now that you've meet us,...

263
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,080
...we'll not sit back and watch. Your craft is priceless.

264
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,520
It's our nation's pride.

265
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,680
These greedy people only want it for themselves.

266
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,400
They should seek permission from the majority.

267
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,930
I'll be the first to object.

268
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,160
We're hoping that a craftsman like you...

269
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:55,440
...will pass down and showcase our traditional culture.

270
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,280
So we'll definitely get you out of here.

271
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,040
Don't worry. I'm a police officer.

272
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,520
Boss Li is involved in fraud...

273
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,880
...and false imprisonment. He'll pay for it.

274
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,760
How did you know that nothing was carved...

275
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,640
...inside the Tang Dynasty Sancai?

276
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,160
It's a coincidence. I broke one of it...

277
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,240
...and saw the carving on the inside of the Tang Dynasty Sancai.

278
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,120
However,there's nothing carved inside the one I broke today.

279
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,600
Boss Li must have...

280
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,080
...heard about it and threatened you.

281
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,060
Yes,there's something I don't understand.

282
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,090
The Tang Dynasty Sancai that you made earlier,...

283
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,280
...why was there a carving inside?

284
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,840
They're inside!

285
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,280
Who are they? -Watch out.

286
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,000
Good question!

287
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,280
I want to know why he did that,too.

288
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,200
He foiled my plans. Take them away!

289
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,960
Don't let anyone escape!

290
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,080
Take them to the car.

291
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,960
Don't burn it! No!

292
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:11,280
This is all my hard work. You can't burn it!

293
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,680
Old Feng.

294
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,920
Out with the old,in with the new. I'll build you a new factory.

295
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:23,840
Old Feng,don't worry. You'll have a bigger work station.

296
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,960
Prepare to work for the rest of your life.

297
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,640
Dream on.

298
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,120
I made the imitation goods for the sake of my factory.

299
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,320
Now that it's no more, I won't be ordered around.

300
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,400
I,Feng Guoqin,promise...

301
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,520
...to destroy my hands...

302
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,200
...and will never make another imitation good!

303
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,880
Mr. Feng!

304
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,640
Freeze! -Don't move!

305
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,480
Stop! Seal the area!

306
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,720
Are you okay? Get up.

307
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,200
Are you all right? -Are you hurt?

308
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,320
Isn't this the one.....

309
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,680
It's not mine. Throw it away.

310
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,440
Thank you for cooperating. You may go now.

311
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,200
How's Feng Guoqin doing? -Don't worry. He's been admitted.

312
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,080
Although selling imitation goods is a huge crime,...

313
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,560
...we have looked into the circumstances.

314
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,290
This will be handled accordingly.

315
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,880
All right.

316
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,560
Is your hand better now?

317
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,680
Mr. Zhuang,...

318
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,400
...I'm grateful to all of you.

319
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,360
If not,I would've still be locked underground...

320
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,880
...and make imitation goods my whole life.

321
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,980
Don't mention it. It's what we should do.

322
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,930
Boss Li have been captured.

323
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,880
The police have investigated the case.

324
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,840
You're free now.

325
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,520
I have something to ask you.

326
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,360
How did you figure out the Tang Dynasty Sancai isn't real?

327
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,000
Is it really a coincidence...

328
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,230
...that you saw the carved word on a broken piece?

329
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,120
Meeting you...

330
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,560
...is an honour. I'm happy for that.

331
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,230
However,you seem to be hung up on this question.

332
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,440
I couldn't figure it out.

333
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:35,560
Is there something wrong with my craftsmanship?

334
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:41,670
I should have perfected the art of making the Tang Dynasty Sancai.

335
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,440
How could you have spotted a flaw?

336
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,960
If I must point out a flaw,...

337
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,190
...it's that you made it too perfect.

338
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,880
Perfect?

339
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,320
Is perfectionism bad?

340
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,840
The moon waxes only to wane, water brims only to overflow.

341
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,960
The Tang Dynasty Sancai you made was too perfect.

342
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,400
Although you brought out its charms,...

343
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,400
...it lacks the precipitation and vicissitude of history.

344
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,120
I'm sure you know...

345
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,160
...that precipitation and vicissitude can't be imitated.

346
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,960
It needs to go through the test of time.

347
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,760
That is only possible with time.

348
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,240
This is what gives an object its soul. This soul...

349
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:49,040
...is actually a gift from history and the original maker.

350
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,960
An object needs to have a soul...

351
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,360
...so that one could feel...

352
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,600
...the changes in history,...

353
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,320
...the rise and fall of dynasties...

354
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,880
...and of civilizations.

355
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,640
I was able to give it shape...

356
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,120
...but I couldn't give it a soul.

357
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:28,280
Actually,your skill is on par with ancient craftsman.

358
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,320
If you create things that you like,...

359
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,520
...I believe that they will be...

360
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,520
...valuable treasures in many years to come.

361
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,960
Me? I can't do it.

362
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,920
This is only a hobby to me.

363
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,680
A craftsman with exquisite skill like you is hard to find.

364
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,840
A master like you is rare indeed.

365
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:58,280
The Tang Dynasty Sancai is the only modern craft ...

366
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,600
...without a flaw.

367
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,760
How would you know if you don't give it a try?

368
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,320
If you do, I'll be your biggest fan.

369
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,480
Master?

370
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,920
I don't even look like...

371
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,720
...a craftsman.

372
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,720
The lab is destroyed.

373
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,440
The factory is burned down. I can't even afford...

374
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,040
...to pay for expenses...

375
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,360
...of building a new kiln.

376
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,800
I can help you financially.

377
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:44,160
Mr. Feng,you have a visitor. Please come in.

378
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,700
Nice to meet you,Mr. Feng.

379
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,800
I'll take my leave.

380
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,080
Mr. Feng.

381
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,080
May I take a seat?

382
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,760
Thank you.

383
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,800
Are you from the corporation...

384
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,400
...that wanted to buy the factory?

385
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,720
Mr. Feng.

386
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,200
I'm interested in Chinese antiques and crafts...

387
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,800
...like the Tang Dynasty Sancai. I like it a lot.

388
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,200
I came here...

389
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,480
...to invite you to Japan.

390
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:50,360
I will provide the best work station in the world.

391
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,240
You'll be given a lab with excellent assistants.

392
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,920
Not only that,you will receive a production fee...

393
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:02,840
...of not less than USD3 million yearly.

394
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,760
You'll be able to create astounding pottery.

395
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:14,480
You want me to continue making imitation Tang Dynasty Sancai.

396
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,760
No.

397
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,040
It's called research.

398
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,480
It's to showcase your skills to the world...

399
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,920
...so that people will know,understand and respect you.

400
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,120
They'll also know,understand...

401
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:33,400
...and respect the Tang Dynasty Sancai.

402
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,200
I can't help you with that. Please leave.

403
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,800
I'm not willing to leave an inch away from China.

404
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,240
Very well.

405
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,680
Mr. Feng.

406
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,560
Since you won't leave China,...

407
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,840
...I can build a factory just for you...

408
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,440
...right here in China.

409
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,840
It'll be managed by you.

410
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,720
I promise...

411
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:28,240
...that you'll receive the best treatment and be respected...

412
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,360
...for the rest of your life in China.

413
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,040
Many bad things have happened to you in China.

414
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,000
I hope you can forget them...

415
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,960
...and start afresh.

416
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,280
This feels great! The Japanese man looks dejected.

417
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,880
My poor Tang Dynasty Sancai. Even if it's fake,...

418
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,340
...I could still have given it to Miss Xiaojia as a gift.

419
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,640
Tang Dynasty Sancai.

420
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,980
Even your dreams are about the Tang Dynasty Sancai.

421
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,200
Don't get excited too quickly.

422
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,020
Hurry and get ready. We're leaving soon.

423
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,480
All right.

424
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,760
We're about to enter the desert.

425
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,280
My men should be there soon.
