The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,500
Episode 27

3
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,160
Miss,you don't drink or eat.

4
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,759
If you fall sick, madam will be worried about you.

5
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,020
She won't be worried about me.

6
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,520
She cares for nothing except for the money.

7
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,840
Miss,madam is worried about you.

8
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,080
Tell her,if she doesn't let Zhuang Rui off,...

9
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,320
...I'll continue to skip my meals.

10
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,040
Miss,however.....

11
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,040
How was it? -She wouldn't drink or eat.

12
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,760
She said..... -What did she say?

13
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,560
She said if you don't change your mind,she'll still skip her meals.

14
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,760
Okay.

15
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,800
You don't have to send her food anymore.

16
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,680
Since she wants to die for an outsider,...

17
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,120
...let her be.

18
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,720
You were the one that scared us,right?

19
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,240
Why didn't you explode?

20
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,160
You useless thing!

21
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,640
You scared me!

22
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,400
Luckily it is a dud.

23
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,250
Pick up more of that.

24
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,360
Here.

25
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,020
Take it!

26
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,700
Here you go.

27
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,800
Well.....

28
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,400
Thank you.

29
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,040
However,don't do it again.

30
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,370
I know your mission is to protect me...

31
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,480
...but don't risk your life. -Without the mission,...

32
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,600
...I'll still protect you.

33
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,730
I can't tell you much...

34
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
...about this matter.

35
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
Give me some time.

36
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,220
I'll tell you about it.

37
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,280
It's okay. Everyone has secrets.

38
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,880
Everyone has secrets.

39
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,880
I think the firewood is still not enough.

40
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,010
It's enough. It can last us three days.

41
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,560
Do you know why you don't have a girlfriend?

42
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,000
They're having a good chat. Can't you see that?

43
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,200
By the way, I have something to tell you.

44
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,320
We're using this way...

45
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:21,120
...to find something instead of running away from Dama.

46
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,360
What is it?

47
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,720
This is a treasure map. Pengfei and I think that...

48
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,240
...it was left by the Japanese army.

49
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,580
Isn't this picture...

50
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,280
...same like the broken jade from the pawn shop?

51
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,080
Yes.

52
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,680
We weren't able to find any clue for so long...

53
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,960
...but you found it here. You're so great!

54
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,760
Moreover,you hid it from me!

55
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,690
Stop! -How dare you hide it from me!

56
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,920
You hid it from me,too!

57
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,040
You told her the truth?

58
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,160
I wanted to tell you since a long time ago.

59
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,290
Feifei,give me the map.

60
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,920
We're right. Have a look here.

61
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,159
I was curious about this area.

62
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,850
Now I got it. It was the place where they put the landmine.

63
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,450
Look at this.

64
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,780
This is the dud that we found this afternoon.

65
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,370
Is it written in Japanese? Did it belong to the Japanese?

66
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,290
This is the first type of landmine.

67
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,600
This model was made in the 1960's.

68
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,120
The words on it...

69
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,450
...were left by the Japanese during the World War II.

70
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,800
No wonder you are a top student!

71
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,440
The landmine was...

72
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,720
...planted here.

73
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,890
Let's have a celebration for managing to cross the area.

74
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,960
Let's have a good meal tonight!

75
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,960
I'll stay up tonight. Have a good rest.

76
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,200
We have an early start tomorrow -Okay.

77
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,330
I'll get some water.

78
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,120
What about the celebration?

79
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,620
Hold on.

80
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,340
There is something wrong.

81
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,480
What's wrong?

82
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,520
I have no idea but I think people often come and go here.

83
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,600
There is a guard hiding over there.

84
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:42,940
Where is he?

85
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,210
What are you going to do?

86
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,600
Let's wait this out.

87
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,530
Have a look here.

88
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,080
This is our location.

89
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,960
We are about 5 km away from the treasure.

90
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,690
What are we waiting here? Let's go!

91
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,060
Why are you so anxious? He's not done yet.

92
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,200
It isn't good news to find a guard hiding here.

93
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,420
Pengfei,check it out.

94
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,280
No problem. Feifei,I need your help.

95
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,560
Xiaorui. Xiaoyun. -You're back.

96
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,800
Feifei,how was it?

97
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,730
I got rid of him. You? -I'm fine.

98
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,200
Xiaorui,give me the map.

99
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,250
Sit down.

100
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,410
Have some water.

101
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,530
Thank you for working hard.

102
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,120
There is a base here.

103
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,360
Based on my observation, all entrances and rooms...

104
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,330
...are guarded.

105
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,040
There are dozens of people.

106
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,920
Who would set up a base in the forest?

107
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,120
They can be drug traffickers or an armed group.

108
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,160
The government is working hard to deal with drug dealers.

109
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,440
Many drug dealers hide in the jungle.

110
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,640
They are ruthless.

111
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,520
If we meet them,...

112
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,210
...it's hard for us to survive.

113
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,220
Fei,what do you think?

114
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,850
We have another option.

115
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,480
We may go from the back of the base...

116
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,080
...to find the treasure.

117
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,680
I wanted to say that,too!

118
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:37,880
Is it safe?

119
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,880
Based on the map and my observation,...

120
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,770
...it should be fine as long as we are careful.

121
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,620
It's getting late now.

122
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,960
Let's rest. We'll continue the journey tomorrow.

123
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,650
It may rain tonight. Let's find shelter in a cave.

124
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,800
I think we should move towards there.

125
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,120
Sure. It is a high terrain. There should be a cave.

126
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,200
Hold on.

127
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,680
There is a cave over there. We can take a break.

128
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,800
It seems that someone has cleaned it.

129
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,080
The villagers may have used it...

130
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,160
...as a place to rest when they hunt.

131
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,800
There is a smell of roasted meat!

132
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,560
This is Hu Rong's territory.

133
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,880
The villagers may tell Hu Rong if they've seen the arrest warrant.

134
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,890
Therefore,we should observe before making a decision.

135
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,720
Feifei,you go with Xiaoyun. I'll go with Xiaorui.

136
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,730
Make sure you tread softly. -Okay.

137
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,560
It's going to rain soon.

138
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,680
They are Chinese. -I've contacted them.

139
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,560
We'll go to their base tomorrow. We'll have a deal.

140
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,720
The amount of stock is big. Boss said that...

141
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,880
...we can't afford to make any mistake.

142
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,960
Du Wa will come tomorrow.

143
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,290
Pengfei!

144
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,360
Pengfei!

145
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,640
Pengfei,don't be reckless! -Don't stop me!

146
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,370
Don't be reckless! -Don't stop me! I'll kill him!

147
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,460
Who are you?

148
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,680
We've been following two of you for a long time.

149
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,120
Who do you think we are?

150
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,960
Tell us the truth.

151
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,960
You have to be frank to us.

152
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,490
If you tell us the truth,...

153
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,770
...you may get a lighter sentence.

154
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,280
As police, you can't force us,too.

155
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,000
You know the law well.

156
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,109
It's okay. I won't force you.

157
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,280
Other people will force you.

158
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,560
If you become the prosecution witness...

159
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,119
...and betray your boss,...

160
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,770
...what do you think...

161
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,040
...may happen to you?

162
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
Tell us the truth.

163
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,210
We are from Yunnan. We came to Myanmar for the first time.

164
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,840
Stop acting! -Fine,I'll tell you.

165
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,850
There is no stock in our country so we want to buy it from Du Wa.

166
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,680
Tell me! -Pengfei!

167
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,080
Where is Du Wa? -Pengfei!

168
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,180
Pengfei! -Tell me!

169
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,760
Walk towards the South for 3 km.

170
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,700
Is it the base that we saw earlier?

171
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,220
That's enough!

172
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,900
Let the drug squad from Yunnan to take over the case.

173
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,880
Who is Du Wa?

174
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:02,880
Du Wa...

175
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,000
...is a drug dealer at the border area.

176
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,080
My brother and I came here six years ago to make a deal.

177
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,240
We fell into Du Wa's trap when we were walking in the forest.

178
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,340
In order to protect me, my brother...

179
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,340
...was caught.

180
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,850
After that, I received a parcel...

181
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,560
...from Du Wa.

182
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,620
Inside was my brother's.....

183
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,880
I made a vow after that.

184
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,760
As long as I have a chance,...

185
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,410
...I'll seize Du Wa.

186
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,650
We understand your feeling...

187
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,360
...but the four of us are not his match.

188
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,290
Don't worry.

189
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,960
I won't take the risk.

190
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,730
Pengfei is gone!

191
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,290
Pengfei is gone!

192
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,260
Where is he?

193
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:51,970
This is.....

194
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,500
"I have to do what I should do. I'm sorry."

195
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,000
Stop!

196
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,720
Where is Du Wa? -He's sleeping in the room.

197
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,180
Which room? -It's at the end of the corridor.

198
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,880
Why is Xiaofei so stubborn?

199
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,490
We've told him it's risky. He still wants to go there!

200
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,720
What shall we do now? Let's save him now.

201
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,000
Save him?

202
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,890
Did you listen to me yesterday?

203
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,000
Don't you know the power of the drug dealer?

204
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,160
They are heavily armed and ruthless.

205
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,600
If we go without any plan, it'll be a suicide mission.

206
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,060
What are we going to do? Will we just sit here?

207
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,280
If he was caught, he would be killed.

208
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,640
We should have a perfect plan.

209
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,130
Xiaorui.

210
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,080
Fine,take your time to think.

211
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,600
I'll go by myself.

212
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,000
Calm down.

213
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,440
We need to have a plan.

214
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,000
Didn't we say it just now? What shall we do?

215
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,200
Both of you are right. Pengfei is in danger now.

216
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,820
However, if we go without a plan.....

217
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,320
I have an idea.

218
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,760
What are you trying to do?

219
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,160
It has been four days. Why aren't there any news?

220
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,440
What is this place? There isn't a bathroom here!

221
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,680
I shall not follow you the next time.

222
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,080
After we make the deal, we'll go shopping.

223
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,740
You may buy whatever you want.

224
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,600
What brings you here?

225
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,360
Wang Mazi sent me to take the stock.

226
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,690
Who are they?

227
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,380
This is my wife.

228
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,440
He is..... -I'm his brother.

229
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:20,880
Go.

230
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,770
It is quite lively here.

231
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,920
Mind your own business.

232
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:38,160
Brother,the buyers are here.

233
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,800
You're quite tough!

234
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,000
You injured my brothers.

235
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,440
This is only a warm-up for you.

236
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,170
There are more punishments awaiting you!

237
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:13,920
Stop!

238
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,250
What did you say?

239
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,720
Do you know him?

240
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,640
We don't know him.

241
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,480
You look so fair. You aren't a drug dealer,right?

242
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,440
Brother, if we aren't drug dealers,...

243
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,120
...why are we here?

244
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,600
You are right!

245
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,740
What are you doing?

246
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,650
Brother.

247
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,640
They.....

248
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,720
You look unfamiliar.

249
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,120
Brother Du,Wang Mazi sent me here to take the stock.

250
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,360
I'm A'Kun. He is my brother,A'Qiang.

251
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,440
This is my wife. We're here for the first time.

252
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,040
Of course we look unfamiliar to you.

253
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,530
Wang Mazi...

254
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,840
...didn't tell me there would be a woman here.

255
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,650
He didn't say it because...

256
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,280
...a brother of mine was in trouble...

257
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,280
...so he didn't manage to get a passport.

258
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,940
Since the hotel is booked,...

259
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,240
...I brought my wife along.

260
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,520
Since you are my guests,...

261
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,520
...let me entertain you.

262
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,680
I'm sorry to my brother that  I couldn't kill you.

263
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,280
You still want revenge even though you are in danger.

264
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,920
I'm so touched!

265
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,840
How was it?

266
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:31,840
Tell me!

267
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,320
How was it?

268
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,440
How was it?

269
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,800
How was it? Was it great?

270
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,500
You must be feeling great now!

271
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,280
Jiang Ge!

272
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,920
Take good care of our guests.

273
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,800
Let's go!

274
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,560
Test it.

275
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:26,840
Try it.

276
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,699
We don't have to test Brother Du's stock.

277
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,840
Let's call off the deal then.

278
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,080
Brother,my husband is weak.

279
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,960
You can replace him instead.

280
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,360
Brother!

281
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,710
What's wrong?

282
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,920
Brother..... -What's wrong?

283
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,720
He overdosed on drugs and almost died.

284
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,600
How is he now? -He's fine.

285
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,080
Why are you telling me then?

286
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,610
How is the deal with Laoliu?

287
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,760
Brother fought with them. The deal was cancelled.

288
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,120
Why are you still here? Get lost!

289
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,530
Don't let me repeat myself!

290
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,450
We sell drugs but don't take it.

291
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,300
This is the basic rule.

292
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,090
I'm new yet I know the rule. Your big brother.....

293
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,250
It's none of your business!

294
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,540
Yes,it's none of my business.

295
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,280
I only know that your brother...

296
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,400
...doesn't... -Shut up!

297
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,360
...follow the rule and your business is getting worse.

298
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,160
Shut up!

299
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,400
I feel pity for you as the 2nd Boss.

300
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,440
How dare you call me that!

301
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,000
I dare you to kill my husband!

302
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,360
You are great!

303
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,600
I shall kill you first!

304
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,640
Brother,let's talk nicely.

305
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,530
We have a good thing for you.

306
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,820
We have a treasure map.

307
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,450
Can we exchange our lives with the map?

308
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,250
Are you kidding?

309
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,400
It was left by the Japanese army.

310
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,300
During World War II,they took a lot of valuables from Myanmar.

311
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,240
This is the treasure map.

312
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,600
The Japanese?

313
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,380
All of you go out first.

314
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,240
Do you think you can exchange your lives...

315
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,000
...by using this map?

316
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,960
What do you want?

317
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,290
Make a guess.

318
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,810
If I'm not mistaken,...

319
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,160
...you want to kill Du Wa.

320
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,560
Dear,you're so funny!

321
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,640
We don't even have a weapon. This is their base.

322
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,280
It's impossible for us to kill him!

323
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,760
You have two choices now.

324
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,200
Either I kill the three of you now...

325
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,290
...or...

326
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,960
...you complete this mission.

327
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,640
After you get it done, I'll let you go immediately.

328
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,080
I am a man of my words.

329
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,240
Give us some time to think about it.

330
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,800
Our aim is to save Pengfei.

331
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,640
It's not a good choice for us to be involved in their fight.

332
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,400
If an accident happens,...

333
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,840
...Jiang Ge wouldn't help us.

334
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,170
We would be dead by then.

335
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,100
Do we have a choice now?

336
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,000
Jiang Ge looks evil.

337
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,080
He's definitely a ruthless man.

338
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,930
If we don't agree to him, he'll kill us now.

339
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,440
There are people on duty at the base every night.

340
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,500
It's hard for us to get closer to Du Wa.

341
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,320
What do you think?

342
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:19,880
I have an idea.

343
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,280
Brother,why are there so many people on duty tonight?

344
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,740
Don't you know the reason?

345
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,720
Brother's enemy is here.

346
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,920
He's from the special forces.

347
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,320
You're well-informed.

348
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,640
Tell them to be careful.

349
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Pay attention.
