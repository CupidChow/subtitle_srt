00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,000
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 37

3
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,920
I don't have a good temper like you.

4
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,720
It's not about having a good temper.

5
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,600
What are your trying to hide?

6
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,760
You're using your bad temper to hide...

7
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,000
...something.

8
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,560
Who are you? Acting like you know me.

9
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,400
Me?

10
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,130
I'm your comrade in battle.

11
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,880
Comrade.

12
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,600
Of course, you're not only my comrade.

13
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,370
You're my brother,too.

14
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,640
Goodness.

15
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,760
I'm not drunk. Who's drunk? I'm not.

16
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,720
You can't hold your drink at all.

17
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,320
Quick,help me.

18
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,680
You should lose some weight.

19
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,560
Don't go.

20
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:45,880
What is it?

21
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,600
Don't be angry.

22
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:47,080
Hello,Miss Xiaojia. -Huang Fuyun!

23
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,240
Why didn't you pick up? -It was too noisy.

24
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,159
I didn't hear the call. -Were you drinking?

25
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,360
No.

26
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,000
Fine,I drank a little with Xiaorui.

27
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,920
You don't have to worry. I didn't do anything bad.

28
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,280
I even got you a gift.

29
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,440
What is it?

30
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,500
You'll know when you see it. I'm sure you'll love it.

31
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,960
Did you miss me?

32
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,280
Don't be shy. There's no one here.

33
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,840
A kiss for you.

34
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,890
The Xu family at Pingzhou Auction,...

35
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,730
...Kachin Hills at Phakant...

36
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,840
...and tomb No. 1 at Inner Mongolia.

37
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,280
Did you plan all that?

38
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,480
I've never doubted you. I trusted you.

39
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,020
Zhuang Rui,...

40
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,360
...can we go back to how it was?

41
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,120
I drank a lot last night. Did I say anything?

42
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,480
No. -Are you angry again?

43
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,040
In your eyes, do I only get angry?

44
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,400
In your eyes, do I only get angry?

45
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,000
Dear guests,thank you for visiting our museum again.

46
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,640
You have been upgraded to VIP guests.

47
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,480
You can purchase the exhibits at 20% off.

48
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,080
We were too busy yesterday...

49
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,200
...and didn't see the red diamond sceptre exhibition.

50
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,640
We came here just to see it.

51
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,760
Which exhibition hall is at?

52
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,120
The red diamond sceptre is not part of the exhibition.

53
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,600
We're sorry for that.

54
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,800
We saw the flyer and specifically came over here.

55
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,720
Why isn't it on display? Did something happen?

56
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,160
Last month,the museum made a report about a midnight break-in.

57
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,380
However,there was no follow-up.

58
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,880
Now the red diamond sceptre isn't on display,...

59
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,640
...was it stolen?

60
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,040
Yesterday was the museum's 100th anniversary...

61
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,000
...but someone made a scene.

62
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,160
Mr. Victor,do you have...

63
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,560
...any enemies that might sabotage you?

64
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,410
This is an internal affair. It's not for public disclosure.

65
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,600
Thank you for your concern.

66
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,080
If your enemy wants to sabotage you,...

67
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,960
...once they catch wind of the missing red diamond sceptre...

68
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,680
...and use this on you,...

69
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,800
...things won't look good for you.

70
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,330
Furthermore,the man who made a scene earlier...

71
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,720
...had a partner.

72
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,200
If you need any help on this,...

73
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,280
...we are willing to help you.

74
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,440
Please come with me.

75
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,080
Last month,there was a robbery in the museum.

76
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,320
The red diamond on the sceptre was stolen...

77
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,280
...so it couldn't be displayed.

78
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,440
The museum's treasure has been robbed.

79
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,000
If this news goes out,it'll affect the museum's good name.

80
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So I had to keep this from the public.

81
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,920
I thought that the red diamond...

82
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,280
...would be found within a month. I never expected...

83
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,680
...that until today,...

84
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,730
...I still have no clue.

85
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:04,640
Mr. Victor,we'll search and retrieve the red diamond...

86
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,080
...for you in secret.

87
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,800
However,we have one request.

88
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,340
All we ask is for you to tell us something.

89
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,560
Isn't this a good deal?

90
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,480
How can I be sure you'll find the red diamond?

91
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,480
We have our own ways.

92
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,320
If we fail,you'll just keep the robbery a secret.

93
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,400
Both parties will not suffer losses,however...

94
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:40,920
...I hope Mr. Victor will tell us about the missing red diamond.

95
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,800
If you can find the red diamond,...

96
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,880
...I promise to provide whatever help possible.

97
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,440
Good,it's a deal.

98
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,800
It's a deal.

99
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,080
Last month, everyone was busy with...

100
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,560
...the 100th anniversary preparation.

101
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,160
It's strange.

102
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,320
This anti-theft glass...

103
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,440
...has no cracks.

104
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,040
This lock...

105
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,880
...also shows no sign of forced entry.

106
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,200
Could it be that a key was used to open the door?

107
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,720
Perhaps it was stolen by one of your staff?

108
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,320
No.

109
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,440
I don't understand.

110
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,560
Why is there a tulip where the red diamond is supposed to be?

111
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,800
Does the tulip mean anything?

112
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,400
Tulip?

113
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,840
No.

114
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,480
It's just another flower in Kiev.

115
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,360
It's common. -Is it?

116
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,160
Do you have any enemies?

117
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,480
No.

118
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,520
Then it must be a jealous rival.

119
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:18,400
The man from yesterday must be linked to the robbers.

120
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,720
They even had a photographer to make a scene.

121
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,160
Perhaps they want evidence of you being embarrassed.

122
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,120
If we can get them out here,...

123
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,680
...perhaps we can find the culprit.

124
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,960
Mr. Victor! -Stop! Listen to me.

125
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,240
We came all the way here just to buy the red diamond!

126
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,480
Let me apologize again. I've told you,...

127
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,040
...the red diamond sceptre is the museum's treasure.

128
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,840
It's not for sale.

129
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,160
Fine,it's not for sale. Can we just see it?

130
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,960
Well.....

131
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,280
I think you don't even have the red diamond sceptre.

132
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,960
Your 100-year-old museum is a fake.

133
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,000
Listen,we came here on a private plane.

134
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,120
You're cheating the consumers, do you know that? I'll sue you.

135
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,160
I'll sue you! -My friend has a temper.

136
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,720
I'm from Changde,Hunan!

137
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,760
Stop! -Let's go.

138
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,400
Stop right there!

139
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,160
This is expensive!

140
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,600
Wait up!

141
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,000
Stop!

142
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,480
Stop!

143
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,540
You disrespected a treasure!

144
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,880
Stop!

145
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,280
Hand me the camera.

146
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,120
You're not fit to be rich!

147
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,800
You can run.

148
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,480
They were the ones after me.

149
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,520
What's this place? Is it the gangsters' den?

150
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,840
Are we going to die here?

151
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,560
Shut your mouth.

152
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,840
You're from China.

153
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,240
Well,Chinese and Ukrainian are friends,right?

154
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,680
If there's anything, let's talk it out.

155
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,480
Please don't disrupt the peace.

156
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,080
How do you know Victor? -Vic.....

157
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,480
What's your relationship with him?

158
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,600
Me? I'm his museum guest.

159
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,360
Since you're a guest, why did you go after my men?

160
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,760
It can't be that simple.

161
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,240
It's like this. Victor asked us...

162
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,400
...to look for the red diamond here.

163
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,840
One of your men was behaving suspiciously so we.....

164
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,320
Why did he send you here instead of coming here himself?

165
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,440
These Ukrainians are so direct.

166
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,370
Don't play games with me. My Mandarin's as good as Victor's.

167
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,840
Listen here. If you want the red diamond,...

168
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,800
...then...

169
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,610
...Victor will need to come here personally.

170
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,120
If Victor doesn't come, forget the red diamond,...

171
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,640
...all of you will lose your lives.

172
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,400
Take them away.

173
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,920
Let me go!

174
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,920
You're good.

175
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,160
Hurry up and untie me.

176
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,120
Are you all right?

177
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,840
Hurry and come here.

178
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:54,920
Are you uncomfortable? -No,I'm good.

179
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,600
Can't you just admit that you're not all right?

180
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,480
It's all my fault.

181
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,200
I didn't get him at the museum and brought us all here.

182
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,560
We're all here for the red diamond.

183
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,440
What's wrong?

184
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,240
It's nothing.

185
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,760
Did you notice anything.

186
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,280
What?

187
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,720
Since we came to Kiev,...

188
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,960
...you feel different.

189
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,100
You seem like yourself...

190
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,860
...but unlike yourself,too.

191
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,800
In Phakant,...

192
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,560
...I told you...

193
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,930
...that everyone has secrets.

194
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,560
I respect you...

195
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,120
...and I won't pry your secret from you.

196
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,920
Unless,...

197
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,120
...you trust me enough to share it with me.

198
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,320
Actually,...

199
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,360
...since the pawn shop robbery,...

200
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,680
...my eyes...

201
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,180
...obtained special powers.

202
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,240
However,...

203
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,440
...there were also side effects that follow.

204
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,800
It's not that I don't trust you.

205
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,760
I was afraid that you'd be worried for me...

206
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,760
...so I didn't tell you.

207
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,920
Is it life threatening?

208
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,920
For now,things are not looking well.

209
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,680
Even so,...

210
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,980
...I will live to the fullest.

211
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,840
Although things might not go the way I want,...

212
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,160
...but I will try my best to live a good life.

213
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,440
Spoken like a true man. I'll go through this with you.

214
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,560
I feel cold. It must be sadness.

215
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,850
I miss Miss Xiaojia at a time like this.

216
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,920
No,you.....

217
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,120
Why didn't you use your special power,...

218
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,810
...your all-seeing eye, to get us out of here?

219
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,800
Why are we just sitting here?

220
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,860
I do not have the all-seeing eyes.

221
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,640
I don't know what they are.

222
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,120
According to the Strange Tales of Liaozhai,...

223
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,880
...Feng Quan had the same symptoms.

224
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,800
It is also mentioned in The Life of Feng.

225
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:38,000
Like the constant moon and the rising sun,...

226
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,720
...like the forgotten river...

227
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,920
...and the Golden Eyes.

228
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,560
The Golden Eyes?

229
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,680
What you're saying is...

230
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,140
...that after the pawn shop robbery,...

231
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,840
...you obtained the Golden Eyes.

232
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,080
Boss Xu shot at the Tamamoku stone.

233
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,120
The broken shards pierced my eyes.

234
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,640
I went to the hospital for treatment.

235
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,960
When I woke up,I realized I obtained this power.

236
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,760
That makes sense. In Traditional Chinese Medicine,...

237
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,640
...Yinzhen is used to treat the eyes.

238
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,440
This means the external impact will affect optic nerves.

239
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,240
It seems like your vision has been impacted,...

240
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,040
...which gives you an odd vision, hence The Golden Eyes.

241
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,920
I couldn't understand then,...

242
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:41,440
...why Boss Xu wanted to get the Tamamoku stone.

243
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,400
Looking back,...

244
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,920
...it was all to do with your Golden Eyes.

245
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,780
When I was investigating Lu Mang,...

246
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,640
...I found an important clue.

247
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,040
His boss is a woman.

248
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,720
She has a scent of amber.

249
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,400
Amber is expensive so not many people use it.

250
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,600
However,...

251
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,280
...when I got close to Qin Xuanbing,...

252
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,340
...I realized she has the smell of amber.

253
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,360
Officer Miao. -Miss Qin.

254
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,360
Your perfume smells good. What brand is it?

255
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,960
I don't use perfume. Perhaps...

256
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,570
...the incense from home rubbed off on me.

257
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,920
She has the scent of amber.

258
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,500
From that onwards,...

259
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,980
...I started being suspicious of her...

260
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,800
...investigated her in secret.

261
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,480
In Phakant,she took away something valuable to you.

262
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,920
I can confirm that she's the boss behind Lu Mang.

263
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,880
However,I couldn't tell you without Officer Ding's permission.

264
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,640
I get it now.

265
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,300
She approached Xiaorui because of the Golden Eyes.

266
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,650
Looking at the current situation,...

267
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,680
...we can confirm that.

268
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:35,280
Qin family,Lu Mang and Boss Hu had a clear goal.

269
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,080
They want the Tamamoku jade and Zhuang Rui's Golden Eyes.

270
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,640
Their plan to rob the pawn shop...

271
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,520
...was foiled because of Zhuang Rui.

272
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,680
Now,another Tamamoku jade has appeared.

273
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:56,080
This time,they will not let this off easily.

274
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,760
I've rested enough. It's time to get work done.

275
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,980
Understood,miss.

276
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,960
Curator, you're not going home yet?

277
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,880
You may leave first. -Yes.

278
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,000
I wonder how Zhuang Rui and the rest are doing.

279
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:10,840
Do you think the missing red diamond...

280
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,480
...is planned by Victor and Nakayama?

281
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,240
Who knows,the woman earlier could be their partner.

282
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,960
If they want to capture us,...

283
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,360
...there is no need use the museum as bait.

284
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,280
Besides,when I asked him about the tulip yesterday,...

285
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,740
...the look in his eyes...

286
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,440
...was odd. He might...

287
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,760
...be hiding something from us.

288
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,160
Victor could've known where the red diamond is...

289
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,800
...but he's unwilling to come out.

290
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,320
When we suggested to help him, he must've felt happy.

291
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,960
If what you say is true,...

292
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,480
...then I was wrong about Victor being a good man.

293
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,560
He actually is an evil man.

294
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,800
He'd rather a 100th anniversary than displaying the treasure...

295
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,000
...or even come here.

296
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,960
What is his deal with the woman earlier?

297
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:15,920
No matter what,we need to find the red diamond.

298
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,880
Only then can we fulfil the deal.

299
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,960
The Tamamoku stone, Grandfather Gu...

300
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,710
...and the archaelogical team 40 years ago.

301
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:27,600
All these are connected to Nakagawa Ryosuke.

302
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,040
We need to find him.

303
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,960
Where could the red diamond be?

304
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:54,560
I remember, back at the hall,...

305
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,490
...there was a painting that was hung low.

306
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,650
There are different sets of fingerprints...

307
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,120
...on both sides of frame.

308
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,530
It must have been moved before.

309
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,800
I suspect...

310
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320
...there's a hidden wall behind it.

311
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,410
Also,when I mentioned Victor,...

312
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:23,560
...Yelena's gaze went towards the painting.

313
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,960
So I believe the painting has something to do with it.

314
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,440
Your eyes can even...

315
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,880
...see fingerprints on picture frames?

316
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,720
Didn't I say they are an all-seeing eyes?

317
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,720
I'd suggest you to be careful.

318
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,160
How dare you?

319
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,000
I've seen it all.

320
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,920
I mean,I've seen the entire hall.

321
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,840
Well,...

322
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,480
...Victor is clearly not going to save us.

323
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,930
Let's think of something else.

324
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,610
Let me see what you have photographed.

325
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,200
What is Victor's relationship with the woman?

326
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,600
They're husband and wife. -What?

327
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,720
Husband and wife?

328
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,800
Wait. -What for?

329
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,680
What is it? -I'm checking for alarms.

330
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,480
We have the all-seeing eyes. -No need. Just take it down.

331
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,810
There's nothing there.

332
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,730
All-seeing eyes, I'll hand it over to you.

333
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,480
The fingerprint marks...

334
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,600
...are on 0,...

335
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,800
...2,7,...

336
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,760
...6,9...

337
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:55,760
...and 8.

338
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,240
According to the fingerprint marks,...

339
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,240
...the combination should be.....

340
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,160
You opened my safe so soon.

341
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,280
I'm impressed.

342
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,320
However,I have a better CCTV system.

343
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,160
No matter what you do, I have my eyes on you.

344
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,520
No,what does a lover's spat...

345
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,880
...have to do with us,right?

346
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,360
Besides, isn't Victor your husband?

347
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,440
He's my ex-husband. -Right,cheating husband.

348
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,640
Ex-husband.

349
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,370
Besides,we're already divorced.

350
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,840
Since you're separated,...

351
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,160
...why do you need to steal his red diamond?

352
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,560
He owes me an apology.

353
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,160
Why does he owe you an apology?

354
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,680
He cheated on me. He betrayed me and our love.

355
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,880
Cheated? That's too much!

356
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,600
Since it's out in the open,...

357
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,520
...I'll tell you what happened.

358
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,240
You'll be the judge of it. -All right,go ahead.

359
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,560
Our 3rd wedding anniversary was coming up.

360
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,800
I planned a perfect trip to South America.

361
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,280
We were to visit the Iguazu Falls.

362
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,400
I told him one week ahead of our trip...

363
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,640
...but he said he won't be free.

364
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,480
Tell me,what does this mean?

365
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,160
He told me that we have waterfalls in Ukraine,too.

366
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,480
Why must we go South America? Do you think they're the same?

367
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,480
Of course they're not! -How are they different?

368
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,760
I became the bigger person by letting this go.

369
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,120
So I decided to celebrate our anniversary at home.

370
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,320
Our trip to South America can wait.

371
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,640
When the day arrived, I prepared a candlelight dinner.

372
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,840
However,when Victor returned home,...

373
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,040
...he didn't remember what day it was.

374
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,480
He might be too busy and have forgotten.

375
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,000
Yes,you should have reminded him.

376
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,560
I don't think so.
