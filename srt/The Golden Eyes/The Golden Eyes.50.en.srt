1
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,500
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 50

3
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,280
Listen. After we arrive at Wen Yu Forest,...

4
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,600
...kill them immediately.

5
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,720
They have gone to Wen Yu Forest.

6
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,880
I don't know how many people are there.

7
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Why? Do you want to fight?

8
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,560
After we handle the people in that car,are you willing to fight me?

9
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,240
Zhuang Rui,...

10
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,680
...I thought I'll never see you again.

11
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,240
I'm sorry.

12
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,640
Mr. Nakagawa told me about your problem.

13
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,640
You were threatened and cheated by Qin Haoran.

14
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,880
So,I will not blame you.

15
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,079
Luckily,you're still alive.

16
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,160
Have you seen the Qin family's upper line?

17
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,000
Sir.

18
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,120
I'm sorry.

19
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,720
It's all my fault for being soft-hearted.

20
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,480
I should kill her back then.

21
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,400
They saved Qin Xuanbing.

22
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,680
They will know that Old Lao is still alive.

23
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,720
They cannot be allowed to continue the investigation.

24
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,560
Yes.

25
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,960
Officer Miao, please give me a chance.

26
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,800
I can help the police to arrest Qin Haoran.

27
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,240
Once this ends, I will surrender myself.

28
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,400
This..... -This cannot be done.

29
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,360
The police have their rules. How can you not report when you know?

30
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,280
I have to report to my superiors.

31
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,240
My colleagues will bring you away in a while.

32
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,160
In regards to the future,...

33
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,400
...I will ask for your leniency. Don't worry.

34
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,360
Thank you. -Qin Haoran's boss is Old Ma.

35
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,320
Yes.

36
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,040
I only saw his back.

37
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,560
However,judging from that,...

38
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,040
...he should be around 50 to 60 years old.

39
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,880
He is not that tall.

40
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,240
This happened 25 years ago.

41
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,040
At that time,I have not founded Xi Huang Jewellery.

42
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,040
In order to find a partner, I often returned to the country.

43
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,440
That's right.

44
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,880
I've never said that the picture was from 25 years ago.

45
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,920
How did he know?

46
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,600
Old Ma must be Ma Tengfeng.

47
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,520
They have always...

48
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,360
...been partners.

49
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,800
This is bad. I must report to Chief Ding immediately.

50
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,640
Xiaorui,why are you standing there? Hurry and follow her!

51
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,120
This a dark and windy night. It's not safe for Feifei to be alone.

52
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,320
Weak woman? Her?

53
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,360
Feifei,I'll send you.

54
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,640
Hello,Zhao. We're cheated. Ma Tengfeng didn't die.

55
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,880
He's Qin Haoran's boss.

56
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,800
Qin Haoran wants to kill Qin Xuanbing.

57
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,800
We must hurry and report to Chief Ding...

58
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,880
...and make Qin Xuanbing the witness to assist investigation.

59
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,760
At the same time, you find out about Ma Tengfeng.

60
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,600
Dying in the accident is just his trick.

61
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,680
Feifei!

62
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,680
I'll send you. -It's okay. I can go by myself.

63
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,440
Watch out!

64
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,640
Feifei!

65
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,960
Feifei!

66
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,080
They actually sneak attack.

67
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,320
It seems that we are right to investigate this.

68
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,669
Mr. Zhuang is with Miss Miao in the hospital. She's safe now.

69
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:39,200
The driver was drunk and surrendered to the police.

70
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,030
However..... -What is it?

71
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,960
The driver used to work at Xi Huang Jewellery as a guard.

72
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,200
Miss Miao met with accident when she went to find Qin Haoran.

73
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,440
This must be related to Qin Haoran.

74
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,920
Let's go. We will go to the hospital now.

75
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,280
Xiaorui,don't be too worried.

76
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,240
Feifei is in temporary coma because of concussion.

77
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,680
She will wake up once she gets better.

78
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,720
Besides,she has police protection now.

79
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,200
No matter how bad Qin Haoran is,he won't dare to hurt her.

80
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,080
Qin Haoran did this...

81
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,960
...because Officer Miao has found out about Old Ma.

82
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,800
When Officer Miao is injured,he can stop the police investigation.

83
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,800
For him to be this worried about Officer Miao's investigation,...

84
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,720
...it means this clue poses danger to him.

85
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,640
Maybe we will be able to arrest all of them if we find Old Ma.

86
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,400
Even if we want to investigate, it's not to be done immediately.

87
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,480
I don't know about Old Ma.

88
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,040
I think it's very important for Qin Haoran...

89
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,200
...to hide Old Ma.

90
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
How is it important? What is more important than the jade?

91
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,920
Zhuang Rui, what are you trying to say?

92
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,800
Feifei is injured. Grandfather Gu is dead.

93
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,160
In the end, it's because of Ma Tengfeng.

94
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,640
Since I cannot win over Qin Haoran,...

95
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,960
...I might as well give him the jade...

96
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,240
...to exchange a life. Ma Tengfeng's life.

97
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,960
Are you kidding?

98
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,560
When Qin Haoran has the jade,...

99
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,600
...if he has the Golden Eyes, the outcome will be bad.

100
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,920
So what? -Calm down.

101
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,800
Ma Tengfeng killed my grandfather. He almost killed your father!

102
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,240
Don't you want to avenge them?

103
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,160
It's enough. This is the ward. If you want to fight,go outside.

104
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,320
I can understand your feelings as he killed your grandfather.

105
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,520
However,it's risky and could lead to bad consequences.

106
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,000
If you must take this risk,...

107
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,880
...I'm sorry that I cannot accompany you.

108
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,440
Wait! Please wait.

109
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,000
Mr. Nakagawa, Xiaorui doesn't mean it.

110
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,560
He's too impulsive.

111
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,840
Then,we'll talk once he's no longer impulsive.

112
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,960
What are you doing?

113
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,040
An eye for an eye. Is it wrong?

114
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,640
Zhuang Rui,...

115
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,480
...you're not the only one who lost your loved ones.

116
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,640
Mr. Nakagawa is right.

117
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,240
I think you should calm down right now...

118
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,920
...and think about what you want to do.

119
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,520
Do you think I'm not being calm?

120
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,760
Do you think I'm not calm enough?

121
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,000
Actually, I think you are quite calm.

122
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,760
Old Ma was your grandfather's murderer.

123
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,080
Now,Qin Haoran hurt Feifei.

124
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,880
Both of them are still not arrested.

125
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,040
If I were you,I would be mad.

126
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,520
I'm your brother. No matter what you decide,...

127
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,800
...I will support you.

128
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,320
I think that Zhuang Rui will not give up easily.

129
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,040
Call Victor immediately and send someone to take the jade back.

130
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,600
-Send to Japan?

131
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,680
No.

132
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,640
The jade is safest with me.

133
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,120
Let Aoyama send the jade to Beijing.

134
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,040
If anything happens, no one can bear the consequences.

135
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,040
Okay. I'll go now.

136
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,440
Are you okay? -Yes, I'm fine but...

137
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,400
...Zhuang Rui's emotion is unstable right now.

138
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,280
I'm worried he will do stupid things.

139
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,400
Zhuang Rui will think first.

140
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,560
I'll send you back.

141
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,960
Aoyama!

142
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,120
I'm sorry. -What happened?

143
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,080
The thing was stolen. -Do you know who did it?

144
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,640
I'm not certain.

145
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,680
However,I'm familiar with the techniques.

146
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,560
It seems to be...

147
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,960
...Peng Fei. -Peng Fei?

148
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,400
What happened? -I'm sorry. It's my fault.

149
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,040
Never mind. It's useless to say this now.

150
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,560
I never thought that Zhuang Rui will do this.

151
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,200
I'm very disappointed.

152
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,640
Since they have the jade,...

153
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,400
..they are likely to have contacted Qin Haoran.

154
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,920
We can only observe Qin Haoran.

155
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,880
We must stop Zhuang Rui from meeting with Qin Haoran...

156
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,560
...and find ways to stop them and take the jade back.

157
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,240
Sir, a call from Nakagawa Ryosuke.

158
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,760
Qin Haoran. -Mr. Qin,I'll be straightforward.

159
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,600
I want to make a trade with you.

160
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,360
Do you mean the jade?

161
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,640
This is interesting. It's a valuable item.

162
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,960
Everyone wants to give me the jade today...

163
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,560
...and each says they have it. Tell me,...

164
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,280
...who should I trust?

165
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,160
Boss Qin,...

166
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,800
...haven't you have chosen?

167
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,440
Not bad,you have improved.

168
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,520
Then,I'll be straight with you.

169
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,760
I can make the trade but if I don't see the item,...

170
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,840
...I will not promise you.

171
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,720
Tomorrow at Siheyuan.

172
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,160
No.

173
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,280
Tomorrow afternoon...

174
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,080
...at Chijiang Mansion Peony Hall.

175
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,280
Okay.

176
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,400
What have you found out?

177
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,720
Sir, after some investigation,...

178
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,280
...Mr. Nakagawa did send an item from Kiev to Beijing.

179
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,800
However,Zhuang Rui and others have stolen it in Beijing.

180
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,440
It was huge and Mr. Nakagawa's followers were injured.

181
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,800
It seems that...

182
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,720
...the item is with Zhuang Rui.

183
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,680
Nakagawa Ryosuke is influential in Japan.

184
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,200
But he cannot win over Zhuang Rui in Huang City.

185
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,520
However,...

186
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,520
...what does Zhuang Rui actually want?

187
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,160
Zhuang Rui values the jade. He stole it...

188
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,520
...and wanted to give us.

189
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,920
The only possibility is he wants us to give him Boss Ma.

190
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,520
Then,do you think...

191
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,600
...I should promise him or not?

192
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,360
Sir,this is not easy.

193
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,040
Boss Ma knows a lot about Xi Huang Jewellery's...

194
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,880
...secrets.

195
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,200
Besides,...

196
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,400
...he is considered to be your saviour.

197
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,720
Saviour?

198
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,080
When we were doing business,...

199
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,040
...he was behind the scene and was not involved.

200
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,480
Meanwhile,I...

201
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,040
...was the one at the frontline...

202
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,040
...and was responsible for many things.

203
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,440
But now,things has changed.

204
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,880
There are no such things...

205
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,920
...anymore. -Yes.

206
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,520
However,...

207
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,640
...if we can have the jade...

208
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,640
...and protect Old Ma,...

209
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,320
...it will be better.

210
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,240
Welcome.

211
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,520
They have entered.

212
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,480
Greetings,sir. Have you make a booking?

213
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,120
Mr. Qin booked the Peony Hall.

214
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,400
Bring both of them to Peony Hall.

215
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,320
Please follow me.

216
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,760
This way please.

217
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,160
You're here.

218
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,720
Sit.

219
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,720
Everything is great in Chijiang Mansion...

220
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,520
...except for the tea.

221
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,360
Beijing residents don't care about tea.

222
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,920
Drinking tea requires the tea leaves to be washed first.

223
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,640
Next,the water must be poured like Guan Yu patrolling the city.

224
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,160
I have a tea set. When you are free,...

225
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,520
...please come to my place for a drink.

226
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,320
There's such a thing.

227
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,120
Like tea leaves,stir-frying them,the tea merchants,...

228
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,120
...there are many research. Those involved with jade...

229
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,320
...are passionate about tea drinking.

230
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,120
Have you brought the item?

231
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,520
Director Qin, you're busy every day.

232
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,400
If you drink too much tea,...

233
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,760
...you cannot sleep well at night.

234
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,480
Let's be straightforward.

235
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,720
Fei,Director Qin and I.....

236
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,680
I'll go to the washroom.

237
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,240
Show it to me.

238
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,880
Take the thing here.

239
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,160
Are you afraid to let me see?

240
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,520
Is it not the item?

241
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,600
It's not.

242
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,880
I just don't understand.

243
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,960
Are you sincere,Mr. Qin?

244
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,160
What do you want?

245
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,000
Ma Tengfeng killed my grandfather.

246
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,000
I want him to pay back with his life.

247
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,800
You want Ma Tengfeng's life.

248
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,960
Do you know his relationship with me?

249
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,800
I only know that...

250
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,560
...you want this.

251
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,440
Are you sure that Qin Haoran's weakness is here?

252
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,160
The hacking technology prevails now.

253
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,560
In order to prevent his company's secrets from being stolen,...

254
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,520
...he saved them in a computer not connected to Internet.

255
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,160
For it to be brought here, he saved them in a pen drive.

256
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,440
I believe that it's inside.

257
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,360
Let's get moving then.

258
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,880
I'm so tired.

259
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,000
Some noodles for you. I'll go to the washroom.

260
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,000
Hurry back.

261
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,600
Don't worry. I have already hacked into the network here...

262
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,400
...and covered the monitor screen. A video will be shown repeatedly.

263
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,120
The guards change every 2 hours.

264
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,520
Once they change, the cover will be found out.

265
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,440
How long do we have?

266
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,280
Around an hour.

267
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,880
It's enough.

268
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,760
According to Qin Haoran's height, if there's a mechanism here,...

269
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,360
...the position should be from here...

270
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,880
...to here.

271
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,800
Could it be...

272
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,840
...where he will often touch?

273
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,400
No.

274
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,400
It should be somewhere the janitor will not touch.

275
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,640
For example,...

276
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,000
...this table.

277
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,520
It should also not be touched by the guests.

278
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,560
For example,this coffee table.

279
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,280
It should not be an art piece,...

280
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,000
...a book or a trophy.

281
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,680
Then,where will it be?

282
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,520
It should be somewhere everyone can see but will not notice.

283
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,160
There's a lock in the corridor but I don't know what it's for.

284
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,680
Let's go and look.

285
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,160
It's here. -Do you know the password?

286
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,600
I will try.

287
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,840
This is the last chance. It's not urgent.

288
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,880
Why don't we leave first?

289
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,040
Let me try for the last time.

290
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,160
Lied to you?

291
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,880
I lied to you because I wanted to treat you like my own daughter.

292
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,360
I never thought that...

293
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,640
...it's my birth date.

294
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,440
Let's go.

295
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,520
Miss Qin, we don't have enough time.

296
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,120
Why don't we..... -It must be here.

297
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,880
They hid it well. We're unlikely to find it in a short while.

298
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,080
If we cannot find it, our plan has failed.

299
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,960
Zhuang Rui is helping us to hold them off.

300
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,560
So,we must find it.

301
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,240
Mr. Qin.

302
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,600
Ma Tengfeng for the jade.

303
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,560
Isn't it a good deal?

304
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,520
In Beijing,...

305
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,800
...I have installed CCTV in all my rooms.

306
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,600
I can see...

307
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,480
...anyone once they enter...

308
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,840
...my secret room.

309
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,920
It's too much of a coincidence. You come here to discuss...

310
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,280
...while...

311
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,960
...Qin Xuanbing enters my secret room.

312
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,840
Xiaozhuang,...

313
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,360
...I sincerely want to deal with you.

314
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,440
However,you stab me in the back.

315
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,920
Am I right?

316
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,160
Besides,...

317
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,840
...the woman with Qin Xuanbing...

318
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,280
...seems to work under Nakagawa.

319
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,080
What is it?

320
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,960
You've just quarrelled but made peace immediately.

321
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,630
There are three safes which you use in Beijing.

322
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,440
Last night,...

323
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,670
...all the safes were opened.

324
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:36,150
If I'm not mistaken, the item must be in one of them.

325
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,230
However,you have made a mistake.

326
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,360
If you have brought the real jade,perhaps...

327
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:48,080
...I will still worry.

328
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,520
Do what you should do. -Okay.

329
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,120
Wait for me to return.

330
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,280
Feifei!

331
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,280
You have woken up.

332
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,800
How are you feeling?

333
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,360
Where is Zhuang Rui?

334
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,240
You ask about Zhuang Rui when you wake up.

335
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,360
He and Nakagawa Ryosuke argued and he went somewhere.

336
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,560
He argued with Nakagawa Ryosuke? How is it possible?

337
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,120
Did he go and find Qin Haoran?

338
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,240
Don't worry. They have planned well. They will be fine.

339
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,400
He goes to find Qin Haoran. How can I stay calm?

340
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,720
Hello,Zhao. Help me to find out Qin Haoran's phone location.

341
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,520
I'll go now. Bring others there.

342
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,800
Where are you going? You're still a patient.

343
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,120
Feifei!

344
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,440
You run very fast...

345
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,880
...but you have the item.

346
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,880
Thank you for telling us.

347
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,720
So,it's here.

348
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,520
You're really the daughter that I taught.

349
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,280
Follow me. Let's go.

350
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,400
Stop it!

351
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,720
Xuanbing, since I can raise you,...

352
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,760
...I can also kill you.

353
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,000
The pen drive.

354
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,920
Let them go.

355
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,120
Yes.

356
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,000
Go! Leave!

357
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,120
Move!

358
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,440
Don't move!

359
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,280
You have improved.

360
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,960
You taught me well.

361
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,000
The pen drive.

362
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,320
Qin Haoran,follow me.

363
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,360
Put your knives down! Don't move!

364
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:20,720
Put your knives down.

365
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,760
Fine,I'll go with you.
