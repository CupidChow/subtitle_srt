1
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,000
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,500
Episode 26

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,860
Quickly eat it.

4
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,640
If you can excrete it within half an hour,you'll be saved.

5
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,320
Otherwise,if you have anything to tell Liu Jia...

6
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,250
...I'll convey the message to her.

7
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:48,770
Eat it quick.

8
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,760
Will I really die? I don't want to die.

9
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,380
Come,lift your leg up.

10
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,640
Lift your leg up. Yes.

11
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,640
Move.

12
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:52,079
What's wrong? Are you tired?

13
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,760
Let's take a break, I'm a little tired.

14
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,560
Okay.

15
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,480
I need to relieve myself.

16
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,960
I'll go there to do it.

17
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,010
You can't see now, don't go around.

18
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,920
Just stay there. I'll wait for you there.

19
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,480
Call me when you've done.

20
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,130
I didn't expect that...

21
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,280
...a handsome and romantic, witty and smart person like me...

22
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,560
...is going to die in a foreign country.

23
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,160
Miss Xiaojia!

24
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,360
Xiaofei,if you can go back to Beijing alive,...

25
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,800
...you must tell Miss Xiaojia that I love her.

26
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,480
I especially love her.

27
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:42,280
My card's PIN is 940329.

28
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,780
The money inside is for her and my mother.

29
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,930
You and Xiaorui can have...

30
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,080
...the hard drives I collected.

31
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,200
Keep it for yourself.

32
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,170
It's coming out now!

33
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,680
Zhuang Rui!

34
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,640
Zhuang Rui! Are you done?

35
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,080
Zhuang Rui!

36
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,480
Are you having diarrhoea?

37
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,760
Zhuang Rui!

38
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,880
Zhuang Rui!

39
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,720
Well,let's go our own ways since you don't believe me.

40
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,520
I'm saved,Xiaofei! I'm saved.

41
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,490
That's good.

42
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,760
I.....

43
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,280
No,it's coming again.

44
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,900
I'm exhausted.

45
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,610
It's killing me.

46
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,410
It's killing me.

47
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,580
I won't die,right?

48
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,840
You have the cheek to say you're a medical student.

49
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,920
Didn't your school teach you?

50
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,380
You can't eat indiscriminately.

51
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,320
I.....

52
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,560
What's wrong?

53
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,960
Drink some water. You'll get dehydrated easily.

54
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,360
Xiaofei,I should have listened to you.

55
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,440
I shouldn't eat indiscriminately.

56
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,960
So you should listen to me next time.

57
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,860
How is your condition?

58
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,560
I'm exhausted, I can't move any more.

59
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,240
Go and find Feifei and Xiaorui.

60
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,760
I'll carry you,get on!

61
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,800
No,I can't do it. I can't walk any more.

62
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,080
Get on.

63
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,440
Get on.

64
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,880
No,I'm too heavy.

65
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,600
When we trained in the field, we carried 50 kg of gear.

66
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:31,960
Get on.

67
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,960
Are you ready?

68
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,880
Xiaofei,can you forget the PIN?

69
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,930
Last time,it was your treasury; this time,your PIN.

70
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,450
I don't know what you'll say next time.

71
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,600
As rich people,...

72
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,000
...it's normal that we have VIP privileges at several banks.

73
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,040
Are you thinking about your boyfriend?

74
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,560
No.

75
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,880
Why should I think about him?

76
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,320
Will Miss Xiaojia miss me?

77
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,680
We'll be in the money.

78
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,800
Is he the person called Zhuang Rui?

79
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,600
Yes. I've been watching them the whole afternoon.

80
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,370
Will they go back on their word?

81
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,320
No way. Hu Rong is the most trustworthy person in Phakant.

82
00:14:59,400 --> 00:14:59,860
Enough!

83
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:46,960
Feifei?

84
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,000
Zhuang Rui,you can see now?

85
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,620
We have to leave here soon.

86
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,020
These people will send a message to them.

87
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:57,840
Let's go.

88
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,120
Which way? -Over there! Get them!

89
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,920
Hurry up! -Go!

90
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,960
Wait for me here.

91
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,970
I think I should be with you.

92
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,120
Hide yourself well. I'll distract them.

93
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,720
Run while it's in a mess. -No!

94
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,640
It's too dangerous here. We can't do this.

95
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,040
Then,we'll die together. They are looking for you,not me.

96
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,360
No! Hu Rong and Dama are cruel and merciless.

97
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,760
They will take you as hostage. No,...

98
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,040
...you can't just go. -Over there,get them!

99
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,000
Let's go!

100
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,560
This way,go!

101
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,440
Slow down.

102
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,109
Wait for me.

103
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,920
Pengfei,it's me.

104
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,240
Miss Qin?

105
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,120
The situation is urgent, I'll cut the long story short.

106
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,480
All villagers in Phakant area received the message that...

107
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,520
...Hu Rong offers a large amount reward for catching Zhuang Rui.

108
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,160
You know that I can't show up openly...

109
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,120
...due to my father's relationship with Hu Rong.

110
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,760
My men will distract Dama.

111
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,850
Keep these things for yourselves.

112
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,480
After you've found Zhuang Rui, take him out of here.

113
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,010
Miss Qin,I thank you, on Zhuang Rui's behalf.

114
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,730
Xiaoyun.

115
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,820
It was a misunderstanding. Thank you,Miss Qin.

116
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,690
Let's go.

117
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,040
Hurry up!

118
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,240
Hurry up!

119
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,560
Hurry up!

120
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,520
Hurry up!

121
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,380
Be careful!

122
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,280
This way.

123
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,170
Hurry up!

124
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,040
Miss,they're not at the front.

125
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,100
I saw them running in this direction.

126
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:05,810
That way!

127
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,240
This way.

128
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,200
Are they catching up with us?

129
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,440
Xiaorui! Are you okay?

130
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,460
I thought you were caught.

131
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,520
You.....

132
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,400
That's great! -Are you okay?

133
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,080
I feel so much better now. There's always a way out.

134
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,820
Let's have a good meal!

135
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,360
Okay?

136
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,800
I'm so happy, let's have a good meal.

137
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,000
Aren't you hungry?

138
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,700
Be careful!

139
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,200
I'm exhausted.

140
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,960
I'm different from you.

141
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,240
You're either marathon runners or triathlon participants.

142
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,000
Rich people like us don't run like this,it's exhausting.

143
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,520
Get up! It's not far. Can't you walk?

144
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,520
No,I.....

145
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,400
I'm not as gifted as you are.

146
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,480
You neither eat nor drink, you won't get tired or sleepy.

147
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,760
I'm just an ordinary rich man. I'm not moving any more.

148
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,320
Ordinary rich man,get up!

149
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,720
Hurry up! -No.

150
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,320
Get up!

151
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,800
I can't do it.

152
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,120
Feifei,that's okay. We've walked more than 10 km.

153
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,320
I don't think Dama can catch up with us. Everyone is tired.

154
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,650
Let's take a break here.

155
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,020
Still,Xiaofei, you're the kindest person.

156
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,440
Feifei,I didn't want to complain about you.

157
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,320
You're violent.

158
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,800
You're like a ball-breaker.

159
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,160
Aren't you afraid that no one wants you?

160
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,560
Regarding the treasury, Liu Jia and I will.....

161
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,960
Master Fei!

162
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,040
Be the bigger person,don't make a fuss with a nobody like me!

163
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,080
Thank you.

164
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,800
Have a seat.

165
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,840
You're despicable.

166
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,160
Pengfei.

167
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,520
Where did you get the backpack and the clothes?

168
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,480
I didn't see them with you when we parted.

169
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,940
They were given by Qin Xuanbing. -Xuanbing?

170
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,120
Qin Xuanbing?

171
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,480
When did she come?

172
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,400
It was yesterday. We were looking for you.

173
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,460
She suddenly appeared with two men and gave me the gear.

174
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,740
She said we certainly need it.

175
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,520
After that?

176
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,400
After that,we parted.

177
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,920
Her two men distracted Dama.

178
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,520
Xiaoyun and I looked for you with the supplies.

179
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,520
You're very interested in Qin Xuanbing.

180
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,410
Why should I care about her?

181
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,640
Why is there a gun? You didn't tell me.

182
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,450
This is a stun gun, it's for self-protection.

183
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,780
There's nothing else?

184
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,210
It's enough. It should be enough for us on our way.

185
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,680
I feel that something is missing.

186
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,160
In this jungle,it's not easy for us to find each other.

187
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,560
How did Qin Xuanbing find you?

188
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,000
Maybe she saw our bonfire.

189
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,600
Here you are,one for each.

190
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:28,680
Thank you.

191
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,320
You can't take it. -This isn't a real gun.

192
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,880
You created trouble even without a gun.

193
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,680
If you have one,you may create trouble again.

194
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,360
You can't even have a toy gun.

195
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,320
All of you have one except me. It's embarrassing.

196
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,210
If we care about that, we'll be in trouble.

197
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,840
Well,bully me as you wish.

198
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,280
You're happy when I can't even protect myself...

199
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,010
...when I'm caught by Dama.

200
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,160
Without my permission,you can't point at others with it.

201
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,760
All right.

202
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,000
Miss. -Sister Dama.

203
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,290
Didn't Zhuang Rui and the rest go out with you?

204
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,040
Yes,they have something on and will be back soon.

205
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,100
Then,he..... -Miss,I'll let you be.

206
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,160
I'm going to see Director Hu.

207
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,520
I'm sorry,Zhuang Rui and the rest escaped.

208
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,330
I didn't do my work well.

209
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,280
Please punish me. -Punish?

210
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,640
What good does it do?

211
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,170
You can't even deal with a young thing.

212
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,840
Why should I still keep you?

213
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,370
One of them was released from special forces.

214
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,450
Continue looking for them.

215
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,360
Their only hope now is to cross the border from Myitkyina.

216
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,160
Go to the Kachin Hills and ambush at the road to Myitkyina.

217
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,120
Once you see them, just kill them.

218
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:27,760
Yes.

219
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:31,600
Miss.

220
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:43,960
Mother.

221
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,690
You want to kill Zhuang Rui?

222
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,080
Wenwen,go back to your room.

223
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,680
Tell me, do you want to kill Zhuang Rui?

224
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,210
This is adult business. You don't have to interfere.

225
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,760
Adults business?

226
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,880
Are you returning their kindness with ingratitude?

227
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,280
When I was kidnapped,...

228
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,440
...Feifei and Zhuang Rui risked their lives and saved me.

229
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,840
You're killing those who saved me,Mother.

230
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,810
Didn't you teach me that...

231
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,500
...we must return kindness with gratitude?

232
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,010
Have you forgotten?

233
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,800
Stop it,mother. It's not too late to stop.

234
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,960
I can ask Zhuang Rui and the rest to forgive you.

235
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,440
Drop it!

236
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,480
I have my reasons. You don't have to say anything more.

237
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,640
What is the reason?

238
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,850
Are you forced to do so for Hu family's sustenance again?

239
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,120
Wenwen.

240
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,460
Do you think you're grown up and capable enough?

241
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,240
How dare you talk to me like this?

242
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,600
My mother is righteous, she isn't a villain like you!

243
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,200
Miss!

244
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,320
Thank you for yesterday.

245
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,240
Don't mention it.

246
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,120
Are your eyes fully recovered?

247
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,200
Yes,I can almost see everything.

248
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,680
Please don't tell Xiaofei and Xiaoyun.

249
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,200
I'm afraid they will be worried. -Don't worry,I won't say it.

250
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,520
Actually,when you said we should go northwards yesterday,...

251
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,200
...I could see a little.

252
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,120
Why didn't you tell me?

253
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,480
When you told me to go northwards, we were going southwards.

254
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,040
The south is Phakant, Hu Rong's nest.

255
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,720
We came from there.

256
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,360
In fact, when I picked the fruit,...

257
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,560
...I saw two villagers holding an arrest warrant for you.

258
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,770
I know that you still don't believe me.

259
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,370
However,I'm really not Hu Rong's man.

260
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,040
I can't tell you.

261
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,520
I'm sorry.

262
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,760
Feifei,how did you aggrieve Rui?

263
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,400
I aggrieved him?

264
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,760
I saw it myself.

265
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,280
I just heard that you apologised to him.

266
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,240
You got it wrong. -No way,my hearing is good.

267
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,720
We should put the firewood here,right?

268
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,140
You confessed to Xiaorui and were rejected?

269
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,800
Why do you have so much time?

270
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,040
Along the way,I found that something is fishy.

271
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,560
Otherwise, it wouldn't be so awkward.

272
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,090
Don't hide it from me,okay?

273
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,760
We have a good relationship, we're good friends,right?

274
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,420
Tell me,I'll analyse for you.

275
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,920
Who has a good relationship with you? Who is your good friend?

276
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,880
I just want to analyse it for you.

277
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Fine.

278
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,920
Don't you want the firewood?

279
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,560
After a short break, we need to start our journey.

280
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,280
Hu Rong and Dama won't stop before they catch us.

281
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,400
We're free from their threat only when we go to Myitkyina...

282
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,640
...and go back to China from there quickly.

283
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,240
I need to tell you something. -What is it?

284
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,320
Nothing.

285
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,200
I need to relieve myself. Just carry on.

286
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,760
Pengfei,let me show you something.

287
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,040
This is a Japanese army's map. -Yes.

288
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,720
This is the Kachin Hills.

289
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,080
The Kachin Hills?

290
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,040
How do you know it?

291
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,370
Look.

292
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,640
Our current location is here.

293
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,160
This Japanese army's map is more than 70 years old.

294
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,080
Xiaorui, how did you get this map?

295
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,920
When I went to the night market with Xuanbing that day,...

296
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,450
...I bought a wood carving.

297
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,080
It was kept inside the wood carving.

298
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,080
As for why this map was kept in the wood carving,...

299
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,340
...I still can't figure it out until now.

300
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,080
It's likely that...

301
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,700
...this is a treasure map.

302
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,760
I believe this sign definitely represents the treasure.

303
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,090
During WW II,...

304
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,760
...Japanese troops were in Southeast Asia for years.

305
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,890
They expropriated a lot of treasures. What do you think?

306
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,480
The evacuation after the war was in haste,...

307
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,480
...they might not have brought them all back to Japan.

308
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,600
We're awesome!

309
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,560
We got it!

310
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:27,360
Can't you both be excited?

311
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,880
When we dig it out, let's divide it.

312
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,320
However,I don't recommend hunting for the treasure.

313
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,680
What? Why?

314
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,380
If this map is true,...

315
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,240
...the treasure is in the virgin forest of the Arakan Mountains.

316
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:48,040
In the virgin forest,not only the tigers and pythons,...

317
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,160
...even the mosquitoes and leeches are lethal.

318
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,160
Also,we're now under Hu Rong and Dama's threat,...

319
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,620
...we shouldn't stay in Myanmar any longer.

320
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,600
Xiaorui!

321
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,370
We're going there. -Xiaorui,why do you.....

322
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:11,440
Hu Rong can think of what you thought.

323
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,710
If we return to China through Myitkyina,...

324
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,239
...she's also certain that it's the only way.

325
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,199
She will definitely send a lot of men there.

326
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,360
If we go there, it'll be a suicide mission.

327
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,440
We can't put ourselves in her hands.

328
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,080
The virgin forest's environment is sinister.

329
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,800
The three of us have no field skills.

330
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,960
So you have to take care of us,...

331
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,530
...you'll be under great responsibility and pressure.

332
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,770
So whether you want to go or not,...

333
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,880
...it's up to you.

334
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,380
I'll go.

335
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,880
I do have a request.

336
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,680
From now on until we're out of the forest,you must listen to me.

337
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,170
You can't act on your own, especially you.

338
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,800
From now on,...

339
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,560
...I'll fully obey you.

340
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,000
I'll completely obey your command!

341
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,280
Are we heading West now?

342
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,640
Shouldn't we go eastwards to the China-Myanmar border?

343
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,400
Why are we going westwards to the Myanmar-India border?

344
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,760
Didn't Xiaorui tell you? He..... -I'm afraid that Dama...

345
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,800
...will ambush on the road, so I chose a detour.

346
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,440
Do you also think there's something wrong between them?

347
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,160
What is wrong? -I don't know either.

348
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,900
I just feel that something happened.

349
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,420
They suddenly become estranged.

350
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,400
No,I'm too curious. I have to ask.

351
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,400
Wait.

352
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,050
I seem to be stepping on something.

353
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,820
Don't move.

354
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,800
Is it a mine?

355
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,120
A mine? How can there be mine here?

356
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:11,980
Don't move.

357
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,560
This is a Japanese release firing device.

358
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,320
It's very old.

359
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,640
It's very dangerous The pin is very unstable.

360
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,260
It'll explode at any time.

361
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,320
I've studied demining...

362
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,140
...but I never done it before.

363
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,320
I believe in you,just try it.

364
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,560
Be careful,don't move.

365
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,170
Can you do it?

366
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,600
Feifei.

367
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,440
Get a heavy object. Xiaorui,on my count.

368
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,930
Lift your leg up when I count to one.

369
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,240
Then,Feifei,put the heavy object on it. Got it?

370
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,600
Got it. -Find a heavy object now.

371
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,680
Don't move.

372
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:47,780
Feifei!

373
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,880
What are you doing? This is a mine!

374
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,520
Don't move,back off!

375
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,280
Come.

376
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,860
I'm sorry,Zhuang Rui.

377
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,130
I promised you to...

378
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,900
...take you back to China safely.

379
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,240
Maybe I have to go back on my word.

380
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,000
Pengfei.

381
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,640
Please take care of Zhuang Rui and Xiaoyun.

382
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,460
Take them away now. -Xiaorui,rest assured.

383
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,880
I'll find a way. Go now!

384
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,200
Xiaorui,go now.

385
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,320
We came here together. Let's leave together.

386
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,580
Zhuang Rui,I'm sorry.

387
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,400
I hid something from you.

388
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,810
I lied to you.

389
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,680
I can't tell you the truth...

390
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,090
...but please believe that...

391
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,120
...no matter what,...

392
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,640
...I'll never betray you...

393
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,120
...or hurt you.

394
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,700
Make your move now.

395
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,370
Xiaorui.

396
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,200
Pengfei,hurry up.

397
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,640
Go! I ask you to leave!

398
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,370
Hurry up! -We must leave together!

399
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,680
Let's find a way to settle this!

400
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,080
Find a heavy object. I'll try to demine it.

401
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,440
Hurry up. -Okay.

402
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,240
Feifei,rest assured. We'll save you.
