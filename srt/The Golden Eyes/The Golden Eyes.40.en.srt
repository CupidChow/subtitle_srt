1
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,000
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 40

3
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,940
She's adopted?

4
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,920
Perhaps she is one of Qin Haoran's pawn.

5
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I understand now.

6
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,759
He made Qin Xuanbing do many bad things...

7
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:02,560
...and eyed the Tamamoku stone, he must know the Golden Eyes.

8
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,560
Tell me,...

9
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,889
...could he be your grandfather's murderer?

10
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,640
I used to think that way.

11
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,010
However,the timeline doesn't match.

12
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,600
Qin Haoran was just a boy then.

13
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,890
He couldn't have...

14
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,130
...committed a murder.

15
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,880
However,how did he know about the Golden Eyes?

16
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,880
I thought long and hard about this.

17
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,079
I believe Gansu will have the answers.

18
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,800
Are you thinking about what Nakagawa Ryosuke said?

19
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,610
With the Golden Eyes...

20
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,320
...I obtained things that I don't deserve.

21
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,160
I'm scared,worried...

22
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,079
...and bothered.

23
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,880
Feng Quan,Nakagawa Yohei and me.

24
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:37,000
Our lives are becoming similar,...

25
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,840
...maybe even becoming one.

26
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,040
We are tied together by the Golden Eyes...

27
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,240
...and similarly be destroyed by it.

28
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,720
Is this my destiny?

29
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,120
I can only accept my fate.

30
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,370
Things are not as bad you think.

31
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,440
Perhaps we can find a way...

32
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,500
...to stop the side effects of the Golden Eyes in Gansu.

33
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,480
Perhaps the Golden Eye will disappear one day.

34
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,840
Perhaps...

35
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,180
...your body will deteriorate further.

36
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,520
Before that happens,...

37
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,400
...don't give up,...

38
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,960
...don't be desolate...

39
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,960
...and don't speak of death.

40
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,240
Do you hear me?

41
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,890
We'll go through this with you.

42
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,720
You're nice.

43
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,650
Don't worry.

44
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,200
You're back. -Father.

45
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,290
I'm sorry, we lost the Tamamoku stone.

46
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,560
So I've heard.

47
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,600
Is it still with them? -Yes.

48
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,080
How is it with Lu Mang?

49
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,930
Miao Feifei caught him.

50
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,920
You don't need to worry. He won't say anything.

51
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,280
Is Zhuang Rui working with Nakagawa Ryosuke?

52
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:28,720
Yes.

53
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,210
Nakagawa Ryosuke seems to have a clue in hand.

54
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,320
What clue? -40 years ago,...

55
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,960
...Nakagawa Ryosuke's father and Zhuang Rui's grandfather...

56
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,020
...worked on an excursion together.

57
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,360
During an archaeological work in Gansu,...

58
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,220
...there was contact related with the Golden Eyes.

59
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,890
So,I believe their next move will be at Gansu.

60
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,600
They're going to the desert.

61
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:56,680
Yes.

62
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,450
They say that...

63
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,560
...a real man...

64
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,480
...is someone who has crossed the desert.

65
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,760
Now,I'm officially a real man.

66
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,120
Don't beg to go home when there's no water.

67
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,200
Listen to your filthy mouth.

68
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:39,120
We came here for Xiaorui.

69
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,929
I'll not go back until we find the cave temple.

70
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,750
We must find the cave temple.

71
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,800
I have a friend that might help.

72
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,720
I met Old Zeng,a camel herder, during a training.

73
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,000
He's knows this place like the back of his hand.

74
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,680
Xiaofei,you're quite the social butterfly. A desert friend?

75
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,080
That was a long time ago.

76
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,280
I'm not sure about his exact home address.

77
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,200
Sir! Please lead your pets aside!

78
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,690
You're blocking us!

79
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,410
Xiaofei,step on the accelerator. We'll cut him off.

80
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,840
Have a good time taking your pets for a walk.

81
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,140
What is it? What happened?

82
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,780
What is it? -I don't know. I'll check.

83
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,840
What's wrong? -There's an engine problem.

84
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,640
We've barely started. It's broken down already.

85
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,880
What do we do? -We are...

86
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,640
...far from the inn, aren't we?

87
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,890
Hurry up. Don't embarrass ourselves.

88
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,320
Make it quick.

89
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,680
Your car isn't better off. Let's ride on my camels.

90
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,920
No,thank you. You're nice. -Nice?

91
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,560
I wouldn't want to ride your pet.

92
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,860
With this speed,just two steps and it'll be night time.

93
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,200
Are you mocking Saiya? -It even has a name?

94
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,640
In the desert,camels are kings. Apologize to Saiya.

95
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,840
Apologize? What did I do?

96
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,560
How is it? -Saiya does look interesting.

97
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,520
Let's make a bet, what do you think?

98
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,720
If I lose,I will apologize to Saiya.

99
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,280
If you lose..... -What?

100
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,160
I'll have Saiya for two days. -Fine. What's the bet?

101
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,130
Let's bet on camel-riding.

102
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,010
Huang Fuyun,we have work to do. Stop playing around.

103
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,130
A bet on camel-riding? With what confidence?

104
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,320
I learned horse-riding when I studied overseas.

105
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,240
I can ride on anything and will win you a camel.

106
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,000
How long do you need? -Half an hour.

107
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,040
Great. I've nothing to do anyway.

108
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,260
Come on,let's do this.

109
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,410
I'll let you go 20 seconds earlier.

110
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,840
No need,I'll ride on Saiya.

111
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,170
You go first. I'll go 20 seconds later.

112
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,520
Giddy-up! Let's go! -20!

113
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,480
19! 18!

114
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,840
Hurry up! Run!

115
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,240
3! 2! 1!

116
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,280
What's taking so long?

117
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,080
Is he lost?

118
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,900
Over there!

119
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,330
Hurry up.

120
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,530
Why aren't you running?

121
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,840
He looks cool.

122
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,880
Don't get too excited. You should see his face.

123
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,900
I'm surprised Huang Fuyun knows how to ride camels.

124
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,080
He only knows how to ride.

125
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,000
I thought he only knew how to boast.

126
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,200
Aren't you going to apologize to Saiya?

127
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,360
Okay,I've fixed the car. It's getting late. Let's go.

128
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,320
Xiaofei,you drive too fast! -Old Zeng.

129
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,880
Pengfei!

130
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,840
I can't believe I would see you again.

131
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,240
You're still tough. -You look healthy.

132
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,640
I'm all right. -How's business?

133
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,730
This isn't the city but we're doing all right.

134
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,320
Invite your friends in. Please pardon the simple place.

135
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,520
No. -Come,let's go in.

136
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,520
You are Pengfei's friends and my guests,too.

137
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,280
Don't be shy. -Thank you.

138
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,280
Make yourselves at home.

139
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,020
There's limited food choices in the desert.

140
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,480
It's all we've got. I hope you don't mind.

141
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,040
Brother, you've always been here.

142
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,090
Don't you want to see the world?

143
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,640
I've never left this place.

144
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,600
People may think this place is mysterious...

145
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,040
...but for me, it's a comfortable place.

146
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,200
This is one of the originating place of Chinese civilization.

147
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,880
Does this mean there are treasures buried underneath?

148
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,760
This place has a rich culture...

149
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,560
...but there were major landforms.

150
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,930
Many developed area have been buried under the sand.

151
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,360
What is the area of this place?

152
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,480
It should be around 45,000 square kilometres.

153
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,530
There are places I've never been,too.

154
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,880
Won't we be finding needle in a haystack?

155
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,000
What are you looking for?

156
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,400
To be honest, we came here to look for...

157
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,410
...a cave temple. Have you heard of it?

158
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,800
No.

159
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Brother,have you really not heard of the cave temple?

160
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,280
Actually,we just want to take a look around.

161
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,880
The desert is unfamiliar to us so we need your help.

162
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,800
You could be our guide.

163
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,240
My age is catching up on me.

164
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,040
My hips and legs are getting weaker.

165
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,980
I haven't been into the desert for two years.

166
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,640
The cave temple that you speak of,...

167
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,960
...I've neither heard of nor seen it.

168
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,120
So my advice is, take a look around here.

169
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,200
Take this as a trip and take many photos.

170
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,680
Have a drink. -All right.

171
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,760
We're already here.

172
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,000
No matter what, we'll go into the desert.

173
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,920
Could you find us a local guide?

174
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,480
Someone who's familiar with the desert.

175
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,540
Yes. Brother, money isn't a problem.

176
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,600
We're rich so we'll pay you well.

177
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,120
Brother,my friends are straightforward. Don't mind them.

178
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,800
This cave temple is important to us.

179
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,860
Where do you want to go? I'll bring you there.

180
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,500
Father. -Stay out of this.

181
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,000
Greet the guests. -Hello,everyone.

182
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,730
The broke-down car? We meet again.

183
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,770
You know each other?

184
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,960
He's just been defeated by me.

185
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,360
You! -Mind your manners.

186
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,040
This is my son,A'Lai.

187
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,720
Well,can you really bring us into the desert?

188
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,080
Of course! I'm familiar with it.

189
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:06,680
A'Lai!

190
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,560
Go and prepare lunch. -Father.

191
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,600
How long will you keep me here?

192
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,780
I don't want to manage an inn. I want to see the world.

193
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,040
See the world? Do you know what it's like?

194
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,020
When something bad happens, it'll be too late then.

195
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,400
I'll see it for myself. You never let me go.

196
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,320
I stay here all day...

197
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,400
...without seeing the desert. It's the same as being dead.

198
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,200
My son is immature. Please don't mind him.

199
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,480
I hope you don't mind him.

200
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:47,930
Okay.

201
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,800
No. What do I say?

202
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,960
Please don't. -Who's there?

203
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,800
No. -You're welcome.

204
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,640
What is it? -It's not me.

205
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,400
Come in and talk. -No,I'm not going in.

206
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,640
I just want to talk about...

207
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,800
...the cave temple. -Why are you stuttering?

208
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,000
Tell me what you think. -What do I think?

209
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,640
I'm thinking of nothing.

210
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,040
It's really nothing. I'm not thinking about you.

211
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,860
I was talking about...

212
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,160
...the cave temple. What is it you want to say?

213
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,410
The cave temple?

214
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,020
I do have something about it. -Then come in and talk.

215
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,320
Go in? Why don't we talk outside?

216
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,040
Talk outside? Let's do that. -Okay.

217
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,680
I sent him to the door yet he doesn't enter.

218
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,280
What a coward.

219
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,760
Father,they don't look like tourists. Why are they here?

220
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,900
They seem mysterious. -Don't mind their business.

221
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,330
I heard they're looking for a cave temple.

222
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,360
Is there such a place here? What's inside?

223
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,540
You've really not seen it before?

224
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,920
Don't make blind guesses. Stay in the inn.

225
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,040
Why don't you let me go out?

226
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,080
I've only been to the desert a few times.

227
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,040
I'm at the inn everyday. It's stuffy.

228
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,440
If you go out, the sand will bury you up.

229
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,000
Stay here. It's safer.

230
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,240
How would you know that?

231
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,160
One day I'll prove it to you.

232
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:23,920
Father!

233
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:36,440
Whenever I see the vast Gobi Desert,I'll feel small.

234
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,320
If we could see stars above the Gobi Desert,...

235
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,370
...how nice would it be.

236
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,520
I've always wanted to leave the city...

237
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,960
...and travel to places under the open sky.

238
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,880
If a person knows his destiny,...

239
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,480
...I believe he would live a life without regrets.

240
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,480
Do you have any regrets? -I...

241
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,730
...regret many things.

242
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,540
My father once told me,...

243
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,920
...one must use their hands...

244
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,800
...to create and leave something behind.

245
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,320
This way,your soul will have a place to go.

246
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,440
It's a pity that I won't create anything in life...

247
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,940
...or leave anything behind.

248
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,560
Zhuang Rui,you will survive.

249
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,730
I'll make sure you'll survive.

250
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,220
We'll all die someday.

251
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,560
It's just difficult to accept death when it comes.

252
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,440
I tried...

253
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,370
...but I couldn't do it.

254
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,730
We'll find the cave temple.

255
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,720
We'll find...

256
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,260
...a way to solve everything.

257
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,600
Then,we'll come back here...

258
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,480
...and look at the stars, all right?

259
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,800
Thank you. You're nice.

260
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,680
Aren't I with the police?

261
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,540
We serve the people. That's the way it is.

262
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,090
The police are cool.

263
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,400
The button seems to have broken.

264
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,840
What is this? -What do you think?

265
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,370
This is.....

266
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,240
This is a wireless radio.

267
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,840
The desert is dangerous so I need to make sure...

268
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,940
...that I can find you.

269
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,440
Take this as...

270
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,410
...a gift from a friend.

271
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,440
Thank you,Officer Miao. I've received your gift.

272
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,680
Thank you.

273
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,780
Roger that.

274
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,720
A sandstorm is coming.

275
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,720
Remember to shut your doors. -Okay.

276
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,000
Let's go.

277
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,880
This place is odd. Why are the lands slanted?

278
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,860
This is the desert.

279
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,880
Did you notice Old Zeng's expression...

280
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,090
...when we mentioned the cave temple?

281
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,400
He knows something.

282
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,960
Perhaps,but I think he has his reasons.

283
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,600
What exactly is in the cave temple?

284
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,960
Are there treasures?

285
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,520
I only hope it can save Xiaorui.

286
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,200
If we can save Xiaorui...

287
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,610
...and earn money from the treasures,...

288
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,600
...Miss Xiaojia and I will have a happy life.

289
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,000
No. I must talk to Old Zeng tomorrow.

290
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,400
A'Lai! Boil some water to drink.

291
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,520
Did you hear me? A'Lai!

292
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,680
A'Lai!

293
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:56,920
A'Lai!

294
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,160
A'Lai!

295
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,520
The wind last night was strong.

296
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,400
I even heard the wind sounds. -I heard it,too.

297
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,460
I had to wake up and close the windows.

298
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,720
Where's Saiya? Did the wind take her away?

299
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,850
Old Zeng, where are you rushing off to?

300
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,400
A'Lai is missing. He must be riding Saiya into the desert.

301
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,920
I'll beat him up when I see him.

302
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,810
He went into the desert? When was this?

303
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,280
He must have left before the sandstorm.

304
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,520
The view isn't clear during strong wind. He's bold.

305
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,130
It's dangerous to go into the desert with the sandstorm.

306
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,120
I'll look for him. Please watch the inn for me.

307
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,800
Old Zeng,the sandstorm might change the landforms.

308
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,240
It's not safe to go alone. We'll go with you.

309
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,440
Yes. Your camel is slow. Let's take our car.

310
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,530
Let's go. We must hurry.

311
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,200
Let's go. -Let's do that.

312
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,880
A'Lai! -A'Lai!

313
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,600
A'Lai! -A'Lai!

314
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,640
A'Lai! -A'Lai!

315
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,760
A'Lai! -A'Lai!

316
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,240
A'Lai!

317
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,480
This is bad.

318
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,640
The sandstorm could have buried him in the sand.

319
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,720
If we don't find him, his life will be in danger.

320
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,040
Let us spilt up.

321
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,640
Twenty minutes later, we'll gather at the car.

322
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,800
Okay. -Okay.

323
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,600
Xiaorui will go with Xiaoyun. You'll come with me.

324
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,760
Okay. -Let's go.

325
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,680
Stay safe.

326
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,120
A'Lai!

327
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,720
A'Lai!

328
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,360
A'Lai! -A'Lai!

329
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,400
A'Lai! -A'Lai!

330
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,040
Xiaoyun.

331
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,400
Isn't this the camel's bell?

332
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,960
You're right. This is Saiya's bell.

333
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,100
They were here.

334
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,080
A'Lai!

335
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,670
We see him. We've found him.

336
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,600
Hurry!

337
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,710
Help him up. -Come.

338
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,120
Are you all right? Give him some water.

339
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,630
You're all right.

340
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,020
I'm glad you're all right.

341
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,720
I saved you this time.

342
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,880
Take this as my apology to Saiya.

343
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,760
I've troubled Saiya.

344
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,210
Is it the time to think about Saiya?

345
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,960
Your father is worried sick. Let's go.

346
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,600
Yes,let's go.

347
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,380
Does it taste good?

348
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,140
Everything tastes good to me.

349
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,960
It's too sweet for me.

350
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,280
Here.

351
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,960
I've troubled all of you. I don't know how to repay you.

352
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,000
Don't know how to repay us?

353
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,720
If I hadn't found you, you'd be dead.

354
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,920
Well,I'll let you choose from one of our camels.

355
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,680
I'll give it to you. Saiya not included!

356
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,760
I do like Saiya.

357
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,960
However,I asked Miss Xiaojia yesterday.

358
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:30,360
She's allergic to camels so Saiya will stay here for now.

359
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,600
Keep this. This annoying bell is Saiya's trademark.

360
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,560
You should keep it as a momento.

361
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,840
Keep it. Saiya will miss it.

362
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,560
You saved my son's life.

363
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,560
I will surely repay you.

364
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,440
Brother,have you actually seen the cave temple before?

365
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,200
Off you go and feed the camels.

366
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,440
All right.

367
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,600
Yes,I've seen the cave temple.

368
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,400
I didn't find the cave temple. it found me.

369
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,640
24 years ago, I got lost in the desert...

370
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,600
...with a camel.

371
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,200
I was out of water and was about to die in the desert.

372
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,480
That day,...

373
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,260
...the moon was exceptionally round...

374
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,440
...and shone on the sand.

375
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,680
What was in the cave temple?

376
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,800
There were broken statues of Buddha...

377
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,960
...and things that were buried in sand.

378
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,490
There were also paintings on the wall.

379
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,720
What happened after that?

380
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,800
After that,I went to the desert many times...

381
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,160
...but I couldn't find the cave temple.

382
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:30,400
This means that within 24 years,...

383
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,720
...the cave temple only appeared once.
