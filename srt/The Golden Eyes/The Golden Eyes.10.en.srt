The Golden Eyes

00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Episode 10

3
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,600
Hello.

4
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,410
Who is it?

5
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,480
Surprise!

6
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,200
Hey.....

7
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,280
Why are you here? -I miss you!

8
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,040
Xiao Jia is on a business trip to Ping Zhou and I miss her.

9
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,400
That's more like it. I need to go out for a while.

10
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,290
Stay here and take your time thinking about Xiao Jia.

11
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,600
Where are you off to early in the morning?

12
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,440
It's not bad here.

13
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,560
Wait for me!

14
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,760
Brother San,you know the pawning practices...

15
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,840
...for jade artifacts.

16
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,520
No regrets after leaving the shop. Besides,...

17
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,000
...you knew it wasn't pure when you bought it yesterday.

18
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,400
I gave you half off for it,now you a refund? It's inappropriate.

19
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,600
I understand where you're coming from.

20
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,880
However,my own brother...

21
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,160
...bought something from your shop...

22
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,160
...which contaminated the jade.

23
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,120
If we don't give the Living Buddha away,...

24
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,620
...he won't live in peace.

25
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,000
Please understand.

26
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,560
Brother San,since you put it this way,...

27
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,040
...I've decided to keep this for 1000,000 yuan.

28
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,000
100,000..... That's too little.

29
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,400
Brother San,you guys are big bosses...

30
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,320
...and you buy things as a hobby. I'm different.

31
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,390
I have to pay rent,amenities, wages,insurance and housing.

32
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,800
These are my overheads. -Boss.

33
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,440
You're offering 100,000 for something that cost us 800,000.

34
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,080
That's too little. -Rui...

35
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,600
It's good enough that we're allowed to refund.

36
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:36,360
After all,it's a refund. -Okay.

37
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,320
He has to think of his expenses.

38
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,280
See how he only uses a metal pot for his tea.

39
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,720
What are you trying to say?

40
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,200
Even appliances have a 7-day refund policy. Do be reasonable.

41
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,320
Lad,I'm afraid you don't know the business policies in Ping Zhou.

42
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,290
Policies? What policies? -Okay,that's enough.

43
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,170
Let's discuss policy then.

44
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,360
Once sold,there is no refunding or exchanging.

45
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,040
We acknowledge that.

46
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,080
However,you have to be above-board.

47
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,520
Shouldn't you consider a universally-accepted policy?

48
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,500
Tell me what is this universally-accepted policy.

49
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,360
Brother Ma,did you see lights flashing in the room yesterday?

50
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,680
Last night,I did see the lights in my rooms...

51
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,800
...flashing ceaselessly.

52
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,440
I checked the circuit and it was tampered with.

53
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,800
Did you see a shadow on the patio, breathing heavily towards you?

54
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,320
A ghost. It was flashing past,...

55
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,880
...and swishing as it floated back.

56
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,120
It even looked at me eerily.

57
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,800
It was chillingly cold. -I found out later that...

58
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,800
...the guests in the next room checked out that very night.

59
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,040
There were footprints on his patio,the same as ours.

60
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,000
I think that someone's up to some tricks,...

61
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,960
...stumbled and fell off.

62
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,360
Serves him right for acting as the ghost.

63
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,160
How can this be? -Weren't you the one behind this,

64
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,960
Boss? -Young man.

65
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,400
You have wild imaginations. -Really?

66
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,600
Mr. Xiao Gu,what are you doing here? Is old Mr. Gu well?

67
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,880
He's doing fine. Zhang Rui gave my grandfather a call yesterday.

68
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,340
My grandfather then told me about your shop.

69
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,159
I discovered that in a short six months,...

70
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:41,480
...this piece of jade has changed hands over ten times.

71
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,560
On top of that,every buyer was a total stranger to the place.

72
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,120
Really? -Of course!

73
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,000
Every seller ended up...

74
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,730
...refunding the product after encountering strange incidents.

75
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,560
Shi San,surely you're familiar with...

76
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,850
...every item in your own shop.

77
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,220
I..... Brother Ma.

78
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,200
I had nothing to do with this. -San'er.....

79
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,280
You..... -Brother Ma.

80
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,040
Don't stop me. -Brother Ma.....

81
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,620
You stay where you are. -Brother Ma.....

82
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,520
I..... -You scoundrel!

83
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,530
I won't do anything to you here.

84
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,080
Just you wait! -Brother Ma.....

85
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,480
I won't let you go when we return to Beijing!

86
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,720
No,Brother Ma.....

87
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,640
Brother Ma..... -Stay where you are.

88
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,840
My grandpa has another message for you.

89
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,800
He said he took you under his wings...

90
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,720
...because he saw that you loved jade,...

91
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,560
...and you were an active person who can be trained.

92
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,000
Now,it looks like you might be a too active for him.

93
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,880
My grandpa hopes you'll be able to learn a lesson from this.

94
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,880
He believes that you'll know what you should do.

95
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,520
Okay.

96
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,480
All right. I'll return the money.

97
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,400
Okay.

98
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,360
Your tuition fees have been borne by others all along.

99
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,640
It's time you bear the cost yourself.

100
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,200
I notice that you have a lot of goods stored in your shop.

101
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,060
Why don't you have a bargain sale?

102
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,840
You can pay for your fees and clear your stock at the same time.

103
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
What do you think?

104
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,120
Okay,I'll do as you say.

105
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,240
I didn't realize how unfathomable the waters of Ping Zhou can be.

106
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,360
It's not the waters of Ping Zhou that's unfathomable.

107
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,360
Neither is it the jade business that's unfathomable.

108
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,640
Then it's..... -It's man.

109
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,600
Listen to me,man is the most unpredictable.

110
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,120
Do you know why I love jade?

111
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,000
It's because jade does not lie.

112
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,080
If you don't understand it,it's because you don't know it yet.

113
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,800
Once you know it,it'll be crystal clear to you.

114
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,040
Unlike man,who are too difficult to understand.

115
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,720
Sometimes,one can't even understand oneself.

116
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,960
Grandpa Gu,has something been troubling you lately?

117
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,240
If so,...

118
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,800
...would you feel better talking about it? Even though...

119
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,600
...I may not understand everything,but maybe...

120
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,560
...after you've let it all out,...

121
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,170
...your shoulders will feel lighter.

122
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,200
Silly boy,some things can only be kept in one's heart.

123
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,940
Why do people have hearts?

124
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,000
It's for keeping things that can't be uttered or forgotten.

125
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,880
Especially one's wrongdoings.

126
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,600
It's there as a constant reminder to never forgot.

127
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,000
Grandpa Gu,how did...

128
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,810
...my grandpa end up alone?

129
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,680
A good man.

130
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,880
He's a very good man.

131
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,240
Xu,when we heard that you're back in Ping Zhou,...

132
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,970
...we made a dinner reservation. -That's right.

133
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,680
Can you see how the Xu family's business is expanding?

134
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,960
Please don't forget us when you take over the business.

135
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,480
Of course not. -Director Xu.

136
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,740
It looks like you had a fruitful trip.

137
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,530
Do make the introductions. -Definitely.

138
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,840
This is Qin Xuanbing,Miss Qin.

139
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,160
She's a top jewellery designer.

140
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,840
She's also the daughter of Xi Huang Jewellery.

141
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,760
She's in the mainland for inspection so I brought her along.

142
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,920
Bingbing,this is Yue Qun.

143
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,760
He's my main supplier.

144
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,560
She's young but she has the best jades from old Hou Jiang.

145
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,960
She hits the jackpot 80% of the time,beating New Hau Jiang.

146
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,920
Besides,her family has total monopoly of Old Hou Jiang.

147
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,210
They play a huge role in Ping Jiang.

148
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,970
Do anticipate her during the exhibition.

149
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,120
Don't worry,Miss Qin. We've doing well these years...

150
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,400
...thanks to Director Xu's support. Am I right?

151
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,440
Any friend of his is ours,too.

152
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,520
Let us know if you need our help.

153
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,960
Director Yue,with the resources you have,we must work with you.

154
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,880
We'll be troubling you. -No trouble at all.

155
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,880
Now that we're done with the introductions,let's us sit.

156
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,440
From now on,we should associate with each other. Cheers.

157
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,210
By the way,Bingbing, my uncle returns tomorrow.

158
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,050
Uncle Xu's coming back?

159
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,330
Then I have to prepare well.

160
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,960
I'll be there tomorrow night. -Okay.

161
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,840
I'll get going then. -You're leaving already?

162
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,050
Let me send you back. -No,I'll be fine.

163
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,520
Okay. Will you see her out?

164
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,370
Bye. -This way,please.

165
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,200
Wei,look at the way you bragged about me.

166
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,380
Didn't you know how limited Old Hau Jiang's resources are now?

167
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,560
You've taken most of them and what's left is dwindling down.

168
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,560
No matter how capable I am,I'm no magician.

169
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,380
What are you trying to say?

170
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,840
The goods we put on the market this year are not up to par.

171
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,320
How is it different from previous years?

172
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,440
When did Old Hau Jiang not sell goods mixed with New Hau Jiang's?

173
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,120
Besides,even if I placed New Hau Jiang's goods there,...

174
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,600
...and there's no jade in it, that's a question of probability.

175
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,920
No guarantee that Old Hau Jiang's goods would have jade.

176
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,040
Don't fuss. Let me finish.

177
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,040
What I'm saying is,there's too little this year.

178
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,400
How little?

179
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,970
There's only three pieces.

180
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,480
Three pieces?

181
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,600
You're joking.

182
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
Listen,Yue Qun.

183
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,300
You're offering chaff for grain.

184
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,840
The more you advertise your brand, the greater your fall.

185
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,460
With the number of suppliers we have,we certainly won't miss you.

186
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,160
Yes,old Director Xu won't miss this little supplier,...

187
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,800
...but Director Xu junior, won't you miss me as your friend?

188
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,010
Once my uncle finds out about this,...

189
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,690
...you and I will be in deep waters.

190
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,520
Put those brains of yours to work. Don't bring calamity on us both.

191
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,000
We're not honoured guests,so why attend the opening ceremony?

192
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,760
Miss Xiao Jia worked hard on this. We should be supportive.

193
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,320
If you're not keen on the dinner, you can leave earlier...

194
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,580
...and give us some space. -Your invitation cards please.

195
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,520
This way,please.

196
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,400
Hello,Uncle.

197
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,290
How are things coming along? -According to your instructions.

198
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,610
Sit down.

199
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,490
A fierce dragon doesn't cross the river. Old Qin understands this.

200
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,320
If he wants to break into the mainland market,...

201
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,800
...he has to look for a partner to collaborate with.

202
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,680
Get closer to Qin Xuanbing.

203
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,400
Let's put aside the collaboration.

204
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,900
Make sure we don't become rivals.

205
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,360
One more ally means one less rival.

206
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,560
Old Mr. Qin only has one daughter.

207
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,520
Uncle,there's no need to worry about this.

208
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,970
Have you sent out the invitations?

209
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,290
I've invited the families of our suppliers to this exhibition,...

210
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,520
...including corporation delegates for tonight's opening ceremony.

211
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,600
They should all be waiting for your arrival.

212
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:08,310
What about Gu Tianfeng? -I've invited him too,...

213
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:10,920
...but he said he'll come if he has time.

214
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,329
I'll stop him at the entrance when he arrives.

215
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,680
I'll drag him here if I have to.

216
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,040
Come in. -Director Xu,Director Xu.

217
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,440
President Gu is downstairs chatting with friends.

218
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,970
Should I invite them here? -I'll go there now.

219
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,480
I will go. Wait for me in the chartered room.

220
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
All right,uncle.

221
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,680
I had better meet that old man.

222
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,220
I'm impressed.

223
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,280
I couldn't tell that you're a newbie.

224
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,160
You almost fooled me!

225
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,120
You're my worthy grandson.

226
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,480
That's right,Grandpa Gu. Xiao Rui is an expert at memorizing.

227
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,120
He must have a photographic memory. So many different...

228
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,280
...tracts and features and he could explain it so well.

229
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,920
In this aspect,he's a bit better than I am.

230
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,880
It's all an illusion. Grandpa Gu, you've said it yourself.

231
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,540
Being good in theory can't beat seeing and feeling the real thing.

232
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,480
Well said.

233
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,480
To be honest,I'm happy you're interested in jade.

234
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,840
Your grandfather will certainly be happy too.

235
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,160
I have a gift for you.

236
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,920
What the.....

237
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,360
Grandfather,you're too cruel.

238
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,240
You know that I like jade,too.

239
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,840
Would you like another grandson? -Go away!

240
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,720
I've got plenty already.

241
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,520
Take it.

242
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,060
Membership certificate? - I'll depend on you when I'm old.

243
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,400
The Gem Society? Am I qualified for this?

244
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,880
You dissected that stone in public at that gem exchange meet.

245
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,360
Who dares to say that you're not qualified?

246
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,200
Miss Xiao Jia!

247
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,660
That boy..... -Miss Xiao Jia!

248
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,280
You're gorgeous.

249
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,360
You were dazzling on stage just now.

250
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,840
Absolutely radiant. No one present could compare to you.

251
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,600
Miss Xiao Jia!

252
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,330
Grandpa Gu,you're so kind. -Keep it well!

253
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,800
Old man!

254
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,680
You're one elusive man.

255
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,120
Inviting you is so hard. -Director Xu.

256
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,760
I forgot. You've been asking me to have dinner with you,right?

257
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,420
Age is creeping up on me. My memory is failing me.

258
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,880
Everyone's here. We're waiting for you.

259
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,200
Did I agree to go?

260
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,380
I'm having a chat about life with my young friends here.

261
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,860
You can chat at another place.

262
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,920
I have my nephew with me, it'll be lively with them.

263
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,760
Old man,shall I help you up?

264
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,360
No need. What's this? -Come.....

265
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,560
You really think I'm old,don't you?

266
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,520
Let's go. -Let's go,Rui.

267
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,840
I'll treat you to a meal. -Let's go.

268
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,170
They're all my old friends.

269
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,440
Mr. Gu! Long time no see! -Yes,it's been a while.

270
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,360
How's business lately? -Thanks to you,it's doing well.

271
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,960
That's good,then. -Mr. Gu,how's your health?

272
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,080
Little Junior Xu.

273
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,340
What do you think? -He's good and excellent.

274
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:41,900
Zhuang Rui.

275
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,800
Long time no see. -Long time?

276
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,360
It hasn't been that long.

277
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,680
Let's take a seat. -All right.

278
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,120
Old Gu,this way. -Please,this way.

279
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,840
Rui,come sit here.

280
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,640
Sit by my side.

281
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,200
President Gu,it's been a long time since we saw each other.

282
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,680
Yes. -Things have changed in two years.

283
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,960
The price of rough stones have gone up. We must stay together...

284
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,840
...and work with each other. -Director Xu,what are you saying?

285
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,400
We're looking at you for support.

286
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,640
Let's eat. Rui,try this dish. This is definitely delicious.

287
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,760
Try it. We'll start eating now. -Let's eat.

288
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,640
Let's eat while we talk.

289
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,780
Bingbing! Hurry up and come here.

290
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,780
Come over here.

291
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,020
I'm sorry to be late. I was caught in traffic.

292
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,010
That's okay,we're glad you could made it.

293
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,440
This is a small token from my father,brought over from Kiev.

294
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,320
I hope you like it. -Why so formal with the gift?

295
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,640
Hurry up and sit down. -I'll take it.

296
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,540
Zhuang Rui.

297
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,520
I happened to be downstairs chatting with Grandpa Gu...

298
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,450
..and was invited here for dinner.

299
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,160
You know each other? That's wonderful.

300
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,210
Young people should get together more often.

301
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,320
The purpose of my invitation today...

302
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,760
...is to get together...

303
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,080
...and to tell something to everybody.

304
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,090
As you're all aware,...

305
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,280
...Xiao Wei is my nephew.

306
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,200
He's done well in running the company these few years.

307
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,680
I'm getting on in years.

308
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,600
Xu Enterprise is a family-owned business.

309
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,760
The key members have come to a decision.

310
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,450
From now on,the company...

311
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,370
...will be gradually handed over to Xiao Wei.

312
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,420
I ask for everyone to support him.

313
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,520
From now on,this young man...

314
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,850
...will take over from me. -Thank you,uncle.

315
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,530
President Gu,you've always been a good judge of character.

316
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,460
Does this nephew of mine meet your expectations...

317
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,980
...and have your support?

318
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,280
It's a good thing to support young people.

319
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,200
However,we have to see if they're worth supporting.

320
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,260
Don't you think? -Yes,you're right.

321
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,800
Thank you,President Gu. I will definitely work hard.

322
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,680
That's good. -Old Gu,...

323
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,920
...will you make Xiao Wei a member of the Gem Association?

324
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,360
You know very well that...

325
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,880
...one has to have the aptitude to become a member.

326
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,080
Yes,I do know. -Of course,...

327
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,610
...we do need to provide young people with more opportunities.

328
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,700
Speaking of which,I should make the introductions again.

329
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:16,940
Zhuang Rui.

330
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,930
He's currently the youngest member of the Gem Association.

331
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,720
This young man must have exceptional talent...

332
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,480
...for President Gu to think so highly of him.

333
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,560
Zhuang Rui,all right.

334
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,200
I look forward to the exhibition tomorrow and your performance.

335
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
Okay.

336
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,560
Little Junior Xu.

337
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,050
Didn't the two of you dissect a rock...

338
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,040
...at the Beijing gem exchange meet that day?

339
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,360
Am I right? -Yes.

340
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,240
Mr. Zhuang was lucky that day.

341
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,850
This is not just luck. More importantly,it's discernibility.

342
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,200
You're right. -Come in.

343
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,720
Director Xu,someone sent you a congratulatory gift.

344
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,760
Open it up.

345
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,760
Let me take a look.

346
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,800
This looks like a common jade.

347
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,600
The work on this isn't that good.

348
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,850
You take a look,too.

349
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,820
It has a cutlass at the waist. This...

350
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,720
...is probably a statue in honour of Guan Zhong.

351
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,280
Guan Zhong is known as the Virtuous Emperor.

352
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,840
It would be a gift in praise of Director Xu's...

353
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,720
...honourable and selfless efforts to establish a virtuous family.

354
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,560
It's an auspicious message.

355
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,340
It's very auspicious.

356
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,250
That's remarkable.

357
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,720
Xiao Zhuang,you're not only an expert in jade,but history,too.

358
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,940
This next generation certainly deserves our respect.

359
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,080
For those words of yours, let's toast to your health.

360
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,080
Let's toast.

361
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,920
Yes. -Let's toast.

362
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:29,800
Good.

363
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,840
Xiao Rui,what are the five qualities of jade?

364
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,200
Kind,just,wise,brave,clean. -That's right.

365
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,920
This is why I love jade.

366
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,320
Not only do I appreciate its beauty,...

367
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,440
...I didn't enter the jade business solely because of this.

368
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,680
Within two years,Xu Company has expanded well.

369
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,720
However,the public exhibition is...

370
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,200
...not a place to pursue fame and fortune,don't you agree?

371
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,280
Everyone,especially those in the jade industry,...

372
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,320
...is given equal opportunity,...

373
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,720
...but if things continue the way it is,...

374
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,640
..then the exhibition will become a place of fame and fortune.

375
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,640
I'm going back to rest.

376
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,800
Continue chatting then send Xiao Qin back,okay?

377
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,400
Okay. -See you.

378
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,400
You couldn't discern it,right? -What?

379
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,140
Guan Zhong.

380
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,000
Guan Zhong is one of the 60 signs in the zodiac.

381
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,440
Superstitious Southern traders see zodiac figurines as inauspicious.

382
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,370
I feel that Uncle Xu will be depressed for a long time.

383
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,720
You do know a lot.

384
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,970
I'll see you at the exhibition. -Let me send you home.

385
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,410
There's no need.

386
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,240
Uncle,whoever sent this thing,...

387
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,140
...I'm going to go after that vicious offender.

388
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,840
Forget it. I don't want to think about who'd send such a thing.

389
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,920
Gu Tianfeng?

390
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,920
Have a seat.

391
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,960
It was me.

392
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,360
I let those people see it on purpose.

393
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,200
I want them to see how Xu Family expanded on its own these years...

394
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,160
...and someone's already unhappy with us.

395
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,320
As long as someone voices out their discontentment,...

396
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,760
...the rest will gradually pick sides.

397
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,240
This way,we will find out...

398
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:18,160
...who our enemies and foes are.

399
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,460
That's brilliant,uncle.

400
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,200
Be careful with those friends of yours.

401
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,920
What friends?

402
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,140
Did you think I don't know about your crooked deeds?

403
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,660
Don't you have too much dealings with those agents?

404
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,200
I just want to be on good terms with them so that...

405
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,460
...I could get cheaper rates when replenishing our stock.

406
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,400
Cheaper rates?

407
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,300
When have quality goods ever been cheap?

408
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,480
I don't usually care about what you do outside,but remember this.

409
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,720
Don't ever tarnish your family name.

410
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,640
We don't do such things with those in the same trade.

411
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,640
Don't let others know of your relationship with them.

412
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,560
Don't worry. Other traders...

413
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,160
...who buy our inferior stones will help us and not hurt us.

414
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,040
I've never sold even one piece of our own stones to outsiders.

415
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,700
That grandson who came with Gu Tianfeng.

416
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,570
He's quite impressive.

417
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,450
Do you mean that pretty boy?

418
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,210
I don't think he's someone we should worry about.

419
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,240
That old man...

420
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,180
...has never cared about anyone before.

421
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,100
It looks like he's going to train the boy.

422
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,460
Wasn't it him who had that nine million yuan rock last time?

423
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,840
You should check that temper of yours and know when to quit...

424
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,850
...so that you won't bring shame to me.

425
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,160
Yes.

426
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,740
Yes,that's right.

427
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,840
As long as Zhuang Rui doesn't attend the 3-day exhibition,...

428
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,300
...I'll give you 100,000 a day. That's 300,000 for three days.

429
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:50,680
Okay.

430
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,710
This is a car with fake license plate.

431
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,570
This man was being very cautious.

432
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,960
Clips from CCTVs show that he's trying to evade them...

433
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,040
...until he reached an intersection.

434
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,840
Though he managed to evade a direct facial shot,...

435
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:29,000
...the camera diagonally opposite managed to take a shot.

436
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,080
Can you identify him?

437
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,710
The camera is too far away, so this would be a problem.

438
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,230
Then,can you locate the car?

439
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,440
The car was last seen...

440
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:47,230
...on a camera in the suburbs before it disappeared completely.

441
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,760
I know of a place where we might find them.

442
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,760
Where is it? -Stupid.

443
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,220
Look at where they were last seen.

444
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,440
If they're not within 1km,go for 5km.

445
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,370
Failing that,search within 10km.

446
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,440
The scope of investigation would be: auto scrap yards,...

447
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:14,600
...auto repair shops and auto service centres. This is a car.

448
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:32,840
It's not a rat. How can it vanish without a trace?

449
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,280
Miss Xiao Jia, have some more food.

450
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,680
You've lost weight.

451
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,740
Have I lost weight?

452
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,240
Zhuang Rui,why are you still reading?

453
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,040
You didn't say a word either. Is the food not to your liking?

454
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,720
Not at all. It's delicious.

455
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,360
Let's eat up.

456
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,090
Are you done with your meal?

457
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,200
I'm still eating. Miss Xiao Jia, how about more vegetables?

458
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I'm good,thanks.

459
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,740
Would you like me to cut it for you?

460
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,060
I can manage it myself.

461
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,330
Zhuang Rui,if you're done eating, have some yoghurt drink.

462
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,880
Chun Zhen yoghurt is my favourite.

463
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,160
Thank you. I like this yoghurt very much,too.

464
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,600
Would you like to try some? Here's another one. Take it.

465
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:57,320
How is it? Do you like it?

466
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,410
Yes,I do.

467
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,660
Zhuang Rui.

468
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,500
Is there a woman that you like?

469
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,000
I do.

470
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,930
My mother and grandmother.

471
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,100
Is there a woman that you like?

472
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,600
How hateful. You know yet you ask.

473
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,160
I'm asking because I know. Let's drink to that.

474
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,100
Are we all done with our meals?

475
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,440
Let's go,then.

476
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,530
Xiao Rui.

477
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,560
I'll send Miss Xiao Jia home.

478
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,400
Bye. -Okay.

479
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,720
Bye. -Take care.

480
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,120
Please.

481
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,980
You're that guard.

482
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,410
Somebody wants to get your leg off.

483
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,760
Who is it? Who is it that wants to harm me?

484
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,360
Quit asking so much. Anyhow...

485
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,440
...do me a favour by helping yourself.

486
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,880
Stay away from the public exhibition for now. Or else,...

487
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,200
...you'll be met with troubles.

488
00:39:59,280 --> 00:39:59,720
Sister

489
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,800
The car was found.

490
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,740
Where is it? -Classed as abandoned vehicle.

491
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,440
But,the car number plate has been restored...

492
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,900
...and we found the owner.

493
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,000
He is Xu Wei from Guangzhou's Xu Corporation.

494
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,880
Where is he? Let's get to him now.

495
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,730
You have to cross state borders,then.

496
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,840
He's in Pingzhou currently.

497
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,440
Pingzhou?

498
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,340
Brother Ma.

499
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,960
Why is it only you?

500
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,880
Am I late?

501
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,160
Where's Xiao Rui?

502
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,520
He couldn't get up because he has food poisoning last night.

503
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,410
He's not coming?

504
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,000
He ought to be here.

505
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,920
He's our consultant.

506
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,560
I can't just consult anyone here now.

507
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,000
San'er.

508
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:31,640
Brother Ma?
