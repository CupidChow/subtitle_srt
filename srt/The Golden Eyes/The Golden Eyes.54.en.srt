1
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,500
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 54

3
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,360
We're different.

4
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,280
You're right. We're different. I'm a fatherless child.

5
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,720
After my mother remarried, she left me behind.

6
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:55,200
I'm telling you, it's very difficult to survive...

7
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,720
...back then. You wouldn't understand.

8
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,720
Do you know how it feels like...

9
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,920
...to starve?

10
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,160
Do you know how it feels like to be looked down by others?

11
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,880
That is the life on the bottom rung.

12
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,090
I don't dare to think of being successful.

13
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,760
Unless an opportunity appears.

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,520
If an opportunity appears,I will hold on to it with my dear life.

15
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,579
Do you understand?

16
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:33,360
In the winter 40 years ago,...

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,660
...an archaeological team came to our village.

18
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,360
The guide was a fat man.

19
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:43,540
Everyone in the village wanted to be chosen.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,079
Zhuang Qiming was kind and chose me.

21
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,480
Fine. Then I brought the team to Feng Quan's Tomb.

22
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,640
What happened inside Feng Quan's Tomb back then...

23
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,880
...changed my life.

24
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,640
Nakagawa,are you all right? Nakagawa!

25
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,440
Save me.

26
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,800
I will save you. I'll bring you out of here.

27
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,050
You must believe me.

28
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,200
After we escaped, we went to a village.

29
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,360
While recovering,...

30
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,530
...I realised that Nakagawa Yohei's eyes...

31
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,160
...were unusual.

32
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,840
I was intrigued.

33
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,240
Then,I started to...

34
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,600
...secretly observed Nakagawa Yohei.

35
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,000
In the end,...

36
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,640
...I found out a huge secret.

37
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,400
Nakagawa, what can your eyes see?

38
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,600
I seem to be able to look into the inside...

39
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,760
...of objects.

40
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,500
It's just like what Feng Quan described.

41
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,700
Feng Quan's tomb paintings depicted his supernatural sight.

42
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,320
His eyes were like yours.

43
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,960
You mean that the totem drawing are a kind of symbols...

44
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,360
...drawn by Feng Quan?

45
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,220
During the explosion,...

46
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,880
...weren't you holding the stone in your hand?

47
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,080
Are you referring to the Zhenxi Stone?

48
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,370
It seems to have shattered during the explosion.

49
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,840
I think your eyes' condition has to do with the stone.

50
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,400
Related to the jade?

51
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,520
Nakagawa Yohei was lucky to escape from me.

52
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,210
Your grandfather,Zhuang Qiming.

53
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,900
It's a pity that I could not find the stone on him.

54
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,860
My grandfather was really killed by you.

55
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,680
You do not know that...

56
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,840
...when I found your grandfather,he was dying.

57
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,760
I stabbed him but he still ran quickly. Isn't that stupid?

58
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,200
You're mad! -Can you blame me?

59
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,730
Don't be too emotional. Don't be rash,child.

60
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,820
Listen,what is the most important part?

61
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,300
I have spent so many years on something I cannot obtain.

62
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,400
However,you obtained it easily.

63
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,120
This is what I am concerned with. -Why don't you just kill me?

64
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,320
Why would I kill you?

65
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,880
I need you to live well.

66
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,360
Kojima?

67
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,600
Are you surprised? Who did you expect?

68
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,560
How would I know that Gu Tianfeng is the insider?

69
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,880
Never thought that I can meet Nakagawa's descendant here.

70
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,360
You know my father?

71
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,400
I don't just know him.

72
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,000
It seems that you and my father are close.

73
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,040
Initially,Nakagawa Yohei and I were supposed...

74
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,200
...to join the archaeological expedition together.

75
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,920
However, Zhuang Qiming took my place.

76
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,500
We kept in touch through letters.

77
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
I still keep those letters...

78
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,640
...and the information from back then.

79
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,080
I see.

80
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,520
So there is another person who knows about that incident.

81
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,080
There must be someone who knows what had happened.

82
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,680
Xiaorui, why don't you sleep for a while?

83
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,920
Okay,I know.

84
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,020
Is there news from Zhuang Rui?

85
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,880
They will not stop until they obtain the stone.

86
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,330
Once they take action, we will have the opportunity.

87
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,760
We can only think of this.

88
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,000
Feifei,there are clues.

89
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,040
Where is this taken? -It's near the cafe in the city.

90
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,560
However,they lost them.

91
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,240
Who is the other person?

92
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,580
I've never met him before.

93
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,320
Long Kun knows that we are searching for him...

94
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,200
...yet he still meet this person. This person must be influential.

95
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,800
This person looks familiar.

96
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,560
How would you know a Ukrainian?

97
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,780
I remember something.

98
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,200
When I was studying overseas, this person gave a talk.

99
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,440
An Ukrainian neuroscience professor,Mr. Petrovich.

100
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,960
I knew I remember him.

101
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:25,640
That's right. It's him.

102
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,660
Why does a medical expert meet with Long Kun?

103
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,240
They want to hurt Xiaorui.

104
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,640
No,we cannot just sit and wait here.

105
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,660
It's dangerous for Xiaorui to be in their hands.

106
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,480
Yelena,...

107
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,810
...if there's news regarding Long Kun,inform us immediately.

108
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,600
Okay.

109
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,200
Xiaoyun,search for the contact of Mr. Petrovich.

110
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,800
Don't worry, I will certainly find him.

111
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,920
Don't worry.

112
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,320
We have coordinated with those from the freight yard.

113
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,400
It's perfect.

114
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,680
You have really done well in this.

115
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,600
You gathered so many Chinese artifacts.

116
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,760
I even have the connection with the freight yard.

117
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,120
If our plan succeeds,we will monopolise Kiev's antique market.

118
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:41,760
We will be strong. -Just to be strong?

119
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,960
You are short-sighted.

120
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:50,400
If we just want to live normally, we don't need to take risks...

121
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,880
...and take the longer path. These artifacts from China...

122
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,360
...were personally restored and repaired by me.

123
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,640
They are national treasures. With them,...

124
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:05,440
...Kiev will be a global Chinese cultural relics exchange centre.

125
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,840
Your greed is greater than mine.

126
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,160
I seem to be too greedy.

127
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,130
It's normal for a human.

128
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,480
How is Zhuang Rui's surgery preparation?

129
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,760
I invited the doctor and...

130
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,280
...his assistant here. They are world-renowned neuroscientists.

131
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,040
Good.

132
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,360
How is it?

133
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,640
Is it the wrong place? Or did I misidentify the person?

134
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,800
The nurse said that Mr. Petrovich and his assistant...

135
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,060
...haven't come to the hospital for a week to go on holiday.

136
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,960
I think this must be related to Long Kun.

137
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,320
This is bad.

138
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,800
Kreza,what is it?

139
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,440
Do you want to go to the exhibition tomorrow night?

140
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,320
I'm not interested to join any exhibition recently.

141
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,720
Are you not interested in Chinese artifacts,too?

142
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,260
Artifacts from China.

143
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,720
Please.

144
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,720
We were invited to the exhibition. Why are we here?

145
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,280
Be patient. Follow me.

146
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,880
Welcome,everyone. Welcome,my collector friends...

147
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,960
...to our exhibition.

148
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,730
This exhibition includes,...

149
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,170
...according to the arrangement,...

150
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,560
...the jade ornament from the Warring States period,...

151
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,200
...Qing Dynasty's gold inlaid cat-eye gemstone pendant...

152
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,200
...and Song dynasty's zither.

153
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,880
These 3 are national treasures from China

154
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,640
Firstly,this jade ornament from the Warring States.

155
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,520
It's intact although it's been 1000 years and still clear.

156
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,400
It symbolises the genius creativity and silent wisdom.

157
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,920
Next,I will introduce the second item.

158
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,880
It's Qing Dynasty's gold inlaid cat-eye gemstone pendant.

159
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,920
You can observe that it's transparent and has clear polish.

160
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,960
It used to be the toy of the Qing Dynasty's emperor. So,it's rare.

161
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,520
Lastly,I want to introduce this Song Dynasty's zither.

162
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,600
It's from the Song Dynasty's palace,pretty and strong.

163
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,840
It's still difficult to hide its lustre.

164
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,400
Never thought that we can see these treasures here.

165
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,760
All these are just appetisers.

166
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,800
If you are satisfied,...

167
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,360
...we will bring in another batch of similar items from China.

168
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,880
Please come at that time. -The first thing is very valuable.

169
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,120
It's worth it even if expensive. -I want to get them all.

170
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,690
They were completely fascinated.

171
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,600
Imagine,when the exhibition has officially started,...

172
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,360
...there'll be a sensation in Kiev's collectors world.

173
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,640
No,it's the whole world.

174
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,000
What is this? -It's with the new batch.

175
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,240
Look at this.

176
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,760
It's the Tamamoku stone! How is this possible?

177
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,720
We have to thank Nakagawa Ryosuke for this.

178
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,440
He never gave up searching for it.

179
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,800
Hence, Kojima is able to find it.

180
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:16,829
No wonder you sent back those around the museum.

181
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,460
You have already obtained the stone.

182
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,800
Then,do we still want the stone in their hands?

183
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:29,440
Why not? With Zhuang Rui still in our hands,...

184
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,600
...the other jade will come to us by itself.

185
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,090
You will have a lot of time to admire it.

186
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,760
What?

187
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,730
They smuggled cultural relics into the country?

188
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,040
Those who attended are not just local collectors from Kiev...

189
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,360
...but also illegal businessman from all over the world.

190
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,080
They are very ambitious.

191
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,300
The items they collected are more than imaginable.

192
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,160
Good-for-nothing people.

193
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,860
Are they dividing them like the 8 members of Allied Forces?

194
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,560
Mr. Victor,...

195
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,600
...please find ways to stop all these collectors.

196
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,440
All of these are China's treasures.

197
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,730
They are committing crime.

198
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,560
These businessmen are not bounded by anything in front of wealth.

199
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,880
Feifei,I'm incapable of doing anything in regards to this.

200
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,460
I hope you understand.

201
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,080
What now? The situation is uncontrollable.

202
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,120
Hello,Sister Fei. -Hello,Zhao.

203
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,040
It's 3a.m. What is it?

204
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,040
Who are they to take those? Those are China's relics.

205
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,400
Long Kun and Ma Tengfeng... -Don't worry.

206
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,400
...smuggled some national treasures to Ukraine.

207
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,000
I only know that the location is in Kiev. Check...

208
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,880
...for any transporting channel in the country.

209
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,720
Focus more on those huge freight yards.

210
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,050
See if there are any news on suspicious items.

211
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,040
Okay,I'll check now. -Okay,goodbye.

212
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,880
This is a huge issue.

213
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,370
Xiaozhao and others will have difficulties in investigating.

214
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,240
If we don't have any evidence,...

215
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,600
...we cannot ask for assistance. We need to depend on our luck.

216
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,160
Xiaoyun,how is your search for that professor?

217
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,730
He disappeared together with his assistant.

218
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,840
Someone last saw them inside a warehouse.

219
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,920
Warehouse?

220
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,260
Yelena have found out that...

221
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,440
...one of the owners is Long Kun.

222
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,960
We also found out that he is there every Sunday.

223
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,760
How is it?

224
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,960
Are you comfortable staying here?

225
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,600
All these are from China.

226
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,760
Have a look for me.

227
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,810
All these are national treasures. Why are they with you?

228
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,880
Continue.

229
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,880
If you can explain it,...

230
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,420
...I will consider whether I should tell you or not.

231
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,240
Emperor Kang Xi once wore this...

232
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,940
...gold inlaid cat-eye gem pendant.

233
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,920
This gemstone is set on a gold plate.

234
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,320
It's like a cat's eye, watching those who wear it.

235
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,640
After Kang Xi,Yong Zheng,...

236
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,720
...and Qian Long had collected it before.

237
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,130
In the end, it was lost while with Pu Yi.

238
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,540
This is recorded in unofficial history.

239
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,040
However,as a real art piece,...

240
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,160
...it has a huge flaw.

241
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,160
How is this possible?

242
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,360
There is a crack behind the gemstone.

243
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,570
The person who made this gemstone placed it on the gold plate...

244
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,000
...to hide this crack.

245
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,800
If you use ultraviolet ray, you can see it clearly.

246
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,130
Brother De says your...

247
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,160
...eyes are very amazing.

248
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,040
I didn't believe him.

249
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,840
You are even more amazing than what he said.

250
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,200
No wonder he risked his life...

251
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,800
...to obtain those stones.

252
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,570
How did you obtain this?

253
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,520
Naturally,it's because of Brother De's capability.

254
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,120
I'll be honest with you.

255
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,000
Other than this,there is still a batch of similar relics.

256
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,280
Each of them is precious.

257
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,680
Brother De likes you.

258
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,140
It's a pity that...

259
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,780
...you don't want to help out.

260
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,880
Once we settle this,...

261
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,130
...we will not be meeting anymore.

262
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,960
Such a pity.

263
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,880
What is a pity?

264
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,530
It's a pity that you may not even earn a single cent...

265
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,760
...from such a lucrative business.

266
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,600
Do you think that after this is done,...

267
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,940
...Uncle De will let you stay?

268
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,960
We are partners.

269
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,240
Without me, how can there be so many...

270
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,440
...deals for smuggling relics?

271
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,080
Uncle De needs your connection in Kiev.

272
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,450
In China,...

273
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,530
...all the channels for relics...

274
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,620
...are controlled by him.

275
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,840
Once this is done,...

276
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,080
...I believe that there will a better partner.

277
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,680
Impossible. I won't allow it.

278
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,940
This may not be decided by you.

279
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:20,840
Right,...

280
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,320
...you reminds me of someone.

281
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:30,960
Who?

282
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,840
Do you know...

283
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,500
...how Qin Haoran was killed by Uncle De?

284
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,640
You can actually find me here.

285
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,690
Your Ukrainian friends are quite something.

286
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,840
Long Kun,where is Zhuang Rui?

287
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,800
If I don't say anything, what can you do?

288
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,530
If you touch me,don't even think of seeing Zhuang Rui again.

289
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,640
Since we can find you here,...

290
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,700
...we can naturally find out where you hide Zhuang Rui.

291
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,320
We don't want to fight you to death. Please inform Uncle De.

292
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:26,400
Tell him we have a deal to make with him.

293
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,960
A deal? Sure.

294
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,560
Can I leave now?

295
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,560
So,your luck is quite good.

296
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,920
You are able to have this strange experience...

297
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,040
...and make some nice friends.

298
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,480
What do you want to do? -Nothing. Don't worry.

299
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,960
They are all well.

300
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,760
What's more,they are willing to let go of the stone.

301
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,040
This touches my heart.

302
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,560
What do you want to do to them? -Nothing.

303
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
I think you should be happy instead.

304
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,920
These friends are doing everything for you,right?

305
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,720
Tomorrow,they will come to see whether you are safe here.

306
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,520
Whether you are still alive.

307
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,120
Listen here. Tomorrow,when you see them,...

308
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,400
...advise them to hand over the stone.

309
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,440
Don't try to plan otherwise.

310
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,280
Dream on.

311
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:02,440
Stop holding in. You must be upset.

312
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,370
At least think about your friends.

313
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,800
Feifei,it's been a long time.

314
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,440
Yes.

315
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,400
Once I arrest you, we will meet often.

316
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,280
Officer Miao has learnt to joke. It's a good thing.

317
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,730
Peng Fei,are you used to the cold weather of Ukraine?

318
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,440
Fine. Who is going in? Only one can enter.

319
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,920
Long Kun didn't say this. -Well,I said it.

320
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,020
After all,you are just going to check out Zhuang Rui's condition.

321
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,200
One person is enough to check whether he is safe and healthy...

322
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,880
...or sick or dead or alive.

323
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,520
Why do I feel that talking in front of you is awkward?

324
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,000
Is it because it's different from the past?

325
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,880
What can I do? That's life.

326
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,480
We all gain what we need and do what we have to.

327
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,840
Who's going in?

328
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,220
Wait for me here. I'll go in. -Be careful.

329
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,240
No need. Come in.

330
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,340
You have 5 minutes.

331
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,880
Are you all right?

332
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,960
You shouldn't come. You shouldn't make a deal with Ma Tengfeng.

333
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,840
We cannot let you stay alone here.

334
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,850
Everyone is worried about you.

335
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,460
I worry about you,too.

336
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,010
Did they do anything to you?

337
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,600
You should not use the stone as an exchange.

338
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,280
I don't have many days to live. It's pointless.

339
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,770
Whether it's pointless or not,...

340
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,760
...we must try.

341
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,160
Hurry and check!

342
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,180
Tomorrow we'll pretend to exchange the stone and make a distraction.

343
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,940
We will find ways to rescue you. Be prepared.

344
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,760
The security is tight here. It's not going to be easy.

345
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,960
Come warm yourself up. This place is really cold.

346
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,800
Yes.

347
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,240
No matter what, we still have to try.

348
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:13,000
Right,Long Kun and Ma Tengfeng are now...

349
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,360
...transporting a batch of relics to Kiev.

350
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,480
They'll make a deal 2 days later. -I know.

351
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,880
Xiaozhao is investigating,but the information we have is too little.

352
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,080
The number of items coming in from China is huge.

353
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,740
It's akin to looking for a needle in the haystack. It's difficult.

354
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,240
Ma Tengfeng is cautious.

355
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,250
There will be no chance if we use usual method.

356
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,050
You cannot hand over the stone.

357
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,920
You must buy time.

358
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,520
Buy time? What's your plan?

359
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,200
I have a way to find contacts in China.

360
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,500
You just have to help me to create a video.

361
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,940
How is Xiaorui?

362
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:56,790
He's fine.

363
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,720
You have seen him. Can we continue with the deal?

364
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,240
You have the upper hand in number of people.

365
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,720
What if we give you the jade but you don't let him go?

366
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,050
So,you are saying.....

367
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,800
The place must be changed. -Sure.

368
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,520
I will send a new address to you.

369
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,140
I'll go there alone tomorrow. You guard here properly.

370
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,880
Yes,don't worry.

371
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,180
What's the situation now?

372
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,320
Doesn't he want to live? Can't he just go through with the trade?

373
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,940
He has become a lab rat but still worries about the country.

374
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,040
Since he has decided, we should trust and help him.

375
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,640
Xiaoyun,call Liu Jia...

376
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,880
...and ask her to create a piece of news.

377
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,320
News? What for?

378
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,800
This is requested by Zhuang Rui.

379
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,080
This news video will be shared on the websites of both countries.

380
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,140
After it is posted,...

381
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,880
...we just need to connect to a virtual link.

382
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,040
Mr. Victor, we need a signal blocker.

383
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,120
It doesn't need to affect a huge area.

384
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,320
It only needs to be effective within 10 metres.

385
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,760
No problem.

386
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,570
This is Zhuang Rui's location.

387
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,490
We will hold off Ma Tengfeng tomorrow.

388
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,200
I'll leave Zhuang Rui to you. -Yes.

389
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,600
Officer Miao,...

390
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,720
...is there any news regarding Kojima?

391
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,840
The time was too short. I don't have the chance.

392
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,120
She was not with Zhuang Rui.

393
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:47,680
I'm sorry.

394
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,520
Eat up. You have work to do tomorrow.

395
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,440
I don't know what you are talking about.

396
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,570
I advise you to be more careful.

397
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,040
Uncle De is not to be fooled easily.

398
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,520
Why did you betray Mr. Nakagawa?

399
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,480
Mr. Zhuang, I'm afraid you're wrong.

400
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,760
I have never betrayed Mr. Nakagawa.

401
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,040
From the beginning,I was only carrying out the tasks...

402
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,800
...given by Mr. Ma Tengfeng.

403
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,080
Good. It's done after adding in some words.

404
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,680
Honey. -How is it?

405
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,560
It will be done before midnight.

406
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,880
The posting will not be affected.

407
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,480
Okay. Thank you for your work,Miss Xiaojia.

408
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,680
Don't worry.

409
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,900
You don't need to tell me these given our situation.

410
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,120
What we must do now is to rescue Zhuang Rui.

411
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,840
There's nothing more important than this.

412
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,760
I'm hanging up. -Sure,goodbye.

413
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,600
Stand there.

414
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,880
Uncle De,it's been a long time.

415
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,280
You come to this cold place.

416
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,640
Can your body withstand it?

417
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,330
I'm afraid you will faint when you're emotional.

418
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,760
You don't sound like yourself.

419
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,820
Did you bring the item?

420
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:28,800
Of course.
