1
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,500
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 55

3
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,460
Did you bring the item?

4
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,320
Of course.

5
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,840
You know him,right?

6
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,880
The famous Uncle De known for his high morality...

7
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,020
...and great reputation.

8
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,080
I have heard about you before.

9
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,340
Why is he known as Uncle De?

10
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,400
The reason behind this is very important.

11
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,880
When Zhuang Rui and I were learning to examine the stone,...

12
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,570
...Uncle De taught us that stone represents 5 morality,...

13
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,880
...benevolence,righteousness, wisdom,bravery and purity.

14
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,480
But after some thinking,...

15
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,960
...I find that Uncle De has... ...nothing to do with any of these words.

16
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,090
Then,why is he still known as Uncle De?

17
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,290
After that,I finally understand.

18
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,840
When choosing names,people use it to cover missing attributes.

19
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,079
If you have no fire,add fire. If you have no water,add water.

20
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,680
If you have no morality.....

21
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,440
Uncle De,I'm tactless.

22
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,320
Don't be upset with me.

23
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,460
It's all right. You're right.

24
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,840
The world lacks earthquakes and typhoons,so they add them.

25
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,120
Both of you,go out.

26
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,320
How is it? Do you finally believe me?

27
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,130
I come to inform you that...

28
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,040
...once Uncle De obtains the stone,...

29
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,880
...he will let you go.

30
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,080
Actually,...

31
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,060
...both of us know that...

32
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,760
...Uncle De will not release me.

33
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,510
He just wants to use me as the bait...

34
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,800
...to obtain the stone easily.

35
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,080
You're quite clever.

36
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,280
My eyes...

37
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,360
...can look into everything in this world,...

38
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,860
...including human mind.

39
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,120
Then,help me to look into...

40
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,640
...my mind.

41
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,130
You're thinking...

42
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,340
...whether your partnership with Uncle De will last long.

43
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,840
Will you become the next Qin Haoran?

44
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,100
You're afraid.

45
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Ridiculous.

46
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,890
You like the relics from China.

47
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,080
Have you heard of a saying that goes,...

48
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,220
...when the birds are gone, the bow is kept away.

49
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,170
When the rabbit dies, the hunting dog is cooked instead.

50
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,060
You don't know?

51
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,460
I'll explain it to you.

52
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,160
For Ma Tengfeng,...

53
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,980
...it's better that his partner is of a lower rank than him.

54
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,120
The person must also talk less...

55
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,560
...so that when he dies, there will be no one to testify.

56
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,560
That will be best.

57
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,800
Keep your mouth shut.

58
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,880
I advise you to watch today's news.

59
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,160
Ukrainian police and China customs seized smuggled cultural relics.

60
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,160
Ukrainian police have contacted Interpol for cross-border arrest.

61
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,320
It is reported that the police...

62
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,650
...have controlled a number of suspects.

63
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,000
The case will be further investigated.

64
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,600
Uncle De, you drink Western drinks now.

65
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,000
It's better to drink tea. It clears blood vessels...

66
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,180
...and prevents heart diseases.

67
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,580
Drinking alcohol will energise you.

68
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,900
That's enough. Let's stop wasting time.

69
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,260
Where is the stone?

70
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,240
1405...

71
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
...9527.

72
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,360
Watch it. Stack them nicely.

73
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,960
How's the situation?

74
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,160
It's fine. We are filling in the truck and preparing to move.

75
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
Really? -Yes.

76
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,840
I'm watching it.

77
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,520
Then,what's with the news?

78
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,549
News? What news?

79
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,440
A number of cultural relics were detained by Chinese customs.

80
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,600
Who's that unlucky person? Don't worry. I'm here.

81
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,680
Okay. That's it.

82
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:02,200
Then,when will you release Zhuang Rui?

83
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,640
I want to let him go now.

84
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,800
But I want to check whether the stone is real or not.

85
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,330
If it's real, I will release him immediately.

86
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,240
But I don't trust you.

87
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,840
Xiaorui! Are you all right?

88
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,520
Why is Xiaofei not here?

89
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,680
He went to rescue him.

90
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,000
You stop my contact with Long Kun...

91
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,840
...and are holding me off.

92
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,280
At the same time,the skilled Xiaofei goes to save him.

93
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,320
Quite good.

94
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,360
I never thought that you will come up with this plan.

95
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,960
However,I'm worried. Xiaofei is alone.

96
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,600
Can he do it?

97
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,800
I took care of Zhuang Rui for many years. I'll keep doing it.

98
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,480
You care about Zhuang Rui but I care more about the stone.

99
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,160
If you want to do anything,do it quick.

100
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,560
Go this way. -Okay. Hang in there.

101
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:36,320
There's someone in front.

102
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,520
This way.

103
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,620
Continue forward.

104
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,320
Hang in there.

105
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,400
Turn left.

106
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,040
Xiaorui,where is Kojima?

107
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,640
Kojima works for Ma Tengfeng and spied on us.

108
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,920
Go straight from here. After that,turn left to leave.

109
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,640
That's the only exit but someone is guarding it.

110
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,800
Xiaorui.

111
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,360
Xiaorui,you cannot use the Golden Eyes anymore.

112
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,020
If you continue,you will die.

113
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,480
14059527. -What do you mean?

114
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,080
Give this number to Feifei.

115
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,200
We will leave together.

116
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,400
You can tell her yourself. -We cannot leave like this.

117
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,880
Wait for me here. I'll come back for you.

118
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,160
How is Zhuang Rui?

119
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,600
You have already planned this.

120
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,760
So,I have sent people to guard him.

121
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,720
I'm asking about his eyes.

122
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,800
The doctor has checked.

123
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,640
His eyes received a strong stimulation...

124
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,160
...and bled.

125
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,000
Then,we have to do change the plan...

126
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,280
...and arrange for the surgery.

127
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,210
Where is Zhuang Rui?

128
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,240
They are well-prepared.

129
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,450
I could not rescue Xiaorui.

130
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,250
The plan failed.

131
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,920
Then,where is Kojima?

132
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,560
Kojima.

133
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,240
Kojima was...

134
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,860
...a spy planted by Ma Tengfeng to be near Nakagawa.

135
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,520
What did you say? -Xiaorui told me this.

136
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,800
No wonder Ma Tengfeng knows our every move.

137
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,839
That cunning old man.

138
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,040
It's useless to talk about this now.

139
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:26,280
Feifei,Xiaorui wants me to tell you this.

140
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,480
14059527.

141
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,280
What does this mean? -I don't know,either.

142
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,840
He couldn't tell me.

143
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,680
He said I must tell you.

144
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,560
1405...

145
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,640
...9527.

146
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,400
1405...

147
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,320
...9527.

148
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,440
1405.

149
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,440
You must not give the stone. Just hold them off.

150
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,920
Distract him? What do you plan to do?

151
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,440
I have ways to find the contact in China.

152
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,600
95.....

153
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,080
Xiaozhao,I have the contact in China for the smuggling.

154
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,000
14059527. Check this number.

155
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,640
Dr. Petrovich has performed a CT scan on the patient.

156
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,960
This is the result. There's not much time left.

157
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,160
The patient was hit by the debris,...

158
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,040
...causing the optic nerves to be compressed and can't focus well.

159
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,170
Objects appear parallel and as 3D interlaced pictures.

160
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,900
This is the reason he has the supernatural ability.

161
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,400
That's right. The magic came from this little debris.

162
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,200
This is our result.

163
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,240
If there is nothing, can we leave now?

164
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,600
Brother De,they want to leave.

165
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,680
Don't be in a rush to leave.

166
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
We invited you here...

167
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,440
...because we recognise...

168
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,360
...your medical skills,...

169
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,720
...especially Dr. Petrovich. We know that you have...

170
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,400
...conducted many brain surgery in the central hospital.

171
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,720
So,we're inviting you to stay...

172
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,160
...and help us.

173
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,160
Why don't you go to the hospital?

174
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,720
What did you bring us here by force?

175
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,920
We needed to protect his privacy.

176
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,040
We still need to trouble you conduct the surgeries.

177
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,040
Surgery? What surgery?

178
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,680
We need your help to remove that little debris from his brain.

179
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,120
I'm afraid we cannot do that.

180
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,360
Why?

181
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,840
We have remove foreign objects from the brain.

182
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,920
But we don't know the structure of this foreign object.

183
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,800
If you insist taking it out, he may die.

184
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,040
Our suggestion is to not do anything temporarily.

185
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,520
I'm sorry. Let me rephrase my request.

186
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,440
I need you to help me to remove that object from his brain.

187
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,000
That's all.

188
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,560
I don't care if he dies.

189
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,480
How can you do this?

190
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,480
I don't care about his life.

191
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,680
Dr. Petrovich is experienced with his judgement.

192
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,920
I have to be responsible for my patient.

193
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,080
Can you do this surgery?

194
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,080
I don't have any experience.

195
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,520
I believe that you can do it.

196
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,480
How long do you need to prepare for the surgery?

197
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,880
The earliest is 3 days.

198
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,960
Only 3 days.

199
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,960
After 3 days,...

200
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,610
...things will be good.

201
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,080
I'll wait...

202
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,120
...for 3 days.

203
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,840
Sister Fei,based on the clue you provided,...

204
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,880
...we have identified the suspect.

205
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,480
The director just ordered to arrest the suspect immediately.

206
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,120
Don't do anything first.

207
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,440
Act once you find out the location of the freight yard.

208
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,760
Do you understand? -Yes. Don't worry.

209
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,090
We will not let these people escape again.

210
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,400
Slowly!

211
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,920
What are you doing? -I'm sorry..

212
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,250
Be careful! -I'm sorry.

213
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,880
Listen! All of you!

214
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,760
If you dare to drop any of these,...

215
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,240
...you will not be able to pay with your life. You hear me?

216
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,920
Hurry!

217
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,840
Gently! Hurry!

218
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,840
Gently! Put that over there. Hurry!

219
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,880
Be careful!

220
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,200
Move in!

221
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,610
The police are here!

222
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,360
Freeze! Bring them away.

223
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,680
Freeze!

224
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,480
Hurry!

225
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,400
Don't move!

226
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,440
Officer Zhao, are you all right?

227
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,400
It's nothing. It's only a small wound.

228
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,600
How's the situation outside? -Everything's under control.

229
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,120
Take him away. -Yes. Move!

230
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,000
The Chinese freight yard has been contacted.

231
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,480
There's a small mistake...

232
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,200
...but it's been settled.

233
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,360
Chinese and Ugandan police are aware of this shipment.

234
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,280
Peng Fei failed to rescue him. He will not let this be.

235
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,760
I have sent my men to the hospital.

236
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,480
I'll go there personally when the freights are being unloaded.

237
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,920
Don't worry.

238
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,160
How's the situation?

239
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,040
Long Kun's warehouse is emptied. Xiaorui has been moved.

240
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,520
We found this inside.

241
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,000
This is bad. They have scanned Xiaorui's brain.

242
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,420
They must have moved him for the surgery.

243
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,680
Where are you going?

244
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,560
Even if I must go to all hospitals in Kiev,...

245
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,760
...I must rescue Xiaorui! -Xiaoyun.

246
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,640
Calm down.

247
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,120
They move quickly because they worry we will find him.

248
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,840
So,they hid themselves.

249
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,240
If you act impulsively, you won't find Xiaorui...

250
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,680
...and may be caught,too. -Then,what should we do now?

251
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,080
Do we just wait?

252
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,100
When Zhuang Rui gave up on the rescue,...

253
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,920
...he asked Peng Fei to tell me some numbers...

254
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,040
...so we can find clues about the relics.

255
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,680
He knew that it's dangerous but he still did it.

256
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,960
Will you disappoint him?

257
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,400
No,we cannot give up on Xiaorui.

258
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,520
I cannot do it.

259
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,810
Only by taking in the relics...

260
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,580
...and arresting Long Kun...

261
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,530
...that we can save Zhuang Rui.

262
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,520
You're awake.

263
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,020
You have suffered these few days.

264
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,960
The doctor said that you overexerted your eyes...

265
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,200
...and hurt your optic nerves.

266
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,640
So,the side effects appear.

267
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,960
How is it? Are you better now? How do you feel?

268
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,880
Here,I peeled an apple for you.

269
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,120
Take a bite.

270
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,960
Don't worry.

271
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,560
Peng Fei has escaped.

272
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,600
I didn't hurt Xiaoyun or Feifei either.

273
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,240
After all, they just want to rescue.

274
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,380
I didn't come to Kiev for their lives.

275
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:20,960
I came here for that thing in your brain.

276
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,760
Eat up. -You won't obtain the Golden Eyes.

277
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,080
This is not for you to decide.

278
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,480
Even if you obtain the stone, you won't obtain the Golden Eyes.

279
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,360
Why?

280
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,400
That year,...

281
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,680
...Nakagawa Yohei met with the explosion of the generator.

282
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,280
Initially,I thought this has nothing to do...

283
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,640
...with the Golden Eyes.

284
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,450
After that,I thought about it.

285
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,760
When Feng Quan was hit by the meteorite,...

286
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,440
...it was a stormy night.

287
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,520
Feng Quan was struck by lightning.

288
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,520
Then,when you were attacked...

289
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,920
...in the pawn shop,...

290
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,720
...you were also...

291
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,760
...electrocuted.

292
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,880
This means that if someone obtains the stone...

293
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,080
...and allows electricity to stimulate...

294
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,640
...the stone in the brain, he will have supernatural ability.

295
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,400
Am I right?

296
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,240
Well,if you were willing to cooperate with me,...

297
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:16,480
...we can work together.

298
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,440
You will not be lying here...

299
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,680
...and waiting to die.

300
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,180
Working together?

301
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,650
With the person who killed my 2 grandfathers?

302
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,640
I know...

303
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,720
...that you are still upset about this.

304
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,560
Everyone will do the same thing.

305
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,880
All these years, I've been thinking.

306
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,280
Will I have any regret?

307
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,260
I have killed someone.

308
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,480
Will I be afraid?

309
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,080
That's before I met you, Zhuang Rui.

310
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,280
You are similar to your grandfather,Zhuang Qiming.

311
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,360
Smart,humble...

312
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,720
...and kind.

313
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,040
When I see you, it's like looking at him.

314
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,400
This feeling tortures me.

315
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,200
It's so painful that..... -Stop it!

316
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,160
You disgust me.

317
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,200
If you have a little shame...

318
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,800
...and regret,...

319
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,020
...you will not kill Grandfather Gu.

320
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,320
You are like me.

321
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,680
Don't forget that when you graduated...

322
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,440
...and wanted to succeed in this society,...

323
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,560
...you hurt yourself in the process.

324
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,720
You are just like me back then.

325
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,440
Living in a small village in the desert,...

326
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,040
...a young man...

327
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,630
...who doesn't know his father...

328
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,320
...and doesn't have any hope for the future.

329
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,630
When I chance upon that opportunity,...

330
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,480
...I did what I had to.

331
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,960
If not,I will never change my life.

332
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,340
In order to change my life,...

333
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,440
...I will not sacrifice...

334
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,080
...the lives of others.

335
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,969
That Uncle De in the past will not do it.

336
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,400
The Uncle De I know will not even do it.

337
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,760
That's because you have the Golden Eyes.

338
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,840
You have what the whole world wants.

339
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,280
If not,you will be like me.

340
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,200
You will be like me and find any ways. You will...

341
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,280
...commit bad deeds.

342
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,810
I'm different from you.

343
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,240
I gave you a chance...

344
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,960
...but you rejected me.

345
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,240
After you rejected me,...

346
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:58,200
...you forced me to let go of all my shame.

347
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,200
Prepare for the surgery. Start immediately.

348
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,200
It's finally here.

349
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,840
Truck.

350
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,840
Drive it here.

351
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,800
Feifei.

352
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,440
They have left,but I found this in the rubbish bin...

353
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,960
...in Long Kun's office.

354
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,520
Zhao. -Sister.

355
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,040
We have managed to hold the freight.

356
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,320
It's really full of relics.

357
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,400
I have contacted Professor Meng to verify them.

358
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,560
Good.

359
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,360
But we do not have all the relics.

360
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,760
What should we do next?

361
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,080
Follow the transporters to Kiev.

362
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,200
They will send someone there.

363
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,120
When Long Kun arrives, I'll contact the police.

364
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,520
We'll bring him down.

365
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,020
Yes,I understand.

366
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,240
Where is Shou Zi? Why is he not here?

367
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,520
My brother has things to do.

368
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,730
Just tell me if you have anything. I'm his cousin.

369
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,880
Cousin?

370
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,400
Yes. My brother informed me that once the freight arrives,...

371
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,460
...I'll give you the items. If not,it's too dangerous.

372
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,480
You work hard. It's good.

373
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:16,000
How is Shou Zi's father?

374
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,680
He is fine.

375
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,000
Shou Zi's parents died a long time ago.

376
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,480
You're a police.

377
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,120
It's bad. Xiaozhao cover was blown.

378
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,760
Freeze!

379
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,360
Tell me. Where is Zhuang Rui?

380
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,280
Zhuang Rui is in Sheng Ai Hospital.

381
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,520
You can prepare to collect his body.

382
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,560
He will die for sure. -Long Kun's men are arrested.

383
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,460
You'll handle this. We're going. -Sure.

384
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:05,240
The doctor said that this object...

385
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,280
...in your brain is fused with your cranial nerves.

386
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,680
If we want to completely remove it,...

387
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,440
...you have to take the risk.

388
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,320
I was thinking,...

389
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,560
...without the Golden Eyes, what will you become?

390
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,160
Without the Golden Eyes,...

391
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,840
...I'm still Zhuang Rui.
