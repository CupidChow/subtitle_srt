1
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,800
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,800
Episode 3

3
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,560
We buy and sell rare goods.

4
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,160
Take a look.

5
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,440
What are you looking at? -This plate is not bad.

6
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,360
Boss,is this plate for sale?

7
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,600
Is it this plate? -No,I meant this one.

8
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,000
Brother,you have great taste.

9
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,960
This is the most precious item at my stall.

10
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,080
It's one of the five kilns from Song Dynasty,...

11
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,760
...a plate of Ge Kiln. -Is it Ge Kiln?

12
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,720
How much is it?

13
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,920
You two should have RMB800,000,don't you?

14
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,240
Did you say RMB800,000? It's fine. It's too expensive.

15
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,280
We don't want it.

16
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,480
It's all golden-wired cracks on this plate.

17
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,600
It's not ice cracks.

18
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,370
Among all the Ge kilns, it's not considered as precious.

19
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,040
Why not you charge us for RMB500,000? Is that alright?

20
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,400
No. Brother,you know quite a lot.

21
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,320
Since you know, you should understand.

22
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,480
Although this ceramic plate isn't the most precious of Ge kilns,...

23
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,610
...it's the treasure of my stall. It's not even for sale.

24
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,480
If you aren't lucky, I won't even show you this.

25
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,079
Let's drop it. Let's go.

26
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,520
RMB550,000.

27
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,200
Do you really want it? Add a little more if you want.

28
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,260
59. That's my lucky number. Coincidentally,I'm 59 this year.

29
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,960
Can he be trusted?

30
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,600
I've searched online before. Ge kilns...

31
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,680
...are normally priced from RMB700,000 to 4,000,000.

32
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,470
If this is authentic,...

33
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,320
...we'll earn a lot. -RMB700,000-4,000,000.

34
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,600
We'll take it. -Are you taking it?

35
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,080
Yes,we are. -Take it.

36
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,360
What do you two think?

37
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,600
We bought this plate for RMB590,000.

38
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,440
We aren't greedy. We can sell it for RMB700,000-800,000.

39
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,120
This.....

40
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,240
How did you notice? Was it based on your instinct?

41
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,160
Zhuang Rui,you studied history for 4 years at Kyoto University.

42
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,520
You even stayed at Ling He Pawn Shop for a year.

43
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,120
How can you make such an unforgivable mistake?

44
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,730
Isn't this something historical?

45
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,400
It is historical. But its history is fluid.

46
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,890
What does this mean?

47
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,920
Look closely at this part in the middle.

48
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,040
It's an authentic Ge Kiln from Song Dynasty. There's no problem.

49
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,320
As for the sides,they should be from other generations.

50
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,200
What generation is it? -Whatever generation.

51
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,120
Do you mean that this is mixed?

52
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,980
There are a lot of things like this at the antique house.

53
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,450
They look for some real parts, and some fake ones.

54
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,520
Then they combined them.

55
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,500
Humans are patient. Normal people can't tell the difference.

56
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,680
It's especially for cheating people who only knows a bit,...

57
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,740
...but behave arrogantly like you. -What do we do then?

58
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,410
No,we must find that person and return it.

59
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,720
I've told you since that day when we were selling gourds.

60
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,200
The rule with antiques is to be settled after goods are delivered.

61
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,920
If you're incapable and you didn't look properly,...

62
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
...you must take the consequences.

63
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,640
Just take it as a lesson.

64
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,140
Isn't this lesson too expensive?

65
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,560
You won't remember if it's not. -That's true.

66
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,720
This time,there's no one else to blame but ourselves.

67
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,330
We weren't skilled enough.

68
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,400
But,don't worry. Once I've finished reading this book,...

69
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,330
...then,we'll make another trip to the antique market.

70
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:02,280
That's great. Study well then.

71
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,370
Eat more. Don't tire yourself out.

72
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,640
What do you think of our.....

73
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,770
We agreed on not eating instant noodles anymore.

74
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,440
Who'd have known we'll fail in such a short time.

75
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,400
It's Uncle De.

76
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,120
Uncle De.

77
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,920
There's a mini private auction...

78
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,320
...tonight at Panjiayuan. -Did you say auction?

79
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,090
You can go and try your judging skills.

80
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,770
They have this kind of activities once in every week.

81
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,200
This is the best chance to use the theories practically.

82
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,970
But remember one thing.

83
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,290
Listen and look more. Talk less and don't buy things.

84
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,060
Alright,Uncle De.

85
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,200
Auction.

86
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,120
I've said it before. When there's a will there's way.

87
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,960
This is our chance.

88
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,180
Why are you still eating instant noodles? Let's go.

89
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,540
Where are we going?

90
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,780
We're going to earn money.

91
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,160
Let's go.

92
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,720
Everyone has seen the items just now. Let's not talk much...

93
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,240
...and start the auction.

94
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,400
Jade Tiger with golden rims.

95
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,240
From RMB280,0000, you may start bidding.

96
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,740
RMB380,000 for me. -It's bid at RMB380,000.

97
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,720
RMB450,000. -It's bid at RMB450,000.

98
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,360
RMB500,000 for me. -It's bid at RMB500,000.

99
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,740
What do you think of this item?

100
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,160
It looks real,but there are marks of repairing.

101
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,720
It's around this price. -It is sold at RMB500,000.

102
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,330
It's a deal. Congratulations, Boss Chen. The item is yours.

103
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,320
I got it. After I bring this item home,I'll be rich.

104
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,730
You're good. You didn't read for nothing.

105
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,650
Come,place it here.

106
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,560
The portrait of Li Duanduan by Ming Dynasty's artist,Tang Bohu.

107
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,400
The starting price is RMB12,000. Although this drawing isn't...

108
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,840
...from Tang Yin,it's an imitation from Qing Dynasty.

109
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,440
The drawing is not bad. It's worth keeping.

110
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,440
Boss Liu,the weather is cold. Don't waste our time.

111
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,400
Hurry up and show us the next one.

112
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,600
That's right.

113
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,320
Alright. Since everyone is not interested,...

114
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,800
...we'll look at the next one. The next one is.....

115
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,560
I want this drawing.

116
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,400
Is this boss interested?

117
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,800
Yes. But RMB12,000 is too expensive.

118
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,680
Can I have it for RMB9,000? -This boss looks unfamiliar.

119
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,840
We're at a private auction, not some street stall.

120
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,220
There's no such rule for bargaining.

121
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,240
The price only goes up here. It doesn't go down.

122
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,680
If you really like it, you can add more to the price.

123
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,320
Didn't Uncle De say that we can't buy anything?

124
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,400
I'll only buy this one.

125
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,490
You still want to buy. We don't have the money.

126
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,640
Boss,if this thing doesn't get sold,it'll be a loss to you.

127
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,280
Why not you make it cheaper and sell it to me?

128
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,880
They said it's a fake. Why did you buy it?

129
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,900
Have you thought about it?

130
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,740
Boss,if you want to buy something to make you happy,...

131
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,620
...go out and turn right,there are a few street stalls for you.

132
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,840
RMB12,000 is a fixed price for this drawing.

133
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,600
If you really like it,...

134
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,280
...why not you add more to it?

135
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,200
I think you're a bit too much.

136
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,040
It's good this young man likes things that are left...

137
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,640
...by our ancestors.

138
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,370
Little brat,...

139
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,960
...do you only need RMB3,000 more?

140
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,280
Alright.

141
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,730
Thank you,Boss Ma. You're such a good person.

142
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,970
Is he? He's causing troubles. -Is it Xiao Zhuang?

143
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,520
Call me Brother Ma from now. By the way,...

144
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,600
...you did nothing for the night. Why did you choose the drawing?

145
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,640
It's quite impossible to...

146
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,200
...buy a real drawing for RMB12,000. Also,...

147
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,610
...its value surely won't increase much.

148
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,960
But it's fine. You're new.

149
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,250
It's not bad to pay for the good drawing,isn't it?

150
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,520
Boss Ma,no. Brother Ma, do you have time?

151
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,760
Why is that? -Come to my teacher's house.

152
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,000
Uncle De,he insisted on buying. I couldn't stop him.

153
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,800
This portrait is drawn well.

154
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,760
The portrait of Li Duanduan.

155
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,880
It's by Tang Yin,Tang Bohu.

156
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,920
Even the title and writings...

157
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,080
...look like Tang Bohu's style.

158
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,200
The writings are... ...great. This is not bad.

159
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,520
Then,do you mean that.....

160
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,840
Is this authentic?

161
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,160
This drawing has a major mistake.

162
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,440
This paper is not right.

163
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,400
This paper is an imitation made before the Qianlong Years.

164
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,640
It's made of leather, so the paper is thicker.

165
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,840
Picture mounting shops in the past like to use this kind of paper.

166
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,040
Also,this must be a 20-foot-paper cut in half.

167
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,080
Or else it'll have "Qing Qianlong Imitation of...

168
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,130
...Chengxintang" stamped at the corner on the back.

169
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,920
It must have been a few hundred years if it's from Qianlong Years.

170
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,760
This..... -Yes. It's an imitation from then.

171
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,880
Isn't it still fake? I told you not to buy. It's fake.

172
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,840
What made you buy this piece of drawing?

173
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,200
I don't know if Uncle De saw this part.

174
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,930
You even noticed this part.

175
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,840
The mounting is very weird. I noticed it by accident.

176
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,840
Why are you two being mysterious?

177
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,480
Don't tell me there's still something interesting in here.

178
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,920
We don't know that yet.

179
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,880
You two can have some tea first. Wait for me.

180
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,500
The truth will be revealed immediately.

181
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,400
I totally don't understand.

182
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,600
What's going on?

183
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,450
No,I'm dizzy after listening.

184
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,920
This.....

185
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,560
It should be a scroll.

186
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,740
What's wrong with the scroll?

187
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,970
Based on what I know,...

188
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,650
...this type of mounting skill...

189
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,640
...is from the time before Yangzhou,Suzhou,the borders...

190
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,120
...Shanghai or other similar places gained their freedom.

191
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,680
It's called the Protection of Fangguzhuang.

192
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,720
It's used for calligraphist, artists and collectors...

193
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,580
...to mount their precious writings and drawings.

194
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,800
It's weird that a fake is mounted with...

195
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,680
...this kind of mounting. This is why I bought it.

196
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,320
I also want to show it to Uncle De.

197
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,480
What happens then? -So I bought it.

198
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:05,829
You.....

199
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,320
How is it? Did you get anything? -I got it.

200
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,960
My boss has long legs. Boss,your skills is incredible.

201
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,140
Even I want to crop it out and make it my screensaver.

202
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,560
Stop being annoying.

203
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,560
I'm asking if you got any useful information?

204
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,920
Nope. Look at this car. It's too far away from the CCTV.

205
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,360
Nothing can be seen. Also,...

206
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,160
...the only thing seen is the car plate. I checked. It's fake.

207
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,920
The expert has said that

208
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,560
this isn’t worth much.

209
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,120
How dare they attack the police because of this?

210
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,940
Do you think that there's some special function...

211
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,640
...that can turn people into X-Men or Spiderman?

212
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,360
You watched too many movies.

213
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,200
It's true. If it has some special function,...

214
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,680
...we would have caught them with our special abilities.

215
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,320
Why do we have to stay here and look at CCTV recordings?

216
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:35,920
Play back.

217
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,680
Stop.

218
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,520
There's something. -What is it?

219
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,770
Do you want to escape from the police? It's not that easy.

220
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,160
The last order.

221
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,010
Hello,I'm a police office.

222
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,920
The camera in this car of yours...

223
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,960
...may have captured some vital information about the suspects.

224
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,760
Can you give me a copy of the recording to assist us?

225
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,880
Alright. I'll give it to you.

226
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,960
How did this become 2 copies?

227
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,600
Yes.

228
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,200
The glory of Tang Bohu on top is interesting,...

229
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,320
...but you know there's nothing by looking at the paper.

230
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,400
It's a fake. But the one underneath is totally different.

231
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,160
The touch is amazingly clean. The writings are energetic too.

232
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,040
Look at its clothes,people and rocks. They look so vivid.

233
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,160
Old man,do you mean that the fake one is above this real one?

234
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,880
This is authentic.

235
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,880
Didn't Zhuang Rui say it just now? The mounting is weird.

236
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,560
So I flipped the drawing on top. Then the authentic one appeared.

237
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,640
Zhuang Rui,you're incredible!

238
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,400
Oh my goodness. Brother, you picked up such a loophole.

239
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,640
You're really amazing.

240
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,640
Zhuang Rui,you used all your money to buy this drawing.

241
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,440
Did you realise anything?

242
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,090
Yes. I noticed the mounting style.

243
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,280
Because the book that you gave me mentioned that...

244
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,560
...people used this kind of mounting style to protect...

245
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,360
...precious drawings during the period of war.

246
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,290
They placed the fake drawings on top of the real ones.

247
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,160
So,I bought it to confirm my thoughts with you.

248
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,040
Learn and use knowledge flexibly. Infer points from a single idea.

249
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,240
Act with charm when you're supposed to. This is not bad.

250
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,380
This is really not bad. -Uncle De,...

251
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,520
...how much is this drawing worth then?

252
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,400
It depends.

253
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,480
Years of auctions have failed to notice Tang Bohu's work.

254
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,400
The price should be from millions onwards.

255
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,840
How much? Did you say millions?

256
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,600
Millions!

257
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,060
Zhuang Rui,...

258
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,960
...God has heard my thoughts. What did I say before?

259
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,130
When there's a will, there's a way.

260
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,760
Millions! 10 million!

261
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,720
Increase the price! -Move.

262
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,050
Brother,...

263
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,520
...I'll pay RMB15 million for this drawing.

264
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,480
Sounds fair to me.

265
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,850
Alright. Thank you.

266
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,200
If you think it's too little, I'll add more for you.

267
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,020
Brother Ma,...

268
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,200
...if you want this drawing,...

269
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,640
...I'll sell it to you for RMB5 million.

270
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,160
Did you say RMB5 million?

271
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,080
When I bought this drawing, you gave me RMB3,000.

272
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,240
Hence,part of this drawing belongs to you.

273
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,640
Don't. I gave you the money. It's different.

274
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,960
If you weren't there, I may not get this drawing.

275
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,520
Hence,take it as how I thank you.

276
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,160
Brother,this is a big favour.

277
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,000
It's hard to see brats like this nowadays.

278
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,000
You're realistic and reasonable. Alright. I'll accept this favour.

279
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,280
If you need Brother Ma's help for anything,...

280
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,920
...I'll be ready anytime. Tell me your account number.

281
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,080
I'll transfer the money to you. -About that.....

282
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,810
Let me tell you. I know. -No,...

283
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,850
...is it the same for the two of you?

284
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,970
Come here. Sit down and have a chat.

285
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,280
The brat is loyal.

286
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,480
It's not bad.

287
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,140
You're not greedy for money and loyal. I like it.

288
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,080
I didn't notice such details about the mounting style.

289
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,240
You noticed it.

290
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,880
Your eyes are good.

291
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,640
You're really lucky.

292
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,880
It's only been half a month, and you found 2 loopholes.

293
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,300
It's not too much to say you're the second Feng Quan.

294
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,560
I sent the chubby guy away. We'll get RMB5 million.

295
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,360
It supposed to be RMB15 million.

296
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,480
Uncle De,who's Feng Quan?

297
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,200
Didn't Pu Song Ling mention someone...

298
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,760
...called Feng Quan in a story he wrote in the Strange Tales?

299
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,170
He accidentally saved a Trionychidae Fairy.

300
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,640
To repay the debt of gratitude, this Trionychidae Fairy...

301
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,960
...gave Feng Quan a pair of magical eyes that...

302
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,600
...can see all the details and recognise all the treasures.

303
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,400
Since then he's been enjoying his life.

304
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,220
Then Uncle De is right. You're the second Feng Quan.

305
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,440
You won't take long to be better than your teacher.

306
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,850
Thank you,Uncle De. -Thank you,Uncle De.

307
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,400
Did you really save some Trionychidae Fairy?

308
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,920
Do you have a gift now?

309
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,880
What about Trionychidae Fairy and gift? There's no such thing.

310
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,340
Then how did you notice...

311
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,940
...the gourd that day and the drawing today?

312
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,010
They're both based on my instinct.

313
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,440
Do you know that I study medicine? I'm materialistic.

314
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,400
Do you know materialism? Talk about Trionychidae Fairy.

315
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,160
Animals can't become fairy.

316
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,160
But I think that...

317
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,320
...you can't be compared with that Feng Quan.

318
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,400
You're more incredible than him. We don't need all those... ...magical support.

319
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,400
We still can find loopholes and earn.

320
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,160
To me,you're the most incredible god.

321
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,040
Didn't Uncle De say that it's fake? It's a novel.

322
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,290
It can't be trusted.

323
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,120
We're rich people now.

324
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,000
We must learn to be arrogant appropriately.

325
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,050
It's only an ancient. Look at how anxious you are.

326
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,040
Forget it. I'll... ...buy equipment and play games on my own.

327
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,080
It feels good to be rich.

328
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,840
I'm having my wedding at Gansu next week. Come if you're free.

329
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,240
Gansu.

330
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,570
Boss,...

331
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,850
...you haven't eaten, have you? Come.

332
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,240
What are you looking at? It's Chinese Doughnuts.

333
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,010
Do you know this?

334
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,020
It's sweet. It's really nice.

335
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,770
My girlfriend is from Gansu. Her mum often sends it to us.

336
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,160
That's right.

337
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,000
I found it from the recording of the car at the opposite side.

338
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,800
Do you mean that this gang of people is from Gansu?

339
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,800
By the way,call the Academy of Social Sciences and ask if...

340
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,500
...they sent an archaeologist team from Gansu.

341
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,880
Noted. -Wait.

342
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,720
Come,have some yoghurt drink. -Thank you.

343
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,560
The money from Brother Ma has been transferred.

344
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,320
Aren't you a capable finance manager? You'll handle the money.

345
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,040
Don't worry. I'll surely be your useful helper.

346
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,460
Don't do sharing economy anymore this time.

347
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,480
I have this. Why do I need to do that? Am I right?

348
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,720
By the way,I'm going to Gansu this time.

349
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,240
Why are you going to Gansu?

350
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,560
My classmate is getting married. He asked me to go and visit.

351
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,890
Did you say classmate? Is it a guy or a girl?

352
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,200
He was my dorm's big brother.

353
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,320
Do you want to join? -Is it Gansu?

354
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,320
I'm not interested. You can go ahead on your own.

355
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,380
I'll stay at home and guard the house.

356
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,200
That'll do.

357
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,890
What are you looking at?

358
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,290
I want to buy a hiking backpack.

359
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,440
After I finished,I want to look at the specs and compare.

360
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,800
Why are you comparing?

361
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,040
We're rich people. Choose the most expensive one.

362
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,210
The most expensive one.

363
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,400
Who's that?

364
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,560
Hello. -Hi there,is this Mr. Zhuang?

365
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,360
Who is this? -Do you remember the...

366
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,200
...San He Liu Cricket Gourd?

367
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,760
The one with RMB800,000 luxurious car.

368
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,240
Ms. Guo Guo.

369
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,060
Please have a seat.

370
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,970
About that.....

371
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,880
Qin Xuan Bing.

372
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,400
Hello,Ms. Qin.

373
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,050
I've asked you out this time...

374
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,220
...to thank you on the cricket you gave me last time.

375
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,160
I like it a lot. Thank you.

376
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,680
It's not an expensive gift. It's so much worse than the gourd.

377
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,900
Actually,I don't know much about antiques.

378
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,760
But the cricket reminded me a lot about the past.

379
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,160
My father gave me a cricket when I was young.

380
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,680
It was summer that year when he took the meal worms with me,...

381
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,640
...fed it and played with it. We listened to it.

382
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,690
It's the most beautiful gift I've ever received.

383
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,320
This is the right gift then. -A cricket.

384
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,640
Did you make this?

385
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,880
Crickets are also called '100-day-insect'.

386
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,280
Their lives are short. They can't live past Winter Solstice.

387
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,980
But the joy that crickets bring to people...

388
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,240
...will always stay.

389
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,920
Thank you. I will keep it properly.

390
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,120
Ms. Qin,would you like to have a drink?

391
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,600
It's not early now. Let's return.

392
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,540
Let me send you.

393
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,200
You must have driven here yourself.

394
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,600
No,actually I don't live far.

395
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,810
I'm staying at the hotel apartment opposite.

396
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,000
You.....

397
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,460
Why don't you speak first? -Are you studying antiques?

398
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,560
The San He Liu Gourd was wrapped around so thickly.

399
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,840
But you could tell. -I'm a history student.

400
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,920
I worked in a pawn shop for a year.

401
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:12,670
What about you? -I'm learning jewellery design.

402
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,320
Is it about diamonds?

403
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,920
And some jades and emeralds too.

404
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:21,630
Then you can be counted as half-involved in antiques.

405
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,080
Nope.

406
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,670
My workshop is in front. Why not have some coffee there?

407
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,670
Sure. Are we drinking coffee again?

408
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,320
Bing Bing,...

409
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,150
...where have you been? I've been waiting for half a day.

410
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:47,800
Mr. Zhuang gave me a cricket last time.

411
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,840
I want to buy him a cup of coffee to thank him.

412
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,480
Yes,you must thank him.

413
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,480
Let's go. I'll send you back.

414
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,240
It's fine. I have something on in my office. I must return.

415
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,480
Alright. Then let me send Mr. Zhuang back.

416
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,680
I must thank him. I'll leave you. -Alright.

417
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,280
I can walk on my own. -Get in the car.

418
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,680
Get in the car.

419
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,520
Cook's Rose from 2009.

420
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,680
Bing Bing drinks wine from areas involved in champagne production.

421
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,020
Are you interested? If you are, I can give you 2 bottles.

422
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,730
My family and Bingbing's family are friends.

423
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,250
She just came to Beijing. She doesn't have much friends.

424
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,760
Her father has told me to take good care of her.

425
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,560
I wanted her to live at the Quadrangle next to Hu Palace.

426
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,280
Who'd have thought that she has chosen this place.

427
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,740
She said that this place has artistic vibes.

428
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,450
It's only 400-square foot. It must be suffering for her.

429
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,200
Is she used to staying at such a big place alone?

430
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,480
Of course. She has 2 full-time nannies.

431
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,900
And I come and see her every day. Why is she not used to it?

432
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,760
By the way,about the cricket,...

433
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,760
...I want to thank you on behalf of Bing Bing.

434
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,920
We've cleared the debts of our transaction.

435
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,280
There shouldn't be much related after this.

436
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,600
We're here. -How are we here?

437
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,400
There're subway trains,buses, and car sharing services in front.

438
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,090
You can go ahead.

439
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,520
What?

440
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,120
So,you didn't go up,did you?

441
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,680
That's a pity. She offered for you to go.

442
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,720
She invited me to her drawing room. There's nothing else.

443
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,720
I know.

444
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,680
You can be disappointed. But don't be regretful.

445
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,320
They're from the royal family. We're upstarts.

446
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,160
That's right. We're softshell turtles in their eyes.

447
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,440
They won't be nice to you sincerely.

448
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,760
I didn't think that much.

449
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,720
Yes. They're rich.

450
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,280
But they aren't happy. Look. Since they're born,...

451
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,600
...they have everything. They don't feel things anymore.

452
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,320
Even a lousy cricket makes her happy. They're not like us.

453
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,920
Our lives are colourful. There are ups and downs.

454
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,800
Look at what we experienced. It's like a roller coaster ride.

455
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,880
Do you know what are wines from areas that produce champagnes?

456
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,080
Yes. What?

457
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,120
Wines from areas that produce champagnes.

458
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,680
Her friend said that Ms. Qin likes wines from those places.

459
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,000
These ladies are hypocritical.

460
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,320
No,why do you care about her?

461
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,520
You won't see her anymore. Am I right?

462
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,680
By the way,I bought you flight tickets to Gansu.

463
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,680
It's business class, but it's discounted.

464
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,040
You said it yourself. Although we're rich,...

465
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,000
...we can't waste,isn't it?

466
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,250
Zhuang Rui,you can see clearly without glasses now?

467
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,400
I simply brought it up in the chat group. You really came.

468
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,640
I'm taking my visit to your wedding as travelling.

469
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,840
I wanted to hold it at Lanzhou.

470
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,820
But my father insists on coming back to the village.

471
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,640
This is too far away. It's so isolated.

472
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,340
My wife is not willing to come back at all.

473
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,980
It's the old people's tradition. Just give in for a bit.

474
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,880
This is my cousin,Er Mao.

475
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,680
Hello. -Hello.

476
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,440
If I'm busy entertaining relatives these 2 days,...

477
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,300
...ask Er Mao to bring you around.

478
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,360
There's an archaeologist team in the village.

479
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,000
If you're interested,ask Er Mao to bring you and have a look.

480
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,860
After all,you're the only one doing our old job now.

481
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,160
Careful. Make sure it's straight.

482
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,010
Careful. Make it straight. That's right.

483
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,600
Don't let them touch.

484
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,180
Hold on.

485
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,660
What are you in-charge of?

486
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,320
I heard that an archaeologist team...

487
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,720
...were doing some work, I came to see.

488
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:12,520
Kid,how can you come as you like?
