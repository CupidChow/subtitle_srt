1
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,800
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,800
Episode 2

3
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,260
The Great Emperor KangXi.

4
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,560
Pan Family Antique Market

5
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,000
What's wrong? Keep up!

6
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,880
It's so crowded here.

7
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,480
Cheap prices! Come take a look!

8
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,140
They're all good quality.

9
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,160
Take a look.

10
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,240
Name a price. -50.

11
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,680
Brother,what sort of item would you like?

12
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,480
Have a browse.

13
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,390
That's fine. -Please lower the price.

14
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,070
Let's go to another stall? -Boss,are you taking in items?

15
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:22,800
Yes.

16
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
Take a look.

17
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,880
Please go. You should try somewhere else.

18
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,140
I haven't even named my price!

19
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,720
Please don't disrupt my business. Please leave.

20
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,530
Please try somewhere else.

21
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,000
Do you take in items?

22
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,400
I have an exquisite piece. -Sure.

23
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,840
I have better ones of these.

24
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,800
Bing Bing,this shop...

25
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,440
...has some worthy items. Choose whatever you like.

26
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,160
President Xu,you're too kind. You may choose whatever pleases you.

27
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,920
Who is this? -This is Qin Xuan Bing.

28
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,640
Miss Qin.

29
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,040
What items do you like? Jewelry? Decorations?

30
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,360
Calligraphy?

31
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,320
I'll just take a look. Boss,there's no need for special care.

32
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,040
Bing Bing,this is Boss Qian.

33
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,020
He is one of the most prominent shop owners here.

34
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,240
Whoever comes here must give way to him.

35
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,500
What do you mean? We just have to act a little before others.

36
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,760
I'm just President Xu's staff. Not really either.

37
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,480
I am just a piece of cloth in President Xu's home.

38
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,840
Boss Qian loves to tease.

39
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,360
The tea is ready. Let's have some tea first?

40
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,159
What is this? This is an important guest of mine.

41
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,560
Bring my tea leaves. -How impudent of me.

42
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,060
Sorry. Miss Qin,please help yourself. I'll be right back.

43
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,520
I have always heard this was an interesting place.

44
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,760
I have finally witnessed it myself.

45
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,570
You have brought me to several interesting places on this trip.

46
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,520
Thank you.

47
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,680
You're most welcome. As long as you're happy!

48
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,960
Sir,I have a century-old imperial item here.

49
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,330
Are you interested?

50
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,690
We shall see.

51
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,620
Take a look.

52
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
What's the price?

53
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,360
See? He has a good eye.

54
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,930
Please name your price.

55
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,160
RMB 5.

56
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,240
RMB 5?

57
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:24,000
Over here,RMB5 means RMB50,000 right?

58
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,440
This is its worth.

59
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,140
If you think this is worth RMB50,000,...

60
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,480
...that's fine by me.

61
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,440
Are you sure this priceless antique...

62
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,900
...is only worth RMB5?

63
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,240
You must be joking!

64
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,720
That's its worth.

65
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:52,800
Mate,stop joking around.

66
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,520
What about this? How about you try all the stalls here.

67
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,600
If someone names a higher price,...

68
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,920
...I'll pay you double.

69
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,560
Isn't double just RMB10?

70
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,680
Let's go.

71
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,600
Boss,are you selling this?

72
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,440
This? No.

73
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,720
Rearing crickets is my hobby.

74
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,600
However,...

75
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,080
...if you are sincere,...

76
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,080
...what about RMB2,000? -RMB2,000.

77
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,960
What's the matter? We're here to make money,not burn it. Let's go.

78
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,360
This lady feels different from the usual ones you bring.

79
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,680
They were pretty good quality.

80
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,760
However,they were commoner level.

81
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,480
This is pure royalty level.

82
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,840
How can she be the same as the others before?

83
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,840
Previously,those were small toys.

84
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,760
This is the perfect match.

85
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,600
Her family does business overseas.

86
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,680
She's pretty and has a good aura.

87
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,640
She's different from the women I brought here before.

88
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,080
Where's she going?

89
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,120
I'll take a look.

90
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,040
Let's go. -Brother,come.

91
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,120
Don't go.

92
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,240
You're pretty sincere.

93
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,280
You can have it for RMB600. -Alright,RMB5 then?

94
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,040
Deal. -Why do you want this though?

95
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,040
I see historical value in it. -Me too.

96
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,800
I can even see your future.

97
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,480
You're a fool to be cheated off RMB600.

98
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,960
Can you sell this to me?

99
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,600
I'm sorry. He has taken it.

100
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,680
Mate,name a price.

101
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,680
Mr. Zhuang,my friend really likes this item.

102
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,290
However,I know a gentleman shouldn't covet.

103
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,920
I'm willing to pay double the price for this.

104
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,720
This water bottle.

105
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,180
However,I'm not planning to sell it.

106
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,280
Sell it.

107
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,680
That's not it. We just need to settle on a good price. Right?

108
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,880
Alright. Name your price.

109
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,360
RMB5,000?

110
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,560
RMB50,000.

111
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,200
Brother,are you a Leo?

112
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,740
Why are you raining on our parade?

113
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,410
How would anyone be able to handle that price?

114
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,680
I see you have good taste.

115
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,400
Honestly,we have many other fantastic items too.

116
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,240
I have something with me today.

117
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,240
Century old imperial item.

118
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,960
If you're interested,...

119
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,090
...you can have both items.

120
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,080
If both of you agree to buy this,...

121
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,880
...the water bottle will be a complimentary gift. How's that?

122
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,080
So worth it! Right?

123
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,040
You get a good item and a happy lady.

124
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,720
Best of both worlds!

125
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,720
Let me break it down for you.

126
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,330
Everyone benefits if this deal goes through.

127
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,000
Take a step back.

128
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,360
RMB10,000. What about that?

129
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,730
I really have no intention to sell.

130
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,000
Mr. Zhuang,with just ten steps,...

131
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,760
...the moment you leave this place,...

132
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,360
...this would appreciate more than ten times!

133
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,720
If you hesitate,then you'll ruin your chance.

134
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,570
RMB50,000 then.

135
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,160
It's a small sum. It's rare that Bing Bing likes it.

136
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,530
Isn't it just a black water bottle?

137
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,200
This isn't black.

138
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,360
It's red.

139
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,980
Is there something wrong with your eyes?

140
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,560
This is clearly black.

141
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,880
Tell me. How is it red?

142
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,640
It might really be red.

143
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,820
Uncle De. -Good day,Uncle De.

144
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,920
Uncle De. -Boss Qian.

145
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,920
Long time no see. What brings you to this humble place?

146
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,610
I was strolling. Your business is doing well.

147
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,280
Thanks to you,it's not bad. -That's great!

148
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,040
Let me see.

149
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,140
Who is this?

150
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,340
Uncle De. A senior. History professor at Beijing University.

151
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,560
A prominent person in the circle of restoring artifacts.

152
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,460
Zhuang Rui,...

153
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,240
...it seems you didn't waste one year with Ling He.

154
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,240
Not bad. This bottle doesn't catch one's eye. Even I couldn't see it.

155
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,000
So,do you plan to keep this for yourself?

156
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,960
Or are you planning to sell it? -Uncle De,...

157
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,300
...in that case,name your price.

158
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,960
Uncle De,I'll give it to you if you like it.

159
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,320
That wouldn't do.

160
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,600
If you are willing,...

161
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,200
...I'll give you RMB100,000.

162
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,320
Is this black bottle worth RMB100,000?

163
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,960
This isn't black. It's red.

164
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,520
I'm sorry. Am I colour blind?

165
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,890
Or can't you discern black and red?

166
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,960
Uncle De,according to you,this is a priceless item.

167
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,440
Zhuang Rui,do you want to clean it?

168
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,160
I'll listen to you. -Alright,I'll help make the call.

169
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,880
Boss Qian,please lend me tung oil and the finest gauze.

170
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,490
Alright.

171
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,160
You do it. -Please,after you.

172
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,360
Isn't this the San He Liu?

173
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:07,040
Zhuang Rui,how did you see it from the start?

174
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,880
Just a gut feeling. It's very similar to the hand piece... ...you gave me.

175
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,069
That means both items are nearly the same age.

176
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:22,200
They're from the late Guangxu period.

177
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:29,920
Boss Qian,do you want to have a look? Hold it yourself.

178
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,840
All right.

179
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,960
All right!

180
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,800
This young man...

181
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,080
...has a good eye!

182
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,650
That's why I said RMB100,000 is cheap.

183
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,370
In fact,it's a bargain!

184
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,840
A great bargain indeed!

185
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,960
The San He Liu they speak of,what's the history?

186
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,760
Boss Qian,please explain to Bing Bing.

187
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,360
What's San He Liu? -This.....

188
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,080
Uncle De is here. He's the best among us all.

189
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,840
He must be the one to explain. -Alright.

190
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,570
This cricket and the bottle...

191
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,000
...used to be a toy for the royal family.

192
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,440
After that,it reached the commoners.

193
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,400
San He Liu was the pioneer crafter.

194
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,080
The nobles' version was called the Guan Mo Zi.

195
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,080
But San He Liu's work was different.

196
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,720
His craftwork was spacious and smooth on the inside.

197
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,560
The crickets chirped in harmony as it was comfortable to live in.

198
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,720
They chirped brightly in unison. This is important. That's it.

199
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,760
I released this precious with just RMB600.

200
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,480
It's too late to turn back now.

201
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,640
Why don't we sell this?

202
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,280
I agreed to give this to Uncle De. -No.

203
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,560
RMB100,000 is already too cheap.

204
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,000
Now that its true identity is revealed.

205
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,160
It costs more than RMB100,000.

206
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,880
I'll take it for RMB300,000.

207
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,960
I'll buy whatever you like.

208
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,280
RMB300,000? That's great!

209
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,240
Uncle De has personally screened this item.

210
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,880
RMB300,000 works.

211
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,520
I'll pay RMB600,000!

212
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,200
I shall take this back with RMB600,000.

213
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,780
You earned a thousand-fold as a middleman. That's enough!

214
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,760
Right? -Yes.

215
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,650
RMB800,000.

216
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,560
RMB800,000? RMB800,000 is fine.

217
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,860
Are you raising the price?

218
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,880
This is mine today. -Alright.

219
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,280
Bing Bing,...

220
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,800
...I'll buy you whatever you like.

221
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,370
You like that cricket more,right?

222
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,720
What about this? I'll give the cricket to you.

223
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,360
Thank you.

224
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,400
Alright. I'll take my leave then.

225
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,440
See you.

226
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,560
Take care.

227
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,520
Even my home isn't as expensive as the home of that cricket.

228
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,840
Uncle De,the water bottle we bought for RMB600...

229
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,400
...was sold for a handsome price.

230
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,200
Should we compensate the owner?

231
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,960
In artifacts trading,the rules have never changed.

232
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,880
It comes and goes.

233
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,040
Misjudgment and sudden rewards aren't rare. Don't think too much.

234
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,880
That's right. -Press on!

235
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,130
Alright. -Uncle De.

236
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,410
I have something good here.

237
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,600
Century old artifact. Age assured.

238
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,040
Please take a look,will you?

239
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,560
That's good.

240
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,080
Keep it for yourself.

241
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,290
How much is it worth?

242
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,410
Not even as much as the cricket.

243
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,200
Don't forget to charge them.

244
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,880
1,10,100,1,000.

245
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,280
1,10,100,1,000,10,000. -No.

246
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,320
100,000. 1,000,000.

247
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,820
That's wrong. You started after splitting.

248
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,040
Start from here.

249
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,200
1,10,100,1,000,10,000,100,000.

250
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,520
One more time. 1,10,100,1,000,10,000,100,000.

251
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,320
Zhuang Rui,we'll be rich from now on.

252
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,640
Alright. Calm down. -You're right.

253
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,720
We're rich now. Have to keep a low profile.

254
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,160
Eat something nice tonight.

255
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,240
Of course! -Let's go.

256
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,160
Let's buy a motorcycle. -What?

257
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,970
Let's buy a motorcycle.

258
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,240
A motorcycle? Is that appropriate?

259
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,000
Two then.

260
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,320
It should be a car. A special car. A luxurious one.

261
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,490
Let's go. -Luxurious cars are expensive.

262
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,360
Tell me.

263
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,000
How did you identify the bottle?

264
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,840
Just a gut feeling.

265
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,860
If that's the case,...

266
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,960
...you have learned a lot from Ling He Pawn Shop...

267
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,820
...and Beijing University's history department.

268
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,860
That's not right. If you're this brilliant,...

269
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,240
...why were you so pitiful before? -I.....

270
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,490
It seems it's because of me.

271
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,560
If I didn't force you there,...

272
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,490
...you wouldn't even get to see it. Right?

273
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,360
So,I'm your lucky charm.

274
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,570
You should treat me better.

275
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,480
It's here!

276
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:31,900
I'm coming!

277
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,160
Good day. Your delivery is here.

278
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,860
Thank you. -Thank you.

279
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,480
How much did you order?

280
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,800
I ordered a few bottles of beer. Specially brewed.

281
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,260
A full meal should be complemented with a good round of drinks.

282
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,850
You don't drink anyway.

283
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,120
I'm glad.

284
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,770
I should post a picture.

285
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,680
There's so much food.

286
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,920
"RMB200,000 has been transferred to your account ending with 8032"

287
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,080
Zhuang Rui,why did.....

288
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,120
Didn't you say that we can pay off the rent...

289
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,760
...and the debt since we're rich?

290
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,560
Then everything will be alright? I have paid them.

291
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,360
But this is yours. I can't take it.

292
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,960
There's no you and I.

293
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,320
Didn't you say you were my lucky charm?

294
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,180
You wanted me to treat you better?

295
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,320
I don't have anything to repay you with.

296
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,000
I'll just give the snuff bottle to you.

297
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,720
Snuff bottle?

298
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,040
Old item. -Artifact.

299
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,640
Age assured!

300
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,880
It's funny.

301
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,880
They didn't set eyes on the expensive items.

302
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,610
They were fixated on this worn jade piece.

303
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,920
Didn't you always brag about your smartness?

304
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,920
You tell me. What's the deal?

305
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,920
Can you do it?

306
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,880
I'm already done with my soup.

307
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,300
I have another idea. -That's enough.

308
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,800
Your standard is bad.  How do you even run a store at the market?

309
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,360
Let's visit my grandfather.

310
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,720
Your grandfather? -Yes,he's brilliant.

311
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,160
He's a jewel stone specialist.

312
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,720
If he says he ranks second,no one would dare take first place.

313
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,240
But this is evidence. You can't just bring it out.

314
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,760
What about this? Come see me tomorrow.

315
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,320
I'll do some paperwork. We'll go together.

316
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,020
What are you doing?

317
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,290
Why aren't you asleep at this hour?

318
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,340
Zhuang Rui,...

319
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,480
...this isn't a hallucination. It's real.

320
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,240
We really earned RMB800,000.

321
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,320
Let's count together.

322
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,240
Look.

323
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:00,680
1,10,100,...

324
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,400
800000

325
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,340
That's enough. Stop thinking about it. Get some sleep.

326
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,520
Fei Fei,slow down.

327
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,080
As long as we do this properly,we'll definitely earn some.

328
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,040
You wouldn't listen to me. This will work.

329
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,370
I can't do it.

330
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,680
Yes,you can. -No,I can't.

331
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,970
You definitely can.

332
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,680
I really can't see it every time.

333
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,200
You don't have to see it every time.

334
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,200
Once out of ten times will do.

335
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,400
Did you know Marx once said,...

336
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,960
...if this...

337
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,440
...had 50% profit,...

338
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,840
...they're willing to take the risk.

339
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,120
If it was 100% profit,...

340
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,580
...then they're willing to break all laws in the world.

341
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,440
If it was 300%,...

342
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,280
...they're willing to put their lives at stake.

343
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,400
Let me calculate.

344
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,800
This is 100,000% returns!

345
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,480
So,no matter what it takes,we have to do it.

346
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,480
Just speak. Don't spit. -Alright.

347
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,160
Breakfast is here.

348
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,220
We have agreed on this.

349
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,320
We'll head to Pan Family Market today.

350
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,920
Based on our trajectory,...

351
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,800
...we'll be on our way to success.

352
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,660
No,even better than that!

353
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,940
Breakfast is here.

354
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,000
Eat up. -Is it too much again?

355
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,410
This is wastage.

356
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,360
Is it a lot? Is it a wastage?

357
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,120
I just ordered 4 cups of soybean.

358
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,480
This is the symbol of our wealth.

359
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,680
The breakfasts we never got to eat in the past,...

360
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,890
...we have to recover them all.

361
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,760
Too bad!

362
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,240
We're rich now!

363
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,800
This is the way. Eat up.

364
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,250
One cup is enough for me.

365
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,120
This item has no real value.

366
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,680
It's just a normal jade piece.

367
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,560
In the past,they carved this into an eye.

368
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,560
It isn't even a good piece of jade.

369
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,760
Just a normal greenish-white jade.

370
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,560
Your craftsmanship is pretty good.

371
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,640
However,...

372
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,440
...this sort of jade is usually made in pairs.

373
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,800
This is the left eye. There should be the right eye too.

374
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,360
In that case,are they trying to find the pair?

375
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,560
Isn't there a saying that goes,only pairs are valuable?

376
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,880
Even if you find its other half,it isn't worth anything.

377
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,560
What's the matter? Are you blind?

378
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,600
You have been here for half a day.

379
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,240
Are you buying or not?

380
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,760
If I like it,I'll get it. -How fresh.

381
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,240
All I have here is top grade. Can you afford it?

382
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,960
Can I afford it?

383
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,320
Good day. Welcome!

384
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,800
Come.

385
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,920
What's that?

386
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,360
He'd like a Yuan Qing flower vase. -Yuan Qing flower vase?

387
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,760
What grade?

388
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,740
He doesn't look that rich.

389
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,040
USD10,000,000 should be fine. -Alright.

390
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:34,280
You could buy the most authentic...

391
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,690
...bluish-white pieces here.

392
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,680
They are the best in Beijing. -That's good.

393
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,400
Even in China.

394
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,980
Grandfather,thank you for your help today.

395
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:41,920
Not at all.

396
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,960
Now that I'm old,...

397
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,090
...I should give out what I have left and contribute to society.

398
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:51,610
As the saying goes,life isn't just about what lies before you.

399
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,420
Also..... -Grandfather,...

400
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,260
...you fiddle around with your game a while.

401
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,560
I'll see Fei Fei off.

402
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,300
Grandfather,I'll come play with you next time.

403
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,380
Sure. -See you!

404
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,360
This lad dares to use me as his wingman.

405
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,480
Fei Fei,...

406
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,920
...let's...

407
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,040
...go for a hotpot meal?

408
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,690
Fei Fei,what's the matter?

409
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,880
Wait up!

410
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,760
It was made during the Yuan Dynasty.

411
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,120
Excellent quality. -What's this gimmick?

412
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,140
Why are both of you still here? Please leave.

413
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,760
There's nothing real here. Everything is a fake.

414
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,840
I can assure you. It's just a copy.

415
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,680
Thank you.

416
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,440
Copy? -Why is he leaving?

417
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,720
These two jokers say this is fake.

418
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,320
Stay there! -Let's go.

419
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,330
Stay there! -What's wrong?

420
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,120
Both of you have run into trouble today.

421
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,560
Give me RMB10,000. That glass vase is yours.

422
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,200
Isn't this extortion?

423
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,400
Why would I spend money on a fake? -What did you say?

424
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,760
A fake? It's authentic!

425
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,280
Who told you it's fake? Do you know anything at all?

426
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,540
Of course,I do! Do you?

427
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,320
Give me the money now.

428
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,180
Otherwise,don't even think of leaving this place.

429
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,860
Do you take us rich people to be fools?

430
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,520
Let go! Or else I'll call the police.

431
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,000
What? The police?

432
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,640
You ruined my business deal and you want to call the police?

433
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,760
Don't use violence. -I will beat you.

434
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,280
You should pay the price for spreading false rumours.

435
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,000
Let me go. -Let's talk this out.

436
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,720
Let me go.

437
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,920
Move aside. -Officer Miao.

438
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,600
They were trying to cheat the foreigner.

439
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,860
I stopped him. Now,he's asking me to pay.

440
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,000
Officer Miao,are you going to let this slide?

441
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,280
You're the police!

442
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,840
You're police?

443
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,920
Madam,I was just doing my business here.

444
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,840
The two of them popped up of nowhere and ruined my business.

445
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,840
Shouldn't they compensate me?

446
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,210
Did you think I don't know your tricks?

447
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,090
Do you want to head back to the police station?

448
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,560
Fine. The government is right. Consider myself unlucky.

449
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,380
Consider myself unlucky.

450
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,970
Still being fierce.

451
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,960
Thank you,Officer Miao. -Come here.

452
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,040
Tell me. What's up with you?

453
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:28,920
What's the matter?

454
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:34,600
You were there at the crime scene.

455
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:39,240
I nearly caught my suspect today but you hindered me.

456
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,560
Don't tell me this is another coincidence.

457
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,800
I didn't think I'd see you here too.

458
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,760
Coincidence indeed.

459
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,760
Miss Officer.

460
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,400
It's madam. -Madam,...

461
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,960
...we were just strolling the streets.

462
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,600
We just happened to have an argument with the boss.

463
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,280
You saw earlier too. It had nothing to do with us.

464
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,680
Let's go.

465
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,000
Wait a minute.

466
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,560
Add me on WeChat.

467
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,600
Alright.

468
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,480
Can we go now?

469
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:40,960
Yes.

470
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,520
Miss Officer. I mean,madam,...

471
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,080
...can I add you on WeChat too?

472
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,540
Fei Fei,...

473
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,690
...I finally found you.

474
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,410
Let's go.

475
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,040
Fei Fei. -Speak.

476
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,850
What's your relationship with that guy earlier?

477
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,640
It's related to the case. Don't think too much.

478
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,170
Stand still!

479
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,360
Don't move. -What are you doing?

480
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,920
Go to hell!

481
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:51,840
Fei Fei!

482
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,200
Go to hell!

483
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,600
Quick,get on the car!

484
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,800
You can't escape the police!
