-Here comes the lightning.
-What?

203
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,030
Get ready, it's going to strike.

204

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,640
Are you okay?

213
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,600
Spacecraft are built

00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,920
The space tourist
must have been terrified.

221
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,720
Did you hear what I said? Chicken.

222
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,090
Chicken! Hilarious…

223
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,010
That's not funny.

224
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,600
It wasn't?

225
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,480

Okay.

244
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,660
That's okay.

245
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,330
I can do it.

You're going to be a billionaire.

250
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,100
Wouldn't it be a waste
to leave all that money behind?

251
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:05,100
Please, can we just drop
the billionaire thing?

252

-Eve.
-Yeah?

Couldn't they have secured everything

256
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,830
Is that a gun floating in front of me?

Go upstairs to the bathroom.

<i>I always thought of the universe</i>

298
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,920
<i>Instead of a place of birth,</i>

299
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,800
<i>maybe it's a place of death.</i>

<i>I've done my share of bad things,</i>

301
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:48,320
<i>so maybe it'd be better to say</i>
<i>I died from that lightning strike.</i>

302
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,580

00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,730
Hey!

356
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:03,770
Damn it.

357
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,860
What did you pick up that rock for?

358
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:14,360
If you had a good time
with some beautiful ladies,

359
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,700
at least have a conscience.

360
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,410
And you have the money.

FIND THE CORRELATION
BETWEEN HIS DEBT AND GRADES

363
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,880
AS HIS GRADES GO UP,
HIS DEBT INCREASES EXPONENTIALLY

364
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,800
THEREFORE, GONG RYONG = BROKE DOCTOR

One, two, three, push!

Push!

367
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,850
-Come on, push!
-Push!

368
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,100
It's coming out!

369
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,350
Push!

370
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,900
It's out!

371
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,070
<i>I took that money and got</i>
<i>a private education like everybody else.</i>

372
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,030
<i>A perfect CSAT score</i>
<i>got me into med school.</i>

373
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,280
<i>Every day, I looked at uteruses</i>

374
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,200
<i>and delivered babies.</i>

375
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,320
Good work, everyone.

376
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:04,290
Doctor! The baby isn't crying.

377
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,870
What?

378
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,830
Clean up here.

379
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:17,170
Call pediatrics. Check the Ambu bag.

380
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,140
Two, three.

381
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,430
I'm here!

382
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,850
Your mommy is right here!

383
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:26,310
Wake up!

384
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,480
If you give up,

385
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,030
I'll kill you myself.

386
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,640
Congratulations

387
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:07,980
on becoming a mother.

388
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,980
Hello.

389
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,830
Congratulations

390
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,410
on becoming a mother.

391
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,290
Are you okay?

392
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:31,460
What's going on?

393
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,420
Breathe.

394
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,880
Breathe.

395
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,960
You have to breathe.

396
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:55,610
Congratulations

397
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,730
on becoming a mother.

398
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,530
Thank you. Thank you so much.

399
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,830
<i>While I may not be God,</i>

400
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,340
<i>I felt a sense of joy and excitement</i>
<i>bringing new life into this world.</i>

401
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,630
The other way.

402
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,550
One.

403
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:26,300
-Help!
-Over here!

404
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,890
LET'S

405
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:30,850
GO

406
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,940
I AM A BIRTHING HERO

407
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,710
Congratulations

408
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,580
on becoming a mother.

409
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,080
-Congratulations.
-Congrats!

410
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:42,340
<i>Whether it was</i>
<i>a hundred times or a thousand times,</i>

411
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,590
<i>each birth made my heart race.</i>

412
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,720
<i>That's why</i>

413
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,020
<i>I became an ob-gyn.</i>

414
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,310
This video was just taken in our IVF lab.

415
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:58,730
It shows one
of our specialists performing an ICSI.

416
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:03,280
It shows Mr. Choi's sperm
being injected into Ms. Na's egg.

417
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,570
As you can see,
Mr. Choi's sperm is deformed

418
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:08,700
and has genetic defects.

419
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,870
Is there any way…

420
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,160
to fix it?

421
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:20,750
If you're successful,

422
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,300
I'll give you anything you want.

423
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,010
<i>Despite being the primary doctor</i>
<i>for the daughter-in-law</i>

424
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,980

<i>I was still broke.</i>

425
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:41,020
<i>But one day, as I was on my way to work</i>
<i>for the night shift…</i>

426
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,480
DON'T SKIP MEALS, DRINK THIS AT LEAST
YOUR MOMS

427
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,870
What the hell? Are they crazy?

2023 R CAR

431
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:11,550
Oh, my God. I can't believe this.

432
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,100
Excuse me.

433
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,310
Hello?

434
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,930
Excuse me?

435
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,230
I'm fine. As you can see, all good.

436
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,900
It's a little dark for sunglasses.

437
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,660
Blood…

438
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,870
What?

439
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:36,240
Your forehead is bleeding.

440
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,160
It's nothing.

441
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,580
I see blood every day. I'm fine.

442
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,000
I'm okay, but…

443
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,420
Can you come out here for a second?

444
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:51,840
So, you see,
this car was passed down to me.

445
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,510
I don't know what to do about this.

446
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,680
Wow, I…

447
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,560
Shit.

448
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:09,070
Wait. Stop, please.

449
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,820
SURGERY PREPARATION UNDERWAY

450
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,160
It appears to be an ectopic pregnancy.

451
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,660
You need emergency surgery.

452
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,740
The egg is implanted
in your right fallopian tube,

453
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:21,290
and the left fallopian tube
is already blocked.

454
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,830
We don't have much time,

455
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,540
so we'll start the anesthesia,
then move you to surgery.

456
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,380
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

457
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:36,390
After surgery, can you lend me
that scalpel over there?

458
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,970
I'm not going to let Kang Kang-su
keep his parts either.

459
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,770
You're…

460
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,150
You know me, right?

461
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,700
Yes. Nice to meet you, Ms. Choi.

462
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,070
Actually, I think
a pair of scissors would be better.

463
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:03,330
If you're tense,
the anesthesia won't take effect.

464
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:11,630
Your forehead is bleeding again.

465
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,100
I like children.

466
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,650
I didn't even know I was pregnant.

467
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,490
Don't worry and get some sleep.

468
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:38,200
There's no need to be nervous.
Trust me and go to sleep.

469
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,240
Are there…

470
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,750
any trustworthy men in this world?

471
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,010
Keep my surgery a secret.

472
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:00,260
I would never talk about a patient.
You included.

473
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:03,060
If you betray me, I'll kill you.

474
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,430
After the surgery,
I'll pretend I don't even know you.

475
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,440
Just do me the same courtesy
after you wake up from surgery.

476
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:15,820
Repeat after me.

477
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:19,280
"I'm going to

478
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:23,410
put my trust in you

479
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:26,660
and go to sleep."

480
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:37,970
Here you go, a scalpel
and a pair of scissors.

481
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,130
Are we good now?

482
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,430
Now, can you go to sleep? Please?

483
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,390
Go to sleep.

484
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:03,950
It's okay.

485
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:06,410
You can trust me.

486
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,580
Don't worry.

487
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,170
I'm your doctor.

488
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:27,220
<i>She even tried to fight the anesthesia.</i>

489
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:29,890
<i>She was amazing.</i>

490
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,270
<i>Maybe it was because,</i>
<i>after she fell asleep,</i>

491
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:37,110
<i>she would be consumed by guilt and regret</i>
<i>that her child was no longer in the world.</i>

492
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,320
<i>MZ Group.</i>

493
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,360
<i>That's how I first met the only daughter</i>

494
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:45,240
<i>of a chaebol family.</i>

495
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:47,490
-Thank you, Doctor.
-You're welcome.

496
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,290
Are you Dr. Gong?

497
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,710
And you are?

498
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,970
At least tell me what's going on
so I know what to do.

499
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:07,930
Hey! Are you guys crazy?

500
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,890
I'm just an innocent citizen.
How dare you…

501
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,900
Hello, doc.

502
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,110
Hello.

503
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,950
<i>Who gave you the right</i>
<i>to operate on my daughter?</i>

504
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:31,120
Do you even have the faintest idea

505
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:34,250
how valuable the genes you destroyed were?

506
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,380
<i>You ignorant doctor.</i>

507
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:41,880
I don't know
how valuable those genes were,

508
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:44,300
but it's wrong to lie to a woman
and do that to her.

509
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,930
<i>Now you're saying</i>
<i>even my daughter may not have kids,</i>

510
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:52,980
<i>after my son and daughter-in-law</i>
<i>failed to have children for years.</i>

511
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:56,770
<i>You're responsible</i>
<i>for ending our family bloodline.</i>

512
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,020
What? Me?

513
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,320
-Get out.
-Why?

514
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,950
Sir? Chairman Choi? Why?

515
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:05,200
Hang on a second!

516
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,070
Why?

517
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,160
Wait.

518

520
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:29,850
Yes, sir.

521
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:33,350
Hold up! Wait a second.

522
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,390
Sir,

523
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,440
as a doctor, I had no choice.

524
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,030
If I were faced with the same situation,

525
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,160
I would have to operate on your daughter.

526
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:52,740
You're fired.

527
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:57,040
What did you say?

528
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:58,920
<i>Fired?</i>

529
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,380
<i>No, I'm going to make sure</i>

530
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,420
<i>you never practice medicine again.</i>

531
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,720
<i>Don't worry, Chairman Choi.</i>

532
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,970
<i>I'll make sure he doesn't get the job.</i>

533
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,260
<i>If I hire you, Dr. Gong,</i>
<i>MZ Group said they would cut off funding</i>.

534
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,270
<i>What did you do to piss him off?</i>

535
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,600
<i>Hey, man, how have you been?</i>

536
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,810
I'll do all the dirty work,
the night shifts.

537
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:18,980
Please give me a job.

538
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,520
Oh, come on. Please.

539
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:21,980
Hello?

540
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:29,240
KIM HYE-SEONG OB-GYN CLINIC

541
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:57,680
Should a doctor be drinking this much?

542
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,520
What's it to you?

543
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,360
I'm sorry.

544
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,030
Aren't we supposed to pretend
not to know each other?

545
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,150
Stop coming here.

546
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,490
Let me compensate you.

547
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:09,150
Pretend you don't know me.

548
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,490
Is there anything I can do?

549
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:11,820
Don't do anything.

550
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,530
Do you know how hard it is
to just sit by and do nothing

551
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,330
knowing what you're going through?

552
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,210
It's hard for you?

553
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:24,290
You're having a hard time?

554
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,880
Ever since I got fired,

555
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,550
do you know how hellish
my life has been because of you?

556
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,220
After getting fired,

557
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,720
I thought of you and your face every day.

558
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,270
All I can think about

559
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:44,900
is how to get back at you and your father.

560
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,110
My thoughts are consumed with revenge!

561
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:52,570
Get lost.

562
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,760
How is this for revenge?

563
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,640
I like you.

564
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,230
Shit.

565
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,700
You know what?

566
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,490
I'm not interested in women.

567
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,830
I have more important things
to worry about.

568
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:45,210
I don't know what love is.

569
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:46,500
Just go.

570
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,950
Wake up.

571
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:22,750
Don't just lean on any random woman.

572
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:39,470
You're not just any random woman.

573
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:41,890
Exactly.

574
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:02,540
<i>Starting then, I guess I was asking</i>
<i>to get struck by lightning.</i>

575
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:30,650
<i>I was confused.</i>
<i>Was it revenge, love, or desire?</i>

576
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,730
I love you.

577
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:35,070
<i>"Is this love?"</i>

578
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,830
Let's get married.

579
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:47,250
<i>"Do I want to marry this girl?"</i>

580
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,120
<i>I wondered.</i>

581
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,460
<i>Go-eun was a good person.</i>
<i>She was too good for me.</i>

582
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,800
<i>She owned the world,</i>

583
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,180
<i>but she shared the pain in my heart.</i>

584
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,390
<i>Fine. Let's get married.</i>

585
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:09,230
<i>This is the kind of girl you marry.</i>

586
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,860
<i>It isn't important whether I love her.</i>

587
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:19,820
What was that? Lightning?

588
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:23,870
Holy crap.

589
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:26,700
-What was that?
-I'm scared.

590
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:27,870
DATING DR. GONG RYONG

591
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:29,710
FROM DOCTOR AND PATIENT TO LOVERS

592
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:44,010
Mr. Gong, I'm going to take you upstairs.

593
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,400
Mr. Gong?

594
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,820
Come on, pull yourself together.

595
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,700
Focus.

596
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,870
-Mr. Gong! Is he okay?
-Hey, are you okay?

597
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:06,870
Sir?

598
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:11,620
It's a choking sign!

599
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:12,960
Is his windpipe clogged?

600
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,500
Try to cough. Can you cough?

601
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:15,920
Try to breathe!

602
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:19,590
<i>If you want to live, you have to cough!</i>
<i>Try coughing!</i>

603
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:20,720
Do a medical check.

604
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,720
He's not hooked up to the medical cable.

605
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,010
-<i>Mr. Gong.</i>
-Eve, are you sure it's vomit?

606
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,510
-Cough.
-I'm coming up.

607
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,850
<i>-Santi!</i>
-What?

608
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:29,310
Check the monitor, now!

609
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,350
-What's that?
-What is it?

610
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:37,860
Are you okay? Try breathing.

611
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:40,400
Cough, or you'll die!

612
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:41,490
Eve!

613
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,630
Mr. Gong.

614
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,340
Hang on to me. Santi!

615
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,020
Mr. Gong!

616
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,390
Santi!

617
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,860
Holy shit!

618
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:23,450
Eve, are you okay?

619
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:25,110
What about Mr. Gong?

620
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:27,950
Eve!

621
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,090
Are you okay?

622
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,050
IOU, an unidentified object has crashed

623
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:47,720
into the machine module radiator
and solar panel.

624
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:48,970
Please check it!

625
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:50,510
<i>Roger.</i>

626
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,480
<i>Santi, hold your position.</i>

627
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,850
<i>We need to redirect.</i>
<i>Stand by for your new order.</i>

628
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,900
<i>Eve, are you okay?</i>

629
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,980
Yes, I'm fine.

630
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,150
-Hey.
<i>-Eve, attach the medical cable.</i>

631
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:05,490
There's no time for that.

632
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:06,910
Is he unconscious?

633
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:09,660
<i>Is he unconscious?</i>

634
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,870
It looks that way.

635
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:15,290
<i>If it's not a blackout</i>
<i>but a blocked airway,</i>

636
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:16,540
<i>brain damage will ensue</i>

637
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,920
<i>after four minutes</i>
<i>due to oxygen deprivation</i>.

638
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,960
<i>In seven minutes, he'll die.</i>

639
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:24,300
Doctor, I think we need
to take all his clothes off.

640
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:32,010
You have four minutes. No, less than four.

641
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:36,350
<i>G.O-10,</i>
<i>report the spacecraft status, over.</i>

642
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:37,770
Life support is normal,

643
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:40,060
and the engine thrusters are fine too.

644
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,520
<i>Without gravity,</i>
<i>the Heimlich won't be easy.</i>

645
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:44,820
<i>You need to find the right spot</i>
<i>and push upward quickly.</i>

646
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:45,740
Copy.

647
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,900
Slow pressure
won't create the force needed

648
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:48,950
to expel the matter.

649
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:50,280
Copy!

650
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:05,170
One, two, three!

651
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,970
<i>One, two, three!</i>

652
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:10,760
Come on. Hurry, Eve.

653
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:14,640
<i>-One, two, three!</i>
-Come on.

654
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:16,640
One, two, three.

655
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,270
Okay, come on, Eve.

656
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:20,560
One, two, three.

657
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:23,440
Two, three!

658
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:28,700
One, two, three!

659
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:30,910
One, two, three!

660
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:55,680
One, two, three!

661
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:00,020
Yes!

662
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,100
She did it!

663
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:23,750
Mr. Gong.

664
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:28,170
-Mr. Gong, are you okay?
-<i>Are you okay?</i>

665
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:30,970
Lean back and hold this.

666
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:33,470
You okay?

667
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:37,310
Can you breathe okay?

668
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:41,640
How many fingers?

669
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,690
Can you see
how many fingers I'm holding up?

670
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:51,780
Can you see them?

671
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:03,830
What's your name?

672
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:09,750
What's my name?

673
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,560
Don't worry, you're fine now.

674
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:24,390
You trust me, don't you?

675
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:26,850
I'm your commander.

676
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:29,250
I contacted IOU Mission Control.

677
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:32,340
They said spacecraft sometimes
get struck by lightning.

678
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:33,760
But that doesn't mean

679
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,380
the astronauts inside are in danger.

680
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:41,760
Fine.

681
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:44,470
Ms. Choi.

682
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:49,020
You have a call from the space station.

683
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,400
Have they arrived already?

684
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,320
No. It hasn't even been
an hour since they launched.

685
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,900
It's Mr. Kang Kang-su.

686
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:57,700
Should I ignore it?

687
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,340
-Done.
-Yeah, okay.

688
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:28,390
Mr. Gong, your blood pressure
and pulse are both normal.

689
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,190
And your breathing is stabilizing.

690
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:35,650
You must wear the medical belt
until you arrive at the space station.

691
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,570
Thank you, Doctor.

692
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:40,700
<i>Don't thank me. Thank the commander.</i>

693
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,750
Is he allowed to drink water now?

694
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:49,500
Of course.

695
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:58,630
Aren't you thirsty?

696
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,510
Are you angry, Commander?

697
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:05,470
Are you mad at me for throwing up?

698
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,180
Why would I be?
You spent 70 billion won on this flight.

699
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:09,270
You are mad.

700
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:13,190
I have to go back down.

701
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:22,820
Your feet…

702
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:47,180
Is it past twelve in Seoul now?

703
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,600
Or is it before?

704
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,480
<i>How can you act so normal?</i>

705
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,810
Didn't we break up as enemies?

706
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,150
I just spoke to your father,
so I figured I'd call.

707
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,070
He still likes me.

708
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:02,570
You two can be friends,
but leave me out of it.

709
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,280
If the new guy is no better than me,

710
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,450
I'm not letting you go.

711
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:10,580
<i>Hilarious, right?</i>

712
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:12,620
<i>Go ahead. Laugh.</i>

713
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:13,660
Hey!

714
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:21,960
Why the hell is my dad
still talking to Kang-su?

715
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:23,590
Can't we call up IOU

716
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:26,760
and get them to delete
our numbers from his phone?

717
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,390
Aren't we only allowed calls
from our contact list?

718
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:33,310
The thing is,
your father gave him permission.

719
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:35,770
Then just don't answer his calls.

720
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:38,230
What a stupid thing to say.

721
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:13,350
Do you miss Earth already?

722
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,190
After we left Earth,

723
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,650
I saw a dead body.

724
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:23,570
There was no safety tether.

725
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:27,450
It was a dead astronaut in a space suit

726
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,160
<i>just floating…</i>

727
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,280
What you saw out there wasn't a dead body.

728
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:33,620
It was a SuitSat.

729
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,790
SUIT SATELLITE
SATELLITE MADE FROM A SPACE SUIT

730
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:39,630
That was a satellite?

731
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:42,710
This is it.

732
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:46,050
That looks like it's
from the SuitSat we've been tracking.

733
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:49,590
Look, that's a fist, and that's an arm.

734
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,680
Put it on the screen.

735
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:58,520
Yeah, that fist and arm
are from a SuitSat.

736
00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:00,440
-What?
-Yes.

737
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,480
How did that thing get detached?

738
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:05,110
<i>A space suit costs 14 billion won.</i>

739
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:08,200
Space suits that have been discarded
at the space station

740
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,910
are recycled into satellites.

741
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:15,450
<i>And you mistook that</i>
<i>for an astronaut who died on a spacewalk.</i>

742
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:17,870
<i>MCC has been tracking its orbit.</i>

743
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:21,000
<i>It's not a big deal,</i>
<i>so there was no need to tell you guys.</i>

744
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:24,130
SuitSats are equipped
with communication devices and sensors,

745
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:25,920
which send valuable data to Earth.

746
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:30,680
<i>A tiny,</i>

747
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,140
invisible piece of cosmic debris
probably hit the arm.

748
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:37,680
It broke off and flew
into the spacecraft's orbit,

749
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:39,640
causing a collision.

750
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:43,150
A single arm is tiny,
so we weren't able to detect it.

751
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,190
That's the one.

752
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:48,610
Chief, that's the one.
That was the space suit I wore last.

753
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:52,490
I wore that to fix the truss
outside the space station.

754
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:55,450
Then I rewired the cables
and attached them to the new equipment,

755
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:58,080
and replaced the broken power regulator.

756
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:02,420
During that, my helmet started leaking
and filled up with water.

757
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,130
I thought, "This is the end,
and I never got to marry."

758
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:08,460
I remember rushing back into the airlock.

759
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:11,680
I did all that wearing that suit.

760
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:15,850
You no longer work here,
so what are you doing here?

761
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:19,730
I'm on the clock until tomorrow.

762
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:23,980
Did you really get scouted
for a lot of money?

763
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:27,480
I should be here.
It's Eve's first command.

764
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:28,530
Is that all?

765
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:30,740
-What?
-I'm sorry?

766
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:37,910
The launch is tomorrow.

767
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,960
How am I supposed to wait a year?

768
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:43,870
A year is too long, Eve.

769
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,550
It'll fly by.

770
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:57,140
We just got together.
It's going to make me crazy.

771
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:01,020
Can't you take the position next time?

772
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:13,700
Yes.

773
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,450
That's a relief.

774
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:19,450
What are you implying?

775
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:23,830
Eve deserves to date a great guy.

776
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:26,580
I totally agree.

777
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:30,750
Go up and get some rest.

778
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:33,420
You're going to wear yourself out
before you get there.

779
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:35,180
Yeah, go up and get some sleep.

780
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,510
<i>The solar panels are damaged.</i>

781
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,140
Do you think it will affect
docking with the station?

782
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:42,730
We adjusted the altered orbit with Santi,

783
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:45,980
and we're inspecting
the machine module for issues.

784
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:47,020
So, we'll have to wait.

785
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:49,060
Were you scared?

786
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:51,070
No.

787
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:53,530
Quite the dramatic start as commander.

788
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:56,160
Can I help with anything?

789
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,780
No, it's okay. I'm good.

790
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:02,750
<i>Go upstairs. That's an order.</i>

791
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:05,920
Go upstairs.

792
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:11,380
Copy.

793
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:15,510
Don't worry. I'll hold down the fort.

794
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:40,660
Hi.

795
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:54,760
Let's take your temperature.

796
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:05,600
Let me know if you feel sick, though
there's probably nothing left to throw up.

797
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,320
I'm hot.

798
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:22,370
36.5 degrees. Perfectly normal.

799
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:25,540
But I feel like I have a fever.

800
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:41,300
Don't touch the window
with your hands or face.

801
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:43,050
You could get burned.

802
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:45,970
The sun's a lot stronger up here.

803
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:55,150
Oh, can I take this off too?

804
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:58,570
I'll turn it off.
Try to get some shut-eye, both of you.

805
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:01,030
Okay.

806
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:05,870
NO SIGNAL

807
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:08,790
Your foot is bleeding again.

808
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:10,870
You also hurt your foot? Let me see.

809
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,460
It looks fine.

810
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:14,460
No, your foot.

811
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,970
Stop moving around and rest.

812
01:00:40,690 --> 01:00:41,530
Three…

813
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:47,530
Just a sec…

814
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:01,130
Okay, nice.

815
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:10,430
-I got it.
-Hold on.

816
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:14,850
The cut is more than a centimeter deep.

817
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:16,810
A Band-Aid won't stop
the bleeding for long.

818
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:19,610
We're completely helpless
without the rails in zero gravity.

819
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:22,400
It's serious.
Just putting pressure on it won't cut it.

820
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:24,990
You need surgery.
It'll bleed whenever you use the rails.

821
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,410
Who's going to operate? You?

822
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:29,160
-Yes, Commander.
-Here?

823
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:33,080
-I'm a doctor.
-You <i>were</i> a doctor.

824
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:38,500
Good thing I brought
my operating tools and some sutures.

825
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:53,390
How can you possibly steady yourself

826
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:56,440
and properly
thread a needle in zero gravity?

827
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:00,690
I've threaded a billion surgical needles.

828
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:02,740
You're not going to sew it all crooked,

829
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:04,740
or sew my big toe
to my index toe, are you?

830
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:07,490
Like I said, it'll keep bleeding
when you use the rails.

831
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:10,370
If you keep this up,
you might end up losing both big toes.

832
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:13,370
Without them, you won't be able to walk
when we get back to Earth.

833
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:18,380
I'm being serious.

834
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:23,510
I know.

835
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,720
I wasn't waiting for you to answer.

836
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:29,680
If I sew it all crooked

837
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,810
and stitch your toes together,

838
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:35,890
I will piggyback you around
for the rest of my life.

839
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:38,940
-Don't be ridiculous.
-Exactly.

840
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:41,190
That will never happen.

841
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:47,200
Before coming here,
I completed all the required training.

842
01:02:47,950 --> 01:02:49,870
This isn't even surgery.

843
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:51,830
This gash

844
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:54,370
just needs some anesthesia and stitches.

845
01:02:56,750 --> 01:03:01,130
Okay, here I go threading the needle
for the billion and first time.

846
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,020
Damn it.

847
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:27,150
The blood must have rushed to my head.
My hands are swollen.

848
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:40,120
I've got all day.

849
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:46,000
Here, it's a new day
every 90 minutes, right?

850
01:03:46,090 --> 01:03:48,550
Within the 90 minutes
it will take to orbit the Earth,

851
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:50,840
I promise to get it done.

852
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:52,970
Hang on.

853
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:14,620
If I knew how to sew,
I'd stitch your mouth shut.

854
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:15,780
Those are scary words--

855
01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:18,370
You throw up,
you're all talk, and you're full of crap.

856
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:21,370
You said it was normal
for first-timers in zero gravity.

857
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:24,210
Didn't you also feel sick your first time?
Yes or no?

858
01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:26,550
Did you or didn't you puke?

859
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:30,170
Okay. You have nine minutes.

860
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:32,800
It won't take nine minutes.
Ninety seconds will suffice.

861
01:04:32,890 --> 01:04:35,220
Once I numb the area,
stitching is a piece of cake.

862
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:43,900
Why isn't there a syringe?

863
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,980
It must have fallen out earlier.

864
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:52,360
You know, in the collision earlier.

865
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:55,620
Just do it.

866
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:58,200
No way. Do you know
how painful stitching without--

867
01:04:58,290 --> 01:04:59,290
Hurry up and do it--

868
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:02,120
No! I can find the syringe, okay?

869
01:05:02,210 --> 01:05:05,710
I know I brought it.
It can't have disappeared.

870
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:07,420
It's in here for sure.

871
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:11,050
Things lost in here
don't drop to the floor,

872
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:12,720
so they're hard to find.

873
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:15,090
It's nothing. I can handle it.

874
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:17,600
It's only a few stitches.
Let's just get it done.

875
01:05:18,930 --> 01:05:21,310
Then, do you want to give it a shot?

876
01:05:22,430 --> 01:05:23,810
I'll be quick.

877
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:25,310
Okay, let's do it.

878
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,520
Okay.

879
01:05:26,610 --> 01:05:27,810
Okay…

880
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,700
Here we go.

881
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:39,790
Here goes.

882
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:42,450
Go ahead.

883
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:51,050
But it's going to hurt.

884
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:58,050
After I finished my last mission
and was returning to Earth,

885
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:00,100
I fell into
a remote area of Southeast Asia.

886
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:04,350
I crashed into a thorny bush
in the jungle at full speed,

887
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:06,690
and I didn't even flinch.

888
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:10,440
There must have been
tens of thousands of thorns in that bush.

889
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:12,940
So don't worry, all right?

890
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:13,990
Okay.

891
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:16,030
Here goes.

892
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:22,740
Turn your head.

893
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:24,160
This doesn't scare me.

894
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:26,370
Come on, don't look!

895
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:27,670
Just leave that to me.

896
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:29,330
Thorns just prick you.

897
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:33,010
It's not the same
as sewing flesh with a needle and thread.

898
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:34,670
-Shall I do it?
-No.

899
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,430
-I'll do it.
-No, I'll do it.

900
01:06:44,730 --> 01:06:45,730
Okay…

901
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,440
Do it?

902
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:13,300
I'm almost done. Just a bit more.

903
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,800
What happened to his toe?

904
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,680
How did he manage
to get a hole only where his big toe is?

905
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:23,430
Tell me when Ryong is on.

906
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,850
Okay.

907
01:07:27,930 --> 01:07:31,480
<i>As planned, they will attempt</i>
<i>to dock on the morning of the 6th.</i>

908
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:35,070
<i>The process will take about three hours</i>
<i>from start to finish,</i>

909
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:38,360
<i>after which, the hatch will open</i>
<i>and they will board the space station.</i>

910
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:42,410
<i>If docking is successful,</i>
<i>Mr. Gong will move to the space station</i>

911
01:07:42,490 --> 01:07:44,740
<i>and spend the next eight days</i>
<i>on various tasks.</i>

912
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:48,370
<i>Sometime tomorrow morning, Korea time,</i>

913
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:51,170
<i>Mr. Gong is scheduled</i>
<i>to contact IOU Mission Control.</i>

914
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:06,520
I love you.

915
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:14,560
Go-eun, I'm going to spend my life
being devoted to you.

916
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:17,940
We're going to live a fantastic life.

917
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:21,530
I promise to be faithful to you.
I'm never going to betray you.

918
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:25,950
Why can't you just say it back?

919
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,910
"Why can't you just say it back?"

920
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:32,750
I love you.

921
01:08:32,830 --> 01:08:33,960
<i>I love you.</i>

922
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:35,960
Hello, Ms. Choi.

923
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:47,310
All done. You're doing well.

924
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:50,390
Didn't you say you were done?

925
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,730
You're doing great.
I really am almost done.

926
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:55,110
Just about done now.

927
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:56,360
Hey, don't move.

928
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,360
-Almost there.
-I can't take it anymore.

929
01:09:01,530 --> 01:09:03,160
-That's enough.
-No, wait.

930
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,570
-I swear, I'm almost done.
-You can stop now.

931
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:06,620
-A bit more.
-No.

932
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:08,990
-Aren't you finished?
-Last one…

933
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:10,330
Hey, you said you were done.

934
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:12,500
I want to make sure there's no scarring.

935
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:14,540
-Okay.
-It looks done.

936
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:16,420
Doesn't it, Dr. Gong?

937
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:24,130
I swear, just one more stitch.

938
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:26,680
Really…

939
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:28,720
Done.

940
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:30,060
Finished!

941
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,400
Good job.

942
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:11,720
Thank you.

943
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:14,270
Sure.

944
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:18,100
Get some rest. I'm going to head down.

945
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:24,110
Commander.

946
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,200
your

947
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:30,450
big toes…

948
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:33,370
are amazing.

949
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:06,190
Your big toes…

950
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:12,370
are beautiful,

951
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:14,790
Commander.

952
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,400
SPECIAL THANKS
TO CHO JUNG-SEOK, PARK JIN-JOO

953
01:11:59,830 --> 01:12:01,710
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

954
01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:04,090
<i>Finally, the space station.</i>

955
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:06,710
Why is our Ryong
the only one flailing like that?

956
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,170
What is this?

957
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:10,470
Hello.

958
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:12,470
<i>They say he's just after her money.</i>

959
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:15,560
He's pretending to be in love with her
and even came to space for it.

960
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:17,810
If I succeed…

961
01:12:17,890 --> 01:12:19,730
<i>I told you, I'll do anything.</i>

962
01:12:19,810 --> 01:12:20,640
Hey.

963
01:12:21,230 --> 01:12:22,350
Give it up.

964
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,770
<i>Go-eun is mine.</i>

965
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:26,190
<i>I'm looking for it.</i>
<i>Don't worry, I'll find it.</i>

966
01:12:26,270 --> 01:12:27,320
<i>His heart rate is dropping.</i>

967
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:28,610
<i>What are you doing?</i>

968
01:12:28,690 --> 01:12:29,860
<i>Did you get caught?</i>

969
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:32,410
<i>Don't move. You're acting suspicious.</i>

970
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,160

971
01:12:47,050 --> 01:12:47,960
Hi.

972
01:13:16,450 --> 01:13:18,620
"PLEASE FAST BEFORE DEPARTURE"

973
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:20,870
AS GONG RYONG BIT THE APPLE,
HE RECALLED EVE'S WORDS

974
01:13:20,950 --> 01:13:22,870
"WHATEVER, I DON'T EVEN LISTEN
TO MY MOTHERS"

975
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,960
THE APPLE WAS HEAVY LIKE EVE'S WARNING

976
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,960
GONG RYONG ROLLED DOWN
THE CAR WINDOW

977
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:35,220
"WHAT COULD GO WRONG?"

978
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:40,060
A SLICE OF APPLE, EVE'S WARNING…

979
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:43,600
GONG RYONG SWALLOWED THE APPLE,
THE WARNING, AND HIS DOUBTS

980
01:13:43,690 --> 01:13:45,690
AS HE HEADED FOR THE LAUNCHPAD
