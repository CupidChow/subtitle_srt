1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,960
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

2
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,490
These are the images of Ms. Na's eggs fertilized

3
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,110
with Mr. Choi's sperm, now divided into 16 cells.

4
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,620
They're your seven grandchildren, sir.

5
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,120
We'll select the three healthiest ones with the highest chance of success

6
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,170
and implant them in her uterus.

7
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,840
Min-jeong, are you feeling better now?

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,050
Yes, Father. I'm taking good care of myself.

9
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,590
I'm perfectly healthy.

10
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,930
Now I can die without any regrets.

11
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,560
Aren't you going to say congratulations?

12
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,160
This belongs to a human.

13
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,500
Is it a morula?

14
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,080
Wow, a morula?

15
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,580
Yes, it's a human morula.

16
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,510
Dr. Lee, turn off the lab's power. We need to disengage the locks.

17
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,880
-Okay. -Wait.

18
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,180
At least give me a chance to explain first.

19
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,360
Have you lost your mind?

20
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,030
Open it.

21
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,100
Is this it?

22
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,580
Excuse me.

23
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,830
Unbelievable.

24
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,670
Is this…

25
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,800
Is this an actual human morula?

26
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,650
Congratulations, Min-jeong.

27
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,690
Thank you.

28
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,950
Once the morulas arrive,

29
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,660
I'll get you the best team of doctors, way better than Gong Ryong.

30
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,490
Just trust me.

31
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,120
All right.

32
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,540
Chairman.

33
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,370
Ryong hasn't done anything up there.

34
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,500
End things with him.

35
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,500
I can't accept just anyone into my family.

36
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,000
Dad!

37
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,960
Kang-su is the one who did all the work.

38
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,470
Marry him instead.

39
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,930
A human egg has never been brought up to the space station.

40
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,810
Just how did you bring these up here?

41
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,940
Whose are they?

42
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,820
They were donated by an egg bank

43
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,780
for experimental purposes.

44
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,820
They were meant to be used

45
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,280
for the infertility research where I compared sterile fruit flies to humans.

46
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,660
I hid them under the holders for the fruit fly vials and snuck them in.

47
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,500
What about the sperm?

48
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,630
The sperm.

49
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,840
Did you use your own?

50
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,140
I stole one of Santi's samples.

51
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,480
The sperm are yours.

52
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,570
What, mine?

53
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,240
You used my sperm?

54
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,280
I experimented with the frozen sperm

55
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,620
that you always keep in the freezer.

56
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,880
So these embryos… These…

57
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,090
These morulas.

58
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,880
They're all my babies?

59
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,050
I know the situation is bad,

60
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,350
and I'm sorry. I know I broke the rules,

61
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,020
but just think about it.

62
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,850
Santi's sperm can't fertilize eggs on Earth

63
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,980
due to their abnormal morphology and genetic defects,

64
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,270
but I made it happen here. Isn't that incredible?

65
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,990
Shut up! You don't even deserve to be called a scientist.

66
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,820
What's wrong with a scientist stretching his imagination?

67
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,240
Someone had to try it sooner or later.

68
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,160
You've all been dying to know if people who can't get pregnant

69
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,290
can have children in space!

70
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,710
I know you wanted to try it too.

71
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,920
Let's be honest, Commander.

72
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,300
You spend every day with those damn mice asking,

73
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,090
Did they bump uglies today?

74
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,180
Will they do it today? Tomorrow?

75
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,590
Has the vaginal plug formed?

76
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,180
You never take your eyes off them

77
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,260
so you can make it possible for humans.

78
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,560
Haven't you been itching to skip the mice and try this yourself?

79
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,570
I'm discarding these.

80
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,370
You're discarding them?

81
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,080
Santi, I have to discard these.

82
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,710
Sorry.

83
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,970
I'll discard them and report this to MCC right away.

84
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,310
Dr. Kang, stay here and wait for instructions.

85
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,890
Commander.

86
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,890
Commander.

87
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,810
Damn it.

88
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,660
What do we do now?

89
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:59,410
I know you're laughing and celebrating on the inside, you jerk.

90
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,040
Hey.

91
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,540
The morulas are 400 km away from their mom's uterus.

92
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,590
At least one of them has to make it there.

93
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,510
It doesn't matter who created it.

94
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,260
Damn.

95
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,890
What are you…

96
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,430
What are you going to do?

97
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,330
Commander.

98
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,460
Commander!

99
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,420
Those are human lives.

100
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,710
These are just cells.

101
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,300
The nuclei met and divided. That's it.

102
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,130
Life begins from the moment a sperm meets an egg.

103
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,840
You're talking about the future.

104
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,850
Right now, these are nothing more than balls of 16 cells.

105
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,930
A morula is essentially a person.

106
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,480
It's already a living thing.

107
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,650
Save your sentimental ob-gyn talk for when you're back on Earth.

108
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,110
You're at a space station.

109
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:12,440
You don't know what this means here, so stay out of it.

110
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,200
You thought it was amazing when a fruit fly gave birth.

111
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,070
How can you destroy human lives

112
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,160
just because it's against the rules?

113
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,040
Fine, let's say you're right, and these are human lives.

114
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,290
Yes, please.

115
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,670
These cells carry a type of energy that doesn't exist on Earth.

116
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,670
No one can predict how they will develop

117
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,300
when this unidentified energy goes to Earth.

118
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,640
Who's to say whether they'll become a cancer mass or a mass of life?

119
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,560
Space is full of radiation and unknown cosmic rays.

120
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,060
Even if you froze these cells,

121
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,810
they'd still be completely exposed to unpredictable risks.

122
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,940
It's not like they'd be protected by a buffer like a mother's womb.

123
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,030
They must be destroyed.

124
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,360
Facing those risks

125
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,580
is the fate this life-form was born with.

126
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,200
That's not something we can decide on our own.

127
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:06,120
They have to face their own fate.

128
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,870
Let's let them decide

129
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,130
their own destiny, okay?

130
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,590
Commander.

131
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,050
What…

132
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,690
Wait a second.

133
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,190
You can't be serious.

134
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,190
You want to crush these human lives like medical waste

135
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,530
and shoot them into space?

136
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,280
You want to let Dr. Kang play God and create human life here?

137
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,070
He stole a teammate's sperm

138
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,330
and shoved it into some random woman's eggs.

139
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,740
These could turn into cancer or mutants.

140
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,120
He put us in grave danger.

141
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,250
He thought he could create humans like God,

142
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,830
and he was conquering his fear.

143
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,670
He was just being arrogant, justifying his actions like that.

144
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,010
Dr. Kang completely disregarded space ethics.

145
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,130
Let go of me.

146
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,390
Science is for humanity. Do your ethics really mean more?

147
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,430
Your experiments with mice to get them to mate, get pregnant,

148
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,270
and give birth are all for human benefit, aren't they?

149
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,770
Let go.

150
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:17,240
You're trying to make it possible for humans to have sex, get pregnant,

151
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,990
and give birth in space too.

152
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,200
It's about finding a way for humanity

153
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,240
to continue across generations beyond Earth.

154
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,170
Think of these living beings

155
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,340
as the starting point for that.

156
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,800
The beginning of it.

157
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,760
Natural conception or not,

158
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,930
they're still human beings who could survive all the radiation

159
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,470
and unknown rays and be born despite the obstacles.

160
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,520
Please see it that way.

161
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,860
These morulas will soon develop into blastocysts,

162
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,320
and unverified blastocysts

163
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,610
cannot enter Earth under any circumstances.

164
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,120
No!

165
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,680
We'll load it onto the spacecraft below with the other waste

166
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,640
and burn it up in the atmosphere.

167
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,470
Murderer.

168
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,310
Excuse me?

169
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,480
You murderer.

170
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,790
Murderer!

171
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,710
Say that again.

172
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,170
You're a murderer.

173
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,340
And you're two-faced.

174
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,640
Murderer!

175
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,680
I regret ever falling for you or feeling my heart race because of you.

176
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,980
I regret risking my life to save someone like you.

177
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,100
I should've just let you die.

178
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,360
I'll never try to save you again.

179
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,320
I didn't know you were so cruel and heartless.

180
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,110
I asked if it was okay if I liked you.

181
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,280
I take it all back!

182
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,700
Good.

183
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,620
I'm so over you.

184
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,710
I can't stand you.

185
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,210
That's what I wanted.

186
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,500
I thought space was like a womb,

187
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,970
but it's a tomb, isn't it?

188
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,630
Not a place of creation…

189
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,220
but a place of death?

190
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,620
Seoul?

191
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,880
Astronaut Kang Kang-su created embryos using unauthorized human eggs and sperm.

192
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,590
The embryos, which developed into morulas,

193
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,220
were immediately discarded as per protocol.

194
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,470
This is all a result of my negligence.

195
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,850
I will take responsibility and step down.

196
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:31,360
Kang Kang-su.

197
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,330
You have violated bioethics and put humanity in danger

198
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,950
with unauthorized experiments.

199
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,710
You caused chaos at the space station

200
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,960
and brought dishonor to all astronauts.

201
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,340
Effective immediately,

202
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,090
you're dismissed from Expedition 3.

203
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,930
You're no longer a fellow astronaut.

204
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:57,020
The final disciplinary action will be determined upon your return in three days.

205
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,600
Now, Commander Eve, you said you'd resign to take responsibility,

206
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,770
but I'm ordering you to continue your duties as commander.

207
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,820
That will be all.

208
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,180
KOREA SPACE AGENCY

209
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,200
Don't do it.

210
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,960
Dr. Kang Kang-su can take over.

211
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,830
If you get caught,

212
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,960
it could jeopardize Dr. Kang's work.

213
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,930
Geez, what the…

214
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,640
Why are you taking that apart?

215
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,360
I thought he was using this to work on fruit flies, but he wasn't.

216
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,990
Who knows if some other lunatic will try to do the same thing?

217
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,780
But what about me? I was given assignments.

218
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,450
Come on, the eggs are already gone.

219
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,750
All I need to do is observe the motility of the frozen sperm.

220
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,710
I need this, Commander.

221
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,250
I told you to stop all ongoing projects.

222
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,300
Commander.

223
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,710
Commander!

224
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,430
Wait, Commander.

225
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:00,350
Use the microscope here in the main module if you need to observe sperm motility.

226
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,100
It's under CCTV surveillance.

227
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,390
Hey!

228
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,640
I paid 70 billion won to be here.

229
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,190
I'm a VIP, all right?

230
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,980
Why do I have to tiptoe around and ask for your permission?

231
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,610
That's equipment for the biological module.

232
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,910
Why are you locking it?

233
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,710
That means I can't use it.

234
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,380
DONG-A

235
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,770
From now on, you'll need my permission to use this microscope for ICSI.

236
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,530
Everything from setup to usage

237
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,280
will be recorded 24-7 on CCTV.

238
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,570
Tourist or not, there are no exceptions.

239
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,080
Damn it.

240
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:29,140
CHAIRMAN CHOI JAE-RYONG

241
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,910
Hey, pour her a glass.

242
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,040
Yes, sir.

243
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,460
Father, I'd rather not drink.

244
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,750
We've got to celebrate.

245
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,630
You won't be able to drink for a while.

246
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,960
Right, I'll just have a sip then.

247
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,600
You're better than my own daughter.

248
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,520
Once you have the baby, you can run the hospital.

249
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,140
I'll make you the director.

250
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,990
You don't even want to eat with me now?

251
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,540
Listen, make something that the vice chairwoman likes.

252
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,870
Yes, sir.

253
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,540
If you marry Kang-su, you can be vice chairwoman.

254
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,840
Build up the company

255
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,920
and pass it on to our precious morula.

256
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:52,690
I bet the morula will be sharp as a tack, just like your brother.

257
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,060
You'll run MZ Group for the next 30 years,

258
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,030
and then the morula will take over for another 30.

259
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,240
Does that sound fair?

260
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,490
I'm not marrying Kang-su.

261
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:07,120
I'm offering you the next 30 years of MZ Group as a gift.

262
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,200
Sir, Dr. Kang Kang-su is on the phone for you.

263
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,620
Oh, really?

264
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,540
Make it a video call so we can all talk.

265
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,710
The chairman would like to switch to video call.

266
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,060
Have you frozen them?

267
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,150
-Mr. Chairman. -The portable freezer I gave Ryong

268
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,150
was specially designed

269
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,900
to block radiation and harmful rays,

270
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:46,530
and it can easily pass through the Earth's atmosphere.

271
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,580
Take it from Ryong and bring the morulas back in it.

272
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,160
Impressive, don't you think?

273
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,380
The IOU could learn a thing or two from us.

274
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,800
I'm sorry.

275
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,170
What?

276
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,840
The seven morulas…

277
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,350
have all been destroyed.

278
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,890
What?

279
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,100
What are you talking about?

280
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,770
What do you mean?

281
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,610
Did you get caught?

282
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,360
It's over.

283
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,780
How much do they know?

284
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,360
What about Ryong? Is he okay?

285
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,330
I lied and said the eggs were donated for experiments,

286
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,200
so they don't know they were Dr. Na's eggs.

287
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,500
You were so sure of yourself!

288
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,250
Did you lose the rest of the eggs too?

289
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,340
Gong Ryong still has a few of them,

290
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,970
but I can't use the microscope.

291
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,300
It's been moved to the main module

292
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,720
and locked up in a rack.

293
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:57,020
It's under 24-7 CCTV surveillance, and nothing can be done in secret.

294
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,270
There's nothing I can do.

295
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,190
Are you…

296
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,980
Are you telling me to give up right now?

297
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,700
There's no other option. I'm sorry.

298
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,160
Who did it?

299
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,330
Who killed my grandchild?

300
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,500
Who is it?

301
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,210
Your commander?

302
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,500
Dad!

303
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,840
I'll call you later.

304
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,500
Sir.

305
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,050
Dad.

306
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,380
CHAIRMAN CHOI JAE-RYONG

307
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,230
They didn't even get to live for a day.

308
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,940
-Who did this? -Dad.

309
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:48,490
Take him to the hospital now before things get worse! Hurry!

310
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,490
-Dad! -Bring them to me, damn it!

311
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,200
I'm going to kill all those bastards up there!

312
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,330
I'm going to kill them!

313
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,460
-Father. -Sir, are you all right?

314
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,510
-Dad! -Father.

315
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,920
Stay with me, sir.

316
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,930
Dad, we're almost there. Just hang in there, okay?

317
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,180
Dad.

318
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:25,440
FLAVORS OF THE MOUNTAIN, SEA, AND SKY

319
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,610
Hey, it's raining.

320
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,870
Oh, goodness!

321
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,660
I wish it had started raining sooner.

322
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,370
The weather's perfect for mung bean pancakes and makgeolli.

323
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:45,500
Rainy days make me think of my exes.

324
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:51,130
I wonder if our Ryong is eating well up there.

325
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,050
Ryong!

326
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,240
What a jerk, right?

327
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,320
Kang Kang-su.

328
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,960
I know you have his lottery ticket. The one that won the jackpot last year.

329
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,430
I'll talk with Santi before he goes back in three days.

330
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:37,550
How about we split it three ways?

331
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,140
Someone like Kang-su doesn't deserve that money.

332
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,020
He's not even on the team anymore.

333
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:01,700
What… What about my sister?

334
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,750
You've got a month to claim it.

335
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,210
Santi is the only one who can do it in time.

336
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,380
You found the ticket,

337
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,510
I'm the only one who can convince him,

338
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:15,590
and Santi is the one who can go to Houston and collect the cash.

339
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,300
But your sister?

340
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,220
She's not doing anything.

341
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,650
In…

342
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,820
In any case…

343
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:37,740
In any case, let's split it four ways.

344
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,230
Dad.

345
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:15,530
I know it's hard, but you have to accept it.

346
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,410
Let's call Ryong.

347
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,950
Please stop.

348
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:25,540
Min-jeong, call Ryong.

349
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,830
He still has three eggs.

350
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,080
That ICSI microscope.

351
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,800
Tell him to steal it if he has to.

352
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:40,090
He might get caught too if he does that. What then?

353
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,350
Min-jeong, call Ryong.

354
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,890
He'll listen to you.

355
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,020
Call Ryong.

356
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,230
-Father. -Do it now.

357
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:53,650
Kang-su said they can't do it because of the cameras!

358
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:58,530
There's no way it can be done without a microscope.

359
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,860
-It's over. -Shut it.

360
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,280
We…

361
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,410
should give up.

362
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:06,910
I'm not giving up.

363
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,540
I won't.

364
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:15,670
If you don't stop, you'll get Ryong and all of us in serious trouble.

365
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,050
Please.

366
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,840
Please come to your senses, Dad!

367
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,680
Please…

368
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:46,830
There are only three eggs left now.

369
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,910
I have to succeed tonight, no matter what.

370
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:51,580
I'm going back in three days,

371
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,830
and they'll need three days to become morulas.

372
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,710
Tonight's my last chance.

373
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,130
Turn left, please.

374
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,840
Give it up. You don't even have a microscope.

375
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,220
I did get a couple of pipettes from the biological module.

376
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:11,850
Hey, what are you going to do with just the pipettes?

377
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:14,150
You still need a microscope to attach them to

378
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:18,690
for one to hold the egg and the other to inject sperm.

379
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:21,070
It's like a needle without the syringe.

380
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:24,110
Really? I had no idea. Thanks for telling me, buddy.

381
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,820
-You jerk. -Hey, that's cute.

382
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,080
How can I turn myself into a microscope?

383
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,620
You can't.

384
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,670
For God's sake.

385
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,220
This damn zero gravity.

386
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,470
I thought it'd work if someone held on to my legs.

387
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:50,430
Hey, since you don't have a microscope,

388
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:55,730
why not get someone to hold each of your legs and arms?

389
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:58,480
Yeah, get four people to hold you still.

390
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,690
Go make an announcement.

391
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,780
Hi, I'm trying IVF again.

392
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,030
Can somebody hold me up?

393
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,530
-Hold on. -Who wants to help me? Raise your hand!

394
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,580
Hey, wait. Be quiet.

395
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:14,410
Dude, if you pull this off without a microscope,

396
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,250
I'll give you a Nobel Prize myself.

397
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,210
It's impossible without a microscope, Ryong.

398
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,720
Hey!

399
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,840
He keeps disappearing in the middle of calls.

400
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,310
Where am I?

401
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:35,890
What do you mean, all we have to do is hold his legs?

402
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,480
What'll the tourist do if we hold his legs?

403
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,560
He won't say.

404
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,110
What, does he think we're stupid?

405
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:46,650
Why should we hold him if he doesn't tell us what he's gonna do?

406
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,280
We're gonna do it no matter what, okay?

407
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,750
We hold his legs, we get 500 billion.

408
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,330
Sweet deal, right?

409
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,290
Let's do it.

410
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,920
Should we call him?

411
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,650
Spacewalk suits don't have any joints, so we move really slowly.

412
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,830
Moving even 0.00001 mm makes your heart feel like it's about to burst.

413
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:35,700
It's like dying in a jointless prison.

414
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,210
What are you doing?

415
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:49,010
Come with me for a second.

416
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,850
Is it impossible to move in this?

417
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,390
Pretty much.

418
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,430
Why?

419
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:17,160
We'll keep your legs still and secure,

420
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,700
so keep your promise.

421
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,790
Of course.

422
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,840
I won't say a word about it. I'll take it to my grave.

423
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:27,670
No.

424
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:31,970
I want to know why you need us to hold your legs.

425
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,590
I need to know.

426
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:38,020
I don't care if the prize is 500 billion or 5 trillion.

427
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,560
In pari delicto.

428
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,810
You want us to dance, you gotta show us your hand.

429
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,870
I will do the same thing that Kang Kang-su did.

430
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:56,950
What the…

431
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,990
-What? -What did you just say?

432
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,870
Santi.

433
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,250
What Kang Kang-su said back there was a lie.

434
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,330
It's not your sperm.

435
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,090
Fuck!

436
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:10,380
It was my patient's sperm, as crooked as yours.

437
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,180
I came up to space at the request of a mother

438
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,800
who desperately wanted a baby.

439
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:20,430
Because her husband's sperm have a genetic defect,

440
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,730
it would be impossible to get pregnant

441
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:25,020
if it wasn't for zero gravity here.

442
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,320
No matter what baby is born,

443
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,980
a responsible mother

444
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,900
who will raise the baby with love,

445
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,200
is waiting.

446
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,740
This is insane!

447
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,330
I'm out.

448
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,040
I can't do it.

449
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,160
Didn't you see what happened to Dr. Kang?

450
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:47,250
You're basically asking us to risk our lives here.

451
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:50,500
We could easily lose our jobs as astronauts like Kang-su did.

452
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:53,130
I'm not asking you to do the procedure yourselves.

453
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,760
Just hold my legs down like when I operated on the mouse.

454
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,720
I'll turn a blind eye to the lottery ticket,

455
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,020
if you guys will turn a blind eye to what I'm about to do.

456
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,520
No, I'm not doing this.

457
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,890
Me neither.

458
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,690
Are you kidding me?

459
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,150
So you'll just give up the 500 billion?

460
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,950
Okay.

461
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:23,410
Let's say we do it. What about the ICSI microscope?

462
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:28,130
Mr. Gong, you can't perform an ICSI without a microscope.

463
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:32,500
When you move your hand by one centimeter with the joystick and manipulator,

464
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,760
the needle only moves by one micrometer.

465
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,800
Is it really impossible?

466
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,930
If you hold my legs completely still,

467
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:44,810
I will…

468
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,190
I'll turn my body into a microscope.

469
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:00,490
There you go.

470
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,040
I thought space was like a womb,

471
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,670
but it's a tomb, isn't it?

472
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,540
Not a place of creation…

473
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,300
but a place of death?

474
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,640
He was at death's door, but he made it.

475
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,970
Look at this guy gobbling up the food.

476
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,930
He seems to be back to full health. What do we do now?

477
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:29,730
Eve.

478
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:31,730
What?

479
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,690
Yeah, I know.

480
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,530
He's eating like a champ.

481
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,820
And pooping like one too.

482
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,150
Yeah. Lucky little guy, right?

483
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,820
He's doing really well today.

484
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,200
Right?

485
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,620
Should we try pairing him up?

486
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,250
He's probably over his mate back on Earth by now.

487
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,540
Yeah? Which one should we pair him with?

488
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,580
Let's see. Who's the best…

489
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,210
Who's the best match?

490
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,720
When Male Mouse 1 was still hung up on his mate on Earth,

491
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:08,560
was there any particular female mouse he had trouble with?

492
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,560
Well…

493
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:16,480
Yeah, this one. Female Mouse 3.

494
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:19,650
Male Mouse 1 bit her pretty badly.

495
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,450
So, I guess not her.

496
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:23,870
She's the perfect match.

497
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,450
I told you, he bit her.

498
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:28,910
It's probably because she kept coming on to him

499
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,420
while he was still heartbroken over his mate.

500
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:35,000
That means Female Mouse 3

501
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,130
was the most forward with him.

502
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,130
Are you sure?

503
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,720
Same goes for humans, right?

504
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,020
When it comes to sex and pregnancy,

505
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,850
I'm the expert.

506
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,520
He's right.

507
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,520
Mouse 3 did throw herself at him. I saw it.

508
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,070
You saw how the fruit fly gave birth in front of me.

509
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:04,530
They must've known an ob-gyn was watching.

510
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:08,450
I'm telling you. They can sense who I am instinctively.

511
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:20,800
Okay, I'll trust you on this then.

512
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,050
Okay. Come here, girl.

513
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,390
All right.

514
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,730
-Commander. -Be gentle.

515
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,770
I guess we have a long night ahead of us.

516
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:47,430
Happy birthday to you

517
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:50,930
Happy birthday, dear Min-jeong

518
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:53,100
Happy birthday to you

519
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,310
Ready? One, two, three.

520
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,690
All right.

521
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,520
Thank you. I love you.

522
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,730
Let's be happy. Love you.

523
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,730
Love you too.

524
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,450
Thank you, Dong-hun.

525
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,100
Let's do it.

526
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,230
I wanna hold his legs.

527
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,690
Screw space law.

528
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,110
Santi.

529
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,240
A mother's waiting for her child.

530
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,490
It's a loving couple.

531
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,740
Plus, I can claim the prize when I get back to Earth in three days.

532
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,120
Let's do it.

533
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:40,410
My heart withers in space.

534
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,670
It becomes smaller and smaller.

535
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,000
It might just disappear.

536
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,670
I can't do it.

537
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,310
Fine.

538
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:03,480
You two stay here. I'll help Mr. Gong all by myself.

539
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:07,270
You know, every day I look at all these girls

540
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,190
again and again

541
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,740
to collect semen samples to send back to Earth

542
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,820
all because I want to have children.

543
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:17,990
It's the same thing with Fantasia. What's the difference?

544
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,410
I'm tired of looking at these damn magazines.

545
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,920
I know my wife would love this.

546
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,430
I know Emma would want me to help Mr. Gong.

547
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,200
I don't understand.

548
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,370
Why isn't he here yet?

549
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:03,830
Wow, he got everything ready.

550
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,750
Jesus!

551
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,220
Santi, Dr. Lee.

552
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,100
What are you doing in that?

553
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:22,970
You can barely move in that suit.

554
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,850
-It makes you really slow. -Exactly.

555
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,900
If I wear this,

556
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,770
my hands will be slow when I move the pipettes, right?

557
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,700
When I move one centimeter, I actually move one micrometer.

558
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:39,240
Wow.

559
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,660
Hey, where's Mina?

560
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,670
Ladies! Wake up already.

561
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:01,390
Goodness. I knew you were drinking too much.

562
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,850
I ground the mung beans. You prepare the chives.

563
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,730
Kim Je-deok faces off against number one in the world, Brazil's…

564
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:36,130
Oh, my gosh. I have to tell him.

565
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,510
Mr. Gong.

566
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:51,230
Where is he? Hello?

567
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:55,280
Where did he go?

568
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:06,950
How about now?

569
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,250
Is it still shaking?

570
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:16,670
They're much steadier now.

571
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,470
Good, just like that.

572
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:28,020
Ladies, let's eat rice with fried eggs and the side dishes we have for breakfast.

573
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,270
-Sounds good. -Okay.

574
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:32,980
Kim seems to be in great shape today, and his balance looks excellent.

575
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:55,420
-Ten points! -Ten points.

576
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,500
He's off to a great start. He's in top form…

577
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:59,880
-Wow. -He got the sperm.

578
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,340
You really are a human microscope. It's amazing.

579
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:07,510
Now, I'll hold the egg with the pipette.

580
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:11,100
At least the egg is bigger.

581
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,710
-Come on. -Come on.

582
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,220
You're good at everything else, but you suck at frying eggs.

583
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,590
-Switch with me. -You do it.

584
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,350
Oh, we're all gonna die.

585
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:50,930
But you barely moved your hand.

586
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,100
How could the pipette shake so much?

587
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:55,100
The first egg is dead.

588
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:58,900
We only have two more left.

589
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,320
Let's try again.

590
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,050
You did it! Toma!

591
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:29,600
I'm going to have a heart attack.

592
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,480
Now, this is the real deal.

593
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:38,150
I'm injecting the sperm…

594
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,570
into the egg.

595
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:45,320
All right. Let's eat.

596
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,240
Kim needs to take a moment

597
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,740
-to gauge the wind and compose himself. -Yes.

598
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:53,040
His left arm holding the bow must stay as still as a block of metal.

599
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,330
It cannot move.

600
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:57,460
He's holding steady, thinking about the position and direction.

601
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,920
If he keeps this up, he can do it.

602
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,460
I know he will.

603
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:04,340
Hold steady, keep the tension, and stay focused until the end.

604
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:06,590
Now, he needs to take a bold shot.

605
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:28,700
Oh, seven points!

606
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:29,820
-Shoot. -Oh, man.

607
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,580
The sperm is outside the egg.

608
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:36,910
My goodness, the second egg died too?

609
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,120
I have to

610
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:41,960
inject the sperm right into the middle…

611
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,750
Right into the middle of the egg.

612
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:01,520
Oh, Mina.

613
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:04,610
Have you seen Mr. Gong?

614
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:10,280
Okay! He got the sperm.

615
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:18,410
One egg left. Let's do it.

616
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:24,670
Mr. Gong?

617
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:29,760
No, I haven't seen Mr. Gong anywhere, Commander!

618
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,970
No?

619
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:34,390
Commander.

620
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:42,560
Why would Mr. Gong be there, Commander?

621
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:57,740
Commander.

622
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,170
Have you seen the tourist?

623
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:11,340
Nope. Maybe he's gone home since you've been so harsh on him.

624
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:26,900
Why are you guys up so late?

625
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,900
Well, I'm just checking, and he's packing

626
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:34,360
since we're going home soon.

627
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,490
Checking and packing this late?

628
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,410
Yup.

629
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:56,720
Have you guys been drinking again?

630
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,140
I'm onto you, you know.

631
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,190
I'll find it.

632
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,780
Farewell drink or something, huh?

633
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:22,790
I let it slide once, but not twice.

634
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,580
I know it was you.

635
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,960
You can drink anytime when you get back, Santi.

636
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:38,430
Commander!

637
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,730
Commander!

638
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:56,200
Yeah, you're right.

639
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,700
Booze? Yeah, we had some.

640
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:03,540
We know it's not allowed, but we were feeling so lonely and tired.

641
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:07,170
We just took one shot. I'm sorry. We shouldn't have.

642
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:11,460
It's just that the station feels so cold.

643
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,760
But I know you're going to make this place

644
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,090
nice and warm.

645
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:20,930
I believe in you.

646
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,290
Where the hell did he go this late at night?

647
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:50,080
Everyone, go to sleep.

648
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:51,790
-Now. -Okay.

649
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:53,670
Good night.

650
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:02,260
You guys are killing me!

651
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:04,810
I'm glad you're here, Mina.

652
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:06,810
Good job, Mina!

653
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:25,200
Where is he?

654
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:46,470
They look like they might actually do it.

655
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:57,980
Oh, my gosh.

656
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,860
Oh, my gosh!

657
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,500
No way. You somehow managed to get the sperm.

658
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,130
But even if you did,

659
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:20,260
are you sure you can inject the sperm straight into the egg

660
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:23,340
with those thick gloves on? They're smaller than a speck of dust.

661
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,230
I can if you'll help me.

662
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:44,950
So you're saying, instead of moving the pipette,

663
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:49,450
you'll move the egg with the culture medium

664
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:54,170
and align it with the tip of the pipette?

665
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:57,340
Yes, place it in a straight line between the pipettes.

666
00:52:58,420 --> 00:52:59,880
In a straight line.

667
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:03,930
Stop.

668
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:18,190
The egg is aligning in the center of the culture medium.

669
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:21,360
If you breathe, the droplet will move.

670
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,030
This is the last egg.

671
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:27,320
The sperm has to go

672
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,910
right into the middle of the egg.

673
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:31,950
Everyone.

674
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:35,580
I need you to hold your breath.

675
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:37,790
Hold your breath.

676
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,170
Okay.

677
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:41,250
One.

678
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:43,130
Two.

679
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,800
Three.

680
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:08,700
Now, this is his final shot.

681
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,990
Kim Je-deok must believe in himself until the end.

682
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,040
Yes, he should stay focused until the last moment. He can do this.

683
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,250
That's right. It's his last arrow!

684
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:17,330
Stay calm.

685
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,080
You got this.

686
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:27,470
Off it goes!

687
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:02,500
I…

688
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,010
am going to save you no matter what.

689
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,000
-Bull's-eye! -Ten points!

690
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:48,300
-Ten points! -He's amazing!

691
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:54,100
It was a perfect shot! Just incredible!

692
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:57,430
Kim Je-deok stayed calm under pressure until the very end…

693
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:00,140
Damn!

694
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:06,940
Holy cow!

695
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:08,440
How is this possible?

696
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,570
You're so…

697
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:16,080
I'm starting to get scared of you.

698
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:18,870
It's all up to you now.

699
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,040
You can do it.

700
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:25,850
Where have you been?

701
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:27,770
Come here, quickly.

702
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,200
Do you hear that?

703
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:41,370
It's the male singing to court the female.

704
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:42,910
Can you hear his serenade? Come on.

705
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:53,340
What sound

706
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:56,050
did you say this was?

707
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,720
It's the male courting the female.

708
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,970
It's pretty loud.

709
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:05,640
I know, right?

710
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:25,910
Think they'll do it now?

711
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:28,710
What?

712
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:06,250
GUEST APPEARANCE BY KIM JE-DEOK

713
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:16,800
GONG RYONG'S 6TH DAY

714
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:25,720
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

715
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,520
When we're back on Earth and standing on solid ground,

716
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,860
let's go out for meals, movies,

717
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:35,320
and walks, just like everyone else.

718
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,150
This doesn't feel right.

719
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:41,910
I'm going to do whatever it takes to bring you a morula.

720
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:42,910
You're lying.

721
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:44,950
-Just with your hands? No way. -Dr. Kang!

722
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:46,660
Kang Kang-su, you son of a bitch!

723
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,790
Oh! Look at this!
