00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,960
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

2
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,470
INCOMING CALL

3
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,730
YI-MANIAC

4
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,170
Hey!

5
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,840
How do you feel? Are you okay?

6
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,760
I'm so embarrassed I don't think I can leave the CQ.

7
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,680
I don't think I'll ever be able to leave this tiny room.

8
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,020
Why not?

9
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,070
What did you do now?

10
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,820
Santi.

11
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,280
I didn't see anything! I know nothing.

12
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,200
Nice, juicy muscles.

13
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,370
From now on, I'm lying low.

14
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,330
I'm going to keep my distance.

15
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,580
I'm going to keep a low profile, make the IVF a success,

16
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,000
and go back as fast as I can.

17
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,710
YESTERDAY

18
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,650
Oh, my God!

19
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,900
Eve, only you can see it now.

20
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,450
Only you can see it!

21
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,710
…you were really going to die...

22
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,470
The accident that could've ended with just me dying almost killed two people.

23
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,090
Have you been drinking?

24
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,220
Yeah.

25
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,470
Look, what did I do that was so wrong?

26
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,220
Even if I could go back, I'd do the same thing.

27
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,690
Open up the hatch, jump out like an idiot, and save you.

28
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,100
Would I have been rewarded

29
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,860
if I had let you die while decompressing and suiting up?

30
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,190
What I did was good. I did the right thing.

31
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,110
Give me a pat and tell me I did the right thing.

32
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,990
Come on, just say thank you.

33
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,330
Where did you get the alcohol?

34
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,080
Is it okay if I like you?

35
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,710
No?

36
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,130
-You're drunk. -I'm not drunk at all.

37
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,470
Is that okay?

38
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,060
It's not okay.

39
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,480
Think about it before you answer.

40
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,570
I'll give you some time.

41
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,780
Hey!

42
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,990
I don't need time.

43
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,870
It's a question that doesn't deserve consideration.

44
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,910
You come here drunk and talking nonsense. Why should I answer that?

45
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,160
We both have partners.

46
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,210
Are you crazy?

47
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,250
Actually, you've been acting crazy all day.

48
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,590
All day long, from the minute you jumped out into space to save me.

49
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,640
And then you had a drink, which is off-limits…

50
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,350
Are you crazy? Are you nuts?

51
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,190
Just shut your mouth and go to sleep.

52
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,110
Does it make you feel better to dismiss this

53
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,070
as me just being a stupid drunk?

54
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,070
You can't even get drunk up here.

55
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,950
A few drops of alcohol just made me a bit braver, is all.

56
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,330
Get out.

57
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,540
I'm going back down in a few days.

58
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,040
You won't be back for a year, so I have to say this now.

59
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,340
I can't go back to Earth pretending like nothing happened here.

60
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,760
I don't want to lie to myself.

61
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,390
Leave.

62
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,060
-Get out. -Come on, wait a second.

63
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,060
-Get out! Now! -Just wait.

64
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,310
Get out.

65
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,690
I said get out!

66
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,030
Come on, Commander.

67
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,690
Commander.

68
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,870
Hello?

69
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,630
Mr. Gong?

70
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,510
Mr. Gong, are you sleeping?

71
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,730
He really put a dent in it.

72
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,540
You scared me!

73
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,460
Why did you open the door?

74
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,170
Curious if I left?

75
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,090
No, I'm not curious.

76
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,640
What the hell?

77
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:57,980
What's with you?

78
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,060
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

79
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,650
Stop it, I'm serious!

80
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,270
I came in because you opened the door.

81
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,240
If you hadn't, I wouldn't have been able to come in.

82
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,990
I'm not that bold or shameless.

83
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,200
Thank you.

84
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,240
It's because you were annoying me.

85
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,910
If you hadn't left, I would have kicked you out.

86
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,040
It's nice

87
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,710
that you were curious.

88
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,130
Come on, do you know how hard it was

89
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,260
to work up the nerve to come and tell you?

90
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,680
It'd be so unfair to be kicked out without finishing what I came to say.

91
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,770
I'm not expecting you to answer on the spot.

92
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:39,440
I know how strange I'm acting.

93
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,940
As an ob-gyn,

94
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,230
I only see women in the OR, exam room, and ER.

95
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,530
I'm always in one of those places, surrounded by pregnant women,

96
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,070
so I only see women as patients.

97
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,160
But this weightlessness has done something to my heart.

98
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,290
You made me like this.

99
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,870
You slapped me silly and made me like this.

100
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,170
You and zero gravity are responsible.

101
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,500
Let me slap some sense back into you. Come here.

102
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,510
Whoa! I don't care how much I like you.

103
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,340
I'm not getting slapped again.

104
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,550
Listen carefully.

105
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,560
In four days, after you go back to Earth,

106
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,980
I'm never going to see you again. The end.

107
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,150
You know how strong alcohol is up here?

108
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,110
But you drank it anyway, and then, this.

109
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,030
You break into the commander's room,

110
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,570
and then go and hit on the commander.

111
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,410
This is unacceptable.

112
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,120
I'm reporting this to IOU Mission Control immediately.

113
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,660
Be prepared.

114
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,080
Go ahead, report it.

115
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,920
Then the whole world will find out that the tourist likes the commander.

116
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,510
What will the crew think of me if they find out about this?

117
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,270
She's getting involved with a tourist who's only here for a few days?

118
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,690
The idea of me getting tangled up with the fiancé of a wealthy heiress

119
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,020
is utterly mortifying.

120
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,360
It's appalling.

121
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,080
I'm going back to being a doctor

122
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,790
and cutting ties with MZ Group.

123
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,670
I'm not comfortable being part of MZ. Plus, it doesn't suit me.

124
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm just a tourist who's here for a few days,

125
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,170
so I get why it would be hard for you to open up to me.

126
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,260
Plus, you're taken.

127
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,550
So, of course, right now it's impossible.

128
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,720
But,

129
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,850
a year from now, if you find yourself alone,

130
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,390
think of me.

131
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,310
If you're with someone better than me, then keep him.

132
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,650
But if I get lucky and you're stuck

133
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,900
with a bunch of losers, then…

134
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,820
maybe we can date.

135
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,200
I'll wait.

136
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,380
Don't do that either.

137
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,590
Who says you get to wait?

138
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,720
No thanks.

139
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,140
You absolutely cannot have feelings for me.

140
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,560
This is an order.

141
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,480
You absolutely cannot have feelings for me.

142
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,360
Does an order like that exist in space?

143
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,570
You're not even in the same league as the guys I know.

144
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,240
Am I so unattractive?

145
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,490
-That's correct. -In what way?

146
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,870
-In every way. -Every way?

147
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,200
Yes, in every way.

148
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,460
Fine.

149
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,590
I got it.

150
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,850
You don't look like you get it.

151
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,390
I'm not an idiot.

152
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,650
Get some rest.

153
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,270
Where did you get the alcohol?

154
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,570
-From the observation module? -No.

155
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,280
-Did Santi give it to you? -No.

156
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,080
After I report this to MCC,

157
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,790
I'm going to find the booze and the culprit.

158
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,000
Understood?

159
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,920
No.

160
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,150
Santi!

161
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,400
Santi!

162
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,780
I'm so sorry.

163
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,790
You guys almost got caught because of me. Sorry.

164
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,500
Oh, you mean the drinks?

165
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,790
I'm an expert at not getting caught.

166
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,510
Where is the drink?

167
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,310
Ta-da.

168
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,110
We don't have any experiments going on right now.

169
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,240
So, nothing to cultivate, and they keep it shut down.

170
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,780
Isn't this an incubator?

171
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,830
It is an alcohol storage for now.

172
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,660
Maybe other astronauts can use it.

173
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,670
Nah, why would they?

174
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,000
They probably forgot I have this over here.

175
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,170
They have the same exact machines on that side as on this side,

176
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,050
but those are way newer.

177
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,630
They would never come over here to use the ones on this side.

178
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,140
Santi?

179
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,430
This bottle…

180
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,310
Let's hide it in a safer place.

181
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,980
A safer place?

182
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:13,890
Yes.

183
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,440
The commander first suspected you.

184
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,110
How about we hide it somewhere else?

185
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:25,200
Not the observation module where you sleep, right?

186
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,620
Do you get what I'm saying?

187
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,660
I got you.

188
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,550
SEOUL, 4:27 A.M. ILS 7:27 P.M.

189
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,140
Change the water and go to sleep, Seung-jun.

190
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,520
ILS needs to sleep so we can go home.

191
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,060
Please, let us get some rest.

192
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,060
Okay.

193
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,400
I think I saw mold growing on the Japanese mustard greens.

194
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,610
Can you ask Mina to check it? I can't reach her.

195
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,150
She's probably sleeping because she's tired.

196
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,530
But it'll probably spread.

197
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,580
You won't be satisfied until you wake her up, will you, Si-won?

198
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,790
Yup.

199
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,000
But how?

200
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,750
He saw it for a split second.

201
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,460
How did Mr. Gong know that was Kang Kang-su's ticket?

202
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,800
The same thing is written on a picture in Dr. Kang's bedroom.

203
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,260
Stand by me?

204
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,140
Oh, my God.

205
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,520
Do you know how embarrassed I was as an astronaut

206
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,520
to be caught like that in front of a tourist?

207
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,690
I want to crawl into the butthole of one of Dr. Kang's fruit flies and hide.

208
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:46,740
First of all, calm down.

209
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,110
Calm down.

210
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,780
He told me I could keep it and that he wouldn't tell Dr. Kang.

211
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,540
But how can I believe him, Dona?

212
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:59,040
On top of that, he wants me to do him a favor.

213
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,420
He's letting me have 500 billion. Just imagine what he'll ask for in return!

214
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,420
Well, it's not like he would ask you to kill someone.

215
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,340
Just do whatever he asks!

216
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,890
I've only known him for four days.

217
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:17,480
He just went outside without a spacewalk suit on

218
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,400
and jumped into space. He's nuts.

219
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,020
How am I supposed to know what a lunatic like that is going to ask?

220
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:26,780
Damn it.

221
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:32,280
Dona, I'm so scared. I feel like Dr. Kang is going to come for me any second.

222
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,120
I'm so anxious that I can't breathe.

223
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,330
Screw the 500 billion won,

224
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,710
even if you gave me a trillion won, I can't.

225
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:42,710
I'm just going to give back the lottery ticket.

226
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,840
Hey.

227
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,840
Wait. Hang on, Mina!

228
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,130
Mina, wait a minute. Mina!

229
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,800
So let's say we keep it.

230
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:57,220
We only have a month to claim the winnings, right?

231
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:01,770
I'm not on the manifest to go back on the G.O-10 when it leaves in a few days.

232
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,440
Only Santi, Kang Kang-su, and Gong Ryong are scheduled to go back down.

233
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,940
How do we claim this money?

234
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:11,070
I'll alter your chart to show that your hormones are out of whack.

235
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,410
They'll have to send you back first,

236
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,660
and I'll make it happen.

237
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,200
Are you out of your mind?

238
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,160
Aren't you a doctor?

239
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,130
If we get caught, we're both finished in this industry.

240
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:27,500
Dona, the money is getting to your head. Oh, God.

241
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,300
Forget it. There's no way we can claim this money.

242
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,350
I'm going to give it back.

243
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,020
Bye.

244
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,020
Hey, wait.

245
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:47,940
Mina!

246
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,540
Where the hell is it?

247
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,580
Dr. Kang, I have something to tell you.

248
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,060
Dr. Lee!

249
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,230
What are you two doing up instead of sleeping?

250
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,110
Do you have a new pair of micro scissors?

251
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,820
Why?

252
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,070
Can't you just lend them to me?

253
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,740
Why do you always have to ask why?

254
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,410
I don't have any.

255
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,540
If you don't have any, then why ask why?

256
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,580
Dr. Kang, I have something to tell you.

257
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,960
Again with the gloves.

258
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,130
When you touch moldy greens, they get covered in spores.

259
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,300
How many times have I told you to use them once and discard them?

260
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,050
What if those spores contaminate my fruit flies?

261
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,100
Proper disposal of gloves after use is essential for scientists.

262
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,980
Why would you carry those around? How much money do you think you're saving?

263
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,100
And my micro scissors.

264
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,900
You used them on your tomatoes, and now they're damaged.

265
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,690
They don't work with precision anymore, so I end up doing my work twice.

266
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,700
I didn't damage your scissors.

267
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,450
Did you think I wouldn't notice if they were off by 0.00001 mm?

268
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,370
They've only been like that since you used them.

269
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,620
I sterilized the gloves and...

270
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,870
What did you want to say?

271
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,130
Who the hell put this mouse food here?

272
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,960
Those damn mice eat like pigs.

273
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,220
Hey.

274
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,550
What were you going to say?

275
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,430
What?

276
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,060
Want me to buy you more gloves? They cost nothing.

277
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,520
I'll get you an unlimited supply,

278
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,190
so how about we stop nagging about money?

279
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,110
You're a scientist. Gloves, seriously?

280
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,400
Were you born a jerk, Dr. Kang?

281
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,700
What did you say?

282
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,950
What, so a scientist asks, Why?  Is that such a bad thing?

283
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,620
Isn't why the word that should be most frequently used

284
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,540
by a scientist?

285
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,960
Why are you bragging about being rich?

286
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,420
For the love of God, why?

287
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,380
Come on. Why are you two being like this?

288
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,460
That's what you wanted to tell me?

289
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,010
Yes!

290
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,510
No!

291
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,060
Yes!

292
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,020
Don't throw them in there.

293
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,820
The spores could fly around and kill my fruit flies.

294
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,530
I told you, I sterilized them!

295
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,860
Dispose of them in your lab.

296
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,860
This trash bin is for public use.

297
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,410
I don't care how much money you have.

298
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,540
This trash bin doesn't belong to you.

299
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,910
It's for the whole planet, got it?

300
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,460
Even if I were drowning in debt,

301
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,830
this trash bin would be

302
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:22,050
public property for everyone on Earth, including me, okay?

303
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,140
She's so damn loud.

304
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,440
KOREA SPACE AGENCY

305
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,730
Why is my hand tingling?

306
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,900
It feels like it's going numb.

307
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,530
-Tae-hui. -Yeah?

308
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,120
Can I have this watch someday?

309
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,280
Why?

310
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,870
Isn't this supposed to be passed down to the best student?

311
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:36,620
I'll wear it for a bit, then pass it down to her.

312
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,790
Let go of my hand already.

313
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,000
You're so bossy.

314
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,090
Eve, what did you eat today?

315
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,170
What? I…

316
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,640
I… Well…

317
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,560
I don't remember.

318
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,770
What?

319
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,430
You don't remember your last meal on Earth?

320
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,850
My mind is blank, Commander.

321
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,570
That's totally normal.

322
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,280
That's how I was on my first flight.

323
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,200
Eve, you worked really hard to get here.

324
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,870
Today, just sit back and enjoy.

325
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,450
Yes, Commander.

326
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,620
Here, take a look.

327
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,130
That space suit really suits you.

328
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,470
Beautiful, right? Don't you think?

329
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,430
Dong-a, please.

330
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,100
See? I mean it.

331
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,650
That idiot doesn't deserve this.

332
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,240
I thought you were going to call Eve.

333
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,330
She's not answering. Must be asleep.

334
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,130
When will you be done with the handover?

335
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,340
At this rate, you'll be coming in every day.

336
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,510
I've been here for over three years.

337
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,550
I need time to say goodbye.

338
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,780
I really hate that you're leaving.

339
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,100
Hi, Ryong.

340
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,890
-Go-eun. -I'm sorry.

341
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,360
I announced our engagement without talking to you.

342
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,690
It must've been a shock.

343
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,570
I'm sorry.

344
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,030
I'm a lousy guy.

345
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,820
Why would you say that?

346
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:00,580
You're doing a great job.

347
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,290
You managed to do the surgery, and you're doing so well, so why?

348
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:09,210
I'm the one who's sorry Kang Kang-su stepped in and took over.

349
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,500
I'm too embarrassed to face you.

350
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,920
So, why would you say that?

351
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,050
I…

352
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,890
I'm not good enough for you.

353
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,720
That's not true.

354
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:25,770
It's not because of Kang Kang-su, it's because of me.

355
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,320
I…

356
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,280
am not getting engaged to you.

357
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,660
I'm sorry.

358
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,330
I'm really sorry.

359
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,910

00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,040
CLOSED FOR LUNCH TODAY

361
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,260
I can't do a good reading if I'm hungry.

362
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,390
Wait.

363
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,520
Have some water.

364
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,820
Unlucky, really unlucky.

365
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,910
This guy is really unlucky.

366
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,530
Is he really your son?

367
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,580
-Yes. -Yes.

368
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:14,250
He is like a solitary pine tree

369
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,460
standing alone on a rock.

370
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,170
He has no luck with parents,

371
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,470
no luck with money,

372
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,220
and no luck with his career.

373
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,510
Forget that. Does he have luck with women?

374
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,730
You cut this out.

375
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,690
How did he meet someone like her?

376
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:40,030
Her lineage has brought her great fortune.

377
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,700
She has it all.

378
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,830
Wow, her face has money written all over it.

379
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:53,120
Of all the faces I've seen, hers is the most auspicious.

380
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:58,420
Okay, so her face is auspicious.

381
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,510
Are you saying they don't suit each other?

382
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,680
No.

383
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,590
They'll have a happy marriage.

384
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,850
He marries her, and everything she has becomes his.

385
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,020
A match made in heaven.

386
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,310
A match that happens once in a thousand years.

387
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,820
-Wow, a thousand years. -It all becomes his.

388
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,940
Forget a hundred.

389
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:23,030
So what you're saying is, they don't suit each other,

390
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,780
but they'll be happily married?

391
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:28,780
Are you saying our son will be respected and get to call the shots?

392
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,700
He's already calling the shots.

393
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,160
She's more into him.

394
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,750
-Thank you. -Thank you so much.

395
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,170
So, which of you is his mom?

396
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,180
You're the fortune teller. Take a guess.

397
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,980
That's easy. Only one of you has had a baby.

398
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,910
Did you get through to the space station?

399
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:14,620
I'm not good enough for you.

400
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,620
I…

401
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,630
am not getting engaged to you.

402
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,090
What do you want to eat?

403
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,620
You go first.

404
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,080
Get in.

405
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,440
What floor?

406
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,530
You need to press the button.

407
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,700
Are you expecting me to press it?

408
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,990
I said, what floor?

409
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,880
I made a mistake yesterday. I'm sorry.

410
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,010
Ryong and I will spend the rest of our lives trying to make it up to you.

411
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,470
Ryong feels the same way.

412
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,760
You liked Kang-su too.

413
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:59,180
You liked him, but now you hate his guts.

414
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:01,940
Over time, you'll hate Ryong too.

415
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,770
Ryong doesn't like you as much as you like him.

416
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,900
-I know. -You do?

417
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,820
What's wrong with you?

418
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,700
What could you possibly lack? Are you missing a nostril?

419
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,330
Are you missing an eye?

420
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:18,750
Why isn't the daughter of Choi Jae-ryong being showered with love?

421
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,290
Why is she clinging to a man?

422
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,710
You think I like Kang-su because of his deep pockets?

423
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:26,840
It's because his feelings for you

424
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,130
are much deeper than Ryong's.

425
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:38,100
Kang-su stole the eggs and sperm to bring Ryong down.

426
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:41,690
He's trying to show off, but he's got nothing to show.

427
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,310
He's never going to pull it off.

428
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,620
-One last breath. Can the father help too? -Yes.

429
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,950
Last one, breathe.

430
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:57,870
Breathe.

431
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,960
-Congratulations. -Thank you.

432
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,830
You're parents now.

433
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:06,880
Dr. Jeon.

434
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,210
Have you heard from Dr. Gong? Is everything okay?

435
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,260
Oh, I meant to get in touch with you.

436
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,890
I had a lot of deliveries scheduled.

437
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,940
Ryong is fine, and he successfully retrieved the eggs.

438
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,020
He pulled it off without anyone catching on.

439
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:32,150
Then Dr. Gong can work on the procedure too.

440
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,240
What a relief.

441
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,740
Have you had lunch?

442
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,830
I knew it, you haven't eaten again. Let's grab lunch.

443
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:43,210
Ryong almost died trying to get them back.

444
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,620
He risked his life, so you need to eat properly.

445
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,380
You're right. Let's go.

446
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:55,840
I hope Ryong succeeds and brings Kang Kang-su down a peg.

447
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,760
I trust Dr. Gong.

448
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,390
I know he'll get the job done.

449
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,350
I need you to come with me. Chairman Choi is asking for you.

450
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,320
RESTRICTED AREA

451
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,280
For it to be a pregnancy, the fertilized egg must look like this.

452
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,200
I got a message saying that

453
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,320
six of the seven eggs Dr. Kang worked on were fertilized.

454
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,910
Six of them are pregnancies?

455
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Yes, sir.

456
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,210
We've never had a successful fertilization here. Congratulations.

457
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:31,500
If the last one fertilizes too, won't that make seven?

458
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,510
Kang-su's the man.

459
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,430
I knew he could pull it off.

460
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,060
See, Go-eun? I told you Kang-su could do it.

461
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,440
Ryong couldn't do it even after multiple attempts,

462
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,190
but Kang-su did it on his first try.

463
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,980
Do you still think you're right?

464
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:56,070
Hey, send me pictures of my grandchildren.

465
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,110
Pardon?

466
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,700
Forget those pictures of other people's fertilized eggs.

467
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:06,040
I want pictures of my grandchildren. The ones my son and my daughter-in-law

468
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,500
are going to have.

469
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,330
Oh, right. I'll pass the request along to Dr. Kang.

470
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:15,340
Now, we freeze them, ship them back to Earth,

471
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,260
and then implant them in my daughter-in-law, correct?

472
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:25,100
So, it's all finished now, isn't it? We're done, right?

473
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,190
How do you feel, Min-jeong?

474
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,320
Given that you were upset with me for changing your primary doctor

475
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,980
without your consent,

476
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:37,780
I'm going to ask for your approval in front of everyone.

477
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,700
You said you were the mother, right?

478
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,370
You said you were in charge?

479
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:43,660
You said you'd make the decisions?

480
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,540
So, what do you say? Should we tell Kang-su to stop?

481
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,710
You decide.

482
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:52,250
Are you going to reject what Kang-su has achieved?

483
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,750
Answer me.

484
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,680
If you say you want to continue, we will.

485
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,850
Otherwise, I'll tell him to stop.

486
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,680
Should we continue?

487
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,360
Have they developed into morulas?

488
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,650
Min-jeong.

489
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:20,400
Morulas?

490
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:24,280
Once a fertilized egg has divided into 16 cells,

491
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,290
it is then called a morula.

492
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:28,870
At this stage, it can implant in the uterus.

493
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,210
When does that happen?

494
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:32,670
It could happen as early as tonight.

495
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,510
What do you want to do?

496
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,720
Still going to insist on Ryong?

497
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,510
Should we turn off the incubator?

498
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,740
Thank you.

499
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:06,950
Father.

500
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,750
It's done.

501
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:17,000
Go-eun, it's over.

502
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,670
What time is it there? Isn't it morning?

503
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,810
GONG RYONG'S 5TH DAY

504
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,720
You're really not going to say anything?

505
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,430
You're not going to ask to split the money or anything?

506
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,390
That's right.

507
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,680
You said, No questions asked.

508
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:17,350
What is it you need my help with?

509
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,440
You don't want me to ask or question you about it,

510
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,730
and just do as you say.

511
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,900
What on earth is it?

512
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,990
What, do you really want me to kill someone?

513
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,910
I can't do it.

514
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,710
I'm going to turn myself in to Dr. Kang.

515
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,290
It's the opposite.

516
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:45,260
I want you to save someone, the same way we saved that mouse.

517
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,350
Tell me what it is right now.

518
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,140
It's simple.

519
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:58,650
All you have to do is hold my legs.

520
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,950
What?

521
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,450
Sueños húmedos,

522
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,700
cabalgata caliente…

523
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:21,130
Dirty confessions.

524
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,590
Morning.

525
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,930
Yeah.

526
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,220
That sucks

527
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,350
having to do this every day, every morning.

528
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,480
Yeah, I'm sick of it too, man.

529
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:40,980
I…

530
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:42,940
I miss my wife.

531
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:47,530
I miss my home.

532
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,040
You said you wanted to get a new house, right?

533
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,370
Yeah. I mean, I want to.

534
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:03,630
Then you will need

535
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,800
money, right?

536
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:10,800
Yeah.

537
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,840
Yeah?

538
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,470
Okay.

539
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:59,270
KING OF MONEY

540
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,150
How's Male Mouse 1's mate back on Earth doing?

541
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,360
His mate

542
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:18,030
is eating, sleeping, and playing well. She's doing great.

543
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,080
Her coat shines. She's also chubby and pretty.

544
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,080
Male Mouse 1 had the best appetite and libido

545
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,590
of any mouse on Earth.

546
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:29,130
He had the strongest sperm. He was truly exceptional.

547
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:31,050
That's why he went to space.

548
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:36,010
I have no idea how he'll ever recover.

549
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,220
Where's Chief Kang?

550
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:41,020
She's not in yet.

551
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,270
Really?

552
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,320
Who could be calling?

553
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,790
I wonder who it is.

554
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,630
Maybe it's something urgent.

555
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,050
Looks like they hung up.

556
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:17,050
Dong-a, hang on a second.

557
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,100
You can call them later.

558
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,930
That tickles!

559
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,480
Stop it. Hang on. Time out.

560
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:35,110
I heard rumors that you were into Eve.

561
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,030
Did I hear wrong?

562
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,370
It's true?

563
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,290
No.

564
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,580
I don't think Eve is interested in men.

565
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,340
She doesn't seem to be dating anyone.

566
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:56,380
Applying to go away for a year says it all.

567
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:01,760
Eve doesn't know much about men.

568
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,520
Cut it out.

569
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:14,900
Aren't you going to go to work? Stop it, come on.

570
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,990
Come on, stop.

571
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:19,800
Where's the bottle of liquor? Where did you hide it?

572
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,090
I don't know.

573
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:26,060
You're always lying.

574
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:30,980
Why do all men do that?

575
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,310
I have nothing more to say.

576
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:37,820
This liar is going to leave now.

577
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,530
They're worse than animals.

578
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:43,870
Men who betray women are absolute trash.

579
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,740
They're foul and repulsive.

580
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,620
They make me sick to my stomach.

581
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,330
What?

582
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:53,580
We've been here for how long?

583
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:55,710
When their partner is out of sight,

584
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:58,510
do men just toss aside their faith, loyalty, and trust?

585
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:01,050
Are they just mammals that throw everything away

586
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,760
when they take off their pants?

587
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:07,140
Do men just like any woman they meet?

588
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:09,430
Please stop.

589
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:13,060
I get it, okay?

590
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,980
Turning me down is one thing,

591
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,020
but aren't you being a little harsh?

592
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:19,900
Do you actually want to see me die of embarrassment?

593
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:22,740
Should I show you how to die in space from humiliation?

594
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:25,990
Being classified as a mammal alongside men

595
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:28,330
is absolutely mortifying for me.

596
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,040
That's all.

597
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:33,120
Yes, I am a mammal!

598
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,130
What?

599
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:40,670
What?

600
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:48,010
CHIEF KANG TAE-HUI

601
00:44:57,610 --> 00:44:58,940
Seriously…

602
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:38,730
Hi.

603
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:40,940
Hey, you called.

604
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,110
What's up?

605
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,240
Is something wrong? Why did you call?

606
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,500
I think there's booze onboard.

607
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,790
At the space station?

608
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,330
Who's the culprit?

609
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:02,550
Do you think Mr. Gong took it up there?

610
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:03,510
Is it soju?

611
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:05,050
Whisky? Cognac?

612
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,470
Lee Seung-jun…

613
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:09,050
It's Santi, right?

614
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:12,100
I haven't found the bottle. They're denying it.

615
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,060
When I wanted to install a camera in every module,

616
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:18,020
they complained about their human rights. Now I know why.

617
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,940
Do whatever it takes to find evidence, okay?

618
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:24,110
If you can't control them from the start, the entire year will be hell.

619
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:25,940
If they conduct experiments in secret,

620
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:28,200
disobey orders, shift the blame onto others,

621
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,160
and ignore the manual, it will quickly become chaos.

622
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,660
Let me tell you, when I first took command,

623
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,000
I caught someone drinking alcohol they had hidden.

624
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,370
Sometimes, the experienced ones

625
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:42,000
think they have the right to overstep boundaries.

626
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:45,340
In cases like that, don't hesitate. Report it immediately.

627
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,470
After they were disciplined, had their pay cut,

628
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:51,050
and were passed over for promotions, they fell in line real quick.

629
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,680
After that, being commander was a piece of cake.

630
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,230
Right.

631
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:59,440
They obviously hid it in the observation module.

632
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,940
Search every inch of it.

633
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,020
I will.

634
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:23,840
What? Mammal?

635
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,090
What was that about?

636
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,200
DR. NA MIN-JEONG

637
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,290
Hi, Dr. Na.

638
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:00,960
I have the eggs and sperm, and I found an incubator.

639
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:04,880
If I work on it tonight, they should be morulas by the time I leave.

640
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,460
Don't worry. You just take care of your health.

641
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:09,760
Don't do it.

642
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:11,510
What?

643
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,300
Dr. Kang Kang-su can take over.

644
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,930
What are you talking about?

645
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:21,560
I changed my mind.

646
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,520
If you get caught, you'll be in danger.

647
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,480
Don't worry about me. I can get this done.

648
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:28,820
If you get caught,

649
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:31,320
it could jeopardize Dr. Kang's work.

650
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:34,530
I've got to go.

651
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:37,330
Wait, Dr. Na?

652
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,260
DR. GONG RYONG

653
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:03,810
MISSED CALL

654
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:14,990
I want to go home.

655
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:13,300
Yes!

656
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:27,100
KANG KANG-SU

657
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,610
Hey, Kang-su.

658
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:32,860
Sir, this is going to make you happy.

659
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,490
All seven of them

660
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:38,570
have undergone cell division and developed into morulas.

661
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:40,360
They are ready to be implanted.

662
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:42,950
It's done.

663
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:45,750
Now we just have to freeze them and take them back to Earth.

664
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:47,830
Congratulations, sir.

665
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,210
Lee!

666
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:54,000
Yes, sir.

667
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:58,550
I want you to take a picture of my grandchildren right now.

668
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:01,890
Take their picture and send them to me immediately.

669
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:02,890
I'm sorry?

670
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:06,810
I have to be the first to see my grandchildren.

671
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:08,520
Do it right now!

672
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,100
We did it. It's done.

673
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:15,190
Yes, sir. Please give me a second.

674
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:19,030
From one to seven, don't leave a single one out.

675
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,240
Do it now!

676
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,330
-Gather everyone. -Yes, sir.

677
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:29,540
-Sir. -Chairman Choi, you're here.

678
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,580
Who wants some fried chicken?

679
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:10,470
The first one…

680
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,440
A son.

681
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:27,870
The second…

682
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:30,450
A daughter.

683
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:39,040
Where is Santi?

684
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,550
Is he in the observation module?

685
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:43,800
He's not there.

686
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:47,260
Then he's in the observation module.

687
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:49,390
You lie every time you open your mouth.

688
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,930
I told you, I drank it by myself.

689
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,900
He should be collecting a sample right about now.

690
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:01,480
Let's see if I'm right.

691
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,950
The sixth is a daughter.

692
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,750
And the youngest is a son.

693
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:23,750
Santi!

694
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,670
Commander.

695
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:28,010
Santi.

696
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:32,260
Commander, I'm the only one you need to punish.

697
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:34,020
Santi doesn't know anything, I swear.

698
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:35,810
He's done already?

699
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,100
Where is he?

700
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,980
Come on, Commander.

701
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:46,530
Sir, I finished taking their pictures.

702
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:50,200
I'm sending you pictures of all seven of your grandchildren right now.

703
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:01,330
I did it.

704
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:06,260
I told you, Santi has no idea. He's innocent.

705
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:08,300
Stop lying, and stop following me.

706
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:10,760
Is Santi here?

707
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:13,430
Santi? Why?

708
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,850
Dr. Kang, are you hiding Santi here?

709
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,190
Dr. Kang.

710
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:22,690
I think they were drinking together.

711
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:24,900
Wait.

712
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,820
These are the wrong settings.

713
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:30,240
It's set to 37 degrees, 5% oxygen.

714
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:34,830
Won't the fruit flies die from the heat?

715
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:39,910
I'm doing a cell comparison.

716
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:44,090
I'm simultaneously investigating both damaged human genes

717
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:45,800
and aging fruit fly genes.

718
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:51,220
Wait, didn't we agree to share that information last time?

719
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,220
Why are you looking for Santi here?

720
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,050
Isn't this…

721
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:05,690
What is that picture?

722
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,410
Isn't it obvious?

723
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:17,490
It's an image of a fruit fly embryo undergoing cell division.

724
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:21,250
The scale indicates a measurement of 0.2 mm.

725
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:24,580
At 0.2 mm, that's more the size of a human embryo…

726
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:42,100
Is that a morula?

727
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:49,110
A morula?

728
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,280
-Why is there a morula...-Commander.

729
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,010
Did you fertilize that here?

730
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:17,640
You've been lying to us, pretending to work on fruit flies.

731
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:21,020
You set the incubator to 37 degrees and 5% oxygen

732
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:23,600
to culture human cells?

733
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:29,730
Commander, wait a minute, that...

734
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:30,730
Let go of me.

735
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,280
Dr. Kang.

736
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:37,280
Until now, no human egg has ever been sent into space.

737
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:39,490
Because it's forbidden.

738
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,000
It's wrong to experiment on humans, correct?

739
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,960
You of all people know what we do to mice and fruit flies.

740
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,170
How could you do this with human sperm and eggs…

741
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:51,460
You know it's against space law,

742
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:54,920
so how could you perform an ICSI?

743
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:58,010
Dr. Kang, have you lost it?

744
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:02,180
Do you think this is no different from our countless other experiments?

745
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:05,680
You know why this is banned.

746
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:08,440
How could you even think about

747
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,570
creating a human being at a space station?

748
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:13,110
Eve, calm down.

749
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:17,320
Open that door.

750
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,370
Are you crazy?

751
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,960
Open it now.

752
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:28,960
Open the incubator door this instant.

753
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:34,340
Open the incubator door before I bust it open.

754
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:45,270
Open it before I blow the door off, you bastard!

755
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:06,790
GUEST APPEARANCE BY BAIK JI-WON

756
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:25,970
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

757
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:29,640
Just how did you bring the eggs to the space station?

758
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:32,610
-Did you get caught? -I'm sorry.

759
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,900
He's probably over his mate back on Earth by now.

760
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:41,070
I have to succeed tonight, no matter what.

761
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,620
Ryong will listen to you.

762
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,040
We should give up.

763
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,540
I'll turn a blind eye to the lottery ticket,

764
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:51,580
if you guys will turn a blind eye to what I'm about to do.

765
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:54,130
Facing those risks

766
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:56,130
is the fate this life-form was born with.

767
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,260
This is all a result of my negligence.

768
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:02,010
I will take responsibility and step down.

769
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:08,180
