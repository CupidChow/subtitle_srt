00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,960
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

2
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,380
FLAVORS OF THE MOUNTAIN, SEA, AND SKY

3
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,770
-Cheers. -Cheers.

4
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,650
Drink up. It's on me today.

5
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,790
Jingle bells, jingle bells

6
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,840
TAXI

7
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,380
HWAYANG HAIR SALON

8
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,180
Good evening.

9
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,810
Hard to catch a cab on Christmas Eve, isn't it?

10
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,150
Please head toward Chuncheon Station and stop the cab when it hits 2, 000 won.

11
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,110
Two thousand won?

12
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,070
Yes.

13
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,150
Sure.

14
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,570
DRAFT PHYSICAL EXAMINATION IN EFFECT, 1988

15
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,350
-Thank you. -Of course, thank you.

16
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,180
-Goodbye. -Thank you.

17
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,770
It may not be a snowy Christmas Eve,

18
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,730
but the sky is filled with shining stars.

19
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,280
When you gaze up at the stars, thoughts of the things you long for arise.

20
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,950
In the end, this longing brings us back to the things we cherish most.

21
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,660
Tonight, A Night of Counting the Stars by the poet, Yun Dong-ju, comes to mind.

22
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,000
A star for memories

23
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,920
A star for love

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,710
A star for loneliness

25
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,970
What the… What is this baby doing here?

26
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,720
A star for yearning

27
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,470
A star for poetry

28
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,140
And a star for Mother

29
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,440
Mother

30
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,520
Mother

31
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,650
I am trying to call out A beautiful word for each star

32
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,620
JUSTICE, POLICE

33
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,750
She left the baby in the back of your cab?

34
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:54,670
Yes.

35
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,960
Do you recall anything specific about the passenger?

36
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,130
Let me think…

37
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,300
She smelled like perm solution, the kind women use.

38
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,060
That's right. I picked her up in front of a hair salon.

39
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,270
My goodness. She abandoned her baby on Christmas Eve

40
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,940
without even putting socks on it.

41
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,530
Oh, dear.

42
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,160
The baby is sleeping.

43
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,910
It's sleeping.

44
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,500
Hush now, go to sleep.

45
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,910
Look, the baby is sleeping.

46
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,430
You two are in cahoots, aren't you?

47
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,230
Besides the seven morulas we found, there were more fertilized eggs, right?

48
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,650
That's why Dr. Kang went to the observation module

49
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,230
even though there was debris flying everywhere.

50
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,110
As for you, the camera was an excuse.

51
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,900
You were guarding the incubator while waiting for Dr. Kang.

52
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,740
I'd never team up with this jerk.

53
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,830
We're not in cahoots. We're enemies.

54
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,870
What are you guys doing here at this hour?

55
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,870
How many eggs did you take up there?

56
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,960
Ten?

57
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,250
Twenty?

58
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,420
Look at the CCTV footage.

59
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,310
You were going back and forth to collect the remaining fertilized eggs.

60
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,310
You took whatever was in the incubator in the observation module

61
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,560
and got on the escape ship, right?

62
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,400
When nobody knew where the tourist was,

63
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,030
you were the only one who said he was in the observation module.

64
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,860
You two met in there, right?

65
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,780
The story about unplugging the camera cable was a cover.

66
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,160
When Dr. Kang took the eggs out of the incubator,

67
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,580
why didn't you say anything?

68
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,540
That's because you two are working together.

69
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,210
That's why you kept your mouths shut.

70
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,960
So there was another incubator in the observation module.

71
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,880
It was on for 40 hours, but we had no clue.

72
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,930
If you take fertilized eggs out of the incubator,

73
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,430
they die.

74
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,100
If it was turned on for 40 hours as per the records,

75
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,770
then they weren't morulas yet,

76
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,770
which means they were fertilized eggs.

77
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,520
So he would've had to bring back the whole incubator.

78
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,730
You'd have to bring it to the escape ship and secretly hook it up.

79
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,820
But look.

80
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,700
Take a look!

81
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,620
When I came back to the main module, I was empty-handed.

82
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,910
That's right. Your suspicion is wrong.

83
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,580
Dr. Kang simply came to take me to the escape ship.

84
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,170
Let me tell you as an ob-gyn.

85
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,840
If it was on for 40 hours, it would be pointless even if they were brought back.

86
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,880
Shut your mouth.

87
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,460
I can't believe a word you say anymore.

88
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,430
Now I have to go back and review the report you wrote.

89
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,270
Chief, Gong Ryong is right.

90
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,190
If the remaining fertilized eggs were in that incubator,

91
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,610
someone determined to bring them down

92
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,480
wouldn't have acted like Dr. Kang on the CCTV.

93
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,360
He would have moved the entire incubator to the Scorpion

94
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,070
to keep it plugged in.

95
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,620
If he had just taken them out and put them in his pocket,

96
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,580
it wouldn't have taken long for them to die.

97
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,660
What they're saying is right.

98
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,370
He didn't have the incubator strapped on,

99
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,120
and he was moving effortlessly.

100
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,960
He didn't bring back anything.

101
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,340
If there were fertilized eggs in there,

102
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,840
he would've had to bring the entire incubator with him.

103
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,700
Thanks, Kang.

104
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,990
We're on the same team now.

105
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,830
I wasn't helping you.

106
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,210
We're on the same side now.

107
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,250
It wasn't for you.

108
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,750
There's no turning back now.

109
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,130
I said it wasn't for you.

110
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
See you!

111
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,930
Check to see

112
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,350
if either Kang-su or the tourist declared anything odd before they went up.

113
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
Yes, Chief.

114
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,620
GONG RYONG

115
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
Thank you.

116
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,350
Is it serious?

117
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,270
How serious are you about it?

118
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,690
-What do you mean? -Your feelings for Eve.

119
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,070
CALLS, GONG RYONG

120
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,710
Don't let Eve struggle through the storm you created.

121
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,420
I hope you don't think an umbrella will protect her from it.

122
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,470
It was tough for her to grow up in an American family and become a commander.

123
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,220
She had to wait a long time for her shot.

124
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,640
I don't find you trustworthy at all.

125
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,020
Please, I'm asking you not to make things confusing for Eve.

126
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,270
I admit

127
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,360
that I'm not a very trustworthy guy.

128
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,440
I agree.

129
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,740
And I don't have much except for this umbrella.

130
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,160
She's going up in a few days,

131
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,210
and I won't be able to see her for a year, or maybe longer.

132
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,080
She doesn't have any family…

133
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,710
so wouldn't it be nice if she had…

134
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,550
at least one person back here on Earth who had her back?

135
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,520
Won't you give me a chance?

136
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,570
CALLS, GONG RYONG

137
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,120
KOREA SPACE AGENCY

138
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,730
All right, Number 3.

139
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,360
And…

140
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,650
What are you doing?

141
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,280
EVE KIM

142
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,790
EVE KIM

143
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,680
This is driving me crazy. Why isn't anyone answering?

144
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,570
It's okay. Let me take a look.

145
00:11:59,050 --> 00:11:59,880
Hi, Eve.

146
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,550
I think she's pregnant.

147
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,430
Really?

148
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,220
Where are you?

149
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,310
Are you in the lab?

150
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,730
What about the ultrasound? Did you do an ultrasound?

151
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,360
No, not yet. I'm going to do it now.

152
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,110
Okay. First, take a deep breath.

153
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,820
Is it okay if I go there? I'll head over there right now.

154
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,780
Then can you drop by my place and grab some hair removal cream?

155
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,080
Bring it just in case.

156
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,080
I'll get the anesthesia and ultrasound ready.

157
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,960
Okay, got it.

158
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,840
Where is it?

159
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,620
NATIONAL CENTER FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD

160
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,870
If any space debris comes at us,

161
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,630
we load the mice onto the cargo ship following the one-mouse-per-cage rule.

162
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:23,840
From the moment we arrived in Florida until the other day when we got to Seoul,

163
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,590
it was one mouse per cage.

164
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,340
In Seoul, she's had zero contact with a male mouse.

165
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,760
They were only together at the station.

166
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,270
No, we can do a DNA test here.

167
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,100
In three hours, we'll know who the father is.

168
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,730
But I'm absolutely sure.

169
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,520
When we cut the power to move them and the camera was off,

170
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,650
in that short window while we were prepping the cages,

171
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,490
that's when they did it.

172
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:49,700
Well, you know how mice are more sensitive than humans in a crisis or disaster.

173
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,700
They must have felt threatened because of the space debris,

174
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,910
which turbocharged their reproductive instinct.

175
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,290
But we still don't know for sure, not yet.

176
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,040
She built a nest to prepare to give birth,

177
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,840
and her stomach is protruding, but…

178
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,170
I mean, how awesome would it be if she was pregnant? Please.

179
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,470
-Eve. -Did you find it?

180
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,050
Okay, that's it.

181
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,850
A round belly and a nest must mean she's pregnant, no?

182
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:16,930
There…

183
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:21,150
Sometimes mice build nests just to have a place to live.

184
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,110
Okay, let's have a look.

185
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,880
It's quadruplets.

186
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,970
A mammal has gotten pregnant in space.

187
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:55,470
I guess we weren't the only sneaky ones doing it in secret.

188
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,270
Do you see that?

189
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:03,810
I'll need to do a detailed examination, but they're developing just like on Earth.

190
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,360
They're only a centimeter, but everything is all there.

191
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,280
Let's check if their hearts are normal.

192
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,610
-Okay. -Check the blood flow rate.

193
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,360
Switching to doppler.

194
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,500
Congratulations, Eve.

195
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:33,340
Congratulations, Female Mouse 3. You're a mom now.

196
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,300
That's right.

197
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,350
Us too?

198
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,140
No.

199
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,360
I had a checkup with Dr. Jeon.

200
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,480
Over 90% of the time, mice become pregnant after mating.

201
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,400
They're super fertile.

202
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,070
They can have ten pups at once.

203
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,700
Four is the minimum, actually.

204
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,670
What's wrong?

205
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,170
It's just…

206
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,840
Now you're going to have a family.

207
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,600
And so will I.

208
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:37,320
Now, we're going to make it possible for humans to have sex,

209
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,700
get pregnant, have babies, and raise them

210
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,120
in space.

211
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,580
This is just the beginning.

212
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,540
Definitely.

213
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,420
Okay.

214
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,010
Congratulations.

215
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,970
I still can't believe it.

216
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,060
KOREA SPACE AGENCY

217
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,400
Congrats, Eve!

218
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,740
Your wish has finally come true! It's happening.

219
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,370
Yeah.

220
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,040
Let's give them nicknames.

221
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,540
Yes, so they'll be healthy.

222
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,870
What should we call them, Eve?

223
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,120
How about we name them after planets?

224
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,080
Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn. Let's choose grand names!

225
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,880
How about Big, Strong, Tough, and Lucky?

226
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,670
To live a long life, don't they use rough names like

227
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,010
Dog Poop, Cow Poop, Horse Poop, or Mouse Poop?

228
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,050
What are you guys doing? What's going on?

229
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,430
She's pregnant.

230
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,180
Eve did it.

231
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,270
-What? -Eve's pregnant?

232
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:51,020
No, the mouse is pregnant. It's been 13 and a half days.

233
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,820
No, not Ma Eun-su,  the mouse.

234
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,110
-Oh right, the mouse. -I see.

235
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,660
She's the first mammal to have sex and get pregnant in space, Chief!

236
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,080
With four pups! And without genetic defects.

237
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,700
She's pregnant with four pups! Can you believe it?

238
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,160
My goodness!

239
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,710
Is it true, Eve?

240
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,380
This is totally unexpected. Congratulations, Eve.

241
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,380
You're sure she got pregnant at the station, in zero gravity, right?

242
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,460
Yes.

243
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,930
Who should I be reporting this to?

244
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,760
Where should I brag about this?

245
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,770
That 2-million-won mouse is now worth 20 billion won!

246
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,350
But how come you're just finding out about it now?

247
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:32,400
If you don't check the mouse within 24 hours of mating,

248
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,070
the copulatory plug disappears.

249
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,780
And even on days 13 and 14,

250
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,320
it's hard to tell just by touching her belly.

251
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,030
They're only one centimeter, but they'll keep thriving from now on.

252
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,620
One centimeter?

253
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,620
When is the due date?

254
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,950
It's around 21 days.

255
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,200
Will they be born here?

256
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,790
No way. They should be born at the station.

257
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:51,830
Is that possible?

258
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,750
They could die.

259
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,550
They were created in space, so we should run the tests there.

260
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,880
Why would we do it here?

261
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,550
When leaving Earth, it's 4G inside the spacecraft.

262
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,550
Can they survive it?

263
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,550
There has been a case of a pregnant mouse going up to space.

264
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,350
That's different. It got pregnant on Earth.

265
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,520
This is the first time it's happened in space.

266
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,310
The starting point is different.

267
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,270
But the pregnant mouse came back safely, didn't it?

268
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,610
Listen, you idiot. Are you really a mouse expert?

269
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,980
That was during the early stages.

270
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,530
Now, the babies are fully developed.

271
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:24,410
Even if they are in the mother's womb, while passing through Earth's atmosphere,

272
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,870
with extreme 4G pressure,

273
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,370
the mother's blood pressure will change rapidly,

274
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,370
and the babies might not receive oxygen for a while.

275
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,170
They might make it if it's 4G.

276
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,880
-Right, Eve? -Eve?

277
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,300
Is that right, Eve?

278
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:43,010
If the oxygen supply to the blood is cut off under 4G of pressure,

279
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,930
whether they will survive or die

280
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,850
is honestly yet to be known because this is a first.

281
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,060
That's right.

282
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,560
It's the first time. We should try it!

283
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,770
Let's not take them. It's too dangerous.

284
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,020
Exactly! It's dangerous.

285
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,150
Eve, this isn't the time to be sentimental.

286
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,990
We're scientists, remember?

287
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,950
Calm down.

288
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:10,870
So now that we know it's possible to successfully mate and get pregnant,

289
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:14,170
let's just observe her here until she gives birth.

290
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,380
I think we need to research and compare the changes that occur

291
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:22,170
when a mammal becomes pregnant in zero gravity versus in gravity.

292
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,100
It would be best to attempt giving birth in space at a later time.

293
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,810
If she successfully gives birth,

294
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:32,180
that mouse's value will become two trillion won.

295
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:36,100
It could unlock new possibilities and hope for human survival beyond Earth.

296
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,900
We have to go all-in. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

297
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,940
Go all-in?

298
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,530
What if they die on the way up?

299
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,200
It doesn't matter if they die?

300
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,320
Nobody here wants them to die.

301
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,240
They survived 4G on the way down.

302
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:53,830
Hey, nobody wants to see them survive more than I do.

303
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,670
She's a week away from giving birth.

304
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,710
She'll be at full term when she goes up to space with me.

305
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,750
In human terms,

306
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,920
it's like putting a woman who's nine months into a spacecraft.

307
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,720
Yet you want to bet on this situation?

308
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,470
Does it surprise you that I'm mad?

309
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,890
Come on. We don't know anything about it yet.

310
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,470
-Just send it up, regardless! -How could you say regardless?

311
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,890
You know what?

312
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,850
Today, can't we just be happy and celebrate instead of arguing?

313
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,610
How could you say that as a scientist? Do you have any idea…

314
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,570
Time for champagne.

315
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,690
Yeah! Champagne!

316
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,150
We stayed up all night…

317
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,360
I've already told you.

318
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,450
It survived on the way down because it was still in the early stages.

319
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,470
It landed on her.

320
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:04,900
You guys are thrilled that I'm getting fired, aren't you?

321
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,910
The disciplinary hearing will start soon. Let's get ready.

322
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,040
Everybody topped up?

323
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,000
-Yes. -Yes.

324
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,960
Here's to a safe delivery!

325
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,000
-Cheers! -Cheers!

326
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,300
A toast to Eve, for successfully getting the mouse pregnant.

327
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,380
-To Eve! -To Eve!

328
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:38,350
For something different today, I'd like two iced Americanos, please.

329
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,440
Sure.

330
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,570
There's no information available on your biological parents.

331
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:49,570
1988, Christmas Eve.

332
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,320
You were found in a taxi near Chuncheon Station.

333
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:56,080
The police couldn't identify your parents when you were brought in.

334
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,910
Even after, there is no record of your biological parents

335
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,910
trying to find you.

336
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,830
What is that?

337
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,380
Which one's mine?

338
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,380
They're the same.

339
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,380
But…

340
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,430
Just drink it.

341
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,010
How can you be so clueless?

342
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:20,690
Oh man, the delivery room was bursting at the seams.

343
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:25,310
Well, I guess it's a good thing because we have serious population issues.

344
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,480
Hey.

345
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,110
What?

346
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,650
How do you register a marriage?

347
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,780
You must've done it before.

348
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,040
Look at you. Are you getting married?

349
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,290
Let's go. You need an MRI.

350
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,630
Your brain isn't functioning properly right now.

351
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:50,380
Do I have to get the papers from the district office or something?

352
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,050
Are you insane?

353
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,130
With who?

354
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,680
Did your commander say she'd marry you?

355
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,350
Isn't she going back up to space in a few days?

356
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,520
She'll be gone for a year and you want…

357
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:08,570
All you did was study back in school and now you decide to be Mr. Drama?

358
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,690
This is too much drama.

359
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,900
Why are you in such a rush?

360
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,870
Look,

361
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:22,330
you need two witnesses, and the process is…

362
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,920
It's about becoming a family, dude.

363
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,710
Think carefully.

364
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,880
It's not the same as dating, man.

365
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,800
So, you'll be one witness and…

366
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,880
Me and?

367
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:36,470
I'm all you've got, right? Your moms would be totally against it.

368
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,550
And you know what?

369
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,430
I won't sign as a witness either.

370
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,560
At least not right now.

371
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,150
This is the reality of this thing you guys call love.

372
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,810
No witnesses to support you.

373
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,110
Do I have to have witnesses?

374
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,990
Take it up with the district office.

375
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,240
What would a witness know anyway?

376
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,990
You're acting strange.

377
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,040
First off, it's weird to ask me, given I'm divorced.

378
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,750
Hey, witness.

379
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,300
I haven't even had a sip.

380
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,050
Could I get this to go, please?

381
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,140
Sure.

382
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,980
Seriously, congratulations!

383
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,820
I can't believe she managed to…

384
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,800
Name, Kang Kang-su.

385
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:59,260
Under the International Institute of Space United,

386
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,430
due to violations of the experimental ethics regulations of the KSA,

387
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:05,270
your status as an astronaut has been permanently revoked.

388
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,980
You can no longer apply to be an astronaut,

389
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,770
and you are prohibited from visiting the space station even as a civilian.

390
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:16,360
You are also permanently excluded from the space fruit fly project.

391
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,410
Do you have any objections?

392
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,130
No objections?

393
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,720
I have a lot of objections.

394
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,970
Kang Kang-su.

395
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:45,140
Are you trying to make trouble for everyone as you leave?

396
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,060
Do you think they're enjoying watching you get punished?

397
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,980
Thanks to Eve's swift disposal of your contraband

398
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,190
and your colleagues' active cooperation

399
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,570
in handling the situation with professionalism,

400
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,070
we've managed to keep this from escalating, understand?

401
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:04,660
If you had brought that down to Earth, you wouldn't be sitting there right now.

402
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,120
You'd be sitting in jail.

403
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:10,160
Because of you, the KSA almost became a global embarrassment.

404
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,870
Are you resentful or what?

405
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,460
You should be thankful to your colleagues for preventing that.

406
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,590
Sure.

407
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,220
Dr. Kang Kang-su,

408
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:29,680
surrender all your astronaut credentials and lab access cards.

409
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,370
This is everything.

410
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,920
Hand in that suit too.

411
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:23,530
Has any other astronaut given as much to fruit fly research as me?

412
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:33,080
It seems you're all celebrating a mouse getting pregnant in zero gravity.

413
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,040
When mouse research in space

414
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,380
was just starting in the '70s, the fruit flies

415
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,590
had already been getting pregnant

416
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,840
and producing offspring for multiple generations.

417
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:50,010
Fruit flies beat you by 50 years, and yet this is a cause for celebration?

418
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,030
Being an astronaut ruined my relationship…

419
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,200
and I lost my child too, but I remained dedicated to fruit fly research.

420
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,330
So, I'm going to take this suit with me.

421
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,710
Chief.

422
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,000
I like this suit. It was custom-made to fit me perfectly.

423
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,000
It's not like anyone else can wear it.

424
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,380
You're here to return that suit.

425
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:30,050
I'll buy it. How much do you want for it?

426
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,180
Are you kidding me? Do you know where you are?

427
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:34,850
Take it off.

428
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,870
Traitors.

429
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,010
I don't need this damn suit!

430
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:17,770
You know,

431
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:22,520
I was going to quit this stupid astronaut job before I got fired anyway.

432
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,990
Face reality, guys.

433
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,700
Being an astronaut

434
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,830
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

435
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:37,580
No need to be nervous.

436
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:41,920
Don't worry, if you get fired, my dad will hire you.

437
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,070
Hi.

438
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,320
Hey, so I was wondering…

439
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,610
What happened to that new life?

440
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,320
What?

441
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:54,450
Did it get back safely?

442
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:58,410
No.

443
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,120
Is it alive?

444
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,620
You don't need to know.

445
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,710
Is it dead?

446
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,170
It's best if you don't know.

447
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:12,970
Knowing might put you in danger. You could get hurt.

448
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,180
Just forget about it. It's all in the past.

449
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,140
So it's dead.

450
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:20,930
How are our fruit flies?

451
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:25,520
Well, Indecency is dead.

452
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,730
What?

453
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,360
What happened?

454
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,190
Old age.

455
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,780
Right.

456
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,530
It lived for 50 days, so it lived a long life.

457
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,200
As for Public and Star,

458
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,290
they've been stuck to a banana stem all day and won't let go.

459
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,840
You've already given it a name? Is it male?

460
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,090
-Yes. -You named him without running it by me?

461
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,090
He's Star because he wasn't born on Earth.

462
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,260
I see.

463
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,720
How are the mice?

464
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:02,980
I'm going to eat, sleep, and stay with them until they're born.

465
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,230
It's all so new, I feel like I'm treading on eggshells.

466
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:09,150
This reminds me of the first baby I brought into this world.

467
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,650
We also brought Star into the world together.

468
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,740
Don't hesitate to call if you need me again.

469
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,870
Okay.

470
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,290
So it did come down.

471
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,720
It's alive.

472
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,140
We're both going to make it happen.

473
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,490
Relax.

474
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,530
You're all done.

475
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:08,120
Everything looks good with the uterine lining.

476
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,000
We can do the implantation in secret

477
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,750
after the clinic closes and everyone's gone.

478
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:18,510
Do you think I can handle it?

479
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,970
Better than anyone else I know.

480
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:25,310
Your uterus hasn't had any problems to date.

481
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,270
Just think happy thoughts.

482
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,600
Thank you, Dr. Gong.

483
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,610
You won't need anesthesia.

484
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,610
It'll only take five minutes. Quick, right?

485
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:41,030
After the procedure, you should lie down and rest for two hours.

486
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,410
Then, you'll be discharged.

487
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,750
It will be at 8 p.m.,

488
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,870
the day after tomorrow.

489
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:53,250
It's set for the day after tomorrow, in the evening.

490
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,510
Make sure security is tight.

491
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,550
Yes, sir.

492
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,470
I'll put the legal team on standby.

493
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,390
Dad.

494
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,560
What is it?

495
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,770
After Ryong finishes the IVF,

496
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:16,020
Min-jeong and I are going to leave.

497
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,360
We'll return when the baby is born.

498
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,370
Yes, that's a good idea.

499
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,040
Enjoy your honeymoon for a year.

500
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,580
I'll feel better knowing that Ryong is by Min-jeong's side.

501
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,960
Ryong needs to continue his work here.

502
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,010
What about Ryong's life?

503
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,670
What do you mean?

504
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,050
Many patients should have

505
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:46,390
the opportunity to be treated by a doctor like Ryong.

506
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,890
Plus, if he's always by Min-jeong's side, people will think something's up.

507
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,270
It'll be a headache if people get suspicious.

508
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,610
You think so?

509
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,150
Once the embryo is implanted,

510
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,190
we don't necessarily need Ryong.

511
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,530
We'll come back when the child is older, and I can get married then.

512
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,660
But you were so eager to get married.

513
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,370
Now that Ryong has come back

514
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,410
after successfully completing the IVF,

515
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:17,290
I'm starting to get bored of him.

516
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,380
Are you serious?

517
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:23,760
Of course, I'm bored. What does he have going for him?

518
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:28,100
Even still, isn't that a bit much?

519
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,600
Where's your loyalty?

520
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,100
You may be my daughter, but you're acting like a brat.

521
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,190
Come on,

522
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:38,230
he risked his life and went all the way to space for you.

523
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,360
Exactly.

524
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,320
That's a lot to deal with,

525
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,860
and I don't like how he's so dependent on me.

526
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,990
It sucks, actually.

527
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,420
The reports you submitted with the tourist were delivered.

528
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,750
Once they arrive,

529
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,960
they'll use them to examine the module in detail.

530
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:02,090
I'd like you to be ready to lend a hand when they call.

531
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,920
Okay.

532
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:05,180
Ignition.

533
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,970
Launch command for ignition.

534
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,350
First stage.

535
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,520
The station looks like it's in bad shape.

536
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,770
I know.

537
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:17,150
They're bringing back detailed footage of the parts that need repair,

538
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:20,900
so your team should be fully prepared to go up and restore it.

539
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,940
Yes.

540
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,940
Liftoff!

541
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,110
Liftoff.

542
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,450
Man, how could they possibly want to go up there already?

543
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:42,250
When will they be back?

544
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,880
The day after tomorrow.

545
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,560
What?

546
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,430
You're a go for the mission.

547
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,600
Don't make things weird up there.

548
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,600
Your job is to bring the ILS back to life.

549
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:02,900
Eve is the commander, and you're just in charge of repairs.

550
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,780
This is what you applied for, understand?

551
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:07,700
Eve is your commanding officer.

552
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:10,490
Aye, aye, Captain.

553
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,100
The truth is,

554
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,690
I came here to create embryos using the MZ Group heir's sperm

555
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,060
and his wife's eggs.

556
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,900
I hid the eggs in the ice cream cup.

557
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,490
I fertilized them behind your back,

558
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:50,570
and the embryo is now in the incubator.

559
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,830
Please don't let it die.

560
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:03,840
There was a disciplinary hearing,

561
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,630
and since Kang Kang-su didn't say anything about the morula,

562
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:11,550
he was the only one to lose his astronaut qualifications and be fired.

563
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:16,890
How would you feel about thanking him for that?

564
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,850
Just leave it alone.

565
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,310
Have you forgotten that he's rude and a backstabber?

566
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,820
The doors are closing.

567
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,770
This isn't your house.

568
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,400
What time is it now?

569
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,030
Right, it's nighttime.

570
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,040
It's night, indeed.

571
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,420
It's nighttime again.

572
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,340
I came to see you at night, Go-eun.

573
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:32,630
I'm sorry. I'll come during the day.

574
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:36,220
I'm not

575
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:39,220
a guy who only comes to see you at night.

576
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:42,600
I'll come back during the day.

577
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:44,980
Bye.

578
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,610
Unbelievable.

579
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,280
Why can't you find your key card?

580
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:47,580
What's this?

581
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,040
What's this doing in here?

582
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,470
Why is this in your wallet?

583
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,600
We are over.

584
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:19,990
I have to pee.

585
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,620
I'm going to pee my pants.

586
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:28,870
I have to pee.

587
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,500
I think I'm going to pee my pants. I have to pee.

588
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,350
I heard you got fired today.

589
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,770
Serves you right.

590
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,620
We lost our baby…

591
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:11,880
but I really wanted to save the morula.

592
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:18,090
Even though it was a morula that Gong Ryong created…

593
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:23,720
I wanted to protect it.

594
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,620
NUMBER 3

595
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,490
KOREA SPACE AGENCY

596
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:28,600
What brings you all the way out here?

597
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:35,480
I wasn't able to go home last night, so I'm a bit of a mess.

598
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,270
-No, no. -I'm sorry.

599
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:39,770
Have you had breakfast?

600
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,150
Not yet, I've been too busy to eat.

601
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:46,990
I thought you might like a home-cooked meal.

602
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:48,360
Eat it while it's hot.

603
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:52,040
Wow,

604
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,790
this already smells amazing.

605
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:56,120
May I open it?

606
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:57,290
Yes, of course.

607
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:00,290
It's so warm.

608
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:10,760
I've never had a meal like this cooked for me before.

609
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:13,180
It looks delicious.

610
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,850
Thank you. It looks great.

611
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,650
Wow, it looks delicious.

612
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,400
May I ask you something?

613
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:26,070
By all means.

614
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,370
You said you were abandoned on Christmas Eve.

615
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:35,700
That's right.

616
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:40,580
You weren't abandoned at Chuncheon Station, were you?

617
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:48,220
It wasn't in a taxi, was it?

618
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,140
It wasn't in a taxi heading to Chuncheon Station

619
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:58,770
on Christmas Eve the year the Olympics were held, was it?

620
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:18,910
No, it wasn't.

621
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:26,340
Right, of course not.

622
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,880
I'm sorry.

623
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:35,100
I too abandoned my child

624
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,810
on Christmas Eve.

625
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,850
I didn't want to have the baby.

626
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:46,270
Even though he died young,

627
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,530
I can't forgive that bastard.

628
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,400
Having that child ruined my life.

629
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:55,120
It ruined my life as a woman.

630
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,290
I had to work in a bar to make money…

631
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,670
but my breasts leaked

632
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:06,000
because they were full of milk.

633
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:10,470
It made me want to die.

634
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:14,010
I wanted to live, actually.

635
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,810
But until Ryong came into my life,

636
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:22,890
all I could think about every single day was how I wanted to die.

637
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:29,480
Even though I wanted to do whatever I could to survive.

638
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:35,950
Not once have I thought of myself as that child's mother.

639
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:39,620
Not once have I looked for it. I've never wanted to.

640
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,370
That's because…

641
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:50,710
when I think about that child, my sins feel a million times worse.

642
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,590
Even though I'm the victim here.

643
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:12,240
Your mother…

644
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:16,360
I'm sure someone like me can't even compare to your mother.

645
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:18,490
She's probably very educated,

646
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:20,700
beautiful,

647
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,210
and a truly amazing person.

648
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:30,670
She must have had no choice.

649
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:33,760
It must have been a circumstance that was beyond her control,

650
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:37,180
which is why she did what she did.

651
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,180
Right.

652
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:48,770
To me, Ryong is the only child I have.

653
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:52,860
He knows nothing about this.

654
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,530
I would like to keep it that way.

655
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:05,960
Yes, ma'am.

656
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:41,510
KSA GENETIC TESTING REPORT

657
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,720
THE PROBABILITY OF MATERNITY: 99.999%

658
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:11,960
Eve!

659
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:14,880
-Female Mouse 3 is bleeding. -What?

660
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,630
There was blood there before…

661
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:18,920
Hurry! Hurry up! Take a look at the ultrasound!

662
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,800
I'm told Female Mouse 3 isn't moving.

663
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:25,430
What about the babies?

664
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,930
Their umbilical veins have narrowed.

665
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:31,640
It's hypoxia.

666
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:35,230
The narrowing of the umbilical veins is restricting blood flow.

667
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:37,820
The mother's decreased respiratory rate is depriving the babies of oxygen.

668
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,280
Have you checked the diameter of her uterine artery?

669
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:46,320
-Eve. -One of their hearts has stopped beating.

670
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:47,660
-No! -What?

671
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:49,540
Will they all die if one of them dies?

672
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:50,870
Eve…

673
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:53,710
All of their hearts have stopped beating.

674
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:02,670
And the mother?

675
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,970
-What about the mother? -Pardon?

676
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,260
Oh, right.

677
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:16,270
The mother is also going to die soon.

678
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:20,860
Get out of the way.

679
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:22,190
I'll do it.

680
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,530
What can you do? Move.

681
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:24,950
I have to euthanize her.

682
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:26,070
It's my job.

683
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,570
We're not euthanizing her!

684
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:30,330
I'm going to save her. I can do it.

685
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:32,240
Eve, let's go.

686
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:34,160
So you save her, then you take her home?

687
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:36,670
Please, let me do the surgery.

688
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:38,460
I'm going to open her up.

689
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:40,420
I'm going to save at least one of them.

690
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,250
I won't let them all die!

691
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,420
Maybe the mother wants to live.

692
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:46,550
I wanted to live, actually.

693
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:50,720
Okay, we won't euthanize her. Come on, let's go.

694
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,560
Please, just let me do the surgery.

695
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:54,270
Get ready!

696
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:01,320
Even though I wanted to do whatever I could to survive.

697
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:04,820
Damn it.

698
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:37,310
What is it?

699
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:39,900
I feel like I got a load off my chest,

700
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,110
but I'm starting to think I may have been overly focused on myself.

701
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:46,190
Maybe you should go see your captain.

702
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,990
Come on, why did you go there?

703
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:52,030
I just wanted to take her some breakfast.

704
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,870
You did? What's the occasion?

705
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:56,700
Whatever, hurry up and go see her.

706
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:58,460
Fine.

707
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:01,830
He must really like her.

708
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,540
What's wrong? Why do you look so tired?

709
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:20,750
Were you up all night?

710
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,170
No, that's not it.

711
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,050
Take a look at this.

712
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,170
What is it?

713
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:39,310
Look.

714
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:44,270
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION FORM

715
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:47,310
Yi-man didn't want to be a witness, but I forced him.

716
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,730
Oh, but Dr. Na was more than happy to.

717
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,780
You and I are the same.

718
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:58,830
Since I'm registered under my late mom,

719
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:00,540
mine is also blank.

720
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:04,000
But I'm forever grateful to the three moms who raised me.

721
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:15,510
What's wrong? Is it too much for you?

722
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:23,270
-Well… -This isn't a proposal.

723
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:25,690
I'm not suggesting we rush into marriage.

724
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:31,030
Just hang on to it, and look at it when you feel sad

725
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:33,650
about the fact that you don't have a family.

726
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,620
And I would like it even better

727
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:40,120
if you mailed it to Seongdeungpo-gu Office, 361-1,

728
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,080
Danghwa-dong 6-ga, Seongdeungpo-gu, Seoul

729
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,330
from space.

730
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:47,830
Unbelievable.

731
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:55,010
Feel free to throw it away.

732
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,720
What makes family so special anyway?

733
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:04,730
If you love each other, that's family.

734
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,780
Don't cry alone anymore.

735
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:21,780
Okay.

736
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:51,900
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

737
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:54,280
I just want to know

738
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:56,240
why she abandoned me.

739
00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:59,360
You think you can wear me down with this

740
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:01,410
and make me share the lottery winnings with you?

741
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:03,120
Tonight.

742
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:06,830
As the commander, I'm not sure if I should let this happen.

743
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:09,620
What if she saw this note?

744
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:12,630
What if she chose not to report this to me or the IOU?

745
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:14,040
She's an accomplice.

746
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:15,340
You've never even seen it.

747
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:16,760
Those are the facts.

748
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:19,340
We need to seize it and punish him before that happens.

749
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:21,430
Your colleagues, your beloved tourist…

750
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:22,600
He'll end up in prison!

751
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:30,100
