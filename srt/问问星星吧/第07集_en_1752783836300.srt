WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,390
<i>Coming up next,</i>

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,470
<i>we're showcasing one of the hottest names</i>
<i>in the news on "When the Stars Gossip."</i>

5
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,440
Hello.

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,980
It's <i>News Spotlight</i> day.

7
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,860
Joining us in the studio today is Eve Kim,

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,700
commander of G.O-10 Expedition 3,

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,360
who is about to venture into space.

10
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,080
EVE KIM, EXPEDITION 3 COMMANDER

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,450
Can you tell us
how you're feeling right now?

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,370
I'm nervous.

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,000
That's only natural.
We're also very nervous.

14
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:53,510
Eve, can you tell us
how many times you've been to space?

15
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,890
This will be my third time.
But it's my first as commander.

16
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,230
There's a lot of public interest
in who Eve Kim actually is.

17
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,850
Are you married, Eve?

18
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,980
No, not yet.

19
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,110
I see.

20
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,240
The position of commander,

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,990
<i>as you are well aware,</i>
<i>is extremely important.</i>

22
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,740
<i>Many people…</i>

23
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,170
Is it okay for a woman
to be at the space station?

24
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,420
Can't you just throw away
this dough mixer and buy a new one?

25
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,260
Why would we throw it out?
Once it's fixed, it'll work fine.

26
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,720
Come on, a new one doesn't cost much.

27
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,050
The radiation there,
you know, those harmful rays.

28
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,520
They say there's lots of that stuff there.

29
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,190
Isn't that bad for a woman's body?
Would she be able to have children?

30
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,690
-See, it works fine.
-Nice, it works.

31
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,070
So?

32
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,700
You startled me.

33
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,240
Female astronauts come back
and have babies all the time,

34
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,700
so it can't be that dangerous.

35
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,620
Not like they'd get pregnant there anyway.

36
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,420
So it's okay as long as
they don't get pregnant?

37
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,250
Even if they wanted
to get pregnant, they couldn't.

38
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,460
It's impossible
to have sex up there or get pregnant.

39
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,090
You can't get pregnant in space?

40
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,050
And you can't do it either?

41
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,390
-Why not?
-Why not?

42
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:27,810
Zero gravity.

43
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,350
For a man and a woman
to get into position…

44
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,650
Well, it would be awkward.

45
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,940
They'd be floating.

46
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,950
Hey, come on.

47
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,370
They can do it in those tiny rooms.
They'd be stuck together anyway.

48
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,830
Where there's a will,
there's a way, right?

49
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,170
Enough. That's all I know.

50
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,540
Dr. Jeon.

51
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,710
Hey.

52
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,920
Listen, together,
our ages add up to more than 150.

53
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,220
Okay.

54
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:05,550
To put it accurately, a penis
needs to fill with blood to become erect.

55
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,470
Right.

56
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,230
First, getting blood
to flow to the penis is tough.

57
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,100
And as the sperm makes its way to the egg,
it asks, "Hey, which way is it?"

58
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,020
The zero gravity confuses it.

59
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,570
Sounds like we should send Mr. Libido,
Byeon Kang-soe.

60
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,990
Anyway, nobody has ever had sex up there,

61
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,740
much less gotten pregnant.

62
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,410
Not even mice, which reproduce like crazy,
have had babies.

63
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,540
Ong-nyeo better go too then.

64
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,540
Up there, even Byeon Kang-soe
and Ong-nyeo couldn't get it on.

65
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:39,460
Hey, if you really want to have sex,
it doesn't matter where you are.

66
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,720
You'll find a way.

67
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,680
So true.

68
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,270
I'm counting on you.

69
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,780
Your mother is waiting for you.

70
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,240
You guys.

71
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,960
I'll never forget how you helped me
for as long as I live.

72
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,000
Thank you.

73
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,340
I love you guys.

74
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,220
From now on, you guys

75
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,970
are this child's aunt, uncle,

76
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:29,720
and brother.

77
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:30,760
Is brother okay?

78
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,180
Yeah.

79
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,940
Before the commander
comes looking for you,

80
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,690
you should hurry and go find her.

81
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,190
I will.

82
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,700
Go, team!

83
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,200
Aunt, uncle, and brother.

84
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,500
What have we done?

85
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:04,720
We just saw Kang-su
losing his rights yesterday.

86
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,180
Oh, my gosh!

87
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,890
We contributed to the creation of life.

88
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,430
I can't believe we did this
for the winning prize.

89
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,020
Yeah, I know.

90
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,650
Guy, let's return the ticket.

91
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,320
Our honor as astronauts
should eclipse 500 billion.

92
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,490
-What?
-What?

93
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,860
Don't you feel any remorse
in knowing that we just sold out?

94
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,070
For 500 billion, yeah.

95
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,160
But say we get caught,

96
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,250
we could at least claim that we did it
to help the creation of a human life.

97
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,250
Not some money.

98
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,170
We ought to feel ashamed of ourselves
as astronauts.

99
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,670
Shame is

100
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,550
just a feeling.

101
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,300
Are you suggesting that

102
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,260
we should return the 500 billion
so we don't feel ashamed?

103
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,890
To Kang Kang-su who's swimming in money?

104
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,430
How much luck does this guy need?

105
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,060
Shouldn't the pride
of our privileged profession

106
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,400
outweigh some prize money?

107
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,160
Where have you been?

108
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,620
Come here, quickly.

109
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,000
What sound

110
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,380
did you say this was?

111
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,300
It's the male courting the female.

112
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,350
-It's pretty loud.
-I know, right?

113
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,980
Think they'll do it now?

114
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,110
What?

115
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,080
That's it, get on top.

116
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,200
Go on, get on top of her.

117
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,830
You can do it, come on.

118
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,120
-Hurry.
-Get on top.

119
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,250
That's it, you can do it.

120
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,710
Give it all you've got!

121
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,710
You…

122
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,060
The fact that they engaged in chasing
means they both want it.

123
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,680
So why does the female run away
when it counts?

124
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,520
Why is she dodging him?

125
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,230
Why would she run away?

126
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,350
In zero gravity,
female mice lose muscle mass

127
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,100
and bone density
at a faster rate than male mice.

128
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,770
Because the females
experience more bone loss,

129
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:10,030
I think they avoid mating
and getting pregnant because it's risky.

130
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,950
Without a harness,

131
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,860
the male didn't even attempt
to mount the female,

132
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,450
so I thought he was the problem.

133
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,240
So the problem lies with the female.

134
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,830
Which was unexpected.

135
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,960
Could female hormones be the solution?

136
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,000
Let's see.

137
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,880
Wow, the levels of female hormones
are much lower here than on Earth.

138
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,760
How about we inject the female
with female hormones for a bit

139
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,390
and see if her bone density decreases?

140
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,060
Okay, sounds good.

141
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,640
Thank you.

142
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,190
I know a thing or two
about female hormones.

143
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,150
You do.

144
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,400
Then you check the progress here,

145
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,150
and I'll…

146
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,740
So, do I make a good assistant?

147
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,670
I'm going back down in two days.

148
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,880
You want me to babysit
a tourist for eight days?

149
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,090
ONE YEAR EARLIER

150
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,600
He doesn't know how to do anything.

151
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,470
I'd be surprised
if he could even find the bathroom.

152
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,730
This is my first command.

153
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,640
How can you ask me
to carry around deadweight?

154
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,690
Who is this guy anyway?

155
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,610
How much money do you have to have
to vacation in space?

156
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,190
I'm already busy as it is.

157
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,740
This is the first mission for Koreans.

158
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,530
What if he messes up?
Why are you dumping him on us?

159
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,950
I mean, come on,
why are you doing this to me?

160
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,000
<i>Do you have to make it so obvious</i>
<i>how much you hate this?</i>

161
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,870
DR. GONG RYONG

162
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,130
She's suffering from hypothermia
and is in cardiac arrest.

163
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,260
MZ MEDICAL CENTER

164
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,690
Min-jeong.

165
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,730
Min-jeong, open your eyes.

166
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,610
We found this phone at the site.

167
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,280
The last call she received
was from Gong Ryong.

168
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,830
He called right after the accident.

169
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,040
KOREA SPACE AGENCY

170
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,180
Why did you go so far away?

171
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,640
I wanted coffee,
and I wanted to walk for a bit.

172
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,650
Is something wrong?

173
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,310
What would be wrong?

174
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,530
My head hurts.
It feels like it's going to explode.

175
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,370
Without caffeine,
I don't think I'd be able to function.

176
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,410
Whatever, you always do great.

177
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,590
Hang on!

178
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,750
Wait for me.

179
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,840
Don't run.

180
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,800
Damn it, last night was a failure too.

181
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,180
Last night? What was?

182
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,890
Why are you asking the obvious?

183
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,680
Sex.

184
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,730
Dong-a, can't you stay?

185
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,570
I thought we would have
another mission together.

186
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,940
Do you have to leave?

187
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,700
Who am I going to fight? So boring.

188
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,320
I actually didn't mind
that arrogant voice of yours.

189
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,490
What's gotten into you all?

190
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,140
That's okay, right?

191
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,360
Is everyone on the ILS asleep?

192
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,490
Yes.

193
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,240
What's that?

194
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,620
Those are 1,836 pieces
of fuel tank debris from a collision

195
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,750
with a low-orbit satellite,
and they've been

196
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,790
playing tag with each other
about 200 miles above the ILS.

197
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,580
And there was a second collision?

198
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,960
Yes, so a new piece of debris,
which is about 13 cm in diameter,

199
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,800
looks like it's approaching the ILS.

200
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,840
What are the odds?

201
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,220
One in ten thousand.

202
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,970
So, 0.01%.

203
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,810
We can avoid it if we adjust the orbit.

204
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:35,980
How fast is it moving?

205
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,320
The delta-v is 0.7 m per second.

206
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,860
-Call Eve.
-Got it.

207
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,710
SEOUL MCC

208
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,670
Hello?

209
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,430
Everyone is asleep, so I'll do it myself.

210
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,320
I'll use the fuel thrusters
on the G.O cargo ship

211
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,740
to change the orbit.

212
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:49,420
Orbit adjustment complete.

213
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,590
Okay. Good job.

214
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,350
Double-check it in the morning,
just in case.

215
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,020
Go and try to get some more shut-eye.

216
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,140
<i>Copy.</i>

217
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,110
Don't let your guard down.

218
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,200
The network can only detect
debris larger than 10 cm.

219
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,860
It's the smaller ones we miss,

220
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:58,120
the ones like bullets,
that are the real danger.

221
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,200
As a matter of fact, we're worried
the smaller ones might collide

222
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:05,000
and create a cloud
of tiny debris smaller than 10 cm.

223
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,670
I'm keeping my eyes peeled.

224
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,300
Where did he go?

225
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,970
Who?

226
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,050
No one.

227
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,590
Stay alert.

228
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,420
GROSS HABITS DIE HARD

229
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,570
You still haven't kicked the habit?

230
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,900
Did you have breakfast?

231
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,610
Should we have breakfast?

232
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,280
EVE'S PLACE, A FEW DAYS AGO

233
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:26,750
Where did you put the remote, Eve?

234
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,960
<i>On October 4th, 1957,</i>

235
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,340
<i>the USSR launched Sputnik 1,</i>
<i>the first artificial Earth satellite.</i>

236
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,430
What are you doing here?

237
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,350
What about you?

238
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:51,190
Me? I came to turn off Eve's TV.

239
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,030
She asked me to turn it off earlier.

240
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,400
She asked you?

241
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,860
When did she ask you? It was me she asked.

242
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,110
There's no way.

243
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,990
She wouldn't ask her boss to do that.

244
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:04,580
But she'd ask an ex-coworker?
Stop talking nonsense.

245
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,410
It's hot.

246
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,160
What are you doing?

247
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,170
What do you mean?

248
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,590
Right. I'll be on my way.

249
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,010
You can have this.

250
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:16,920
Running away?

251
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,140
Me?

252
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,430
Didn't you come to turn off the TV?

253
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,100
Done.

254
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,600
It's like you're used to doing it.

255
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:34,020
In the US, 70% of people

256
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:37,030
shove the remote
between the cushion and the right armrest.

257
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,070
Did Eve also give you her passcode?

258
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,990
No, I asked Dona.

259
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,070
I see.

260
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,160
As for that shirt…

261
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,410
Can you either cover up or take it off?

262
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,790
This? Why?

263
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,920
You're sending me some mixed messages.

264
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,300
It's making me think twice.

265
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,760
I'll do what I want.

266
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,550
You do what you want.
Don't tell me what to do.

267
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,600
If I told you not to quit, would you stay?

268
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:14,400
No, I would quit.
I would quit, no matter what.

269
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,270
They're offering a lot of money.

270
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,940
-Exactly.
-Yes, exactly.

271
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,360
I'm going.

272
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,310
This doesn't feel right.

273
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,310
I think I confused my respect for you

274
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,810
for romantic feelings,
now that I'm leaving.

275
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,230
I'm really sorry.

276
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,740
Sure.

277
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,240
I get that you could be confused.

278
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,580
Since you're confused anyway,

279
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,870
how about we make this serious?

280
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,800
Please.

281
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,680
Please, God.

282
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:13,350
Take pity on this life
and turn it into a baby.

283
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,600
Please, I'm begging you.

284
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:34,120
Wait, she didn't even disinfect it once.

285
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,250
How can she still have
the same dressing I put on?

286
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,750
Commander.

287
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,710
Commander.

288
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,850
Seriously, I know you're busy,
but this is going too far.

289
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,680
I told you, worst-case,
you could lose your foot.

290
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,520
Every time you used the rails,
you would've rubbed it

291
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,440
until the wound got infected.

292
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,400
You're either brave or stupid.

293
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,150
I'll go blind if I look at the sun.

294
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,910
I'll die if I open the window.

295
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,490
If I do this or that, I'll die.

296
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,200
Even if I take a dump, I'll die.

297
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,460
You're always telling me what to do,
so why can't you take care of yourself?

298
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,880
I swear…

299
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,960
Commander.

300
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,050
Wake up.

301
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,640
Damn it.

302
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:15,720
She wouldn't even know
if someone carried her out of here.

303
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,520
<i>This is the first mission for Koreans.</i>

304
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,310
What if he messes up?
Why are you dumping him on us?

305
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,360
I mean, come on,
why are you doing this to me?

306
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,410
Do you have to make it so obvious
how much you hate this?

307
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,160
He's coming to say hi today.

308
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,500
Chief.

309
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,580
Come on, it's my first time as commander.

310
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:46,420
Why should I have to babysit a tourist?

311
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,880
He won't even know how
to eat, sleep, shit, or bathe himself.

312
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,470
I'll have to chase after him
and help him wipe his butt.

313
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,590
How is it any different than a newborn?

314
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,850
Forget it.

315
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,560
I'm not taking any tourists.

316
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,640
I don't want to do it.
Take back the order.

317
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,480
You're here. Eve.

318
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,780
Say hi. This is your commander, Eve Kim.

319
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,240
Hello.

320
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,010
You don't have to babysit me.

321
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,590
I won't cause any trouble.

322
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,770
You did babysit me.

323
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,480
All I did was cause trouble.

324
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,750
When we're back on Earth
and standing on solid ground,

325
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,510
let's go out for meals,

326
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:16,260
movies and walks, just like everyone else.

327
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,850
If it rains, let's get wet,

328
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,680
and let the wind blow us over.

329
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,400
Let's go on dates like they do on Earth.

330
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,150
When we get back, I'll be good to you.

331
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,860
Once I set foot on solid ground,

332
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,280
I can be good to you too.

333
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,720
<i>Whenever I want to see you,</i>

334
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:06,140
<i>I hope it's someplace</i>
<i>where you're only a cab ride away.</i>

335
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,450
Why do we have to
bring it back to him personally?

336
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,160
Just put it back in the storage module

337
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,750
where I first found it!

338
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,790
We can do that, right?

339
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,080
That's all we have to do!

340
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,460
Do you really think

341
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:34,710
that Kang Kang-su is gonna find it
in the next two days

342
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,510
before going back to Earth?

343
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,180
No way. It'd be like throwing it away.

344
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,890
You wanna throw away 500 billion?

345
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,600
I don't care if he finds it or not.

346
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,600
Guys.

347
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,810
If we don't do this right,
we'll regret it.

348
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:50,770
And if we don't do this now,
say we sleep on it,

349
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,650
we might change our minds.

350
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,520
And we'll regret that.

351
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,690
And if we leave it
in the storage module like you say,

352
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,820
we'll want to check, we'll be tempted.

353
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,870
And we'll think things like,
"What if we took it?"

354
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,660
"What if the ticket goes to waste?"

355
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,490
"What if?" "Why didn't we just steal it?"

356
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,040
And then we're back to square one.

357
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,250
Except as thieves who stole nothing!

358
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,750
What about our pride? Our dignity?

359
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:17,630
Do you really wanna live with that level
of regret for the rest of your lives?

360
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,970
Just do it and get it over with!

361
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,480
Wait.

362
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,280
I'm sorry.

363
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,990
I was

364
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,200
in a rush.

365
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,210
Let's reconsider this, Santi.

366
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,880
Just hurry up!

367
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:15,270
Why does God lead us into temptation?

368
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,110
You really wanna stay here all night?

369
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,570
We might wake him up!

370
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,100
What the hell?

371
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,380
Hello.

372
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,010
Doctor. Go-eun.

373
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,640
DR. GONG RYONG

374
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,650
It's Gong Ryong. What should I do?

375
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,150
Should I answer it?

376
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,910
Min-jeong.

377
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,490
Wake up and answer Gong Ryong's call.

378
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,710
Turn it off!

379
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,380
I don't care if it's Ryong or Kang-su.

380
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,340
Don't ever let those two bastards
call my family again.

381
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,510
Understood?

382
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,850
Oops!

383
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:37,220
<i>Why is it so hard to get through to you?</i>

384
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,560
<i>I've been on the edge of my seat waiting.</i>

385
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,640
<i>It worked.</i>

386
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,770
I did it without a microscope.

387
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:45,560
I performed an ICSI manually

388
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,270
and fertilized the last remaining egg.

389
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,160
Are you listening?

390
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:58,040
<i>Are you too happy to say anything?</i>

391
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,790
<i>Is it because you can't believe it?</i>

392
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,460
<i>It's the truth.</i>

393
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,170
<i>It needs two more days in the incubator</i>

394
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,880
<i>to become a morula.</i>

395
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:12,470
I'm going to do whatever it takes
to bring you a morula.

396
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,800
<i>You have to stay strong.</i>

397
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:18,140
<i>Soon, it'll be your turn to take over.</i>

398
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:21,310
<i>I'm going to make sure</i>

399
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:24,310
<i>you hear the word "Mom,"</i>
<i>just like you've always wanted.</i>

400
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,400
<i>Okay?</i>

401
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,440
Give it to me.

402
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,280
I think I hear someone.
I'll call you back.

403
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,240
Ryong!

404
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,290
Min-jeong?

405
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,080
Min-jeong!

406
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,920
She's coming to.

407
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,310
You're lying.

408
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,020
If you tell Eve,

409
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,560
I'll kill you.

410
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,230
Even you wouldn't stoop that low.

411
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,400
I trust you won't.

412
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:29,460
Blood pressure, pulse, body temperature,
and PLR are all normal.

413
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,130
Sweetie, are you conscious?

414
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,340
Did you hear him?

415
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,550
We can finally breathe easy.

416
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,720
Min-jeong, our family has been saved!

417
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:47,060
Min-jeong, can you see me?

418
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,150
Do you see me?

419
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,570
You heard what Ryong just said, right?

420
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:56,030
He made my grandchild.
You heard it too, didn't you?

421
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:00,030
Ryong saved our family.

422
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,330
Ryong saved us.

423
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:26,850
There's no way.

424
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,210
Hello.

425
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,130
Have something to eat.

426
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,880
Here you go.

427
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,260
Gracias.

428
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,550
After eating,
you should get some sleep, Commander.

429
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,970
Didn't you work all night?

430
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:08,020
-No, it's okay.
-You probably didn't sleep much.

431
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,440
We should be clear of the debris now,

432
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,400
so I'll handle the rest with MCC.

433
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,320
After you're done eating,
go get some shut-eye.

434
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,480
She slept well.

435
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,190
How would you know?

436
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,780
Once I'm asleep, someone could
carry me out and I wouldn't know.

437
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:26,290
It's probably because
I'm a bit slow and brave too.

438
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,210
Everyone knows how brave you are.

439
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,750
Why would you get rained on?

440
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,210
Rain? Where did that come from?

441
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,920
I don't like getting rained on.

442
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:41,720
If there's one thing
I hate more than rain, it's wind.

443
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,010
Someone here has a really loud voice.

444
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:50,430
Hey, it doesn't make sense.
How did you do it alone?

445
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,810
You're a fraud, aren't you?

446
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:53,520
It's impossible to do manually.

447
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,610
-Jealous?
-What?

448
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:59,070
-Are you jealous?
-Listen, you bastard.

449
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,990
Dr. Kang, what are you doing?

450
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,860
Why would I be jealous of a loser?

451
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,070
Dr. Kang, stop it.

452
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,330
There must be
some sort of misunderstanding.

453
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:10,000
Your life isn't even worth
comparing to mine.

454
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,330
Just with your hands? No way.

455
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:15,460
-Dr. Kang!
-Hey!

456
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,630
Dr. Kang.

457
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:23,840
GONG RYONG'S 7TH DAY

458
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,030
So were there more collisions?

459
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,990
How big is this one?

460
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,700
-Even though we adjusted the orbit?
-Yes, even after that.

461
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:53,960
It looks like the size of the debris cloud
is larger than we calculated.

462
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,880
We're seeing debris smaller than 10 cm
undetectable by radar,

463
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,250
spread out widely
into where we adjusted our orbit.

464
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:04,630
Then, is there a possibility
they could all return to Earth?

465
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:17,440
<i>Informing the ILS.</i>
<i>Code yellow, code yellow.</i>

466
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,230
<i>This message is</i>
<i>for all crew aboard the ILS.</i>

467
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,070
<i>As of 20:03,</i>
<i>we are initiating a code yellow.</i>

468
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:27,240
<i>The 1,836 pieces of space debris</i>
<i>we've been tracking since last night</i>

469
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,660
<i>have collided in succession,</i>
<i>forming a debris cloud.</i>

470
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,580
It isn't serious, is it?

471
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,950
This happens three or four times a year.

472
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,000
In a case like this,

473
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,790
we get into the Scorpion and wait.

474
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,670
Worst-case,
we evacuate immediately in the Scorpion.

475
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,840
Mr. Gong, pack all
your essential belongings.

476
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,800
Are you saying
we could go back to Earth today?

477
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,550
It's just a precaution, just in case.

478
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,140
It's never happened in my experience.

479
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,930
<i>It's too late to adjust again.</i>

480
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,890
<i>We think the space debris</i>
<i>will pass through in 40 minutes.</i>

481
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,690
<i>Prepare to evacuate if necessary.</i>

482
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:02,230
<i>Pack only the essentials</i>
<i>and wait in the Crew Scorpion.</i>

483
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,900
<i>This is nothing new.</i>
<i>Just do as you were trained.</i>

484
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:08,110
<i>Let's pray the debris cloud</i>
<i>clears the station.</i>

485
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,740
<i>Oh, and Kang Kang-su.</i>

486
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,910
<i>Given the emergency, I'm putting</i>
<i>your disciplinary action on hold.</i>

487
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,700
Go with the other astronauts.

488
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,290
Dr. Kang, load the fruit flies
onto the cargo ship.

489
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:19,790
And Mina,

490
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,170
move the lettuce you grew to the freezer.

491
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,840
-Okay.
-Santi.

492
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,130
Load the frozen human biosamples
on the CTV, okay?

493
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,470
Aye, Captain.

494
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,890
Okay, Dr. Lee, let's go get the mice.

495
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:34,890
If things go south,
the CTV will leave for Earth first.

496
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,770
Okay, let's get a move on.

497
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:40,480
Mr. Tourist, collect your personal items,

498
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,110
go to the Scorpion, and stay put.

499
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,780
Okay.

500
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,020
Come here.

501
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,230
All right, come here.

502
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,440
Come on, let's go.

503
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,740
You finish up here.

504
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,860
Okay.

505
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,560
Is it a morula yet?

506
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,110
How long has it been?

507
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:13,360
Not yet.

508
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:14,870
Forget it.

509
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:17,030
Go and wait in the Scorpion.

510
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,830
Stop wasting time.
You're putting yourself at risk. Come on.

511
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:23,000
Is there a hidden spot
to plug this in on the Scorpion?

512
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,000
It has to develop into a morula.

513
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:29,050
Is there somewhere to plug it in or not?

514
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,510
There's no way

515
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,720
I'm going back empty-handed.

516
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,680
Nothing ever comes of this.

517
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,890
Do as you were told
and wait in the Scorpion.

518
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,850
And what if it really leaves?

519
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:46,400
What if it leaves and I've abandoned this
because I chose to save myself?

520
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,780
I'm taking this with me no matter what.
And if it leaves, we leave together.

521
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:54,860
And if it ends in standby mode,
we come here and plug it back in.

522
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,950
Is there a place to plug this in?

523
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,830
Without power, it won't develop
into a morula and will die. You know that.

524
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,880
Is there or isn't there?

525
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,300
There isn't?

526
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,260
I'll find a place to hide it
and plug it in.

527
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:21,680
But get it to me ASAP.

528
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,810
It'll be fine as long as Eve doesn't know.

529
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,850
Just Eve?

530
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:39,240
You guys are unbelievable.

531
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:45,830
It's important you make sure
there's only one male per cage.

532
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,500
This damn space debris.
I should've known things were too quiet.

533
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,500
The mouse cage has 30% capacity remaining.

534
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,920
We need to hurry.

535
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,630
Dr. Kang, how much do you have left to do?

536
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:01,010
There are a lot of fruit flies.
It's going to take some time.

537
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,980
I'm only going to load
the Japanese greens and the romaine.

538
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:08,650
Okay, then I'll head to the Scorpion
and put it on standby.

539
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,730
As soon as you're done here, get on board.

540
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:14,690
-Santi, hurry up!
-Yes.

541
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:22,410
I'm going to go and pack my stuff.

542
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,630
Dr. Kang, did you pack
all the important stuff?

543
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,710
Important? Like what?

544
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,470
The expensive stuff.

545
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,730
Thanks to my colleagues,
any love I had for this place is gone,

546
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:48,060
and I'm being disciplined.

547
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,940
Don't worry,
I packed everything worth anything.

548
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,190
So mind your own business.

549
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,660
What did he say?

550
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,990
Does he have the ticket?

551
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,450
He does for sure.

552
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,750
Five hundred billion
just rained down upon him,

553
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,710
and that bastard plays it cool.

554
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,540
Yeah.

555
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:14,500
Must be nice.

556
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:15,880
Let's go.

557
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:21,640
<i>You have 20 minutes until impact.</i>
<i>Calmly board the Scorpion and wait there.</i>

558
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,510
<i>Please follow the training manual.</i>

559
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:28,770
Shit.

560
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,320
Damn it.

561
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:38,710
This is Scorpion.
The life support system is all clear.

562
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,670
The Scorpion's engine is nominal.

563
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:42,760
Okay.

564
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:49,260
We're not really
going back to Earth today, are we?

565
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:53,060
Dr. Kang,
I'm sure you'd be happy to go back.

566
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,990
<i>Eve, is the entire crew on standby?</i>

567
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:11,830
What's keeping you, Dr. Gong?

568
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:15,790
On my way.

569
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:17,880
<i>Where are you? Why aren't you on board?</i>

570
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,090
I'm on my way, Eve.

571
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:36,600
Look at this!

572
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:43,570
Code red, code red.

573
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,530
The debris will hit earlier than expected.

574
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,320
Santi.

575
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:50,200
-Get ready to depart.
-I'm on it.

576
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,780
I'll go get the tourist.

577
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:54,160
No, I'll go get the tourist.

578
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,460
What was that?

579
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,860
Oh, shit.

580
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:02,310
What was that?

581
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,860
What's going on?

582
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,150
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

583
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:13,490
<i>Debris has taken</i>
<i>the storage module antenna out.</i>

584
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,660
<i>The Wi-Fi and radio comms</i>
<i>in the observation module are down.</i>

585
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:18,960
This is IOU,

586
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,920
checking to see if we can restore comms
to the observation module. Over.

587
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,630
This is Seoul. The debris cloud
is expected to pass through the station.

588
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:29,050
<i>It is projected to pass</i>
<i>within one mile of the station.</i>

589
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:31,630
<i>Terminate standby.</i>
<i>Scorpion, switch to departure mode.</i>

590
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,850
Scorpion, switch to departure mode.

591
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:35,510
<i>Is everyone aboard?</i>

592
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,770
The tourist has not yet boarded.

593
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,690
Eve?

594
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,860
Fuck, what's going on?

595
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,610
Hey! Commander!

596
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:52,110
Has anyone here seen the tourist?

597
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,700
I'll go get him.

598
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,490
I saw him in the observation module.

599
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,200
In the observation module?

600
00:47:57,290 --> 00:48:01,410
But that's in the opposite direction.
You saw him there?

601
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,630
I'll go get him.

602
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:05,170
No, I'll go, Commander.

603
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:06,590
Chief.

604
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:08,880
IOU says a breach has been detected
in the storage module,

605
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,300
and both hatches have been sealed.

606
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,470
That means
the storage module has zero oxygen.

607
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:15,600
You must not open those hatches.

608
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,180
<i>There is no way</i>
<i>in or out of the observation module.</i>

609
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:23,600
When did you see him in there?

610
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:25,980
Check the CCTV.

611
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:36,410
-There.
-I see him…

612
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:38,580
He's leaving the main module.

613
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,500
But I don't see him returning.
He's still in the observation module.

614
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:45,670
The tourist is trapped
in the observation module alone?

615
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:47,040
Oh, no.

616
00:48:58,720 --> 00:48:59,890
I'm here.

617
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,520
I'm in here.

618
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:08,020
I said, I'm in here!

619
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:25,920
I'm going out.

620
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:29,630
It's pointless.

621
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:31,840
We can't reach the area
with the tourist anyway.

622
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,630
If we have people stuck in two areas,
it'll only complicate the rescue.

623
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,760
I'll go out and spacewalk over.

624
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,800
<i>Spacewalk? You're going to go out there?</i>

625
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:41,350
Are you out of your mind?

626
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:43,770
We have no idea
when the rescue ship will come.

627
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:45,890
Something could happen.

628
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:48,730
I have to go out there and bring Mr. Gong.

629
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:50,980
I am not leaving him here alone.

630
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:03,870
Headset.

631
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:06,040
If I go over there,

632
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,370
we can use a G.O ship
to get back to Earth.

633
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:12,090
I'm going to get him
and take him back down.

634
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,630
<i>Are you crazy? As commander,</i>
<i>you need to think rationally.</i>

635
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,880
You're being reckless!

636
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:18,220
Chief!

637
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,390
If they don't leave now,
they'll be in danger.

638
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:23,060
This is an order.

639
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:26,060
We'll send a rescue ship for the tourist.
Leave this instant.

640
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,060
Close the hatch right now!

641
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,420
Han Si-won, activate
the remote emergency separation.

642
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,380
We'll close the hatch from here.

643
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:05,350
Chief, please,
at least let me stay behind.

644
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:11,520
Han Si-won.

645
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,650
Damn it.

646
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:37,510
Chief!

647
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,550
Remote emergency separation
has been activated.

648
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,510
All six hooks have been released.

649
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:27,510
Departure is imminent.

650
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:43,530
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

651
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:44,780
Damn it.

652
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,200
Damn it!

653
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,250
Eve.

654
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:06,340
Commander?

655
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,010
Commander, Eve.

656
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:11,100
Santi.

657
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,430
Dr. Mina, Dr. Lee, can you hear me?

658
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:17,230
Hey, Kang Kang-su, you son of a bitch!
I'm in here.

659
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:19,650
Can't anybody hear me? I'm still here!

660
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,330
<i>Beyond the Huangpu River…</i>

661
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,750
<i>Most people use clams, but…</i>

662
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:20,840
No.

663
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:22,710
I'm still here!

664
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:24,880
I'm over here!

665
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,920
Somebody help me!

672
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,040
I feel terrible that we left them behind.

<i>You go back up there and bring back Ryong!</i>

674
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:43,330

<i>This isn't the time to get emotional.</i>
<i>Stay out of it.</i>

689
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,290
G.O-10 Expedition 3…

690
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,090
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

691
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:28,710
Hi.

692
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,630
-How are you?
-Fine, how are you doing?

693
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,880
-Good.
-Good.

694
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:36,390
-I speak Korean very well.
-Really? What a surprise.

695
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:39,770
-Me too. My Korean is good.
-Nice to meet you.

696
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:43,390
A little bit later,

697
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:47,310
could I get your autograph?

698
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,570
A little later.

699
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:53,030
-My autograph.
-I'm so nervous.

700
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:56,070
-No need to be nervous. It'll be fine.
-Right.

701
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,790
We're going live in three, two, one.

702
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:02,960
Many people want to know
what the position of commander entails

703
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:06,290
and exactly what kind of work you do.

704
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:08,880
It's not really different
from anything else.

705
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:14,550
My role is to ensure the safety
and well-being of the astronauts.

706
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:17,090
Insure, as in you "insured" them?

707
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:19,510
What I meant was "ensure," not "insure."

708
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,350
-Oh, yes. My apologies.
-It's okay.

709
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:23,680
Right.

710
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:27,440
The pressure…

711
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:30,980
There's a lot of pressure…

712
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:38,660
I'm sorry.

713
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:40,620
I hope you will all keep watching

714
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:45,830
right up until the moment Eve Kim
embarks on her journey to space.

715
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,380
This has been Lee Hwa-sin
for <i>News Spotlight</i>.

716
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:52,090
Let's cut to commercial.

717
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,670
Can I have your autograph?

718
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,300
Please? Yes.

719
00:57:57,550 --> 00:57:59,140
Autograph.

720
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:01,220
Okay.

721
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,560
Thank you.

722
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:08,020
"Kong Hyo-jin"?

723
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:11,650
Kong Hyo-jin? Who's Kong Hyo-jin?

724
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:14,650
Oh, no. I thought that was what you wrote.

725
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:16,280
Thank you.

726
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,950
-Thank you.
-Thanks a lot.

727
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:19,820
No, thank you for coming today.

728
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:21,490
-It was nothing.
-Thanks.

729
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:22,830
Let's go.

730
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:24,620
-Okay.
-Okay, let's go.

731
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:25,910
Oh, don't forget this.

732
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:29,500
-Kong Hyo-jin's autograph.
-Yeah.

733
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:30,880
Thank you.
