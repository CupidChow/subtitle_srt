1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,960
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

2
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,360
What?

3
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,660
No. Don't come out.

4
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,990
Stay there!

5
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,290
No, I deserve to die.

6
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,500
Please go back.

7
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,670
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

8
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:32,920
Go back, Eve!

9
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,170
Go back!

10
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,100
We're ready to go. Commander, take your seat.

11
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,310
I'm not leaving.

12
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,150
What?

13
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,020
I said, I'm not leaving.

14
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,530
If it were me trapped alone,

15
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,780
would you guys have left me behind?

16
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,620
If I were the tourist, would you have abandoned me?

17
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,120
Being the commander doesn't mean you have to throw your life away.

18
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,000
Are you saying it's okay for him to die?

19
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,420
Chief, would you have left me behind?

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,090
Dong-a, would you have abandoned an untrained civilian?

21
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,260
No, right?

22
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,300
I have the most experience with spacewalks,

23
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,390
so I should be the one to stay.

24
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,020
Reattach the hooks and open the hatch now.

25
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,390
I won't leave him alone here to die.

26
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,860
I'll find him and go back down with him on a G.O ship.

27
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,820
I'm not throwing my life away.

28
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,030
I'll stick close to the station and make my way over carefully.

29
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,450
Open the hatch!

30
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,210
This is Seoul. We have visual on EV1, Camera 5.

31
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,670
EV1, don't rush it. Just follow instructions.

32
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,010
We're looking for the safest route.

33
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,670
Copy.

34
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,720
This is EV1.

35
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,180
I'll make my way up from the kitchen module to Adapter 1,

36
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,270
the storage module, then Airlock 2.

37
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,240
IOU.

38
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,330
Is there any other spot leaking oxygen other than the storage module?

39
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,450
We cannot confirm that right at this time.

40
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,040
Are you saying you don't know if the tourist is alive?

41
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,770
I've reached the storage module.

42
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,190
The target point is visible 15 m ahead.

43
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,230
There are a lot of sharp edges, and the space debris will be back.

44
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,150
Be careful.

45
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,360
Copy.

46
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,360
Continuing on.

47
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,080
No.

48
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,040
No!

49
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,140
You're doing great.

50
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,220
You're almost there.

51
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,320
No.

52
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,940
What? Is it back already?

53
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,610
The debris cloud is approaching faster than we thought.

54
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,530
It's speeding up.

55
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,700
Eve, hurry. The big ones are coming.

56
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,080
Okay.

57
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,340
Incoming!

58
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,840
Eve, watch out!

59
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,720
No.

60
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,860
Has her space suit been compromised?

61
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,450
No, not yet.

62
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,740
What?

63
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,700
What?

64
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,080
Eve, take cover!

65
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,930
When we're back on Earth and standing on solid ground,

66
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,690
let's go out for meals,

67
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,570
movies and walks, just like everyone else.

68
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,480
If it rains, let's get wet

69
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,360
and let the wind blow us over.

70
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,910
Let's go on dates like they do on Earth.

71
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,080
When we get back, I'll be so good to you.

72
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,040
Once I set foot on solid ground,

73
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,710
I can be good to you too.

74
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,350
Don't look down!

75
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,270
Open your eyes and look straight ahead!

76
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,820
-Check the pressure in her suit. -Okay.

77
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,160
There's no oxygen leak. Her secondary tank's just been activated.

78
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,450
Okay. How are her vitals?

79
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,790
Her temperature and heart rate are still normal.

80
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,170
But there's no time. She has to get inside now.

81
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,170
Eve, are you all right? Can you hear me?

82
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
It's okay.

83
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,210
There should be some scratches on your suit, but nothing critical.

84
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,940
This is EV1.

85
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,490
The cloud of debris is clearing.

86
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,780
It'll be back!

87
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,540
Copy. I'll move fast.

88
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,220
IOU.

89
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,470
Have you gotten hold of the tourist yet?

90
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,720
Negative. Not yet.

91
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,750
I'm here.

92
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,210
Right below the airlock hatch.

93
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,130
What the hell was the tourist doing in the observation module?

94
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,470
How is he? Is he okay?

95
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,720
Stand by with the tourist, okay?

96
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,100
We'll confirm a safe time for your escape on the G.O-4 and update you soon.

97
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,370
Airlock has been pressurized.

98
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,310
Eve!

99
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,060
I'm sorry.

100
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,270
It's… It's my fault.

101
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,650
It's all my fault.

102
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,750
I'm sorry.

103
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,090
Eve.

104
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,220
Out of your suit yet?

105
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,010
You should've just left.

106
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,060
Do you really mean that?

107
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,940
You should've gone without me.

108
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,190
I deserve it.

109
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,610
I'm sorry for not making it there in time,

110
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,370
for drinking behind your back,

111
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,370
for calling you a murderer,

112
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,710
for being here at all, for having feelings for…

113
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,800
For everything. I'm sorry for everything.

114
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,090
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

115
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,440
You said you'd be good to me.

116
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,490
You said you wanted to… You know, like they do on Earth.

117
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,580
Let's do that when we're back on Earth.

118
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:51,100
Eve, if you're out of your suit, turn it around.

119
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,310
Turn the camera around.

120
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,490
Eve.

121
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,000
Can you hear me?

122
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,640
Did we lose connection again?

123
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,390
Eve?

124
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,640
The connection seems fine, but I can't hear her.

125
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,230
I'm sure they're fine.

126
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,610
The connection is stable and functioning properly.

127
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:48,320
They've probably entered an area with intermittent communication loss.

128
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,240
I hope that's it.

129
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,950
-When will we have the escape time? -Right.

130
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,040
Breaking news.

131
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,080
The Scorpion spacecraft made an emergency escape after colliding with space debris

132
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:02,920
and is now heading to Earth with astronauts from Spain and Korea onboard.

133
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,760
Fortunately, the Crew Scorpion has a total capacity of six,

134
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:12,390
and it's assumed the entire crew was able to evacuate from the space station.

135
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:16,220
Whether any astronauts remain on the space station

136
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,270
has yet to be confirmed.

137
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,730
IOU and the Seoul Mission Control Center

138
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,230
have announced they will brief the media

139
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,690
on the emergency escape shortly.

140
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,280
-Whether the tourist… -Mr. Go.

141
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,570
…is aboard the Scorpion and returning a day early is unknown.

142
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,030
As soon as we know more…

143
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,000
Well…

144
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,080
I'm sure he's fine, what with all the advanced technology we have.

145
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,840
Don't worry, okay?

146
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,170
You know Ryong. I bet he's just lying there, relaxing…

147
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,630
No, wait. He zonks out fast.

148
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,890
He's probably snoring like this on his way back here now.

149
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,560
-Should I go pick him up? -Sorry?

150
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,930
Can I come?

151
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,270
I'll come too.

152
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,850
You really can't. You know that, right?

153
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,650
We have our own airline.

154
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,490
-Yes. -Call and ask them to free up a plane.

155
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,150
I didn't see him off when he left.

156
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,450
You can't fly out right away, and you'd never beat him there.

157
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,000
I don't need to beat him there.

158
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,210
He's not coming straight to Seoul, right?

159
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:25,290
You said he'd need a few days to adjust to gravity at the hospital.

160
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,420
I can bring him back with me on our plane after that.

161
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,430
What are you waiting for? Go make the call.

162
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,890
But it takes time to go through the procedures.

163
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,050
Make it happen.

164
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,020
Yes, ma'am.

165
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:45,650
I wonder if the egg developed into a morula before he set off.

166
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,590
GONG RYONG'S 8TH DAY

167
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,750
MORULA FORMED

168
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,350
The G.O-4 set for their escape is functional in all modules,

169
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,770
and the propulsion control system is working fine.

170
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,270
Okay.

171
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,860
It's been in hibernation mode, so make sure it's fully powered up.

172
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,570
The last step is the engine firing test. Should we start?

173
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,900
The liquid oxygen levels are dropping.

174
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,780
It looks like there's a leak.

175
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,780
That means it could explode when we fire up the engine.

176
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,000
The oxygen saturation isn't that high, so it shouldn't be a problem.

177
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,580
We can start the engine.

178
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,460
-Zoom in on the spacecraft. -Okay.

179
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,860
I don't see any leaks.

180
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,400
It's probably not showing up on camera.

181
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,530
If the leak isn't visible,

182
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,030
it should be fine to fire up the engine.

183
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,240
They can't avoid the debris and return safely

184
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,500
unless we start the engine and change the orbit.

185
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,580
Right.

186
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,120
I'm a little worried,

187
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,090
but we can't let them board without testing it first.

188
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,630
This is the only way for them to evacuate.

189
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,510
Okay, start the test.

190
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,550
Yes, Chief.

191
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,930
Keep an eye on the liquid oxygen levels.

192
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,770
-Check the saturation again too. -Okay.

193
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,940
They'll depart as soon as the test is complete.

194
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,020
Got it.

195
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,410
They're doing the final test on the spacecraft now.

196
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,910
We'll depart in an hour.

197
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,250
And in four hours, we'll be back on Earth.

198
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,060
You're not losing your mind or anything, right?

199
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,290
You're not regretting it, are you?

200
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,090
Am I dreaming?

201
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,300
THE TRUTH IS, I CAME HERE TO CREATE EMBRYOS…

202
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,900
Why does that damn oxygen tank keep floating around? It's distracting.

203
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,110
Are you in love with Eve?

204
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,330
What? I was her mentor for five years.

205
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,500
I was yours for five years.

206
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,590
Crew Scorpion is entering the atmosphere.

207
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,510
Put the Scorpion on the main screen.

208
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,770
Scorpion has entered the atmosphere

209
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,730
and is expected to land in the open waters

210
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,150
off the coast of Florida in 35 minutes as scheduled.

211
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,040
This is my first time riding Scorpion.

212
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,210
I hope it's as safe as a G.O vessel.

213
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:01,920
Scorpion?

214
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,760
-Was that an explosion? -Mina.

215
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,010
Scorpion?

216
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,480
Seoul? What was that?

217
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,270
What was that?

218
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,190
What's going on?

219
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,520
Dona, what's happening?

220
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,400
An explosion?

221
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,910
The escape ship's engine module blew up during testing.

222
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,330
Get G.O-4 on the screen.

223
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,500
Eve, are you all right?

224
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,710
Mr. Gong Ryong?

225
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,130
Are you okay?

226
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,290
I'm okay. Are you all right, Eve?

227
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,420
Close the airlock hatch first, Commander!

228
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,130
The engine module exploded.

229
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,870
The truth is,

230
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:15,120
I came here to create embryos using the MZ Group heir's sperm

231
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,830
and his wife's eggs.

232
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,870
I hid the eggs in the ice cream cup.

233
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,250
I fertilized them behind your back,

234
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,210
and the embryo is now in the incubator.

235
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,550
Please don't let it die.

236
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,730
The engine module gave out during the test and blew apart.

237
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,770
The remote power controls aren't responding,

238
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,980
and the undocking system is down.

239
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,360
It can't be detached from the station.

240
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,240
The vessel is useless now.

241
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:58,200
It won't get you back to Earth.

242
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:16,890
Eve.

243
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,850
What… What do we do now?

244
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,900
There's nothing we can do.

245
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,490
-Go get my future son-in-law and grandkid. -This way.

246
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,370
Bring them both back safely.

247
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,330
Yes, Chairman.

248
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,210
The astronauts who escaped have passed through the atmosphere.

249
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,890
-Hello, there. It's good to see you. -Did you have lunch?

250
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,520
It's been a long time.

251
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,310
-Hello. -Hey.

252
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:10,280
Eve, here's the situation.

253
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,280
G.O-4, the only escape ship available to you,

254
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,910
is no longer an option.

255
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,740
Right now, there's no way for you

256
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,540
to get back to Earth.

257
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,330
How soon can you send a rescue ship?

258
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,250
I'll look into it right away.

259
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:30,500
In the meantime, check the station's power and see how long you can hold up.

260
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,760
Copy.

261
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,080
Commander, is there anything I can do to help?

262
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,690
Things are not looking good here.

263
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,440
It seems the solar array got fried

264
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,440
when the storage module was breached.

265
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,410
You've got to be kidding me.

266
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,280
We can no longer get power from the solar panels,

267
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,040
so we'll have to rely on emergency power.

268
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,660
How long do you think it'll last?

269
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:51,790
Well, I'd say no more than two days.

270
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,760
Then you need to conserve power. Switch all modules to emergency mode.

271
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,550
We'll keep communication open until your space suit battery runs out.

272
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,010
Let's keep it to a minimum.

273
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,140
Got it.

274
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,060
I'll start by turning off the systems

275
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,480
that consume the most power, except for life support.

276
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,900
We'll get to you in two days. We can.

277
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,360
We will.

278
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,030
The press is waiting.

279
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,990
You need to speak to them before the Scorpion lands,

280
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,750
or they'll realize the commander and the tourist couldn't evacuate.

281
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,790
We need to shape the story on our end.

282
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,430
Here she comes!

283
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,480
-Here she comes! -Where?

284
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,230
What caused the emergency evacuation from the space station?

285
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,520
Has everyone on the station made it out safely?

286
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,610
When is the tourist coming back to Korea?

287
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:58,400
-Please give us an update. -Could you give us the details?

288
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,200
When is the official…

289
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,330
It's become a morula.

290
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:11,420
Sixteen cells.

291
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,380
I just need to bring it back and implant it.

292
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:36,110
Don't be scared, okay?

293
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,280
We can get through this.

294
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:15,520
We just need to hold out for two days until they send the rescue ship.

295
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:21,530
If we keep the power usage to a minimum, we should be able to make it.

296
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,200
But…

297
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,460
Once you turn off the dehumidifier, condensation will start to form.

298
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,250
That could be dangerous.

299
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,210
So get here before we freeze to death.

300
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,110
I'll make sure to get you back to Earth.

301
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,620
Is there anything you need?

302
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,670
No, thank you.

303
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,720
We're ready to go.

304
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,970
Please turn off your tablet and all other electronic devices.

305
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,390
Wait, look at this.

306
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,180
What is it?

307
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,230
The emergency evacuation from the space station was due to debris

308
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:39,360
created by the collision of a fuel tank with a low-orbit satellite.

309
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,440
Secondary impacts formed a large cloud of debris,

310
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,030
which was so vast that

311
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:47,450
despite orbit adjustments, it still intersected the station's path.

312
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:51,200
The escape ship has passed through Earth's atmosphere

313
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,620
and is heading to the waters off Florida's coast.

314
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,660
Ocean.

315
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,710
I feel terrible that we left them behind.

316
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,040
When will they launch the rescue ship?

317
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,210
How are the commander and the tourist? Are they okay?

318
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,350
The spacecraft that has arrived on Earth is carrying a total of four people.

319
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,230
The mission commander and the tourist

320
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,400
are currently still at the space station.

321
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:09,110
IOU and the Seoul Mission Control Center are preparing a rescue ship

322
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,530
to evacuate the commander and Mr. Gong Ryong

323
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:14,070
from the station as soon as possible.

324
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,870
Due to the damage caused by the space debris,

325
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:21,330
-they were left stranded on the station. -What is she saying, Dr. Jeon?

326
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,630
-They're in good health with no injuries. -I don't…

327
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:28,260
-They're maintaining communication… -I'm not sure.

328
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,170
…while awaiting the second evacuation.

329
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,970
We plan to bring them back to Earth as quickly as possible.

330
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:39,020
When and where will the rescue ship launch?

331
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,100
Who will board?

332
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,020
That'll be all.

333
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,650
I'm sorry. We'll issue an official statement soon.

334
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,360
-I'm sorry. Excuse me. -Could you tell us more now?

335
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,500
I'll go.

336
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:10,880
The available vessels are at IOU Mission Control and in the States.

337
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:14,010
This isn't the time to get emotional. Stay out of it.

338
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:18,600
You know it's going to take at least a week for them to launch.

339
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,220
We can't wait that long.

340
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,680
Let me take our own vessel.

341
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,770
We don't have a vessel that's completed a crewed flight.

342
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:29,360
The one we have has never carried people into space.

343
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,240
You know we're just testing

344
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,990
the abort system and reentry in two days with a manikin!

345
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,490
I'm saying, put me on it instead of the manikin.

346
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:39,160
Isn't the manikin a stand-in for a person anyway?

347
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,250
Just get out of here.

348
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:50,090
You're telling me to put you on the test flight to see

349
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,960
if it's safe enough to carry people?

350
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:52,970
You're insane!

351
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:56,300
They only have two days' worth of power left on the space station.

352
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:59,640
I'd rather die trying to reach them than die from the stress of waiting.

353
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,810
You just won't quit!

354
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:02,270
I'm a pilot, all right?

355
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,940
A soldier who's prepared to die in the air any day.

356
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:08,400
Are you going to let Eve die? And send a rescue ship after she's dead?

357
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,730
In this kind of situation, you should say, Man up and be the manikin.

358
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,570
You're a soldier. I'm your superior.

359
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,070
This is an order, you fucker!

360
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,360
You want to go? Fine, go!

361
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:17,820
Why can't you be like this?

362
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,540
You think you want to save Eve and I don't?

363
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:26,290
You can't bring them back if you don't make it there safely,

364
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,250
you stupid womanizer!

365
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,590
Have you ever seen the manikin come back in one piece?

366
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,510
Who do you think you are? You don't even work here!

367
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,930
I'm not quitting.

368
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,140
My resignation hasn't been processed yet.

369
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,890
You can just forget about it.

370
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,480
I won't stand for it

371
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,690
if anyone hesitates to save Eve's life.

372
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,980
Even if it's you.

373
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:10,500
GONG RYONG'S 9TH DAY

374
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:06,970
It's minus 20 degrees.

375
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,850
I found the thermal tents.

376
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,060
Let's wait it out in these.

377
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:18,740
-I'm going to go see if there's any food. -Okay.

378
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:29,660
As you all know, the ILS system has been severely damaged,

379
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,790
and we can't get the automatic docking to work,

380
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:35,210
so the unmanned rescue ship is useless.

381
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:37,420
We need to send astronauts on the rescue ship.

382
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,840
When can we do it?

383
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,760
We haven't even detached the engine from the Scorpion yet.

384
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,340
It will take at least a week.

385
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,350
Bongani.

386
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:50,100
When is the earliest you can get the G.O spaceship ready for launch?

387
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,230
The earliest I would be able to get them ready would be five days.

388
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,110
Can you please move up three days?

389
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,990
Isn't the Maru ready to launch in two days?

390
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,120
Has it done the return test yet?

391
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,080
This will be our first test with dummies.

392
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:15,290
We didn't even finish an emergency escape test.

393
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:35,100
Water, guys.

394
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,820
Can I get a water, please?

395
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:43,490
Please.

396
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:46,030
Get me a bottle of water, you prick.

397
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,530
Hello?

398
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,700
Is there a Mr. Kang? Mr. Kang?

399
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,290
Just a moment.

400
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,120
Here. It's for you.

401
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,590
Hello? This is Kang Kang-su.

402
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:05,970
Why did you come back alone? Why is Ryong still up there?

403
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:09,600
Why did you come back without him? You bastard!

404
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,680
-Go-eun. -You go back up there right now

405
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,480
and bring back Ryong!

406
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,730
All right.

407
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,310
All right, listen.

408
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,610
You have a plane in Houston, right?

409
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:28,990
WE ARE CLOSED

410
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:35,290
Hey.

411
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,460
Damn it.

412
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,100
For God's sake! Stop crying like it's his funeral!

413
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:59,190
He's going to come back just fine!

414
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:01,570
Your eyes are made for seeing,

415
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,150
not for spilling damn tears.

416
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,480
Hey, come on.

417
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,820
Damn it.

418
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,410
That jerk.

419
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:39,230
EVE, GONG RYONG STRANDED FOR 30 HOURS

420
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,650
This is the space station.

421
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,900
We're running out of emergency power.

422
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,740
Communication uses up the most power,

423
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,530
so if we keep charging the space suit,

424
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:57,370
the life support system will shut down.

425
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,380
I know we need to stay online for rescue,

426
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:04,590
but we won't survive without oxygen, so for now…

427
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:09,130
I'll shut down everything

428
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:12,430
except the CO2 scrubbers and oxygen generators.

429
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,060
This is probably our last transmission.

430
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,810
The tourist and I are holding on for now.

431
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,650
We won't give up hope until the end.

432
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,820
IOU is doing everything it can to speed things up.

433
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,440
We'll be there in 24 hours.

434
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:28,740
Really?

435
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,450
Yeah.

436
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:35,580
We'll launch within 30 hours max.

437
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,170
I…

438
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,340
I mean, we…

439
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,680
Please don't give up on us, guys.

440
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,020
I'll see you back on Earth.

441
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,610
Commander.

442
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,780
Eve.

443
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,270
How about a drink?

444
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,780
By the time IOU gets there, they'll both be dead.

445
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,280
Shut up.

446
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:37,070
The Maru is set for launch tomorrow. Instead of the manikin...

447
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,410
I said, shut up.

448
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:39,570
What's your plan then?

449
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,410
Call Bongani and tell him to get it done in 30 hours!

450
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:45,540
Even if he does, they'll both be dead in 30 hours!

451
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,710
They'll suffocate to death from the CO2 buildup

452
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,040
and lack of oxygen!

453
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:50,880
You know Eve. If she says two days,

454
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,380
it means they've got less than that!

455
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,970
What then?

456
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,340
You want to let Dong-a go like he says?

457
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:59,800
And tell yourselves, We did everything we could?

458
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,180
If we do that, all three of them will die, you idiots!

459
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,730
Damn it.

460
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,940
Shit.

461
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,280
OXYGEN REMAINING IN STATION: 28%

462
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,370
SURVIVAL TIME REMAINING: APPROXIMATELY 20 HOURS

463
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,460
God, it's cold.

464
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I'm cold.

465
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,390
You think rescue will come tomorrow?

466
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:55,730
Don't talk. Save your energy.

467
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,530
Will they come?

468
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,660
Why is time passing so slowly?

469
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:09,750
Well, don't you have your cell phone?

470
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,630
You can't go online,

471
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:15,800
but don't you have some music or videos saved?

472
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:21,430
Where's my phone? I can't find it.

473
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:30,640
I guess it's somewhere over there.

474
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:32,980
I'm freezing.

475
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:33,900
Uh-huh.

476
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:36,650
Uh-huh?

477
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,530
Uh-huh.

478
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:42,160
Are formalities out the window now?

479
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:46,120
Let's just drop them.

480
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:49,580
We're going to die soon anyway, so who cares?

481
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:53,790
Yeah.

482
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:56,210
You're right.

483
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,590
-Eve. -Yeah?

484
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:02,470
Where's the liquor? Are you going to drink it after you freeze to death?

485
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:05,890
I was saving it for when we really need it.

486
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,930
When we really can't take it anymore,

487
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,980
and there's absolutely no choice.

488
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,150
We're going to die if you save it any longer.

489
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:18,230
Stop saying we're going to die.

490
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,190
Come on, let's just drink it.

491
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,740
My feet have gone numb.

492
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,700
They've gone numb already?

493
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,870
Yeah.

494
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:28,990
Hang on.

495
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,120
Here.

496
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:43,970
Oh, geez.

497
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,600
How is it?

498
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,730
God, that's good.

499
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:00,900
Here.

500
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:13,710
-How is it? -It burns.

501
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:15,420
Feels good, right?

502
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:24,760
Oh, that's nice.

503
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:32,310
I'd kill for a movie right now.

504
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:34,770
A movie would be great.

505
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:49,030
Let's go see one when we're back on Earth.

506
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,120
Together.

507
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,750
Together?

508
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:00,420
Yeah.

509
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:20,230
Eve.

510
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,020
Yeah?

511
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:28,400
Never mind.

512
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,120
What is it?

513
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:34,200
If I'm about to die,

514
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:36,830
can I be forgiven for anything?

515
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:41,170
What's the point of forgiveness? Once you're dead, it's all over.

516
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:44,170
For some things, you'd still want forgiveness.

517
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,680
Like what?

518
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:54,430
Like…

519
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,480
Nothing, never mind.

520
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,950
Let's get some rest now.

521
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:17,200
I should stretch my legs.

522
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,580
What's wrong? Are you in pain?

523
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,090
What's the matter?

524
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,630
I have a cramp. It's really bad.

525
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:30,800
What? You… You have a cramp?

526
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,880
Yeah.

527
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:33,510
Hold on a second.

528
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:38,140
-No, don't come out! -No.

529
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,140
-Stay there! -No.

530
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,600
Oh, it's bad.

531
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:43,810
Stay there!

532
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,400
No, don't! It's dangerous!

533
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,690
No, wait!

534
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:49,860
Which leg, the left one?

535
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:50,990
It hurts.

536
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:53,950
Where? Here?

537
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:55,120
Yeah.

538
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,500
Your leg is freezing.

539
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:02,500
Go back in. It's not safe outside the tent. Go!

540
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,920
You'll put yourself in danger.

541
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:07,460
What?

542
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:10,760
Well, you said it's not safe outside the tent.

543
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:14,340
Bad idea?

544
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:17,390
No.

545
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:36,490
Come here.

546
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,290
Isn't this a little better?

547
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,550
-You know… -Yeah?

548
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:57,640
It'd actually be warmer if we were naked.

549
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:03,640
Are you okay with that?

550
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,650
We might actually die.

551
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:09,020
It's not a matter of whether I'm okay with it.

552
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:19,870
-Can I have the liquor? -Yeah.

553
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:22,950
Do you want some?

554
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,370
-Go ahead. -Okay.

555
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,480
Get your arm out first.

556
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:03,200
Your body feels ice cold.

557
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:05,370
Yeah.

558
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,750
I'll warm you up.

559
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,050
Just hang on. You'll feel warm in a minute.

560
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:17,130
Okay.

561
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:22,890
Are you warm?

562
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:26,640
Yeah.

563
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,860
You must be out of your mind. You're the commander.

564
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:33,730
No.

565
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:37,320
This is the protocol, you know.

566
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:41,120
I'm just following protocol.

567
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,240
Seriously.

568
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,720
Commander.

569
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:04,810
Yeah?

570
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,690
The truth is…

571
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:18,400
The truth is,

572
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:22,370
I came here to create embryos using the MZ Group heir's sperm

573
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:25,490
and his wife's eggs.

574
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:27,700
What?

575
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:30,960
I hid the eggs in the ice cream cup.

576
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:33,170
They were my patients,

577
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:36,170
and the wife desperately wants a child.

578
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,510
While pretending to be a tourist…

579
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:47,680
I managed to fertilize an egg.

580
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:52,060
In my pocket outside

581
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,940
is an embryo with 16 cells.

582
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,030
A living being.

583
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:06,870
Here he comes!

584
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:08,540
He's here.

585
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,330
Stay back, please.

586
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:18,380
Hi. What's the current situation?

587
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:19,460
Can we have an update?

588
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:23,050
Can you tell us how you plan to bring back the tourist from the space station?

589
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:25,640
-When is the official briefing? -Can you please tell us?

590
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,560
-Tell us about your plan. -Any updates?

591
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,970
How's the tourist? Is he okay?

592
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:31,850
-Why the silence? -Please tell us.

593
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:33,350
Excuse me! Here!

594
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:39,360
Kill me if you want.

595
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:42,240
I deserve it.

596
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:56,830
I wonder if Santi

597
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,250
is with his wife now.

598
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,630
I've lied to you…

599
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:10,680
more than a hundred times because of this.

600
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,860
It's nice, isn't it?

601
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:22,490
What is?

602
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:34,160
That means three people might die here.

603
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:41,210
Did… Did you just say people?

604
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:47,890
I don't even have the energy to be mad at you right now.

605
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,180
Why bother?

606
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,390
It's all pointless now.

607
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:07,860
Are you happy that there are three of us dying?

608
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:12,410
Yeah.

609
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,910
I was worried it might end up dying here alone.

610
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:21,340
But we're sharing the same fate, so that's a little better.

611
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,100
Don't give up.

612
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:41,400
They'll still send a rescue ship even if we die.

613
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:45,900
Maybe you can make them take it back and implant it.

614
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:50,110
Write a will or something.

615
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,210
Eve.

616
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:04,130
It's our dying wish.

617
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:06,920
Maybe they'll do it.

618
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:19,940
I hope it's born healthy.

619
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:50,260
I'm happy even if I freeze to death.

620
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:11,490
Let's try the thing the mice couldn't do.

621
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,870
Even the mice couldn't do it, so how can we?

622
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:17,620
Before we die.

623
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:09,840
GONG RYONG'S 10TH DAY

624
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,060
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

625
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:32,360
They're no longer getting oxygen.

626
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,240
If we don't send a rescue ship today,

627
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:37,110
we'll lose both the commander and the tourist.

628
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,160
He's a complete idiot!

629
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,490
Please get them to launch

630
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:44,500
the rescue ship right away.

631
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:47,750
I will never let Ryong die.

632
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:49,790
We're going to launch the Maru toward the ILS orbit.

633
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,800
We need international cooperation.

634
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:55,420
This is the fastest way to get to them.

635
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:56,800
Please let me go.

636
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,680
Even if you made it there,

637
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,760
it'd be a gamble with all the systems down.

638
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:04,810
Worst-case scenario, you might crash right into the station.

639
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:06,270
If you'll let me,

640
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:08,980
I want to go to rescue the commander and the tourist too.

641
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:17,110
