1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,960
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

2
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,290
The baby's heart rate is too fast.

3
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,800
Please get back to me as soon as possible.

4
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,070
GONG RYONG

5
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,290
Mr. Gong?

6
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,510
The ultrasound.

7
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,550
What is this?

8
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,600
Why did you send it to Yi-man?

9
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,470
Is it okay for the baby's heart to beat so fast?

10
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,230
The heartbeat of a fetus can be irregular.

11
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,820
It's at 180 bpm now,

12
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,030
so it's fine as long as it doesn't go higher.

13
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,150
Don't worry.

14
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,160
I see.

15
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,240
Eve.

16
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,910
Is the baby…

17
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,920
From when we were in space.

18
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,130
You're the father.

19
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,830
I'll come to you.

20
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,750
Okay.

21
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,220
Get here soon. I miss you.

22
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,010
Okay.

23
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,090
Hey, are you smiling or crying?

24
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,310
You haven't paid the fine,

25
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,520
lost your medical license,

26
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,360
and got a two-year sentence.

27
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,570
Look, the IOU or the KSA

28
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,700
would never send you to space again, so how…

29
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,580
I should go.

30
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,510
I have something to tell you.

31
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,390
What is it? Is something going on?

32
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,020
Sorry I couldn't tell you sooner.

33
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,940
I only found out a few days ago myself.

34
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,850
What is it?

35
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,730
I'm 12 weeks pregnant.

36
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,450
Wait, what are you talking about?

37
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,790
That's absurd.

38
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,960
It's true.

39
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,750
The baby is healthy.

40
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,090
Who's the father?

41
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,430
It's Mr. Gong Ryong.

42
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:12,850
It happened here.

43
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,400
The baby will die if I go back to Earth.

44
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,450
Please let me stay.

45
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,860
I'll have the baby here.

46
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,240
-Eve. -Eve.

47
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,410
Are you insane?

48
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,660
You know you could die trying to have the baby there!

49
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,330
No one has ever done that before, not even the mice!

50
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,750
Do you have a death wish?

51
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,420
Chief.

52
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,880
Look, I want to live.

53
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,340
Dong-a, I'm not trying to get myself killed.

54
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,470
I disposed of the morula.

55
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,470
If I give up this baby too,

56
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,180
I won't be able to live.

57
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,850
I still can't forgive my mother.

58
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,810
I tried, but I can't. She did abandon me after all.

59
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,780
I'm not going to give up on this baby's life or my own.

60
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,030
Because of this baby,

61
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,620
I really, desperately…

62
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:17,250
want to live a long, healthy life. More than I ever did.

63
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:23,880
Dr. Ma, Chief, Dong-a, I need your help, okay?

64
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,380
Help me.

65
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,590
You will stand by for departure as planned and wait for further orders.

66
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,800
Chief!

67
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,760
Chief!

68
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,390
-Eve. -Eve.

69
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,760
What's wrong?

70
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:36,930
Eve, what's wrong?

71
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,890
-Eve, are you in pain? -What's the matter?

72
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,060
Chief! Eve!

73
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,520
Eun-su, get Dona in here now.

74
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,730
Where's Dona?

75
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,190
Eve, are you all right?

76
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,490
How the hell did you miss that she was pregnant?

77
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:56,540
She got a check-up at MZ Medical Center when she was back in Seoul,

78
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,500
and another one in Houston right before the launch.

79
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,210
How did…

80
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,750
She was here for less than three weeks.

81
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,920
It may not show up on tests for 21 days. She probably didn't know.

82
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,220
Who would've thought… Eve couldn't have seen this coming.

83
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,640
What do we do now?

84
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,690
The mom will be safe coming back down, right?

85
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,150
Yeah, I think so.

86
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,360
We have to bring her back, okay?

87
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,950
I'm not an ob-gyn.

88
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,370
First, we need to find an ob-gyn who's familiar with zero gravity.

89
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,330
Where the hell are we going to find a doctor like that?

90
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,660
An ob-gyn who knows about

91
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,500
pregnancy in zero gravity and has been to the space station?

92
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,960
We won't find anyone like that anywhere in the world!

93
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,650
No, absolutely not. We can't do that.

94
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,900
But nobody else will be willing to go!

95
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,910
Even the tourist can only stay there for seven to ten days at most.

96
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,240
He'll have to skip the space training, which means

97
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,700
he could lose his ability to walk due to the aftereffects of zero gravity.

98
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,790
You know that.

99
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,080
There's only one person

100
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,630
who would be willing to risk their life.

101
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,220
The only fool who'd go knowing all this

102
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,800
is Mr. Gong Ryong.

103
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,930
NEW MESSAGE FROM LEE SEUNG-JUN

104
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,850
Mr. Gong, Eve has abdominal pain.

105
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,190
Please check the ultrasound.

106
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,110
We got Eve's ultrasound.

107
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,110
Chief, Eve has been having abdominal pain.

108
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,950
She even has some vaginal bleeding.

109
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,620
Take a look at her ultrasound.

110
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,290
From this, I can't figure out the cause.

111
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,130
Eve's cervix appears to be short.

112
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,340
The lower part looks funnel-shaped.

113
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,590
I think it might be cervical incompetence,

114
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,840
but the ultrasound wasn't done by a doctor.

115
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,840
To be sure, I need a transvaginal ultrasound.

116
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,510
Let's have them do one right now.

117
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,970
No, that could put her in danger.

118
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,060
We don't have much time!

119
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,930
-She's bleeding, Mr. Gong. -She's…

120
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,310
She's bleeding?

121
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,020
That means

122
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,980
her cervix is opening further or something else is wrong.

123
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,700
A transvaginal ultrasound must be done carefully.

124
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,030
Since the amniotic sac has descended, rupturing it would be dangerous.

125
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,280
The fetus would also be at risk if you touch it.

126
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,200
It'll result in a miscarriage,

127
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,830
and her bleeding will get worse.

128
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,580
She could get an infection and go into shock.

129
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,960
Due to fluid loss in space,

130
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,210
minimal bleeding can lead to hypovolemic shock.

131
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,340
She could die.

132
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,760
She's in no shape to return!

133
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,340
Even if she could,

134
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,300
she'd never risk the baby's life.

135
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,800
Please don't let her die.

136
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,890
You idiots, you think I'm trying to kill her?

137
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,730
She needs an ob-gyn

138
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,650
to figure out the exact cause

139
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,440
and stitch up her cervix or do whatever it takes

140
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,900
to stop the bleeding.

141
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,070
You know you can't do surgery in zero gravity.

142
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,780
You can do a McDonald cerclage.

143
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,070
A STITCH AROUND THE CERVIX

144
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:22,200
Chief, the only person who's performed surgery in zero gravity

145
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,160
is Mr. Gong Ryong.

146
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,370
Chief.

147
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,920
Please let me go up there.

148
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,430
I know the IOU would never approve of this.

149
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,270
I don't even have a medical license.

150
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,530
I still haven't paid the fine,

151
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,740
and I can't afford to buy another space trip.

152
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,860
Please just sneak me onto the cargo ship like a piece of baggage.

153
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,320
You'll be dead before you get there.

154
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,160
You hate me, don't you?

155
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,540
You think I deserve to die like that.

156
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,870
Put me on the ship with the mice.

157
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,210
With the fruit flies.

158
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,500
Please.

159
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,760
Please send me up there.

160
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,890
Please.

161
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,810
Please let me go and be by Eve's side.

162
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,100
I'm begging you. The two of them…

163
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,270
are my family now.

164
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:42,150
He's the only doctor who can help her here.

165
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,820
Please let him come!

166
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,740
There's no time, Chief.

167
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,620
I'm begging you.

168
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,830
Please, I'm begging you.

169
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,630
We deeply regret for what happened.

170
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,130
There is no excuse.

171
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,930
And I also understand how ridiculous

172
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,390
it sounds to send a criminal back to the space.

173
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,060
But before you brand him as a convict,

174
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:17,480
consider him as the only doctor who can save a life up in space.

175
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,150
Give him a chance to save our astronaut Eve.

176
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,990
If anyone can save life there,

177
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,030
it would be him.

178
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,210
Ryong!

179
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,380
Are you having lunch?

180
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,090
-Did you eat? -Yeah.

181
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,170
Come sit.

182
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,140
-Mom. -Yeah?

183
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,680
-Mom. -What?

184
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,600
Mom!

185
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,060
What is it, silly?

186
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,310
I'm going somewhere far away.

187
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,520
Where?

188
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,560
For how long?

189
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,480
Well, I'll be back soon.

190
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,900
When is that?

191
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,400
I'll call you when I get there.

192
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,290
You ladies are really amazing.

193
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,790
You raised me, fed me,

194
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,410
and put me through school.

195
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,670
Wow, you're just so petty.

196
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,590
You made sure to skip over the giving birth part.

197
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,960
-Geez. -You could've thrown it in there.

198
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,340
Here.

199
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,520
Use this when you need it, like when you're sick.

200
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,230
Please don't try to save money

201
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,480
and rely on painkillers when you have issues.

202
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,900
What the heck are you saying?

203
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,310
Maybe he's talking all big with an overdraft account.

204
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,320
TRANSACTION DETAILS

205
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,870
This is supposed to be your wedding fund. Why are you giving it to us?

206
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,290
And for God's sake, stop drinking so much!

207
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,420
Hey, why are you being melodramatic with all this stuff?

208
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,170
Thank you for being my mom.

209
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,930
I know it made your lives so much harder.

210
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:16,810
I love you.

211
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,270
You fool!

212
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,610
What are you… Where are you going?

213
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,320
How long will you be gone?

214
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,820
Come on, tell us.

215
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,620
Just get me some rice.

216
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,700
He wants rice.

217
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,450
-No, you can have mine. Here. -Right, let's eat first.

218
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,710
Just half a bowl, okay?

219
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,870
-That's not enough. Here you go. -Shush!

220
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,290
Hwa-ja, grill a mackerel!

221
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,880
-Get him some soup too. -Right.

222
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,300
How's Eve?

223
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,310
Her bleeding won't stop,

224
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,930
and her cervix looks even shorter.

225
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,730
She's refusing to take painkillers for the baby's sake,

226
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,270
so she's in more pain now.

227
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,900
She might really have a miscarriage soon.

228
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,740
Her blood pressure is still rising.

229
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:14,070
Okay, let's go. Hurry up.

230
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,450
What is your song request?

231
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,750
Song request? Are you fucking kidding me right now?

232
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,290
Don't take that tone, asshole!

233
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,290
You have no right to say that!

234
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:25,750
You're lucky we're sending you to space instead of jail.

235
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,170
Now, I'm not into this either.

236
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,050
But Eve is the only reason we're doing this, motherfucker!

237
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,680
Liftoff.

238
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,390
Liftoff.

239
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,700
Hang in there, Eve.

240
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,580
He'll be here soon, okay?

241
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,950
He's coming.

242
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,720
-Dr. Lee. -Go, hurry.

243
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,070
Thank you.

244
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,110
Eve.

245
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,370
There's no need to be scared.

246
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,160
You're okay.

247
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,760
You need a stitch.

248
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,390
You've been bleeding because of cervical incompetence.

249
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,900
I brought the needle this time for the anesthesia.

250
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,450
It's just stitching your cervix to keep the fetus in place.

251
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,740
I'm closing it so it can support the growing uterus. It's simple.

252
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,540
It's simple?

253
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,330
Yeah, it won't take long.

254
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,960
Are you sure about that?

255
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,750
You said that when you stitched up my toes.

256
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,170
Liar.

257
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,840
You know that all doctors are liars.

258
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:39,890
Are you ready?

259
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,560
I'll start now, okay?

260
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:48,770
Let's get started.

261
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,490
I've been watching her overnight.

262
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,580
She no longer has any abdominal pain or anesthesia-induced headache.

263
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,710
Her BP is good, and the bleeding has stopped.

264
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,620
Everything looks good.

265
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,420
Good work.

266
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,380
-Is everyone at the station asleep? -Yeah.

267
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,260
You two should go get some rest.

268
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,310
You made sure to give Mr. Gong a clear warning, right?

269
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,560
Yeah.

270
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,260
Did you sleep okay?

271
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,560
Yes, Commander.

272
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:09,810
How are you feeling?

273
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,480
I'm not the commander anymore.

274
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,110
You'll always be my commander, all right?

275
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,780
Are you feeling okay?

276
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,190
Yeah, I feel much better.

277
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,610
I'm glad.

278
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,740
You and I

279
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,990
now have Byeol.

280
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,620
Byeol?

281
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,330
Yeah, that's our baby's name.

282
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,340
It means star. It was conceived here in space.

283
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,170
But you named Public and Indecency's baby Star.

284
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,640
You don't like the name?

285
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,850
I'm not sure.

286
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,640
Because they're fruit flies?

287
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,980
No.

288
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,060
Then what?

289
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,810
It's nothing.

290
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,530
Oh, when will I start to feel the baby move?

291
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,700
From around 20 weeks.

292
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,320
-Twenty weeks? -Yeah.

293
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,580
I thought about you here every day while reading the obstetrics book,

294
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,710
wondering how you knew I was going to need it.

295
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,380
The part you carved out to hide the liquor

296
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:25,680
happened to be about 14 to 15 weeks of pregnancy.

297
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,850
But by the 13th week,

298
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,640
a walking obstetrics book showed up

299
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,060
right in front of me.

300
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,610
Do you think

301
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,740
the day will come when I can have a drop of that liquor after giving birth?

302
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,080
It'll come, right?

303
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,540
Yeah, I'm sure it will.

304
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,180
You're not an astronaut.

305
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,760
You need to be clear about that.

306
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,390
You'll be going into space without proper training,

307
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,850
and because of zero gravity,

308
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,640
you may lose your ability to walk.

309
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:19,060
The longer you stay there, the more blood flow increases to your eyes,

310
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:22,110
causing your retina to thicken. That could lead to vision loss.

311
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,030
You cannot stay there for too long.

312
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,860
The longer you do,

313
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,780
the greater the risk for you.

314
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,660
Your job

315
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,620
is to come back with Eve straight away.

316
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,080
Don't forget that.

317
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:49,050
Seriously. I told them to leave this unplugged for a while.

318
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,310
It's so hot.

319
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,970
I need to adjust the thermostat again.

320
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,610
Eve.

321
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,150
Aren't you hot? Is it just me?

322
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,780
I'm not hot.

323
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,660
Well, I am.

324
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,460
Listen, Mr. Tourist.

325
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,790
You should head back down now.

326
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,340
It's dangerous for you to stay here.

327
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,710
I'm fine now.

328
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,340
You'll be my doctor from Earth, right?

329
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,430
Just come back for the delivery, okay?

330
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,310
Come with me.

331
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,660
I'm here to take you back.

332
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,990
We can have a baby next time.

333
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,290
Once the mouse pregnancy and birth are successful

334
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,750
and it's proven to be safe. We can do it then.

335
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,420
We didn't think this through.

336
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,550
I'm taking you back with me.

337
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,860
They're ready for our emergency landing.

338
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,820
Come with me.

339
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,410
I can't believe you're saying this.

340
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,870
You can't stay here.

341
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:40,910
You know why.

342
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,040
So you want to kill your own baby?

343
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,670
What if something goes wrong?

344
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,380
What if you need a C-section?

345
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,810
The moment I cut you open, your organs will spill and float around.

346
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:01,230
Because of surface tension, your blood will stick to the instruments.

347
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:04,150
It'll spread all over the room.

348
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,900
I can't perform surgery or a C-section here,

349
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,110
so there's nothing…

350
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,820
It's too dangerous for you.

351
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,990
Why do you keep assuming it's going to go wrong?

352
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,040
If there's even a 5% chance you'll die…

353
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:27,340
No, even if it's just 1%, I'm not putting you at risk.

354
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,840
If you're not going, I'm not going.

355
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,760
What?

356
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,760
I'm not leaving without you.

357
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,680
You can only stay here for seven to ten days at most.

358
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,640
How would you keep working as a doctor

359
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,770
if you can't walk anymore or go blind?

360
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,600
So come with me.

361
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,100
And let our baby die?

362
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,450
You're not letting it die.

363
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,330
I am.

364
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:01,910
Think of it that way.

365
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,000
That's the same thing. What are you saying?

366
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,550
A lot of people have natural births on Earth.

367
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,920
Can't you just trust me?

368
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,550
Come on, we can have another baby.

369
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,720
That baby won't be the same as this one!

370
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,510
This baby is going to die!

371
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,060
For God's sake!

372
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,350
Stop…

373
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,480
Stop saying it's going to die.

374
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:32,650
Look, I…

375
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,610
I want to protect our baby too.

376
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:38,780
But…

377
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,080
I have to protect you first. That's more important to me.

378
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,300
If you stay here any longer,

379
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,430
it'll be too dangerous to go back.

380
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,220
You need to come with me now.

381
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,520
You can keep an eye on me from Earth,

382
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,690
get your astronaut training,

383
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,400
and come back for the delivery. Why can't we just do that?

384
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,700
Am I…

385
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:27,620
Am I still just a tourist to you?

386
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:31,330
How do you expect me to just drop in for a week like a tourist

387
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,920
when my wife and baby are fighting to survive?

388
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,300
You're telling me to just come as your doctor to help with the delivery.

389
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,760
You're so damn stubborn, Commander.

390
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,520
I've never told anyone

391
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,560
that they should give up on their babies until now.

392
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,360
It's our baby, and I…

393
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,150
hate to do this too.

394
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,990
Fine.

395
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,580
You can stay.

396
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,620
I'll stay with you.

397
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,670
Whatever happens,

398
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,880
let's see this through.

399
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,130
I'll be here for my wife and baby every step of the way.

400
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,420
Are you out of your mind?

401
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,680
Both the baby and I will make it.

402
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,180
Why are you trying to ruin your life here?

403
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,520
Please just go back, okay?

404
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,770
No, listen to me. I…

405
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,610
You could die giving birth. You're asking me to watch you die.

406
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,820
Would you leave if you were me?

407
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,660
Please go back, okay?

408
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,920
I'm not going anywhere without you.

409
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,630
If you're worried about my life,

410
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,260
you'll come with me.

411
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,130
Chief.

412
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,960
Eve agreed to return.

413
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,920
Really?

414
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,670
The emergency landing site is off the coast

415
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,630
-of Pensacola, Florida, -Yes. Please relay the message quickly.

416
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,470
in the Gulf of Mexico.

417
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,890
Let me know as soon as the time of deorbit burn has been calculated.

418
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,640
DEORBIT BURN: SPACESHIP ENGINES FIRING

419
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,060
TO CHANGE ITS ORBIT FOR RE-ENTRY

420
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,110
Santi, you've got the parachutes, right?

421
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,910
Yes, ma'am.

422
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,490
How's your headache, Eve?

423
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,790
Your BP is a bit high.

424
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,910
Yeah, I'm fine.

425
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,290
What about you, Mr. Gong?

426
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,580
I'm good.

427
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,800
Is Ryong really coming back today?

428
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:30,680
Yeah, why would Yi-man lie to us?

429
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,560
Let's just clean the place quickly.

430
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,680
You do the bathroom. I'll do the kitchen.

431
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,100
Na-mi, open the windows.

432
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:38,770
Boy, where did he put the vacuum cleaner?

433
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,740
Keep an eye on Eve's vitals.

434
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,110
Yes, Chief.

435
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,740
All right. You'll be back on Earth in eight hours.

436
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,160
-Copy. -Copy.

437
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,240
Copy.

438
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:56,040
All right, then. We're ready for your departure.

439
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,000
Go.

440
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:05,300
Initiating undocking sequence.

441
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,090
Unlocking, disengaging first lock.

442
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:14,930
Undocking G.O-12,

443
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,180
T minus one minute.

444
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,940
Disengaging second lock.

445
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:28,450
Undocking completion, T minus 30 seconds.

446
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:46,510
Eve, is everything okay?

447
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:55,600
Is their oxygen supply stable? Their breathing seems uneven.

448
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,600
Their BP and pulse rates are all normal.

449
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,730
They're fine.

450
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:00,350
Okay.

451
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,350
G.O-12 has detached from the space station.

452
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,830
We'll fire the engines once you're 20 m away from the station.

453
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,160
What do we do?

454
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,750
Is it going to be okay?

455
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,250
It's okay, Eve.

456
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,380
Don't think about anything, okay?

457
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,480
Geez, how's he ever going to find anything in this mess?

458
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,740
FIRST KIM EVE

459
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,320
NATIONAL CENTER FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD

460
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,500
NATIONAL CENTER FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD

461
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,870
DEAR KIM EVE

462
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,920
First Kim Eve?

463
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,130
National Center for the Rights…

464
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,760
1988, CHRISTMAS EVE

465
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:22,430
You weren't abandoned at Chuncheon Station, were you?

466
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,690
It wasn't in a taxi, right?

467
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,900
It wasn't in a taxi heading to Chuncheon Station

468
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,190
on Christmas Eve, the year the Olympics were held, was it?

469
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,120
1988, CHRISTMAS EVE

470
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,540
No, it wasn't.

471
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,620
Eve's blood pressure keeps going up, Chief.

472
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,790
What?

473
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:45,980
Na-mi, what's wrong?

474
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,520
Why are you crying?

475
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:54,940
What kind of mother am I?

476
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,660
-Na-mi. -Why are you crying, dummy?

477
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,740
Hwa-ja, I'm a complete idiot.

478
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,370
-Na-mi! -What's the matter?

479
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:08,870
How could I not recognize her?

480
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,000
Na-mi.

481
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:14,460
I don't deserve to be a mom.

482
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,010
I'm sorry.

483
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,350
I'm sorry, my baby.

484
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:28,310
-Chief. -What the hell happened?

485
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:29,810
She's never been like this.

486
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,360
I'm sorry.

487
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,610
Eve.

488
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:39,990
I'm sorry, my baby.

489
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,700
Eve, look at me.

490
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:44,870
Her BP is too high.

491
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:47,830
She seems extremely anxious, and her pulse is too fast.

492
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:49,290
Her blood vessels could burst.

493
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,710
Eve, try to calm down.

494
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,090
Guys, there's something wrong with Eve.

495
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,680
Santi, take off her helmet.

496
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,390
Take her helmet off and check the pupils.

497
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,100
I'm on it. Hold on.

498
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,470
Eve, can you see me?

499
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,890
Eve! Look at me!

500
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,890
Look at me! Can you see me?

501
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,060
Her pupils are dilated!

502
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,570
Eve!

503
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,730
How many fingers am I holding up? Huh?

504
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,280
Eve! Can you see me? How many fingers am I holding up?

505
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,700
Three.

506
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,910
Three?

507
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:25,200
Double vision. It might be cerebral hemorrhage.

508
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,240
She'll die at this rate.

509
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:28,870
-We need to stop. -Guys, we need to go back!

510
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,000
We need to go back!

511
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,580
Eve.

512
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,380
Now!

513
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,920
Now!

514
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,630
Santi, steer back to the station right now.

515
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,920
-She needs medication. -Eve!

516
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,420
You're okay.

517
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,760
-Calm down. -You'll be okay.

518
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,760
Eve.

519
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,760
Take deep breaths.

520
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,650
3 MONTHS LATER

521
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,280
PASSENGER TERMINAL 2

522
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,260
Going somewhere?

523
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,300
It's none of your business.

524
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:29,850
I just got back to Seoul, so where are you going?

525
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,680
Mr. Go.

526
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:33,060
Wait for me.

527
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,230
Can I go to the restroom? Excuse me.

528
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,980
Hey!

529
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,870
Don't you have anything better to do? You have a job.

530
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,330
Is Ryong having a boy or a girl?

531
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:55,960
A boy or a girl?

532
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,040
How should I know?

533
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,670
We should try for a baby again, too.

534
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:08,180
Ryong will make it possible for you to have kids.

535
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,600
Are you crazy?

536
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:14,730
Just you wait.

537
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,190
He will make it possible for you to have kids.

538
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,360
Wow, he must be crazy.

539
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,910
Ms. Ji Hwa-ja, Jang Mi-hwa, and Jeong Na-mi?

540
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,410
-Yes! -Yes, we're here.

541
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:30,990
-Let's go. -Yeah.

542
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,960
What are you all doing here together?

543
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,130
Is something wrong?

544
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:42,250
I hear she'll need a lot of blood during delivery.

545
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:46,170
Send my blood up to the space station.

546
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,010
We're all type A.

547
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,550
-Send mine up there too. -Mine too.

548
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:54,060
No, you guys are anemic. I can't.

549
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,810
No, Yi-man.

550
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,020
We don't drink anymore, and we've quit smoking.

551
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,190
We have.

552
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:04,150
We want you to do it. We're scared.

553
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:07,280
Why are you scared? It's nothing to be scared of.

554
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,990
Well, it'd make Ryong happy, though.

555
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,700
But you can't do it, Na-mi.

556
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:15,410
Why not?

557
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,290
Because if your blood enters Eve's body,

558
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:22,420
there's a chance the immune cells in your blood could attack Eve's tissues.

559
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,710
The biological mother can't be a donor.

560
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,590
That's absurd.

561
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,260
Come on, how could that be?

562
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,930
I mean, why can't I…

563
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,480
Are you saying

564
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,360
I can't even do this one thing for my daughter?

565
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,230
-Don't cry. -Na-mi, don't do this again.

566
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,240
Hey, Ryong is going to come back soon

567
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,490
with his wife and baby, right?

568
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,530
You're really a mom now,

569
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,330
and we're all grandmas.

570
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:57,330
Once they're here, you can do anything.

571
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:58,620
Am I right?

572
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,250
Yeah, sure. Absolutely.

573
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:02,580
That's right. Let's just think

574
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:06,130
that they're on a really long honeymoon to space,

575
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,760
that they even made a baby there,

576
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:12,090
and they'll come back to us together, all three of them.

577
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,720
-Right? Isn't that true? -Yeah.

578
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,220
But still…

579
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:19,060
-Come on now. Stop crying. -Come on.

580
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,770
ONE WEEK BEFORE EVE'S DUE DATE

581
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,750
One, two, three, four,

582
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,670
five, six, seven, eight…

583
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,140
Good. A little more gently in sync with the breathing.

584
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,010
-Okay. -Santi, very good.

585
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,640
-Is the suction working well? -Yes.

586
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:03,400
Okay, good. Let's try this one more time.

587
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:04,940
All right.

588
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,950
The baby's blood pressure and heart are both good,

589
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:14,740
and there are no deformities from the radiation so far.

590
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:18,120
It's growing well with a very strong will to survive.

591
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,200
We're in the final stretch.

592
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:23,580
We've also upgraded the medical module system to ensure

593
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:26,210
complete protection from any space bacteria or viruses.

594
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:29,050
You won't need to worry about infections

595
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,880
with any type of patients up here now.

596
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,420
Good.

597
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:35,640
We've magnetized all surgical instruments with Mr. Gong as well,

598
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,930
so they won't be floating around anymore.

599
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:40,470
Okay. What about bleeding control?

600
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,730
Dr. Mina Lee will handle suction.

601
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,520
Okay.

602
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,400
Mr. Gong has figured out a steady surgical position.

603
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,150
Eve has been working out a lot as well, so her bone density looks good too.

604
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,700
The X-ray machine was a no-go, right?

605
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:58,280
No, I don't think we can send up either X-ray or MRI this time.

606
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:02,750
Surgical procedures could've been possible if we had a little more time.

607
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,210
Her BP, bone density, everything looks good.

608
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:08,630
She seems strong enough to handle a natural birth.

609
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,550
She just can't break any bones.

610
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,380
Don't let her push too hard.

611
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:21,430
All right! She's been doing great.

612
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,180
She's going to do great, right?

613
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,110
-What? -What's going on?

614
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:12,730
What's the problem?

615
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:13,860
Go check.

616
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,030
She still has a few more days to go!

617
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:31,040
Her BP is up by 10, cardiac output increased by 10%.

618
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,460
Santi, give her an IV and antibiotics.

619
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,420
Will do.

620
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:48,230
Eve, you can scream if it hurts. Don't hold back, okay?

621
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:58,950
Keep breathing.

622
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:08,790
You will

623
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:12,580
go back to Earth right after this, okay?

624
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,510
As soon as the baby is born,

625
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,130
you're leaving. Got it?

626
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,800
The contractions have started.

627
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,100
You never kept your word.

628
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,850
Once the baby is born,

629
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:29,560
you'll switch with another ob-gyn. Okay?

630
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:31,390
All right.

631
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:58,300
You're fully dilated.

632
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,340
When you feel the contraction, hold your breath

633
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,180
and push, okay?

634
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,300
Let's try it.

635
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:06,640
-One, two, three. -Two, three.

636
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,140
Push!

637
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,730
Good.

638
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:18,900
You're doing great.

639
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,190
Suction.

640
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,320
Again.

641
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,910
Keep your head up as you push. One, two, three.

642
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:26,160
Push!

643
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,960
-You left the humidifier on, right? -Yeah.

644
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:37,420
-Be careful with her head. -No, wait! Hold on.

645
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:41,550
Why is she coughing? What's wrong?

646
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:43,800
-She's coughing? -I think so. Hang on.

647
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,680
Oh, she peed.

648
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:53,140
Good girl.

649
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,610
Eve, you need to feed her.

650
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:02,650
Just go get the formula. I'll feed her.

651
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:03,860
Can't you get it?

652
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:05,530
Come on, get up.

653
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:09,990
I'll go get your bottle.

654
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,290
I know, just hold on.

655
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:22,340
Byeol, when do you think Mommy will be back?

656
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,340
-Come on, stand up. -Hold your legs up.

657
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,510
Come on. Hold onto that.

658
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:28,970
Oh, I'm going to let go, okay?

659
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:31,310
Is she standing up? I'm going to let go now.

660
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,390
Byeol!

661
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:53,700
With Daddy.

662
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:55,500
You want to come with Mommy to space?

663
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:45,880
Eve.

664
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:51,930
You're a mom now.

665
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:03,310
Great job, Eve.

666
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:11,660
Thank you all

667
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,950
for everything you've done for me.

668
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,120
You did great.

669
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,080
Get some rest.

670
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:29,510
Yes!

671
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:34,390
Oh, my God!

672
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,330
She's so tiny.

673
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:12,680
Look, guys.

674
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,470
Let's go get everything ready

675
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:17,810
and clean up the stuff.

676
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:19,020
Santi.

677
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:28,900
She's beautiful.

678
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,490
You should get some rest now, okay? The baby needs to rest too.

679
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:47,340
What is it? Is something wrong?

680
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:48,420
No.

681
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:51,670
It's nothing. I'm fine.

682
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:55,680
Are you sure?

683
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,890
Yeah, I'm fine.

684
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:15,280
Just don't break any bones.

685
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,990
If you break your pelvic bone, that'll be it.

686
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:37,930
You know…

687
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:41,680
I really want a drink.

688
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:44,930
What? Already?

689
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:46,850
I can't have one?

690
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,690
No, you should wait.

691
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:51,070
Come on, really?

692
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:56,110
Having a drink with you right now would make me so happy.

693
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:58,110
Please?

694
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:01,280
Please?

695
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:06,210
Hold on a second.

696
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,630
Your blood pressure is normal, and everything else looks good.

697
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,720
The contractions are progressing well, and…

698
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:21,140
There's no sign of postpartum bleeding.

699
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:32,190
Listen, when will the pain meds wear off?

700
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:34,610
Soon.

701
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,070
Why? Do you feel nauseous?

702
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,280
Hey, come here.

703
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:01,220
You're a dad now.

704
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,390
Yeah.

705
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:10,980
You said you could never deliver your own baby.

706
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,400
Congratulations.

707
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:23,240
Why do you look like that?

708
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,660
You look sad. Why?

709
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:30,620
No, I'm just overwhelmed.

710
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:32,380
All right.

711
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,590
I'll be right back, okay?

712
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:00,700
If your pelvis breaks,

713
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:02,950
it'll tear your blood vessels and cause bleeding.

714
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,780
They won't be able to operate.

715
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:06,870
It'll be the end.

716
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:09,910
So whatever you do, don't push too hard.

717
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,430
She's beautiful.

718
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,430
Just one drop, okay?

719
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:08,610
No, forget it.

720
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:12,620
-I changed my mind. -Hey, you can't take it away from me now.

721
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:14,370
What's the matter?

722
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:16,960
You should rest up and eat something first.

723
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,750
You can have it after that, okay?

724
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:21,590
After that, it's all yours.

725
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:27,590
Fine.

726
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:37,350
Hey.

727
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:40,190
I'm getting a little sleepy.

728
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:42,520
Sure, go ahead and sleep.

729
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:44,690
It'll be good for you.

730
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:47,900
But I don't want to sleep.

731
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:50,990
I don't want to waste any time.

732
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:52,740
You're not wasting time.

733
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:57,790
Sleep is like the best medicine for you right now. You need it.

734
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:09,970
But I don't want to.

735
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:30,450
Don't go anywhere, okay?

736
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:32,950
Okay.

737
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:36,700
You'll stay with me while I sleep, right?

738
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:38,120
Of course.

739
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:49,550
I miss you already.

740
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,340
Who? Me?

741
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:54,930
Or Byeol?

742
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,190
Both of you.

743
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:05,440
You can be with us all you want once you get some sleep.

744
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:18,490
Thank you.

745
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:23,620
I should thank you.

746
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,460
1 YEAR LATER

747
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:52,000
MZ FERTILITY CLINIC OPENING CEREMONY

748
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:54,170
PRESS CONFERENCE FOR THE NEW SPACE FERTILITY CLINIC

749
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,190
At the space station,

750
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:08,650
an ob-gyn clinic is opening.

751
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,690
A space fertility clinic that will tackle

752
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:15,610
infertility in zero gravity, which we couldn't do on Earth.

753
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:19,780
It's become a reality with MZ Group's support and my efforts.

754
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,990
And our beloved Byeol, the first to be born in space,

755
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:27,080
will be celebrating her first birthday

756
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,460
surrounded by all our love.

757
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:34,170
Her first birthday party will be held in the space station's biological module,

758
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,010
and I'm inviting all of you…

759
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:38,550
Actually, I'm inviting everyone on Earth to join us.

760
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:40,090
It's just that

761
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:42,390
you'll need to cover your own travel expenses.

762
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:43,640
No discounts.

763
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:49,560
When will Byeol be able to come down to Earth?

764
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:52,900
I think your question

765
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,360
will be better answered by those two,

766
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,700
since they'll be going to the space station soon.

767
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:01,070
Chief Kang,

768
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:02,990
I wanted to ask you too.

769
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,490
When will the two of them be here?

770
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:11,080
It's been a year and seven months since Mr. Gong Ryong left Earth.

771
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:13,960
It's the longest anyone has ever been in space.

772
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,170
While other astronauts have rotated in and out,

773
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:20,340
he has insisted on staying on the space station

774
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:22,720
as both a doctor and a father.

775
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,430
This is because Byeol has an underdeveloped heart

776
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:27,430
and low bone density and muscle mass,

777
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,480
since there's less strain on the heart and less muscle use in zero gravity.

778
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,400
His persistence

779
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,020
has brought us closer to the moment

780
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:37,400
when he and Byeol will finally step back on Earth.

781
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,030
Please support them until then.

782
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:42,620
Thank you, Chief Kang Tae-hui.

783
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:46,950
With the establishment of the space fertility clinic,

784
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,200
a new era has begun

785
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:51,670
where anyone who wants to have children can now do so.

786
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:55,750
Now, no one will ever be unable to have children

787
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,510
because of Earth's environment, their limitations,

788
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:00,670
health issues, or lack of money.

789
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:05,850
Mr. Gong will lead the way in space, while I will lead on Earth.

790
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:08,810
He with his expertise,

791
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,310
and I with my money.

792
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:14,940
Together, we'll work to protect the value of life.

793
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:18,570
How did you raise one trillion won in funds?

794
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:19,940
Right, it's all my own money.

795
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,740
I made 500 billion purely by luck,

796
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:26,490
then invested it in stocks and made another 500 billion.

797
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,370
CEO Choi Go-eun.

798
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,250
How about a clap?

799
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:52,180
I did something good. Give me some credit.

800
01:00:59,070 --> 01:00:59,980
I love you.

801
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:03,280
Marry me.

802
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:08,080
I want to have

803
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:10,200
kids with you too.

804
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:25,340
Let's have children, everyone on Earth!

805
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:28,300
Otherwise, our planet is doomed!

806
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:29,600
When is the wedding?

807
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,140
Did you just propose to her?

808
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,470
Please tell us.

809
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:44,450
What once seemed impossible,

810
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:46,530
mammalian pregnancy and childbirth…

811
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:49,530
The birth of Byeol has not only solved the infertility issues

812
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:51,540
but also opened up possibilities for humans…

813
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:55,080
Dr. Gong Ryong still remains on the space station

814
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,670
to ensure the lives that began in zero gravity

815
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:01,250
can live healthily on Earth, overcoming the challenges of gravity.

816
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:04,050
Abnormal sperm numbers 3, 5, and 9.

817
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:07,050
Their genetic defects can be fixed in zero gravity.

818
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:11,050
Now, other desperate people can have children as well.

819
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:13,770
Aren't you pushing yourself too hard?

820
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:15,560
Take it easy. You have a child.

821
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,150
When you have a kid, you'll see.

822
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:20,230
You never get tired.

823
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:49,840
Byeol.

824
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:58,600
Byeol.

825
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:02,940
Do you see that blue planet over there?

826
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:05,650
That's Mom and Dad's home.

827
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,200
Don't you want to go?

828
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:26,050
Mr. Gong, you have to go back now.

829
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:28,590
The damage to your organs, eyes, and muscles

830
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:30,630
has all become fatal.

831
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,800
Zero gravity is threatening your life now.

832
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,930
You're at your limit.

833
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:37,180
You need to come with us.

834
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:42,060
Until I figure out how to get Byeol on the spaceship,

835
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:43,810
I'm not leaving.

836
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:48,650
I'm going to find a way to take her with me.

837
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:08,710
Byeol!

838
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:11,050
You're here!

839
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:15,800
Did you sleep well? Say, Auntie.

840
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:16,850
Byeol.

841
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:19,770
-Who's that? -Say, Uncle.

842
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:21,390
No, you like me better, right?

843
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:23,020
Uncle.

844
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,190
-Can you say, Uncle? -You just burped, right?

845
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:28,150
Come on, people.

846
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:30,820
Her first word should be mommy,  not auntie or uncle.

847
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:31,900
Am I right, Byeol?

848
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:33,740
Can you say, Mommy?

849
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:36,410
-Gotcha! -Oh, that's a good girl.

850
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:37,910
I'm going to tickle you!

851
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,590
After Byeol was born,

852
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:57,930
Eve stayed with us for one more day before she passed.

853
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,520
Byeol, come to Uncle.

854
01:05:03,770 --> 01:05:05,810
Easy.

855
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:07,520
Oh, look at you.

856
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:14,150
Look at you.

857
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,780
Look at this, Byeol.

858
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:17,910
They're yellow.

859
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:19,790
They're beautiful, right?

860
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:21,540
Let's go see the rice.

861
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:24,920
That day, she kissed Byeol's feet

862
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,250
at least a hundred times.

863
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:29,880
That day, she apologized

864
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:33,130
to everyone at MCC over and over again.

865
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:36,340
That day, she joked about

866
01:05:37,930 --> 01:05:40,970
how I should die instead of her.

867
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:47,650
That one day with her

868
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:50,480
felt so long.

869
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,650
Eve did so much before she passed.

870
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:58,780
The space was both a womb

871
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:01,160
and a tomb for her.

872
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:40,620
Goodbye, Eve.

873
01:06:42,410 --> 01:06:43,410
I'll see you again.

874
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:10,650
Dear Byeol.

875
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:13,690
Once you come to this vast space

876
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,440
with no beginning or end, you'll see.

877
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:20,320
Zinnias, lettuce,

878
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:23,660
mayflies, even humans.

879
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:26,950
Everything is weightless here.

880
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:30,040
All living beings are equal.

881
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:35,170
So do not carelessly step on

882
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:36,760
an earthworm in the backyard,

883
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:40,180
or weed the lawn.

884
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:44,220
They are

885
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:48,770
miracles made by the spirits of the universe.

886
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:52,650
Every being is…

887
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:55,320
a miracle on its own.

888
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:06,800
