-Here comes the lightning.
-What?

203
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,030
Get ready, it's going to strike.

204

00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,640
Are you okay?

213
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,600
Spacecraft are built

220
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,920
The space tourist
must have been terrified.

221
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,720
Did you hear what I said? Chicken.

222
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,090
Chicken! Hilarious…

223
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,010
That's not funny.

224
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,600
It wasn't?

225
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,480

Okay.

244
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,660
That's okay.

245
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,330
I can do it.

You're going to be a billionaire.

250
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,100
Wouldn't it be a waste
to leave all that money behind?

251
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,100
Please, can we just drop
the billionaire thing?

252

-Eve.
-Yeah?

Couldn't they have secured everything

256
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,830
Is that a gun floating in front of me?

Go upstairs to the bathroom.

<i>I always thought of the universe</i>

298
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,920
<i>Instead of a place of birth,</i>

299
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,800
<i>maybe it's a place of death.</i>

<i>I've done my share of bad things,</i>

301
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,320
<i>so maybe it'd be better to say</i>
<i>I died from that lightning strike.</i>

302
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,580

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,730
Hey!

356
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:04,770
Damn it.

357
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,860
What did you pick up that rock for?

358
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,360
If you had a good time
with some beautiful ladies,

359
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,700
at least have a conscience.

360
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:22,410
And you have the money.

FIND THE CORRELATION
BETWEEN HIS DEBT AND GRADES

363
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,880
AS HIS GRADES GO UP,
HIS DEBT INCREASES EXPONENTIALLY

364
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,800
THEREFORE, GONG RYONG = BROKE DOCTOR

365

One, two, three, push!

00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,010
Push!

367
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,850
-Come on, push!
-Push!

368
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,100
It's coming out!

369
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,350
Push!

370
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,900
It's out!

371
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,070
<i>I took that money and got</i>
<i>a private education like everybody else.</i>

372
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,030
<i>A perfect CSAT score</i>
<i>got me into med school.</i>

373
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,280
<i>Every day, I looked at uteruses</i>

374
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,200
<i>and delivered babies.</i>

375
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,320
Good work, everyone.

376
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:05,290
Doctor! The baby isn't crying.

377
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,870
What?

378
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,830
Clean up here.

379
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,170
Call pediatrics. Check the Ambu bag.

380
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,140
Two, three.

381
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,430
I'm here!

382
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,850
Your mommy is right here!

383
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,310
Wake up!

384
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,480
If you give up,

385
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,030
I'll kill you myself.

386
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,640
Congratulations

387
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,980
on becoming a mother.

388
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,980
Hello.

389
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,830
Congratulations

390
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:28,410
on becoming a mother.

391
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,290
Are you okay?

392
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,460
What's going on?

393
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,420
Breathe.

394
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,880
Breathe.

395
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,960
You have to breathe.

396
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,610
Congratulations

397
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,730
on becoming a mother.

398
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,530
Thank you. Thank you so much.

399
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,830
<i>While I may not be God,</i>

400
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,340
<i>I felt a sense of joy and excitement</i>
<i>bringing new life into this world.</i>

401
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,630
The other way.

402
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:21,550
One.

403
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:27,300
-Help!
-Over here!

404
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,890
LET'S

405
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:31,850
GO

406
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,940
I AM A BIRTHING HERO

407
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,710
Congratulations

408
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,580
on becoming a mother.

409
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,080
-Congratulations.
-Congrats!

410
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,340
<i>Whether it was</i>
<i>a hundred times or a thousand times,</i>

411
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,590
<i>each birth made my heart race.</i>

412
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,720
<i>That's why</i>

413
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,020
<i>I became an ob-gyn.</i>

414
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,310
This video was just taken in our IVF lab.

415
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:59,730
It shows one
of our specialists performing an ICSI.

416
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:04,280
It shows Mr. Choi's sperm
being injected into Ms. Na's egg.

417
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,570
As you can see,
Mr. Choi's sperm is deformed

418
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:09,700
and has genetic defects.

419
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,870
Is there any way…

420
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,160
to fix it?

421
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:21,750
If you're successful,

422
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,300
I'll give you anything you want.

423
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,010
<i>Despite being the primary doctor</i>
<i>for the daughter-in-law</i>

424
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,980

<i>I was still broke.</i>

425
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:42,020
<i>But one day, as I was on my way to work</i>
<i>for the night shift…</i>

426
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,480
DON'T SKIP MEALS, DRINK THIS AT LEAST
YOUR MOMS

427
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,870
What the hell? Are they crazy?

2023 R CAR

431
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:12,550
Oh, my God. I can't believe this.

432
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,100
Excuse me.

433
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,310
Hello?

434
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,930
Excuse me?

435
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,230
I'm fine. As you can see, all good.

436
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,900
It's a little dark for sunglasses.

437
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,660
Blood…

438
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,870
What?

439
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:37,240
Your forehead is bleeding.

440
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,160
It's nothing.

441
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,580
I see blood every day. I'm fine.

442
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,000
I'm okay, but…

443
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,420
Can you come out here for a second?

444
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,840
So, you see,
this car was passed down to me.

445
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,510
I don't know what to do about this.

446
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,680
Wow, I…

447
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,560
Shit.

448
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:10,070
Wait. Stop, please.

449
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,820
SURGERY PREPARATION UNDERWAY

450
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,160
It appears to be an ectopic pregnancy.

451
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,660
You need emergency surgery.

452
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,740
The egg is implanted
in your right fallopian tube,

453
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:22,290
and the left fallopian tube
is already blocked.

454
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:23,830
We don't have much time,

455
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,540
so we'll start the anesthesia,
then move you to surgery.

456
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,380
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

457
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:37,390
After surgery, can you lend me
that scalpel over there?

458
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,970
I'm not going to let Kang Kang-su
keep his parts either.

459
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,770
You're…

460
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,150
You know me, right?

461
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,700
Yes. Nice to meet you, Ms. Choi.

462
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:58,070
Actually, I think
a pair of scissors would be better.

463
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:04,330
If you're tense,
the anesthesia won't take effect.

464
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:12,630
Your forehead is bleeding again.

465
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,100
I like children.

466
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,650
I didn't even know I was pregnant.

467
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,490
Don't worry and get some sleep.

468
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,200
There's no need to be nervous.
Trust me and go to sleep.

469
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,240
Are there…

470
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,750
any trustworthy men in this world?

471
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,010
Keep my surgery a secret.

472
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,260
I would never talk about a patient.
You included.

473
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:04,060
If you betray me, I'll kill you.

474
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,430
After the surgery,
I'll pretend I don't even know you.

475
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:12,440
Just do me the same courtesy
after you wake up from surgery.

476
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:16,820
Repeat after me.

477
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:20,280
"I'm going to

478
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:24,410
put my trust in you

479
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:27,660
and go to sleep."

480
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:38,970
Here you go, a scalpel
and a pair of scissors.

481
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,130
Are we good now?

482
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,430
Now, can you go to sleep? Please?

483
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,390
Go to sleep.

484
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:04,950
It's okay.

485
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,410
You can trust me.

486
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,580
Don't worry.

487
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,170
I'm your doctor.

488
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:28,220
<i>She even tried to fight the anesthesia.</i>

489
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:30,890
<i>She was amazing.</i>

490
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,270
<i>Maybe it was because,</i>
<i>after she fell asleep,</i>

491
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,110
<i>she would be consumed by guilt and regret</i>
<i>that her child was no longer in the world.</i>

492
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,320
<i>MZ Group.</i>

493
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,360
<i>That's how I first met the only daughter</i>

494
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,240
<i>of a chaebol family.</i>

495
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:48,490
-Thank you, Doctor.
-You're welcome.

496
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,290
Are you Dr. Gong?

497
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,710
And you are?

498
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,970
At least tell me what's going on
so I know what to do.

499
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:08,930
Hey! Are you guys crazy?

500
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,890
I'm just an innocent citizen.
How dare you…

501
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,900
Hello, doc.

502
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,110
Hello.

503
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:28,950
<i>Who gave you the right</i>
<i>to operate on my daughter?</i>

504
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:32,120
Do you even have the faintest idea

505
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:35,250
how valuable the genes you destroyed were?

506
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,380
<i>You ignorant doctor.</i>

507
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:42,880
I don't know
how valuable those genes were,

508
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:45,300
but it's wrong to lie to a woman
and do that to her.

509
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,930
<i>Now you're saying</i>
<i>even my daughter may not have kids,</i>

510
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:53,980
<i>after my son and daughter-in-law</i>
<i>failed to have children for years.</i>

511
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:57,770
<i>You're responsible</i>
<i>for ending our family bloodline.</i>

512
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,020
What? Me?

513
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,320
-Get out.
-Why?

514
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,950
Sir? Chairman Choi? Why?

515
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,200
Hang on a second!

516
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,070
Why?

517
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,160
Wait.

518
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:28,300

520
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:30,850
Yes, sir.

521
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:34,350
Hold up! Wait a second.

522
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,390
Sir,

523
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,440
as a doctor, I had no choice.

524
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,030
If I were faced with the same situation,

525
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,160
I would have to operate on your daughter.

526
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:53,740
You're fired.

527
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,040
What did you say?

528
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:59,920
<i>Fired?</i>

529
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,380
<i>No, I'm going to make sure</i>

530
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,420
<i>you never practice medicine again.</i>

531
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,720
<i>Don't worry, Chairman Choi.</i>

532
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,970
<i>I'll make sure he doesn't get the job.</i>

533
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,260
<i>If I hire you, Dr. Gong,</i>
<i>MZ Group said they would cut off funding</i>.

534
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:14,270
<i>What did you do to piss him off?</i>

535
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:16,600
<i>Hey, man, how have you been?</i>

536
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,810
I'll do all the dirty work,
the night shifts.

537
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:19,980
Please give me a job.

538
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,520
Oh, come on. Please.

539
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:22,980
Hello?

540
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:30,240
KIM HYE-SEONG OB-GYN CLINIC

541
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,680
Should a doctor be drinking this much?

542
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,520
What's it to you?

543
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,360
I'm sorry.

544
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,030
Aren't we supposed to pretend
not to know each other?

545
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,150
Stop coming here.

546
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,490
Let me compensate you.

547
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:10,150
Pretend you don't know me.

548
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,490
Is there anything I can do?

549
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:12,820
Don't do anything.

550
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:15,530
Do you know how hard it is
to just sit by and do nothing

551
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,330
knowing what you're going through?

552
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:22,210
It's hard for you?

553
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,290
You're having a hard time?

554
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,880
Ever since I got fired,

555
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,550
do you know how hellish
my life has been because of you?

556
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,220
After getting fired,

557
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,720
I thought of you and your face every day.

558
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,270
All I can think about

559
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:45,900
is how to get back at you and your father.

560
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,110
My thoughts are consumed with revenge!

561
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:53,570
Get lost.

562
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,760
How is this for revenge?

563
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:18,640
I like you.

564
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,230
Shit.

565
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,700
You know what?

566
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,490
I'm not interested in women.

567
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,830
I have more important things
to worry about.

568
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:46,210
I don't know what love is.

569
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:47,500
Just go.

570
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,950
Wake up.

571
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:23,750
Don't just lean on any random woman.

572
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:40,470
You're not just any random woman.

573
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:42,890
Exactly.

574
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:03,540
<i>Starting then, I guess I was asking</i>
<i>to get struck by lightning.</i>

575
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:31,650
<i>I was confused.</i>
<i>Was it revenge, love, or desire?</i>

576
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:33,730
I love you.

577
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:36,070
<i>"Is this love?"</i>

578
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:44,830
Let's get married.

579
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,250
<i>"Do I want to marry this girl?"</i>

580
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:50,120
<i>I wondered.</i>

581
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,460
<i>Go-eun was a good person.</i>
<i>She was too good for me.</i>

582
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,800
<i>She owned the world,</i>

583
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,180
<i>but she shared the pain in my heart.</i>

584
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,390
<i>Fine. Let's get married.</i>

585
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:10,230
<i>This is the kind of girl you marry.</i>

586
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,860
<i>It isn't important whether I love her.</i>

587
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:20,820
What was that? Lightning?

588
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:24,870
Holy crap.

589
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:27,700
-What was that?
-I'm scared.

590
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:28,870
DATING DR. GONG RYONG

591
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:30,710
FROM DOCTOR AND PATIENT TO LOVERS

592
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:45,010
Mr. Gong, I'm going to take you upstairs.

593
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,400
Mr. Gong?

594
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,820
Come on, pull yourself together.

595
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:04,700
Focus.

596
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,870
-Mr. Gong! Is he okay?
-Hey, are you okay?

597
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:07,870
Sir?

598
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:12,620
It's a choking sign!

599
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:13,960
Is his windpipe clogged?

600
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,500
Try to cough. Can you cough?

601
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:16,920
Try to breathe!

602
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:20,590
<i>If you want to live, you have to cough!</i>
<i>Try coughing!</i>

603
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:21,720
Do a medical check.

604
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,720
He's not hooked up to the medical cable.

605
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,010
-<i>Mr. Gong.</i>
-Eve, are you sure it's vomit?

606
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,510
-Cough.
-I'm coming up.

607
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,850
<i>-Santi!</i>
-What?

608
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:30,310
Check the monitor, now!

609
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,350
-What's that?
-What is it?

610
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:38,860
Are you okay? Try breathing.

611
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:41,400
Cough, or you'll die!

612
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:42,490
Eve!

613
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,630
Mr. Gong.

614
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,340
Hang on to me. Santi!

615
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:12,020
Mr. Gong!

616
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,390
Santi!

617
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:20,860
Holy shit!

618
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:24,450
Eve, are you okay?

619
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:26,110
What about Mr. Gong?

620
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:28,950
Eve!

621
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,090
Are you okay?

622
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,050
IOU, an unidentified object has crashed

623
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:48,720
into the machine module radiator
and solar panel.

624
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,970
Please check it!

625
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:51,510
<i>Roger.</i>

626
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,480
<i>Santi, hold your position.</i>

627
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,850
<i>We need to redirect.</i>
<i>Stand by for your new order.</i>

628
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,900
<i>Eve, are you okay?</i>

629
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,980
Yes, I'm fine.

630
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,150
-Hey.
<i>-Eve, attach the medical cable.</i>

631
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:06,490
There's no time for that.

632
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:07,910
Is he unconscious?

633
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:10,660
<i>Is he unconscious?</i>

634
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,870
It looks that way.

635
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:16,290
<i>If it's not a blackout</i>
<i>but a blocked airway,</i>

636
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:17,540
<i>brain damage will ensue</i>

637
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:19,920
<i>after four minutes</i>
<i>due to oxygen deprivation</i>.

638
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,960
<i>In seven minutes, he'll die.</i>

639
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:25,300
Doctor, I think we need
to take all his clothes off.

640
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:33,010
You have four minutes. No, less than four.

641
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,350
<i>G.O-10,</i>
<i>report the spacecraft status, over.</i>

642
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:38,770
Life support is normal,

643
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:41,060
and the engine thrusters are fine too.

644
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,520
<i>Without gravity,</i>
<i>the Heimlich won't be easy.</i>

645
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:45,820
<i>You need to find the right spot</i>
<i>and push upward quickly.</i>

646
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:46,740
Copy.

647
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,900
Slow pressure
won't create the force needed

648
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:49,950
to expel the matter.

649
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:51,280
Copy!

650
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:06,170
One, two, three!

651
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,970
<i>One, two, three!</i>

652
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:11,760
Come on. Hurry, Eve.

653
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:15,640
<i>-One, two, three!</i>
-Come on.

654
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:17,640
One, two, three.

655
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,270
Okay, come on, Eve.

656
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:21,560
One, two, three.

657
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:24,440
Two, three!

658
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:29,700
One, two, three!

659
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:31,910
One, two, three!

660
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:56,680
One, two, three!

661
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,020
Yes!

662
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,100
She did it!

663
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:24,750
Mr. Gong.

664
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:29,170
-Mr. Gong, are you okay?
-<i>Are you okay?</i>

665
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:31,970
Lean back and hold this.

666
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:34,470
You okay?

667
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:38,310
Can you breathe okay?

668
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:42,640
How many fingers?

669
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,690
Can you see
how many fingers I'm holding up?

670
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:52,780
Can you see them?

671
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:04,830
What's your name?

672
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:10,750
What's my name?

673
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,560
Don't worry, you're fine now.

674
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:25,390
You trust me, don't you?

675
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:27,850
I'm your commander.

676
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:30,250
I contacted IOU Mission Control.

677
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:33,340
They said spacecraft sometimes
get struck by lightning.

678
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:34,760
But that doesn't mean

679
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:38,380
the astronauts inside are in danger.

680
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:42,760
Fine.

681
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:45,470
Ms. Choi.

682
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:50,020
You have a call from the space station.

683
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:51,400
Have they arrived already?

684
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:54,320
No. It hasn't even been
an hour since they launched.

685
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,900
It's Mr. Kang Kang-su.

686
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:58,700
Should I ignore it?

687
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,340
-Done.
-Yeah, okay.

688
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:29,390
Mr. Gong, your blood pressure
and pulse are both normal.

689
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,190
And your breathing is stabilizing.

690
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:36,650
You must wear the medical belt
until you arrive at the space station.

691
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,570
Thank you, Doctor.

692
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:41,700
<i>Don't thank me. Thank the commander.</i>

693
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:48,750
Is he allowed to drink water now?

694
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:50,500
Of course.

695
00:51:58,170 --> 00:51:59,630
Aren't you thirsty?

696
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,510
Are you angry, Commander?

697
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:06,470
Are you mad at me for throwing up?

698
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,180
Why would I be?
You spent 70 billion won on this flight.

699
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:10,270
You are mad.

700
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:14,190
I have to go back down.

701
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:23,820
Your feet…

702
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:48,180
Is it past twelve in Seoul now?

703
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:50,600
Or is it before?

704
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,480
<i>How can you act so normal?</i>

705
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,810
Didn't we break up as enemies?

706
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:57,150
I just spoke to your father,
so I figured I'd call.

707
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,070
He still likes me.

708
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:03,570
You two can be friends,
but leave me out of it.

709
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,280
If the new guy is no better than me,

710
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,450
I'm not letting you go.

711
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:11,580
<i>Hilarious, right?</i>

712
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:13,620
<i>Go ahead. Laugh.</i>

713
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:14,660
Hey!

714
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:22,960
Why the hell is my dad
still talking to Kang-su?

715
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:24,590
Can't we call up IOU

716
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:27,760
and get them to delete
our numbers from his phone?

717
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,390
Aren't we only allowed calls
from our contact list?

718
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:34,310
The thing is,
your father gave him permission.

719
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:36,770
Then just don't answer his calls.

720
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:39,230
What a stupid thing to say.

721
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:14,350
Do you miss Earth already?

722
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,190
After we left Earth,

723
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,650
I saw a dead body.

724
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,570
There was no safety tether.

725
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:28,450
It was a dead astronaut in a space suit

726
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,160
<i>just floating…</i>

727
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,280
What you saw out there wasn't a dead body.

728
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:34,620
It was a SuitSat.

729
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,790
SUIT SATELLITE
SATELLITE MADE FROM A SPACE SUIT

730
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:40,630
That was a satellite?

731
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:43,710
This is it.

732
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:47,050
That looks like it's
from the SuitSat we've been tracking.

733
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:50,590
Look, that's a fist, and that's an arm.

734
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,680
Put it on the screen.

735
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:59,520
Yeah, that fist and arm
are from a SuitSat.

736
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:01,440
-What?
-Yes.

737
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,480
How did that thing get detached?

738
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:06,110
<i>A space suit costs 14 billion won.</i>

739
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:09,200
Space suits that have been discarded
at the space station

740
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,910
are recycled into satellites.

741
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:16,450
<i>And you mistook that</i>
<i>for an astronaut who died on a spacewalk.</i>

742
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:18,870
<i>MCC has been tracking its orbit.</i>

743
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,000
<i>It's not a big deal,</i>
<i>so there was no need to tell you guys.</i>

744
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,130
SuitSats are equipped
with communication devices and sensors,

745
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:26,920
which send valuable data to Earth.

746
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:31,680
<i>A tiny,</i>

747
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,140
invisible piece of cosmic debris
probably hit the arm.

748
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:38,680
It broke off and flew
into the spacecraft's orbit,

749
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:40,640
causing a collision.

750
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:44,150
A single arm is tiny,
so we weren't able to detect it.

751
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:46,190
That's the one.

752
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:49,610
Chief, that's the one.
That was the space suit I wore last.

753
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:53,490
I wore that to fix the truss
outside the space station.

754
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:56,450
Then I rewired the cables
and attached them to the new equipment,

755
00:55:56,530 --> 00:55:59,080
and replaced the broken power regulator.

756
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:03,420
During that, my helmet started leaking
and filled up with water.

757
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,130
I thought, "This is the end,
and I never got to marry."

758
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:09,460
I remember rushing back into the airlock.

759
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:12,680
I did all that wearing that suit.

760
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:16,850
You no longer work here,
so what are you doing here?

761
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:20,730
I'm on the clock until tomorrow.

762
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:24,980
Did you really get scouted
for a lot of money?

763
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:28,480
I should be here.
It's Eve's first command.

764
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:29,530
Is that all?

765
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:31,740
-What?
-I'm sorry?

766
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:38,910
The launch is tomorrow.

767
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,960
How am I supposed to wait a year?

768
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:44,870
A year is too long, Eve.

769
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,550
It'll fly by.

770
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:58,140
We just got together.
It's going to make me crazy.

771
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:02,020
Can't you take the position next time?

772
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:14,700
Yes.

773
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,450
That's a relief.

774
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:20,450
What are you implying?

775
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:24,830
Eve deserves to date a great guy.

776
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:27,580
I totally agree.

777
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:31,750
Go up and get some rest.

778
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,420
You're going to wear yourself out
before you get there.

779
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:36,180
Yeah, go up and get some sleep.

780
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,510
<i>The solar panels are damaged.</i>

781
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,140
Do you think it will affect
docking with the station?

782
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:43,730
We adjusted the altered orbit with Santi,

783
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:46,980
and we're inspecting
the machine module for issues.

784
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:48,020
So, we'll have to wait.

785
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:50,060
Were you scared?

786
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:52,070
No.

787
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:54,530
Quite the dramatic start as commander.

788
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:57,160
Can I help with anything?

789
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,780
No, it's okay. I'm good.

790
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:03,750
<i>Go upstairs. That's an order.</i>

791
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:06,920
Go upstairs.

792
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,380
Copy.

793
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:16,510
Don't worry. I'll hold down the fort.

794
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:41,660
Hi.

795
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:55,760
Let's take your temperature.

796
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:06,600
Let me know if you feel sick, though
there's probably nothing left to throw up.

797
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,320
I'm hot.

798
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:23,370
36.5 degrees. Perfectly normal.

799
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:26,540
But I feel like I have a fever.

800
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:42,300
Don't touch the window
with your hands or face.

801
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:44,050
You could get burned.

802
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:46,970
The sun's a lot stronger up here.

803
00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:56,150
Oh, can I take this off too?

804
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:59,570
I'll turn it off.
Try to get some shut-eye, both of you.

805
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:02,030
Okay.

806
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:06,870
NO SIGNAL

807
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:09,790
Your foot is bleeding again.

808
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:11,870
You also hurt your foot? Let me see.

809
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,460
It looks fine.

810
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:15,460
No, your foot.

811
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:29,970
Stop moving around and rest.

812
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:42,530
Three…

813
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:48,530
Just a sec…

814
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:02,130
Okay, nice.

815
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:11,430
-I got it.
-Hold on.

816
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:15,850
The cut is more than a centimeter deep.

817
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:17,810
A Band-Aid won't stop
the bleeding for long.

818
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:20,610
We're completely helpless
without the rails in zero gravity.

819
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:23,400
It's serious.
Just putting pressure on it won't cut it.

820
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:25,990
You need surgery.
It'll bleed whenever you use the rails.

821
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,410
Who's going to operate? You?

822
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:30,160
-Yes, Commander.
-Here?

823
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,080
-I'm a doctor.
-You <i>were</i> a doctor.

824
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:39,500
Good thing I brought
my operating tools and some sutures.

825
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:54,390
How can you possibly steady yourself

826
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,440
and properly
thread a needle in zero gravity?

827
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:01,690
I've threaded a billion surgical needles.

828
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:03,740
You're not going to sew it all crooked,

829
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:05,740
or sew my big toe
to my index toe, are you?

830
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:08,490
Like I said, it'll keep bleeding
when you use the rails.

831
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:11,370
If you keep this up,
you might end up losing both big toes.

832
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:14,370
Without them, you won't be able to walk
when we get back to Earth.

833
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:19,380
I'm being serious.

834
01:02:23,630 --> 01:02:24,510
I know.

835
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,720
I wasn't waiting for you to answer.

836
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:30,680
If I sew it all crooked

837
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:32,810
and stitch your toes together,

838
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:36,890
I will piggyback you around
for the rest of my life.

839
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:39,940
-Don't be ridiculous.
-Exactly.

840
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:42,190
That will never happen.

841
01:02:45,490 --> 01:02:48,200
Before coming here,
I completed all the required training.

842
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:50,870
This isn't even surgery.

843
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:52,830
This gash

844
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:55,370
just needs some anesthesia and stitches.

845
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:02,130
Okay, here I go threading the needle
for the billion and first time.

846
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,020
Damn it.

847
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:28,150
The blood must have rushed to my head.
My hands are swollen.

848
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:41,120
I've got all day.

849
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:47,000
Here, it's a new day
every 90 minutes, right?

850
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:49,550
Within the 90 minutes
it will take to orbit the Earth,

851
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:51,840
I promise to get it done.

852
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:53,970
Hang on.

853
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:15,620
If I knew how to sew,
I'd stitch your mouth shut.

854
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:16,780
Those are scary words--

855
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:19,370
You throw up,
you're all talk, and you're full of crap.

856
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:22,370
You said it was normal
for first-timers in zero gravity.

857
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:25,210
Didn't you also feel sick your first time?
Yes or no?

858
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:27,550
Did you or didn't you puke?

859
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:31,170
Okay. You have nine minutes.

860
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:33,800
It won't take nine minutes.
Ninety seconds will suffice.

861
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:36,220
Once I numb the area,
stitching is a piece of cake.

862
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:44,900
Why isn't there a syringe?

863
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:47,980
It must have fallen out earlier.

864
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:53,360
You know, in the collision earlier.

865
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:56,620
Just do it.

866
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:59,200
No way. Do you know
how painful stitching without--

867
01:04:59,290 --> 01:05:00,290
Hurry up and do it--

868
01:05:00,370 --> 01:05:03,120
No! I can find the syringe, okay?

869
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:06,710
I know I brought it.
It can't have disappeared.

870
01:05:06,790 --> 01:05:08,420
It's in here for sure.

871
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:12,050
Things lost in here
don't drop to the floor,

872
01:05:12,130 --> 01:05:13,720
so they're hard to find.

873
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,090
It's nothing. I can handle it.

874
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:18,600
It's only a few stitches.
Let's just get it done.

875
01:05:19,930 --> 01:05:22,310
Then, do you want to give it a shot?

876
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:24,810
I'll be quick.

877
01:05:24,890 --> 01:05:26,310
Okay, let's do it.

878
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,520
Okay.

879
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:28,810
Okay…

880
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,700
Here we go.

881
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:40,790
Here goes.

882
01:05:41,990 --> 01:05:43,450
Go ahead.

883
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,050
But it's going to hurt.

884
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:59,050
After I finished my last mission
and was returning to Earth,

885
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:01,100
I fell into
a remote area of Southeast Asia.

886
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:05,350
I crashed into a thorny bush
in the jungle at full speed,

887
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:07,690
and I didn't even flinch.

888
01:06:07,770 --> 01:06:11,440
There must have been
tens of thousands of thorns in that bush.

889
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:13,940
So don't worry, all right?

890
01:06:14,030 --> 01:06:14,990
Okay.

891
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:17,030
Here goes.

892
01:06:22,450 --> 01:06:23,740
Turn your head.

893
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:25,160
This doesn't scare me.

894
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:27,370
Come on, don't look!

895
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:28,670
Just leave that to me.

896
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:30,330
Thorns just prick you.

897
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:34,010
It's not the same
as sewing flesh with a needle and thread.

898
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:35,670
-Shall I do it?
-No.

899
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,430
-I'll do it.
-No, I'll do it.

900
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:46,730
Okay…

901
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,440
Do it?

902
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:14,300
I'm almost done. Just a bit more.

903
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,800
What happened to his toe?

904
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,680
How did he manage
to get a hole only where his big toe is?

905
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,430
Tell me when Ryong is on.

906
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:26,850
Okay.

907
01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:32,480
<i>As planned, they will attempt</i>
<i>to dock on the morning of the 6th.</i>

908
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:36,070
<i>The process will take about three hours</i>
<i>from start to finish,</i>

909
01:07:36,150 --> 01:07:39,360
<i>after which, the hatch will open</i>
<i>and they will board the space station.</i>

910
01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:43,410
<i>If docking is successful,</i>
<i>Mr. Gong will move to the space station</i>

911
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:45,740
<i>and spend the next eight days</i>
<i>on various tasks.</i>

912
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:49,370
<i>Sometime tomorrow morning, Korea time,</i>

913
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:52,170
<i>Mr. Gong is scheduled</i>
<i>to contact IOU Mission Control.</i>

914
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:07,520
I love you.

915
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:15,560
Go-eun, I'm going to spend my life
being devoted to you.

916
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:18,940
We're going to live a fantastic life.

917
01:08:19,030 --> 01:08:22,530
I promise to be faithful to you.
I'm never going to betray you.

918
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,950
Why can't you just say it back?

919
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,910
"Why can't you just say it back?"

920
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:33,750
I love you.

921
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:34,960
<i>I love you.</i>

922
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:36,960
Hello, Ms. Choi.

923
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:48,310
All done. You're doing well.

924
01:08:49,770 --> 01:08:51,390
Didn't you say you were done?

925
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,730
You're doing great.
I really am almost done.

926
01:08:54,940 --> 01:08:56,110
Just about done now.

927
01:08:56,190 --> 01:08:57,360
Hey, don't move.

928
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,360
-Almost there.
-I can't take it anymore.

929
01:09:02,530 --> 01:09:04,160
-That's enough.
-No, wait.

930
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,570
-I swear, I'm almost done.
-You can stop now.

931
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:07,620
-A bit more.
-No.

932
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:09,990
-Aren't you finished?
-Last one…

933
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,330
Hey, you said you were done.

934
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:13,500
I want to make sure there's no scarring.

935
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:15,540
-Okay.
-It looks done.

936
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:17,420
Doesn't it, Dr. Gong?

937
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:25,130
I swear, just one more stitch.

938
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:27,680
Really…

939
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:29,720
Done.

940
01:09:29,810 --> 01:09:31,060
Finished!

941
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:43,400
Good job.

942
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:12,720
Thank you.

943
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:15,270
Sure.

944
01:10:16,810 --> 01:10:19,100
Get some rest. I'm going to head down.

945
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:25,110
Commander.

946
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,200
your

947
01:10:30,450 --> 01:10:31,450
big toes…

948
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:34,370
are amazing.

949
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:07,190
Your big toes…

950
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,370
are beautiful,

951
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:15,790
Commander.

952
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,400
SPECIAL THANKS
TO CHO JUNG-SEOK, PARK JIN-JOO

953
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:02,710
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

954
01:12:03,630 --> 01:12:05,090
<i>Finally, the space station.</i>

955
01:12:05,170 --> 01:12:07,710
Why is our Ryong
the only one flailing like that?

956
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,170
What is this?

957
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:11,470
Hello.

958
01:12:11,550 --> 01:12:13,470
<i>They say he's just after her money.</i>

959
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:16,560
He's pretending to be in love with her
and even came to space for it.

960
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,810
If I succeed…

961
01:12:18,890 --> 01:12:20,730
<i>I told you, I'll do anything.</i>

962
01:12:20,810 --> 01:12:21,640
Hey.

963
01:12:22,230 --> 01:12:23,350
Give it up.

964
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,770
<i>Go-eun is mine.</i>

965
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:27,190
<i>I'm looking for it.</i>
<i>Don't worry, I'll find it.</i>

966
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:28,320
<i>His heart rate is dropping.</i>

967
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:29,610
<i>What are you doing?</i>

968
01:12:29,690 --> 01:12:30,860
<i>Did you get caught?</i>

969
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:33,410
<i>Don't move. You're acting suspicious.</i>

970
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:40,160

971
01:12:48,050 --> 01:12:48,960
Hi.

972
01:13:17,450 --> 01:13:19,620
"PLEASE FAST BEFORE DEPARTURE"

973
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:21,870
AS GONG RYONG BIT THE APPLE,
HE RECALLED EVE'S WORDS

974
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:23,870
"WHATEVER, I DON'T EVEN LISTEN
TO MY MOTHERS"

975
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:25,960
THE APPLE WAS HEAVY LIKE EVE'S WARNING

976
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,960
GONG RYONG ROLLED DOWN
THE CAR WINDOW

977
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:36,220
"WHAT COULD GO WRONG?"

978
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:41,060
A SLICE OF APPLE, EVE'S WARNING…

979
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:44,600
GONG RYONG SWALLOWED THE APPLE,
THE WARNING, AND HIS DOUBTS

980
01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:46,690
AS HE HEADED FOR THE LAUNCHPAD
