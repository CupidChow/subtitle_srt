1
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,960
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

2
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,720
I can't believe this.

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,640
YOUR ROYAL CHOICE, COME ALONG WITH ROYAL BANK

4
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,610
It wasn't ours to begin with.

5
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,110
We will be punished for our greed.

6
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,320
Now what?

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,200
Stop it. This is not the time to be blubbering.

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,580
Come on. He's the one who lost it, and we found it for him.

9
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,340
So he should give us a cut.

10
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,170
Are we just going to sit here and let him take it from us?

11
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,180
Let's go ask Dr. Kang for a cut.

12
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,720
It was partly his fault for losing it.

13
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,180
All we did was find it for him.

14
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,310
What are you doing? Go negotiate with Dr. Kang right now!

15
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,690
-What? -What?

16
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,650
Wasn't it you who squandered it, Dr. Lee?

17
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,030
After taxes,

18
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,950
the four of us could've gotten 83.75 billion won each.

19
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,740
But you blew it all for us, didn't you, Dr. Lee?

20
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,700
If you screwed up,

21
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,790
you should take responsibility and get some of it back, don't you think?

22
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,600
I heard he's staying at this hotel.

23
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,740
Forget it. I'll go by myself.

24
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,410
Don't get involved. Whether I have to kneel or beg

25
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,420
or let him throw me out the window, I'll handle it alone.

26
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,580
Dr. Lee,

27
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,960
go home.

28
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,010
I don't want to be with my sister.

29
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,800
I'm so angry at myself,

30
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,720
I can only imagine how angry everyone else is.

31
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,980
I'm sorry my sister was so harsh.

32
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,900
My head is still ringing from being hit.

33
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,490
Is there a welt?

34
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,970
You came in on your own.

35
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
There's no leaving now.

36
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,600
Okay.

37
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,240
Ryong.

38
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,990
I brought Ggong. Open the door.

39
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,000
Ryong.

40
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,300
Hang on.

41
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:54,460
We're working on a rep...

42
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,000
Let's work on it separately.

43
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,630
When you're done, send it to me first.

44
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,090
I…

45
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,430
have something I want to say to you.

46
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,510
Can you hold your liquor?

47
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,730
Say it to me. Why...

48
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,150
Fine. Where should we go?

49
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,300
I'm sorry.

50
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,100
Just go, Commander.

51
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,150
Let's go home.

52
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,150
Okay.

53
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,990
No.

54
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,490
Don't leave.

55
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,540
Okay.

56
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,840
-Can you hold your liquor? -I like to drink.

57
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,670
-But can you hold it? -I like it.

58
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,010
Then, let's make a bet.

59
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,260
So what, the person who drinks the most gets Ryong?

60
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,340
How did you know?

61
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,620
Slow down.

62
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,580
How mortifying.

63
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,840
Is the bet on?

64
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,180
I'm not joining in.

65
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,350
You're so fucking annoying.

66
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,310
Did you just swear?

67
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:32,570
There's a lot worse where that came from,

68
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,410
but I'm not drunk enough to say it yet.

69
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,160
You should go and swear at Ryong.

70
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,290
He's the one who had a change of heart.

71
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,800
Weren't you the one who turned Ryong

72
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,970
into a traitor?

73
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,310
Drink.

74
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,820
You can really drink.

75
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,790
Pour me another one.

76
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,290
-Why? -You've had four drinks.

77
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,540
I have?

78
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,890
Now we're even.

79
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Excuse me.

80
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,650
Can I have another bottle?

81
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,080
I was hoping to have a sober conversation.

82
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,120
So much for that.

83
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,050
Thank you

84
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,390
for saving my Ryong.

85
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,140
I wanted to thank you in person.

86
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,400
This all happened because I like Ryong.

87
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,150
I'm sorry.

88
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,740
I tried really hard not to like him,

89
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,320
but I couldn't help it.

90
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,990
I'm really sorry.

91
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,630
All of the shiny things below this hotel

92
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,340
are things Ryong wants from me.

93
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,260
That's why he likes me.

94
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,260
In order to get me,

95
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,430
Ryong risked his life and went to space.

96
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,230
He won't give up the space fertility clinic

97
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,690
my dad promised him.

98
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,570
Ryong is actually quite materialistic.

99
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,240
A hardworking astronaut doesn't suit him.

100
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,830
You're just a novelty, something new,

101
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,200
but he'll get bored soon.

102
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,040
He'll get bored soon?

103
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,000
Do I look like a boring woman to you?

104
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,960
You saw Ryong as someone who paid 70 billion won to go to space,

105
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:39,130
the future son-in-law of the chairman of MZ Group.

106
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,970
But I saw Ryong when he was driving a lemon,

107
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,270
when he was a doctor living in poverty.

108
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,940
I saw Ryong when he was desperately trying to get to the top.

109
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,440
You don't understand the compassion…

110
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,660
I feel for that man.

111
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,870
I couldn't care less about that.

112
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,700
Do I look like a boring woman to you?

113
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,000
This won't do.

114
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,760
If I drink every drop of alcohol in this place,

115
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,100
will you give me Ryong?

116
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,390
I have a feeling I'm going to be drinking all of it.

117
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,280
GONG RYONG

118
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,410
RYONG

119
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,210
Why aren't they answering? It's driving me nuts.

120
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,510
Open the door.

121
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,090
You're mine.

122
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
Ryong.

123
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,020
Are you okay? You stink of booze.

124
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,730
Eve, are you okay?

125
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:20,780
Did you really have so much to say that you had to call both of us?

126
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,990
It must be nice to have so many women to call.

127
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,150
Come on.

128
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,950
Come on, sober up. Are you okay?

129
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,410
Don't touch me.

130
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:31,660
You have no right to say anything.

131
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,790
-Are you okay? -Give me a minute.

132
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,670
Eve, are you okay?

133
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,960
Hey, why are you lying there?

134
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,510
-I need to lie down too. -What?

135
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,510
Don't lie there.

136
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,060
If you have something to say, say it in front of us.

137
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,610
That's why we came back together. Say what you have to say.

138
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,980
That's right. Say it.

139
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,320
Are you going to sleep here?

140
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,450
-Yes. -Then I'm going to sleep here too.

141
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,870
I'll take you home. Let's go.

142
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,620
-Who? -Me?

143
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,370
Should the three of us sleep here then?

144
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,830
-You leave then. -Yeah.

145
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,420
You can leave.

146
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,590
This is too stressful.

147
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,970
I'm cold.

148
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,350
No.

149
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,850
I'm cold.

150
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,070
Sleep.

151
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,320
This is nice.

152
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,820
It's so warm.

153
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,070
This is nice.

154
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,830
So nice.

155
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,010
Where is this girl? Why isn't she answering the phone?

156
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,680
DONA

157
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,170
Is it the winning number for the 2, 456th lottery?

158
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,830
It is. May I ask what took you so long?

159
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,460
Can I claim the prize now?

160
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,010
Yes, of course. I mean it's a king's ransom.

161
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,220
We were wondering where the winner was.

162
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,060
The doors are closing.

163
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,350
Okay, thank you.

164
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,260
We…

165
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,430
We went to the buffet. It's not what you think.

166
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:38,310
I don't care if you just slept or copulated.

167
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,930
Are you going to stand here all day?

168
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,230
I didn't say you could sit.

169
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,540
We're sorry, Dr. Kang.

170
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,170
I'm probably coming across as a real jerk right now.

171
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,460
Why are you kneeling?

172
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,090
Dr. Kang.

173
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,920
You know what a scaredy-cat I am.

174
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,720
The minute I picked up the lottery ticket, I was going to find out whose it was,

175
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,430
and I swear, I was going to return it to them.

176
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,850
Whose idea was it?

177
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,310
Who told you to steal my money?

178
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,530
He's so hopeless.

179
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,070
I was going to give it back. I promise.

180
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,240
Why would you give it back?

181
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,330
If you give it back to Dr. Kang,

182
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:44,120
it'll be like pouring a bottle of water into the Han River.

183
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,500
You're crazy. If you give it back to him, you're an idiot.

184
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,130
Like I said, who was it?

185
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,510
-Was it you, Dr. Lee? -Me?

186
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,640
It wasn't me.

187
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,430
Was it Santi who made you thieves?

188
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,560
No.

189
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,770
Was Ryong the ringleader?

190
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,530
No, no.

191
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,530
Mr. Gong did nothing wrong.

192
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,200
I swear on my honor as an astronaut,

193
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,950
the three of us wanted to return it.

194
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:23,040
The three of us discussed it, and while you were sleeping,

195
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,620
we put it right in front of your face so you couldn't miss it, and then we left.

196
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,080
That's all.

197
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,960
That's the most important thing, Dr. Kang.

198
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,260
But incredibly, in the middle of that chaos,

199
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,090
Ryong was lucky enough to find it, and when he came back,

200
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,390
he gave it to us.

201
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,260
As soon as I held it, I thought, Is this fate?

202
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,730
Why is it back in my possession?  Of course, I was tempted.

203
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,770
I was, but I said, Let's give it back.

204
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,770
We have to give it back.

205
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,110
It was nearly a year old.

206
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:58,150
We thought we might be overreacting over a worthless piece of paper.

207
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,370
The plan was to call Houston to check if the ticket was still valid,

208
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,580
and then return it.

209
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,290
That's what the phone call in the bathroom was about.

210
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,420
That's the truth.

211
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,000
So from the beginning,

212
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,840
it was Ryong who said, Give it back? Are you an idiot?

213
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,970
And the bastard who picked it up at the ILS

214
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:25,600
and gave it to you three and not me, knowing full well whose it was, was Ryong.

215
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,690
That guy is turning taking my things into a hobby.

216
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,410
He already has Ms. Choi.

217
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,750
Why the hell would he have a crush on someone?

218
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,130
Shouldn't we go get her and teach her a lesson?

219
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,420
Should we torment her?

220
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,630
So the commander or captain or whatever leaves?

221
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,010
Take that!

222
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,550
Hey, turn it off.

223
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,930
Let's not dance around the issue and just bring them here

224
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,720
so we can get to the bottom of it.

225
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,930
How are we supposed to know if it's one-sided or if she seduced him?

226
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,020
You're right.

227
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,060
When I was there that day,

228
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,770
they were both in a sleeping bag

229
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,280
without any underwear on.

230
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,570
Underwear…

231
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,780
-Both without any underwear on? -What?

232
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,780
Really?

233
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,120
-Why are you telling us that now? -Why are you telling us that now?

234
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,120
Damn it.

235
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,380
What is it?

236
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,470
She saved your life. We want to show our gratitude.

237
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,470
Bring that girl by so we can feed her a home-cooked meal.

238
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,890
I know what you all are up to.

239
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,970
What are we up to?

240
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,230
I'm busy. I came to get my homework reviewed.

241
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,350
Listen, you brat.

242
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,610
If you knew us so well and how we feel, you wouldn't have said that crap

243
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,190
after drinking yesterday!

244
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,650
Come on, I…

245
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,240
I'm feeling conflicted as it is. I don't need your nagging.

246
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,110
I'm sure the same goes for the commander.

247
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,160
Things are already complicated enough, so stay out of it.

248
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,120
Listen! We're going to make her a home-cooked meal. You better bring her.

249
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,210
-Got it? -Mom.

250
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,380
How would you feel if your boyfriend's ex

251
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,420
told you all about their relationship?

252
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,130
I'd be totally put off.

253
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,470
You shouldn't let that happen in the first place if you're a man.

254
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,550
It would be over.

255
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,640
-Was that about you? -Was that about you?

256
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,600
I'm hanging up.

257
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,520
-Hey! -What'd he say?

258
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,770
-You punk. -Hang up.

259
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,160
Thank you for your reports.

260
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,870
Ryong, you were trying to remove the cable for the camera you took

261
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,120
and got trapped alone.

262
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:57,210
It wasn't just ours. Dozens of cables from various countries were tangled together.

263
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,790
So it wasn't easy to just remove mine.

264
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,380
No matter how well you organize the cables,

265
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,800
they go wild in microgravity.

266
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:09,970
Once you were in the sleeping bag, you followed the guidelines for survival.

267
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:11,890
Yes.

268
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,310
But why didn't you take off your socks, Mr. Gong?

269
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,020
Your feet could've gotten frostbite.

270
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:22,820
Oh, my socks…

271
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,490
Well, you know, socks are…

272
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,950
Chief, as you're aware,

273
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:34,200
it isn't easy to bend over and put on or take off your socks in zero gravity.

274
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,290
That's why we wear the same pair of socks

275
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,880
for days in a row even though we change clothes daily.

276
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,790
It was too hard, so we gave up.

277
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,090
Fair enough.

278
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:47,300
Anyway, thanks for working so hard to write such detailed reports.

279
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,350
It's going to be a big help.

280
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,220
Are we finished?

281
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,850
You've had an incredible journey, teetering on the brink of life and death.

282
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,350
We won't forget it either.

283
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,360
Right.

284
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,780
This is where we part ways.

285
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,900
You can leave now.

286
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,910
Eve and I have more things to discuss.

287
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,290
I'll be going then.

288
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,100
Goodbye.

289
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:39,600
Since we had the wrap-up party for Expedition 3 yesterday,

290
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,480
don't meet the tourist personally anymore.

291
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,480
I know he said it was one-sided, but it's not a good look.

292
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:46,610
People will talk.

293
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,610
People are already gossiping.

294
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,160
Have you forgotten that there are more people who want you to fail

295
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,790
and take your position than there are who support you?

296
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,870
You worked so hard to get here.

297
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,170
I don't want this to tarnish your reputation.

298
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,510
Does it feel like I'm interfering in your personal life?

299
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,590
Did I go too far?

300
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,510
No.

301
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,850
Don't ever see him again. Got it?

302
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,770
You're not answering.

303
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,980
Okay.

304
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,450
Have you given up on your unrequited love?

305
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,080
I'm not going to do that anymore.

306
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,160
That's good. You've come to your senses.

307
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,580
By the way…

308
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,750
The prime example of a mammal, the mouse, hasn't had sex in space yet,

309
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,380
or gotten pregnant or given birth.

310
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,760
You're an ob-gyn, aren't you?

311
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,470
-Huh? -In microgravity,

312
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,510
what do you think is the most crucial factor for life to be born?

313
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,760
Why can't mammals have sex up there?

314
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,610
Let's do it together.

315
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,200
A pretty little mouse

316
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,490
might have already done it.

317
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,580
-What? -You just didn't see it.

318
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,670
When mice mate,

319
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,000
the copulatory plug remains for 24 hours.

320
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,420
That's how we can check.

321
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,920
There's no way we'd miss it if a mouse were to mate.

322
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,300
We could tell.

323
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,800
But sometimes there are mice where we can't tell.

324
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,680
The sneaky ones, the ones who pretend they didn't do it.

325
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,930
The ones secretly in love.

326
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,560
Huh? What's wrong with you, Commander?

327
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,100
The sneaky ones.

328
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,400
The ones who pretend they didn't do it.

329
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,150
-The ones secretly in love. -The ones secretly in love.

330
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,790
I'm going to go up with Eve this time.

331
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,580
What?

332
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,250
That's where Eve is going to stay,

333
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,010
so I need to repair the damaged station.

334
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,180
The IOU has my request.

335
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:22,720
I don't know if the IOU will approve such a last-minute request.

336
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:26,480
Whether you two go up there and reconcile as colleagues, I don't care.

337
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,060
As long as the mission is a success, I'm okay with it.

338
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,280
By the way, Park Dong-a,

339
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,950
you and I also have to write a report.

340
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:43,950
On the Maru rescue and return process, and any issues or improvements needed.

341
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,160
This includes you too, Eve.

342
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:50,000
So from now on, the three of us are in this together.

343
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,460
Don't even think about leaving before me today.

344
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,470
Let's take a look.

345
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:14,360
Don't worry. I'm not going to steal your position as commander.

346
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,360
Even if I go, you're the commander. I won't take a junior colleague's job.

347
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,660
It's going to take three months to restore the station.

348
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,370
You're going to be staying there.

349
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:25,910
I'm going to fix it.

350
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,540
And once it's done, I'm leaving.

351
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,790
So don't look at me like that.

352
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,340
Did you find something?

353
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,850
-Oh, you're here. -Yeah.

354
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,260
Let's get started.

355
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:50,190
From the window by the tourist's seat,

356
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,520
I saw flames from the undetached trunk.

357
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:56,030
The material should've disintegrated before we entered the atmosphere.

358
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,860
Why was it still there?

359
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,910
I was shocked at how slowly the trunk burned.

360
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,780
The parachute almost went up in flames.

361
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,990
Has the trunk material changed?

362
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,790
The parachute wasn't functioning properly either.

363
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,670
Let's look into it one by one.

364
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,390
You know, being here reminds me of the old days.

365
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,310
Dong-a, sit down.

366
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,310
Yeah, it does.

367
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,650
Man, it was tough watching out for you guys.

368
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,650
Dong-a, who did you like back then?

369
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,240
Yeah, tell us.

370
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,870
I'll forgive you if you're honest. Who was it?

371
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,500
You ladies, seriously.

372
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,880
It was another woman, Chief. There were others, you know.

373
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,130
-There were so many. -He can't answer.

374
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,630
Enough already, Eve. Chief.

375
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,260
-You slimy bastard. -He was slimy from the beginning.

376
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,390
Come on. Lay off.

377
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,930
Was this why you wanted us to work on this together?

378
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:11,140
Yes, we're going to make you squirm.

379
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,770
We're just getting started.

380
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,020
-Chief. -Yeah?

381
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,570
You should just apply for the station repair mission.

382
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,190
You used to be an engineer.

383
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,900
You should come up to space with us so we can all hang out.

384
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,110
Should I?

385
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,160
I was starting to get sick of all the meetings and reports.

386
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,080
It doesn't suit my temperament.

387
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,290
Dong-a, should we all go up together?

388
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,460
What do you think?

389
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,380
Hey, Dong-a.

390
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,000
Dong-a?

391
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,590
What do you say? Is it okay?

392
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,980
-See you tomorrow. -Good night, Doctor.

393
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,940
FLAVORS OF THE MOUNTAIN, SEA, AND SKY

394
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,710
Eve, what are you doing here?

395
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:19,630
I got a call from Jeon Yi-man out of the blue.

396
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,050
What did Yi-man want?

397
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,710
He called and told me to come.

398
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,430
You're here! Welcome!

399
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,470
Wow, she's so obedient.

400
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,970
Oh, hello.

401
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,060
Eve! Get in the car. Hurry!

402
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,940
Hurry up! You don't want to be here!

403
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,520
-What should I do? -Get over here.

404
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,980
They'll eat you alive! Hurry up and get in!

405
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,240
Hurry! Come on.

406
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,280
For God's sake. No!

407
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,920
You must have been surprised when Yi-man called.

408
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,420
Go and get some beer.

409
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,380
I'm not drinking.

410
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:07,510
Who said it's for you? Can't we treat the captain to a drink?

411
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,890
I have a meeting right after.

412
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:14,180
Just one beer then. I'll just have one beer.

413
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,310
One beer is fine.

414
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,940
Don't say anything strange.

415
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,150
Don't be silly.

416
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,440
-Thank you for rescuing our son. -Thank you.

417
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,400
You know how men are.

418
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:32,030
When they go on trips, or somewhere new, or visit unfamiliar places,

419
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,120
or meet new women,

420
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,660
they get all restless

421
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:40,290
and sometimes lose their minds and make mistakes.

422
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:42,000
You know how it is.

423
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:46,960
You idiot, you didn't bring any glasses. We can't chug from the bottle.

424
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:48,920
Go get some glasses.

425
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,350
That fool.

426
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:58,180
That idiot went off to space when he was about to get married,

427
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:02,230
so I'm sure he got scared and had a brief lapse of judgment.

428
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,690
Please don't hold it against him, Captain.

429
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,990
You know how men aren't all there compared to women.

430
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:11,030
That fool may look fine on the outside,

431
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,990
and even though he's a doctor,

432
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,910
he's still really immature and not the greatest of guys.

433
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:16,990
What did you say?

434
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,910
You're bad-mouthing me, aren't you?

435
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,080
Hey, even as women, we can see how amazing the captain is.

436
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:26,550
I bet she's got high standards and has tons of men after her.

437
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:29,050
I bet there are lots of men secretly crushing on her.

438
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:32,090
There's probably at least a dozen idiots like Ryong.

439
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,550
Tons, I'm sure.

440
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,600
What do you like? What can we make for you?

441
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,680
Do you want anything?

442
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:41,980
I heard you're going up soon.

443
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,810
I eat everything.

444
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,650
Is there something you're craving?

445
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,980
Stop asking. Just make her everything.

446
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:52,860
-How old are you? -I'm 37.

447
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,910
What do your parents do? Are they both alive?

448
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,160
No, they passed away.

449
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,000
Oh, dear.

450
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,210
You turned out so well though.

451
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,840
They would have been so proud if they were here.

452
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,340
Where were you born?

453
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,380
I don't really know.

454
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,430
I was adopted to the US right after I was born

455
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,550
and raised by my adoptive parents.

456
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,260
They abandoned their daughter? A newborn?

457
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:21,480
Oh my… When?

458
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,350
Why are you asking that kind of thing?

459
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:31,690
I was told it was on Christmas Eve.

460
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,070
How terrible.

461
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,240
It must have been so cold.

462
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,370
Is that why your name is Eve?

463
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,710
That's why I hate Christmas Eve the most.

464
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:47,380
-This looks good. Thank you. -I hate Christmas too.

465
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,170
You sit this one out.

466
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,500
Why? I want to drink too.

467
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,630
The tofu is good today.

468
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:03,430
Man, I shouldn't have had anything to drink.

469
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,020
Can't I go with you?

470
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,400
No.

471
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,570
Chief Kang said that we weren't allowed to meet, ever.

472
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,480
Just to the front of the MCC.

473
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,570
What if we get caught?

474
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,860
If they find out I'm the mouse, they'll kill me.

475
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,320
Very scary.

476
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,910
Would they fire you?

477
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:20,990
Who knows?

478
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,710
Eve.

479
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:28,670
What?

480
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,340
Do you regret being the first mammal to do it?

481
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,510
I don't know.

482
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,840
You don't know?

483
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,970
Didn't you stop thinking about whether you'd live or die in that moment?

484
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,850
Yeah, I forgot all about it.

485
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,440
Whether I was the commander or the tourist,

486
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,770
in space or on Earth, with gravity or zero gravity,

487
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,440
I forgot it all in that moment.

488
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,740
I was good, wasn't I?

489
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,490
I'm a pretty amazing mammal, aren't I?

490
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,790
Has the Maru been salvaged?

491
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,880
Yes, we took it back to the MCC storage today.

492
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,720
I will investigate Maru with Commander Eve and Pilot Dong-a Park

493
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,010
and report the errors and improvement of the liftoff and landing process of Maru,

494
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,100
including trunk separation failure during the rescue mission.

495
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,810
Please hurry up.

496
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:28,520
The investigation team in Florida is ready to launch.

497
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:55,000
OBOK SAUNA

498
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:56,170
Hello.

499
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,170
Thank you.

500
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,050
I've never done this before. What do I do when I get inside?

501
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,600
Just follow what everybody else is doing.

502
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,390
Just follow what they do?

503
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,680
After you go up,

504
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:10,190
you won't be able to have a proper shower for a whole year, right?

505
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:12,150
-True. -That’s not a shower. It's a wipe-down.

506
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,650
You're right. It's just wiping down.

507
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:16,860
You'll be okay, right?

508
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,110
Take it all off? Okay, okay.

509
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,450
You can do it.

510
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:23,320
MEN'S SAUNA, WOMEN'S SAUNA

511
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:32,790
-How was it? -So embarrassing. Everyone was naked.

512
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,500
Do you remember how cold we were?

513
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,800
No, I don't remember.

514
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,840
I'm hungry.

515
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:44,970
Me too.

516
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,140
I don't know this area.

517
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,850
Let's just choose a place that smells good.

518
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:49,770
Okay.

519
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,150
Whoa, he's bringing out another pan.

520
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:00,820
-What? -Hang on.

521
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,530
You act like you haven't eaten in days.

522
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,910
The station didn't have any smell at all.

523
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,080
It was so dreary.

524
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,040
Is this the smell of plain bread loaves or baguettes?

525
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:20,090
Does the food at the station have to have no smell and no taste?

526
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,010
How do you eat that for a year?

527
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,010
I started missing Earth after only ten days.

528
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:31,100
I've never been there for more than three months,

529
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:35,150
but according to some senior astronauts, after three months,

530
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,810
they were dying to hear birds chirping.

531
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,860
Then after six months,

532
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:44,570
they said you go crazy just wanting to hear the sound of rain.

533
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:48,740
I've even seen people bring recordings of Earth sounds to play up there.

534
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:55,500
But right now, I really want to bottle up this smell and take it back with me.

535
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:00,630
That feeling of sinking into hot water at the bathhouse earlier today,

536
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:03,800
and the sensation of the water lapping against my skin,

537
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,220
and the sounds of this neighborhood

538
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:10,390
as we wait here together for the bread to come out.

539
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,100
It's nice.

540
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,940
It isn't nice because it's Earth.

541
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,190
It's nice because you're with me.

542
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,490
Is that so?

543
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,820
I see.

544
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,120
You almost died up there.

545
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,580
Aren't you scared to go back?

546
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:41,960
I'm not scared of dying.

547
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,510
I don't care when I die, but I want to die when I'm happy.

548
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,840
Everyone dies.

549
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,890
Can I be honest with you?

550
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,720
That day,

551
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,310
even if I had died in that tent,

552
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:00,400
I didn't think I'd feel resentful or angry about my life.

553
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,730
Because I wasn't alone.

554
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,070
Yeah.

555
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,660
Being here with someone I like

556
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,080
and dying like this wouldn't be so bad.

557
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,830
I've been lonely my whole life, but I'm not lonely anymore.

558
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,170
That was what I thought.

559
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,420
No way.

560
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,840
I'm going to survive and make it back

561
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:32,600
so I can eat something hot with the commander,

562
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,680
take a warm bath with her, and date like other normal people.

563
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,270
And if we fall deeper in love,

564
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,980
I'm going to marry and have kids with her.

565
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,940
At least three.

566
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,690
I definitely won't die in some kind of accident.

567
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:50,660
I'm going to live a healthy life until I'm almost 100,

568
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,620
and then die just a day or two apart from this woman.

569
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,870
I should live at least a day longer

570
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,750
so she won't grieve because of me.

571
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:04,960
Those were the thoughts I had as I begged and begged

572
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,300
and prayed and endured.

573
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:11,760
I refuse to die like this in here with this woman.

574
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,600
I vowed to myself that I wouldn't die.

575
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:27,230
And if we fell deeper in love, what was it that you would do?

576
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:32,240
If we fall deeper in love…

577
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,120
-What was that about kids? How many? -So, if we fall deeper…

578
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,950
Huh? How many kids would we have?

579
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,330
I don't know.

580
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,750
What? Dream on, buddy.

581
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,130
Oh, it's open! Let's go.

582
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,300
Come in.

583
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,810
DAD

584
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,230
Hi, Dad.

585
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,230
What the hell have you been up to?

586
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,450
MZ switched their primary bank.

587
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,570
They switched to our competitor.

588
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,910
I want you to get over there and fix this now!

589
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,260
Chairman Choi.

590
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:38,050
Isn't this stooping a bit low?

591
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,310
What?

592
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:43,100
Please switch your primary bank back to ours.

593
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,770
Go-eun is my woman.

594
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:47,190
Please bring her back too.

595
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,860
You told me to give up.

596
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,440
Give up?

597
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,610
Nobody has ever dared to tell me to give up before.

598
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,740
You give up.

599
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,870
I thought you liked me.

600
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:01,040
You could never be satisfied with a guy like Ryong.

601
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,660
Ryong didn't give up.

602
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,290
Even when he didn't have any eggs, he didn't give up.

603
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:09,420
Even in situations where, as you said, giving up was the only option,

604
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,920
he didn't.

605
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,840
You lost.

606
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:16,680
He was on the brink of freezing to death, and he still didn't give up.

607
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,220
You could learn a thing or two from him, you punk.

608
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,970
Ryong is a scumbag. He has feelings for someone else.

609
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,060
Look at this punk.

610
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:29,110
Ryong has given up Go-eun.

611
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,150
Go get Ryong.

612
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:52,170
Do you have another woman?

613
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,010
What?

614
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,220
I am even…

615
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:01,640
thinking about keeping the socks you wore as heirlooms.

616
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,350
I asked you a question. Do you have another woman?

617
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,770
If that's true,

618
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,020
it won't matter that you risked your life to make that morula.

619
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,230
I won't trust you with it.

620
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,490
I'll also kick you out of the hospital

621
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:18,030
and put a stop to the space fertility clinic.

622
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:21,990
I'll make sure you never practice medicine on Earth again.

623
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,700
Sir, I was going to tell you,

624
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:28,870
but, you see, Go-eun and I...

625
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,960
Dad.

626
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,970
Why are you doubting Ryong just because of what Kang Kang-su said?

627
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:41,300
What, after that ice cream backstabbing incident,

628
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,310
do you two have something else up your sleeve?

629
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:45,970
How are you planning to stab us in the back this time?

630
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,270
Listen, sir.

631
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,100
If it weren't for that lunatic Kang Kang-su,

632
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:55,570
Ryong and I wouldn't have any problems.

633
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,820
Because of that man,

634
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,070
I can't bring myself to look Ryong in the eye.

635
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,080
He books the room next to mine at our hotel and goes around

636
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,120
telling everyone that my ex-boyfriend is staying in the room next to mine,

637
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:12,170
making me into this strange woman...

638
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,210
That's going a bit overboard.

639
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:16,210
Is this true?

640
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,170
Yes, he's in the room next to hers.

641
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,510
Do you have any idea how pathetic he is, begging me to take him back?

642
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:23,720
Pathetic?

643
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:26,890
When have I ever acted pathetic around you?

644
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:31,190
He walks around the hotel restaurant in his pajamas

645
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:34,940
and forces people to kneel in front of him in the lobby, going on and on about money.

646
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,650
Did you rip people off?

647
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:38,320
You really are something else.

648
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,200
You act like you're the center of the universe.

649
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,820
It's not me that he likes.

650
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:49,250
He needs our company to make his bank our primary bank.

651
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,710
Why do you think I dumped him?

652
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:54,500
This is so embarrassing.

653
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:58,800
While this so-called astronaut is on Earth,

654
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,630
he either spends all day with his fruit flies,

655
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,130
or he's at a fruit fly conference,

656
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:06,760
or he goes to parties to raise money for fruit fly research.

657
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:09,520
He'd come over after midnight,

658
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,480
and all this man would do is spend the night.

659
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,850
The only time I ever saw him was in bed.

660
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:18,530
The minute he opened his eyes, he'd run off to his little fruit flies.

661
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:21,860
You'd only come to sleep with me because you were supposedly so busy.

662
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,320
How is it you don't have a Nobel Prize yet,

663
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:27,490
and instead, you go around trying to turn my dad against Ryong?

664
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,750
That thing he can't do at the station,

665
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:33,120
the thing he can't do with fruit flies.

666
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:35,790
That's the only thing he came to me for, to sleep with me.

667
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:37,380
Enough.

668
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:40,920
I'm okay.

669
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,760
You have no idea how to be an older brother figure,

670
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,970
but you have the nerve to talk about mine.

671
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:52,270
Now that I like somebody else,

672
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,730
he's refusing to give up

673
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:56,230
because his pride's been hurt.

674
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:58,570
Dad,

675
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:01,610
he treated me worse than his fruit flies.

676
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:03,700
Do you still want us to work things out?

677
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,160
Huh? Do you?

678
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,200
Why do you still speak to this fruit fly of a man?

679
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:12,870
You, get lost.

680
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,500
Sir.

681
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,790
That bastard Ryong has feelings for somebody else.

682
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,880
Ryong, would you like to have lunch?

683
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,340
Sir.

684
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,420
Hey!

685
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:28,550
I want you to ban this fruit fly lover.

686
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,680
Don't let him in again.

687
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:51,370
If anyone's going to tell him, it'll be me.

688
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:53,540
I haven't given up on you yet.

689
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,540
At least let me save face.

690
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Okay.

691
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,840
-Are you insane? -Hey!

692
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,380
You… Blindsiding me again?

693
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:17,020
Shit.

694
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:21,060
Take it out on me, not my precious piece of crap car.

695
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:23,570
You think I'm going to go down alone at the disciplinary hearing?

696
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:26,110
You're going down with me.

697
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:28,660
Say that again.

698
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,450
You think I won't do it?

699
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:33,450
Did they get caught?

700
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,500
-What? Did you take it from them? -You listen to me.

701
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:38,540
You stole my money and my girl.

702
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:40,580
Aren't you the real thief here?

703
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:44,340
Fine. Even if I get a harsher penalty

704
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:47,800
and they slap me with a fine of billions of won, thanks to you…

705
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,930
Thanks to you, I've got it covered. Much appreciated.

706
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:52,720
Do you really want to start something?

707
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,060
You little shit.

708
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,390
-You asshole. -Hey!

709
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:01,900
You still haven't implanted the morula into Dr. Na Min-jeong, have you?

710
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,610
You bastard.

711
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:08,700
You should know when to shut up.

712
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:09,900
Can't you distinguish

713
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:12,870
between your love life and matters of life and death?

714
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:15,620
You're only good at betraying people.

715
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,500
Stop. You're going to make things difficult for Ms. Choi.

716
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:19,660
Please stop.

717
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:21,540
So what if I betrayed a thief like you?

718
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:23,080
-So what, you bastard? -What?

719
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:25,040
That's nothing compared to what you deserve.

720
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:33,010
Go-eun.

721
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:40,850
You're not even worth hitting.

722
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,610
You happy?

723
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,690
Are you guys satisfied?

724
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:02,000
There will be a disciplinary hearing for Kang Kang-su tomorrow.

725
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:05,880
The inspector general will personally be overseeing the proceedings.

726
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,300
The entire crew from Expedition 3 must attend.

727
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:11,340
Yes, Chief.

728
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:14,430
Kang Kang-su's experiment,

729
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:17,720
using the donated eggs and Santi's sperm from the station, was an act

730
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:18,970
of contempt and deception

731
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:22,190
not only to his fellow astronauts but also to the KSA.

732
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:24,100
It will be Kang Kang-su's judgment day.

733
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:26,610
Do your best to cooperate with the inspector general.

734
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:30,230
How is it possible not to know what was in the incubator?

735
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:33,530
Here, we can only monitor whether it's on or off.

736
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:40,040
We can't know what's inside the incubator until they report it.

737
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:44,210
Si-won, come with me to the main office before we go home for the day.

738
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,040
I need to get something from my office for the inspection team.

739
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:49,130
Okay.

740
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,630
Let's have dinner.

741
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:56,340
I'm not done with work.

742
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:07,230
We all warned you.

743
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:08,940
Warned me about what?

744
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:10,020
You know.

745
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,570
Let's finish this after dinner.

746
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:18,910
I want to get this done and go.

747
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:20,790
Aren't you going to listen to me?

748
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,750
It doesn't have to be me, just don't date the tourist.

749
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,840
If everyone is against it, there's probably a good reason.

750
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:38,010
Is this intended to be advice or a warning?

751
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,350
You're kidding me, right?

752
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:43,810
Dong-a, I don't have much time.

753
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:45,940
I'm leaving for space in a few days.

754
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,020
Every second feels precious to me right now.

755
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:53,860
The thought of leaving someone I like behind on Earth makes every day feel

756
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,610
like it could be my last, like I've been sentenced to death.

757
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,660
The thought of wasting even a second is making me crazy.

758
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,460
Did you sleep with him?

759
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:10,590
When?

760
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,920
When I risked my life to save you?

761
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:21,180
When you were naked and alone together in the sleeping bag?

762
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,520
Yes.

763
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:26,810
You're lying.

764
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,230
You and I are no different.

765
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,490
Stop lying. Up there? In zero gravity?

766
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:39,610
Yeah.

767
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:42,950
That punk did what a mouse couldn't? You expect me to believe that?

768
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:44,580
Yeah.

769
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:50,120
On top of everything, now you're lying to me?

770
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:52,920
Eve, you've gone mad.

771
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,420
You're nuts, you know that?

772
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,630
We're not done talking.

773
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:02,010
Why didn't you tell Dr. Ma,

774
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,390
who has been hell-bent on getting mice,

775
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:06,680
the most prolific breeders of all mammals, to mate?

776
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:08,980
Why didn't you tell your partner that?

777
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:11,350
Why do you only lie to me?

778
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,780
You and I are not the same.

779
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:19,030
I'm a terrible person, which is something you could never be.

780
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,150
I…

781
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:24,160
I know you. You're not like that.

782
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:32,040
But it's true.

783
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:33,750
But it's true.

784
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:38,210
You guys lost. We did it first.

785
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,010
Aren't we amazing?

786
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:47,220
You guys need to step up your game, got it?

787
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:14,380
Chief?

788
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,000
We're running late.

789
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:36,400
I'm heading out now. Just wait a bit.

790
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:51,450
Do you have an umbrella?

791
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,020
-Chief. -Yeah?

792
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,440
On your way home, can you drop me off at the MCC?

793
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,730
Do it tomorrow.

794
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:19,190
The flight team wants it by tonight.

795
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:20,900
Then take a taxi.

796
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,570
Come on. It's raining.

797
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:24,450
Then at least give me the company card.

798
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:27,160
Just take my whole wallet, why don't you?

799
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,160
What did you say?

800
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,540
Let's have dinner. I don't want to eat alone.

801
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:34,750
I told you, I have to work. What did the inspector general say?

802
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,710
As expected, the mood was tense.

803
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:51,560
Isn't that the commander?

804
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:57,480
She doesn't even have an umbrella. She can't afford to catch a cold now.

805
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,270
-Call her. Let's pick her up. -Okay.

806
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,090
Aren't you cold?

807
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:24,670
Why'd you come out? It's just around the corner.

808
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,680
Why didn't you borrow an umbrella instead of walking in the rain?

809
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,640
Everyone had already left for the day.

810
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,560
So the people who dislike me have all left?

811
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:36,730
Hang on. What's that? What's wrong with your neck?

812
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:38,310
-Huh? -Who did this?

813
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:40,100
This? It's nothing.

814
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:41,900
-What? -It's no big deal.

815
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,820
Out of nowhere?

816
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:50,070
So, where's that commander now?

817
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,700
The one who ordered me not to like her up there in space.

818
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:55,080
You called me a murderer.

819
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,790
Where's the guy who said he'd never save me again?

820
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,210
I left him in space.

821
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,630
I love how the rain sounds.

822
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:08,220
There you go again.

823
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,930
Here's the thing. It's not the sound of the rain you love.

824
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:14,350
You also love the sound of the rain because you're with me, Commander.

825
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:16,470
You're right.

826
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:32,160
It started from then, that's right.

827
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,990
Yep, that's when it was.

828
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,120
And Dong-a risked his life to go up there.

829
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:42,250
Let's be honest. We all thought something was off, right?

830
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:44,250
They held back

831
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:46,630
and after they got back, that's when sparks flew?

832
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:49,800
Hey, Si-won. Zoom in over there behind the sleeping bag.

833
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:52,470
-Behind the sleeping bag? -Quickly.

834
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,600
Okay.

835
00:55:58,390 --> 00:55:59,980
Zoom in more.

836
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:00,940
-More? -Yes.

837
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,940
Is that an incubator back there?

838
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:07,070
An incubator?

839
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:09,150
Was there an incubator there?

840
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,820
Isn't that an incubator door?

841
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:13,860
It's too dark to see it clearly. Hang on.

842
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,880
You're right, that's an incubator.

843
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,050
It hadn't been used since we repurposed that module for observation,

844
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:33,470
but the power turned on just before the space debris hit.

845
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:37,350
We can't tell from Earth what it was used for.

846
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:38,760
After the debris hit,

847
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:41,640
communications were cut off, so there's no record after that.

848
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:43,020
Who could have used it?

849
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:58,990
All hell might break loose at tomorrow's disciplinary hearing.

850
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:02,500
Check to see who went there when the debris hit.

851
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:03,580
Okay.

852
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:26,100
So he had more embryos than the seven morulas we caught him with.

853
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,310
Damn.

854
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:31,030
Get Kang Kang-su and the tourist in here.

855
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,530
-The tourist too? -The tourist was in there the whole time.

856
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:37,700
He was messing around in there and got left behind. Call them now!

857
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,390
You two are in cahoots, aren't you?

858
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,220
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

859
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,680
Name, Kang Kang-su.

860
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,470
Your status as an astronaut has been permanently revoked.

861
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:24,640
Traitors.

862
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,600
We may have lost our baby,

863
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,190
but I wanted to save the morula.

864
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,100
We're not in cahoots, we're enemies.

865
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:35,320
Shut your mouth. I can't believe a word you say anymore.

866
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,610
She doesn't have any family,

867
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:38,740
so wouldn't it be nice if she had

868
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:42,070
at least one person back here on Earth who had her back?

869
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,820
-I think it's pregnant! -Really?

870
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:45,450
Where are you? I'll head over there right now.

871
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:53,420
