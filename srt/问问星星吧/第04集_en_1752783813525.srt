1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,960
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

2
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,430
Eve!

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:16,970
Stay with me, Eve!

4
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,260
EV1, check your CO2 levels. EV1?

5
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,600
-Open your eyes, Eve. -EV1?

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,680
Are you okay?

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,690
-Eve! Eve, stay with me. -Stay awake!

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:26,560
Eve!

9
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,110
Let's see

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,200
what she wrote in her will.

11
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,340
My adoptive father was an American astronaut.

12
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,590
How does that look? Should we get one more?

13
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,680
Let's take another. Come on.

14
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,230
See if you can get the article.

15
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,740
My daughter's gonna see this.

16
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,990
She'll be proud.

17
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,830
He died trying to save his colleague during a spacewalk.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,670
Right before the spacewalk,

19
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,880
he wrote me a letter,

20
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,470
and those turned out to be his last words.

21
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,350
Dear Daughter,

22
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,730
once you come to this vast space with no beginning or end, you'll see.

23
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:56,190
Zinnias, lettuce, mayflies, even humans.

24
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,450
Everything is weightless here.

25
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,620
All living beings are equal.

26
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:10,170
So do not carelessly step on an earthworm in the backyard…

27
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,540
…do not carelessly step…

28
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,840
…or weed the lawn.

29
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,210
…or weed the lawn.

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:20,090
They are miracles made by the spirits of the universe.

31
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:21,760
Every…

32
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,350
Every being is a miracle on its own.

33
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,680
…on its own.

34
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,930
That's what he said.

35
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,140
Every being…

36
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,810
is a miracle on its own.

37
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,110
Eve!

38
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,820
Grab whatever you can, Eve. Come on!

39
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,460
She's got a hold of it.

40
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,840
Eve, are you okay?

41
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,930
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,140
I think my glove is damaged.

43
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,060
Here's your list of duties while I'm out.

44
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,690
This isn't a will, just a set of requests.

45
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,860
Okay, number one.

46
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,160
Run on the treadmill for two hours straight

47
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,990
to keep your calcium levels up until you return to Earth.

48
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,290
Zero gravity is a monster that feeds on muscles.

49
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,960
Number two.

50
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,420
Put food in Public and Indecency's vial.

51
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,880
They need to eat to survive.

52
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,300
Keep an eye on the larvae and check if they're molting.

53
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,260
Keep the temperature at 25 degrees and humidity at 75% to help them along.

54
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,220
If they fail to molt and die, there will be hell to pay.

55
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,930
Number three.

56
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,850
Change the IV and dressing for the post-op male mouse.

57
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,690
Shake the NSAID and inject exactly 0.2 ml.

58
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,820
Gently. Don't hurt him, okay?

59
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,820
All right, number four.

60
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,330
There are three tubes of gochujang at the back of my food storage locker

61
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,990
in the kitchen module.

62
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,670
You'll find a can of tuna there too. If you're missing Korean spice,

63
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,920
try adding two tubes of gochujang to the tuna.

64
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,130
Now, don't forget. You have to leave one for me.

65
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,720
Number five.

66
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,510
-Once the spice gets your bowels moving… -Kang-su. Eve.

67
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,930
…you have to poop by the end of the day.

68
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,270
I know you haven't pooped once since you got here

69
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,480
-three days ago. -Gross.

70
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,320
In zero gravity, the toxins will spread throughout your body,

71
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,860
causing odor and even swelling.

72
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,070
-It's very dangerous. -Where is it?

73
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,070
You haven't gone in three days, so you'll need to push hard,

74
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,660
but zero gravity weakens your blood vessels.

75
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,910
So make sure to alternate between pushing and pausing.

76
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,830
You've got to take it easy, or you could burst a blood vessel.

77
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,590
Man, she's even telling me how to take a dump now.

78
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,090
Where is it?

79
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,650
Found it.

80
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,780
EV1, body temperature 37.3 degrees, your heart rate…

81
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,950
Fifty-seven?

82
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,000
Eve, check your glove. Is the hole bigger?

83
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,870
Her ECG levels are falling.

84
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,790
EV1, check your CO2 levels.

85
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,880
EV1?

86
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,460
EV1?

87
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,550
Eve! Eve, stay with me.

88
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,970
Eve!

89
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,100
Number six.

90
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,900
-You're not an astronaut. -Shit.

91
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,190
You're a visitor, so stay put

92
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,400
and do nothing, no matter what happens.

93
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:10,410
IOU, this won't work. Please find a different angle of approach.

94
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,200
Moving EV1 to a safe position.

95
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,760
Don't move. Stay as still as possible.

96
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,590
You need to buy every second you can!

97
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,340
Copy.

98
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,890
-EV2, repressurization complete. -Repressurization done.

99
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,970
I'm switching places with Dr. Kang.

100
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,110
Eve, how's your breathing?

101
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,730
Is the tear getting bigger?

102
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,900
Her heart rate is dropping.

103
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,610
-Commander. -Check your CO2 levels.

104
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,870
-Can you hear me? Commander. -EV1.

105
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:56,160
It's still within the normal range.

106
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm fine.

107
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,500
You checked the reading? Can you see the monitor?

108
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,080
Capcom, have we found a different angle of approach?

109
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,710
We can't get a good angle.

110
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,630
Her safety tether is attached to a concave section on G.O-10.

111
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,130
There's just no way

112
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,760
we can bring her close enough to the hook

113
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,010
with the solar panel in the way.

114
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,060
With her right hand holding on to the panel,

115
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,810
it won't work with the robot arm.

116
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,380
Number seven.

117
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,380
Stay out of trouble like I said,

118
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,300
and I'll buy you a drink when I'm back on Earth next year.

119
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,770
Lee, how much time is left?

120
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,730
Fifteen minutes remaining for decompression.

121
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,810
As soon as it's done,

122
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,110
you'll exit and unhook Eve Kim's safety tether.

123
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,270
Eve, don't move an inch until then.

124
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,730
If the tear gets any worse, you're in real trouble.

125
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,820
EV1, copy.

126
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,080
You must be cold.

127
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,920
It's minus 130 degrees out there. Your feet must be freezing.

128
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,840
How long have you been standing there like that?

129
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,800
I mean, how much longer do you have to…

130
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,760
…like that?

131
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,060
Eve.

132
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,270
Eve. Wake up.

133
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,650
Look at me, okay? Eve!

134
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,860
Open your eyes. Eve!

135
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,130
I think I'm fine.

136
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,350
I'm okay.

137
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,850
You said you were fine even when I stitched up your toes

138
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,600
without anesthesia.

139
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,900
Will you please stop lying?

140
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,070
Pressure is dropping in your suit, Eve.

141
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,410
Eve.

142
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,540
Come on, look at me. Eve!

143
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,540
Stay awake. Look at me, okay?

144
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,960
Eve!

145
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,090
I'm okay.

146
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,050
EV1's heart rate is dropping fast.

147
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:45,510
You said you'd buy me a drink when you got back to Earth!

148
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,720
EV1 seems to be…

149
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,980
EV1 seems to be losing oxygen rapidly.

150
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,060
EV1?

151
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,820
EV1!

152
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,900
Eve, respond! What's your oxygen level?

153
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,650
I'm okay.

154
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,070
I think I can hold out.

155
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,410
Damn it.

156
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,620
You can't see the monitor?

157
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,370
You can't see it?

158
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,910
Shit.

159
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,750
Lee, how much longer for decompression?

160
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:55,790
This is Airlock 1.

161
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,250
I'll go out, unhook her, and bring her back right now!

162
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,340
No, Seung-jun.

163
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,010
Finish decompression first.

164
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,600
You have to finish decompression first.

165
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,060
I think I can hold out until then.

166
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:15,060
You've been acting like you're fine this whole time?

167
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,810
Airlock 1, preparing to exit.

168
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,020
Stop! Are you trying to get yourself killed?

169
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,070
You'll be in danger too without proper decompression.

170
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,570
Just wait till it's finished.

171
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,450
It's almost done, all right? Stick to the protocol!

172
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,700
Her vitals are continuing to drop, Chief!

173
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,540
Don't stop me. Do you want to lose her like this?

174
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,260
What the hell?

175
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,340
-What's going on? -Where's this coming from?

176
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,970
Someone just opened G.O-10's hatch!

177
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,600
What?

178
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,120
Oh, my God!

179
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,720
That crazy bastard.

180
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,350
He's out of his damn mind.

181
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,310
You need to turn around and face me.

182
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,360
Turn around and face me right now.

183
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,270
I can't.

184
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,530
Are you even connected to the oxygen supply?

185
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:47,990
I am.

186
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,910
I didn't want to blow up the station,

187
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,950
so I closed its hatch too.

188
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,040
You'll get decompression sickness! The gas bubbles will kill you!

189
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,620
Mr. Gong.

190
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:02,130
Push your legs through the hatch,

191
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,300
close it, and get inside.

192
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,800
Do as I say.

193
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,380
No.

194
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,550
You looked like you were about to die any second.

195
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,060
How could I just stay inside?

196
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,020
You can't reach the hook,

197
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,690
but I can reach it from here. So how could I…

198
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,770
Anyway, forget about that.

199
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,610
Where's the hook to the safety tether?

200
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,280
Where do I go?

201
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,240
You skipped decompression. You could die.

202
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,830
Nitrogen narcosis is no joke.

203
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,120
So just tell me!

204
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,040
I'm not going back until I unhook you,

205
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,460
so tell me right now, okay?

206
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,090
I feel like I'm going to die.

207
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:51,380
Where is the damn hook?

208
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,680
For God's sake.

209
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,470
Look, Mr. Tourist.

210
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,930
Who goes out to space in a pressure suit without decompressing?

211
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,400
In that suit, you won't last one… No, not even two minutes.

212
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,560
Get back inside now!

213
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,480
At this rate, they're both going to die!

214
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,780
Screw the protocol. I'm going out right now!

215
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,150
Just tell me where the hook is!

216
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,160
Let go of the handle and go down.

217
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,490
Mr. Gong is much closer to it than we are.

218
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,330
If they wait for Dr. Lee, neither of them will make it.

219
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,830
Mr. Gong, listen carefully.

220
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,460
Go down and grab the hook. You'll be able to reach it.

221
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,130
Gong Ryong. Just listen to me.

222
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,760
If you go back inside now, you might still be okay.

223
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,760
Going down now.

224
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,930
Damn it, he just won't listen.

225
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,890
He's the only one who can save Eve right now.

226
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,310
He can reach the hook from there!

227
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,350
Theoretically, he can last for a few minutes!

228
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,860
For God's sake.

229
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,480
Come on.

230
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,070
I don't see it.

231
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,660
This is an order.

232
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,910
Go back inside!

233
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,420
Where is the hook?

234
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,260
Go back inside.

235
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,850
Keep going. Go farther down.

236
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,770
Hold on to that right there.

237
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,770
Copy.

238
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,270
Going down.

239
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,240
I can't reach it.

240
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,040
Come on!

241
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,210
Where is it?

242
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,170
Is it on my left?

243
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,630
On my right?

244
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,680
I can't reach it!

245
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,260
We can't see any further.

246
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,180
This is insane.

247
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,930
What do I do then?

248
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,850
What do I do now?

249
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,770
Damn it!

250
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,980
I…

251
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,700
I can't do it.

252
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,200
Only you can see it now.

253
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:09,670
Eve, only you can see it now.

254
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,290
Eve!

255
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,670
Only you can see it now!

256
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:27,560
Only you can see it!

257
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,400
Eve.

258
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,770
On your left.

259
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,360
It's on your left.

260
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,570
My left?

261
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,620
On my left.

262
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,120
On your left.

263
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,370
A little more to the left.

264
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,050
Stretch a little farther to the left.

265
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,720
To the left.

266
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,310
Stretch farther to the left. A little more.

267
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,270
Damn it.

268
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:28,720
I got it.

269
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,560
I got it.

270
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,350
Yeah!

271
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,650
He…

272
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,440
He did it!

273
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:42,530
That nutjob.

274
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:45,530
That lunatic did it. He did it.

275
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,700
Confirming.

276
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,580
EV1 has been detached.

277
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,160
Let's take her home.

278
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,000
Let's take her home.

279
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,480
Go ahead.

280
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,320
Once you're in, push the repressurization button

281
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,490
and put on the oxygen mask right away, got it?

282
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:27,160
Just go!

283
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,660
Go.

284
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,680
Airlock 1, decompression completed to 4.3 psia.

285
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,060
I'll help Eve back inside when she gets here.

286
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,560
Eve, I'm heading out now. Can you see me?

287
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,770
Yes, I can see you.

288
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,160
G.O-10, did you lock the hatch?

289
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,330
Did you lock the hatch?

290
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,090
Don't talk. You're low on oxygen.

291
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,840
Hey, stay focused. Look down the hatch.

292
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,050
I said don't talk, Eve! I got this!

293
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,380
-Let me do it! -Open the repressurization valve.

294
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,350
Hey.

295
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,180
Mr. Gong, did you find the repressurization valve?

296
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,980
Mr. Gong.

297
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,770
-Mr. Gong? -Sir.

298
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,650
-Mr. Gong. -Sir.

299
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,980
-Sir. -Sir.

300
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,820
Sir.

301
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,070
Sir!

302
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,120
Sir.

303
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,620
Sir!

304
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,090
Damn it! Why is he not picking up?

305
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,550
Wait, is he dead already?

306
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,680
Or…

307
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,560
Are you dying right now?

308
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,020
Ryong!

309
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,270
Come on, please pick up.

310
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,110
It'd be faster to just talk to you like this!

311
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,420
Dr. Na Min-jeong's eggs have been successfully injected

312
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,420
with Mr. Choi Dong-hun's sperm in zero gravity via ICSI.

313
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,760
They're now in the incubator

314
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,550
set at 37 degrees with 5% oxygen,

315
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,600
where the sperm and egg nuclei

316
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,810
are likely fusing as we speak.

317
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,140
If all goes as planned,

318
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:05,190
we should know by tomorrow morning if fertilization was successful.

319
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,570
What are our odds here?

320
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:11,780
Well, since Mr. Choi Dong-hun's sperm is severely misshapen,

321
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,110
it's likely that both its motility

322
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,280
and DNA integrity are compromised.

323
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,740
But in a zero-gravity environment,

324
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,910
we're hoping that at least three of them will fertilize.

325
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,040
All seven of them will.

326
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,580
Sure, of course.

327
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,790
-I have a good feeling. -Yes, all seven of them.

328
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,600
Dr. Jeon.

329
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,690
The director thinks I don't know anything,

330
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,230
and I need to keep it that way.

331
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,610
Have you talked to Ryong?

332
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,200
I haven't been able to reach him for hours. I'm worried sick.

333
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,320
He's not taking my calls either.

334
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,330
Do you think he got caught?

335
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,200
He might be dead.

336
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,710
What?

337
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:09,090
He said he was going to keep running on the treadmill until the motor exploded.

338
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,460
Maybe he tore a muscle while he was running,

339
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:14,920
or his heart couldn't handle the strain in zero gravity and went into arrest,

340
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,180
or his arteries ruptured.

341
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,470
Something must've gone wrong for sure.

342
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:22,270
How could he risk his life to steal back some eggs? That's insane.

343
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,390
If something really happened to him,

344
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,600
I'm not letting it slide, whether it's the director or the chairman.

345
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,440
How's Min-jeong doing?

346
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,860
-Is she all right? -Yes, sir.

347
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,400
Right this way, sir.

348
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,410
The chairman is here.

349
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:42,620
How are you feeling?

350
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:47,370
Well, everything looks good, sir.

351
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,920
You can go now.

352
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Yes, sir.

353
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,140
You should start preparing for your pregnancy now.

354
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,300
Kang-su will make it happen soon,

355
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:04,270
so stop working and just focus on your health.

356
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:08,730
Once my grandchild is born, I'll put them on a pedestal.

357
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,770
I won't let their feet touch the ground,

358
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,940
and I'll make sure every door

359
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,900
is opened for them so they'll never even have to touch a doorknob.

360
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,490
They'll be raised like royalty.

361
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:21,120
I'll get them the best teachers

362
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,910
so they can learn business management and take over MZ Group after Go-eun.

363
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,500
No.

364
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,120
Once the baby is born, I'm leaving with them.

365
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,710
What?

366
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,840
The child is mine.

367
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,210
How I raise them is up to me.

368
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,510
I've decided

369
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:40,720
I won't let them turn out like you.

370
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,180
Who do you think you are?

371
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,180
You have no idea how much Dong-hun struggled growing up, do you?

372
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,060
He didn't want to go into management,

373
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,480
but you forced him into that construction job,

374
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,770
and it got him killed.

375
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,690
I know you'll do the same to my child,

376
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,860
and I won't tolerate

377
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,320
your controlling ways and restrictions anymore.

378
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,320
Are you…

379
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,950
Are you saying it's my fault Dong-hun died?

380
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,790
Did you ever ask him…

381
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,670
what he really wanted?

382
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,930
He was miserable his whole life,

383
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:24,390
and he died trying to save someone else.

384
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,810
That's who he was.

385
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,930
He was different from you.

386
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,310
That's why

387
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,770
he also wanted to leave you if we had a child.

388
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,690
Shut it!

389
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,240
I'm the one who spent 70 billion to send Gong Ryong up to space!

390
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,740
This is about my child,

391
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,530
but you changed my doctor without my consent,

392
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,790
and you're already controlling their life

393
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:50,370
when they're just a handful of cells, not even an embryo.

394
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,290
Imagine what you'll do once they're born.

395
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,040
As their mother, I can't let that happen.

396
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:59,760
Did you ask the child if they want to inherit MZ Group?

397
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,800
Who in this world wouldn't want money and power?

398
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,890
The child has my genes,

399
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,140
so I know.

400
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,270
They're going to be someone like me,

401
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:14,810
living with pride and the whole world at their feet!

402
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,190
Don't kid yourself. They won't be like you.

403
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,240
Things won't go according to your plans.

404
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,900
You can thank me later.

405
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:27,450
Just quit your job here and focus on your health.

406
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:29,490
What's so great about being a damn doctor?

407
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,800
I want Na Min-jeong fired.

408
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,220
Effective immediately!

409
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,340
-Clear her office this minute. -Yes, sir.

410
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:49,350
If I see her working in this hospital,

411
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,270
-you'll be fired too. -Sir?

412
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,560
CEO Choi Go-eun of MZ Electronics

413
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,730
has announced her engagement to Dr. Gong Ryong,

414
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:58,150
an ob-gyn formerly with the MZ Medical Center.

415
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:02,320
Dr. Gong is currently aboard a space station as a tourist

416
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
and will return to Earth in five days.

417
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,320
Here's a clip from the press conference.

418
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,530
Has the chairman officially given his blessing?

419
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,330
Of course.

420
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,040
When will the engagement ceremony be?

421
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,580
Once Ryong gets back,

422
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,000
we'll arrange a meeting for our families first.

423
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,840
-Ladies. -We'll cherish our time together.

424
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,800
I think…

425
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,760
We'll cultivate a happy marriage…

426
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,380
-We should go dress shopping. -…built on love and trust.

427
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,360
…didn't go to the space station for fun.

428
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,320
As a doctor,

429
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,660
he's taken an important first step in the life sciences industry

430
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,700
that MZ Group will lead in the future.

431
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,910
Could you say a few words to Mr. Gong?

432
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,250
I miss you.

433
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,250
Stay healthy,

434
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,220
and please make it home safe and sound.

435
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,350
GONG RYONG'S 4TH DAY

436
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,040
I'm worried.

437
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,500
He'll get better, won't he?

438
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,040
He has to.

439
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,700
Thanks to Na-mi,

440
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,700
we haven't had to go to a hair salon in the last 30 years.

441
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,200
It's way too expensive to get a perm.

442
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:22,000
She could do our hair when we meet the girl's family too.

443
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,460
Do you think a day like this would've come if it weren't for Na-mi?

444
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:30,970
Imagine if she hadn't convinced us to raise Ryong back then.

445
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,430
Ryong should forever be grateful to Na-mi, even more than to us.

446
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,690
NA-MI'S HAIR SALON

447
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,650
Eve.

448
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,270
Only you can see it now.

449
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,860
Only you can see it now!

450
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,700
Do you want more noodles?

451
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,490
No, I don't have time. I've got to run and prep for surgery.

452
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,960
Slow down. You'll get indigestion.

453
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,420
You got a perm?

454
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,630
Pretty.

455
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,840
Yi-man just called me pretty.

456
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,850
Who says that to their friend's mom?

457
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:42,970
I can hear you.

458
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,220
RYONGSTER

459
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,480
You asshole!

460
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,520
Geez.

461
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,360
Nothing happened. What's with the yelling?

462
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,490
I'm done being friends with you, you jerk.

463
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:01,330
You're just going to give me a heart attack at this rate,

464
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:03,830
so I'm done, okay? Just forget everything.

465
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,040
Forget what?

466
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,710
Are you saying you don't want to check on my moms anymore?

467
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,830
Sure, you can forget about that too.

468
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,920
-Can we have more kimchi, please? -Sure.

469
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,800
Hey, your moms?

470
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,550
They're doing way better than you. Stronger and healthier too.

471
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:20,220
Hell, they'll probably even outlive you.

472
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:24,560
They just got a perm too, and they're loving it.

473
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,060
You worry about your own life.

474
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:30,940
They may look fine on the outside, but they're a mess on the inside.

475
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,980
They take fistfuls of meds every day.

476
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,070
So? Did you run that marathon?

477
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:36,650
You bet.

478
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,320
No one knows what I did.

479
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,910
But you couldn't have been running until now.

480
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:46,620
What took you so long to call me?

481
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,960
So, are you feeling okay?

482
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,620
I'm fine. Let me talk to my moms.

483
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,090
Listen, things have been crazy over here.

484
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:01,010
Go-eun announced her engagement to you.

485
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,600
What did you say?

486
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,430
She said there'd be a ceremony as soon as you got back.

487
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,350
Look, just go for it.

488
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,810
Get engaged and marry Go-eun.

489
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:13,560
You can just refuse to take any money from her father.

490
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,080
What?

491
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,170
-Hi. -You're up.

492
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,970
Good news, the nitrogen cleared out with no issues.

493
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,510
You really pulled through.

494
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,930
You got incredibly lucky.

495
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:46,890
Thank you.

496
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:50,600
You can come out once we finish adjusting the pressure.

497
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,520
Hang tight for a bit.

498
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:53,900
Wait.

499
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,360
How's the commander?

500
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:04,990
Chief.

501
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:08,830
Eve's vitals are back to normal too.

502
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:12,160
Mr. Gong's hyperbaric treatment is finished, and there's no tissue damage.

503
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:15,710
I think we can relax now.

504
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,340
Good work, everyone.

505
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,800
I should go lie down in my office.

506
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,590
Hey, you. Outsider.

507
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,140
You really should go now.

508
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,970
They might think you're the boss here.

509
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,100
After I talk to Eve.

510
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,060
You…

511
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,940
Are you…

512
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,860
What, are you jealous? You care more about Eve than I do.

513
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,160
Chief.

514
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:51,370
I just talked to the IOU legal team.

515
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,910
They're having an emergency meeting about yesterday,

516
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,040
and they want you to attend.

517
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,250
What's your question?

518
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,050
Never mind.

519
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,130
-What time? -Now.

520
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,900
Thanks. You should go get some rest.

521
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,030
-Would you like some porridge? -No, thanks.

522
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,240
Where are you going? I'll take you.

523
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:26,740
What's with you?

524
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,370
I'm sorry I left you behind.

525
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:32,450
Don't worry about it.

526
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,540
I'm going to the bathroom.

527
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,840
Right, the bathroom.

528
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,360
Are you feeling all right?

529
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:12,950
Ladies first.

530
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,790
Thought you were really going to die...

531
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:36,140
I know I shouldn't have done that.

532
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:40,600
I'm just a tourist, and I should've known my place.

533
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:44,820
The accident that could've ended with just me dying almost killed two people.

534
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,450
But because there were two of us,

535
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:50,990
we both survived.

536
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:54,950
We astronauts know we could die at any time, and we're prepared for that.

537
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,040
But you're a tourist, a human. We can't let you die out here.

538
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,660
Aren't astronauts humans too?

539
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,670
Aren't all lives equal?

540
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,170
You believe even the life of a fruit fly or a mouse

541
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,380
has value and meaning, right? Was that a lie?

542
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,880
If you had died, it would've been like killing me twice.

543
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,220
I'll never forgive you for that.

544
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,310
I'm sorry, Commander.

545
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,270
I shouldn't have done it, and I feel terrible.

546
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:25,650
It won't happen again. Please forgive me.

547
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:37,080
For the next four days until you go back to Earth,

548
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,040
act as if you're dead, and don't do anything.

549
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,500
Don't touch anything,

550
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,870
and stop all your ongoing projects.

551
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:48,130
Just enjoy your time here quietly until you go back.

552
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,550
And while you do…

553
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,850
Actually, even afterward, stay out of my sight.

554
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,850
I don't even want to see you.

555
00:39:58,930 --> 00:39:59,980
Is that clear?

556
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:01,890
Eve.

557
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,030
Act as if I'm dead and don't do anything? I can't do that. I'm alive.

558
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,660
This place is like a mid-sized apartment.

559
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,950
How do you expect me to stay out of your sight in this cramped space?

560
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,500
It's not like we can go outside. We share a bathroom,

561
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:24,420
and you sleep right across from me. How can I stay out...

562
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,830
I'll sleep somewhere else.

563
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,170
What?

564
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,170
The mission commander wandering around

565
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:34,090
looking for a place to sleep because of some tourist?

566
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,890
That's ridiculous.

567
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:41,140
I'm really sorry about what I did.

568
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,560
I just didn't know any better.

569
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,020
I didn't realize how dangerous it was, all right?

570
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,730
What do I know? I'm just a tourist.

571
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:49,900
You did know better.

572
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:53,990
You knew how dangerous it was, but you jumped out anyway.

573
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,240
That's why I can't forgive you.

574
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,200
Commander, please.

575
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,950
I was being reckless.

576
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:05,210
Sometimes I can be impulsive like that.

577
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,540
Please forgive me.

578
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,340
Commander.

579
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:22,740
Section 3, Clause 4 of the IOU-space tourist agreement.

580
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:26,660
If the tourist causes any issues at the space station

581
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,370
by taking unauthorized dangerous actions,

582
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:32,290
the IOU will enforce disciplinary measures.

583
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,670
You do remember signing that, don't you?

584
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:36,670
I know, okay? I know that.

585
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,470
You can't blame the commander.

586
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,680
I didn't say anything.

587
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,180
I guess you can't do anything now.

588
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,510
Mission control

589
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,810
will also tell you to stop all your projects, keep your head down,

590
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:52,110
and do nothing but exist for the remainder of your stay.

591
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,190
Good for you, huh?

592
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:55,940
You've got nothing to do anyway.

593
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:04,160
Let me clue you in on something.

594
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,750
As of yesterday, the eggs are back in my possession.

595
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,580
I won't give up.

596
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,710
Let me clue you in on something.

597
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,590
I managed to fertilize the eggs from MZ Group yesterday.

598
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:27,020
Six out of seven fertilized.

599
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:28,790
Could you say a few words to Mr. Gong?

600
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:31,540
I miss you.

601
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,290
Stay healthy,

602
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:37,170
and please make it home safe and sound.

603
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,340
MZ ELECTRONICS CEO CHOI GO-EUN ENGAGEMENT ANNOUNCEMENT

604
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:54,230
Hey, can you make sure to take a bunch of pictures?

605
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:56,100
The tear right here on Eve's glove?

606
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,860
Yeah, I'm going to send it over to MCC.

607
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:06,530
Oh, hi, there.

608
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:08,700
Why'd you come all the way here to use this bathroom?

609
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:13,290
Are they seriously being jerks and not letting you use the one over there?

610
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:16,170
That is so petty.

611
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,130
You okay?

612
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:21,840
You look down.

613
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:27,840
Can I sleep in a corner somewhere here?

614
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,680
Although I doubt I'll be able to sleep.

615
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,270
We've got the best remedy for that.

616
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,530
Stairway to Heaven.

617
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:49,240
And he's buying our stairway to heaven.

618
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:50,870
What?

619
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,410
Wait, that's…

620
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:02,710
No, I had it hidden under the veggies.

621
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,470
Damn it, Mina. Sew the ticket into your underwear.

622
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,430
You're making me so anxious.

623
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:09,340
My underwear? Where exactly?

624
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:11,720
Your bra.

625
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,180
Sew it into your bra

626
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,890
before anyone else sees it.

627
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:17,140
You just sleep anywhere without your own CQ.

628
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:22,770
But Dona, the tourist was staring right at the ticket.

629
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,690
Get a hold of yourself.

630
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:30,320
Even if Gong Ryong saw it, how would he know it was a winning ticket?

631
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:32,530
We've got a month.

632
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:34,990
As long as we claim it in time, the money is ours.

633
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:38,670
Why do you keep talking like this is ours when it's not?

634
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:42,920
The person who lost it hasn't bothered with it all year.

635
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,880
That ticket doesn't belong to anyone.

636
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,170
This lottery ticket belongs to whoever wrote Stand by me.

637
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,260
What if they find out about this later?

638
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:55,180
I told you, this is our destiny written by the cosmos!

639
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,320
I don't understand. Why would she punish you

640
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:15,870
when she should've just rewarded you?

641
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:18,040
I mean, you saved her life, for God's sake.

642
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,750
If I were her, I would be bound to you forever!

643
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,710
Rule book this, rule book that.

644
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:26,670
Since when is the manual more important

645
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:28,840
than saving someone's life?

646
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,050
Hey.

647
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:32,260
Hey!

648
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:34,970
Do you know how cool he was out there?

649
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:37,470
-He was awesome. -What's that?

650
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,390
You…

651
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:41,600
were awesome.

652
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:45,020
Yeah, awesome.

653
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:51,740
Look. Isn't it strictly forbidden to bring alcohol up here?

654
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:53,320
What was that?

655
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:55,740
If Eve finds out, we're toast.

656
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:57,040
Oh, this

657
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,200
will never be allowed in here.

658
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,000
But do you know why

659
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:04,130
I risked my career, and thus my life, smuggling it in?

660
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:08,960
To become more humane. To feel.

661
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,510
Don't be so rigid about it. It's so we can moisten our throats.

662
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,140
It's so dreary and dry here.

663
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:20,060
No water, no air, no alcohol.

664
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:22,140
So, no affection.

665
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,230
Right.

666
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:28,860
This is our gift to you.

667
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:32,950
To our hero, Fantasia!

668
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:37,240
From now on, the pack has got your back.

669
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:59,970
You are probably the only,

670
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,810
first and only anthropoids

671
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:03,940
to ever take a shot in here.

672
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,480
But when we get back down…

673
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:18,740
Just make sure to hide it later.

674
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:23,870
Well, you can do this any day on Earth.

675
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,710
That's why I call it heaven. Good night.

676
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:30,290
-Good night. -Night.

677
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:33,670
Okay, then.

678
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,380
I'm going to go check on the mice.

679
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:38,970
You can sleep in the CQ.

680
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:43,060
There's a window in the quarters here.

681
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:46,440
Unlike the ones on the other side.

682
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,860
Just lie down and watch Earth.

683
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:55,030
You'll start to feel totally at ease and drift off to sleep.

684
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:56,950
See you.

685
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:58,570
Good night.

686
00:49:58,660 --> 00:49:59,820
Night.

687
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:05,770
Santi.

688
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,640
Santi!

689
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:22,280
I totally regret coming up here, but…

690
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:24,740
Santi.

691
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:28,410
I'm going to make sure that people like you,

692
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,830
who struggle to have kids, can have them too.

693
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,250
I'm not going back empty-handed.

694
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:37,460
Good night.

695
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:57,440
I saw the lottery ticket.

696
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:01,360
It belongs to Kang Kang-su.

697
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:04,740
Stand by me. I saw it written on one of his photos too.

698
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:06,370
Kang Kang-su?

699
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:14,830
Yeah, I was going to give it back!

700
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,630
What, you think…

701
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:21,720
You think I'm the kind of person who'd steal 500 billion from someone?

702
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:27,470
I've just been keeping it because I didn't know whose it was.

703
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:31,350
Once I find out… I mean, I just did. Yeah, and now that I know,

704
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:34,520
I'm going to give it back to Kang-su!

705
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:38,020
What?

706
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:40,740
Wait, you're going to give it back to him?

707
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:41,860
Yeah!

708
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:45,950
Well…

709
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:50,490
Do you really have to give it back to him?

710
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:52,580
What?

711
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:53,710
Are you insane?

712
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:55,630
Why would you give it back?

713
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:57,590
He's got plenty of money.

714
00:52:57,670 --> 00:53:00,760
He's a trillionaire, okay? Not just a billionaire.

715
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,630
Man, I really don't get it.

716
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,010
He doesn't even care he won. He hasn't even bothered to look for it.

717
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:07,600
Giving him 500 billion

718
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,180
is like pouring a bottle of water into a river.

719
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:16,190
You should keep it.

720
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,980
It's definitely yours, okay?

721
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:20,900
I'll just…

722
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:23,150
pretend I didn't see.

723
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:25,070
But in return,

724
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:28,030
later on, help me just one time, no questions asked.

725
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,790
Then I'll act like I didn't see it, okay?

726
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:34,210
I didn't see anything!

727
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:36,620
I didn't see anything.

728
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:38,830
I know nothing.

729
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,440
Dr. Lee!

730
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,190
Hey, why didn't you go to sleep?

731
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,280
Dr. Lee.

732
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,650
You should go to sleep.

733
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:12,790
I bet you think I don't realize how amazing the work you're doing here is.

734
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:15,710
But I do know, okay?

735
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:18,580
Right.

736
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:21,920
Please,

737
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:24,920
I'm asking you.

738
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:31,140
Please do your best to study Alzheimer's using these mice

739
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:33,890
and make sure you develop a vaccine for it.

740
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:38,690
So that no mother in the world would ever forget where she lives

741
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,480
or stop recognizing her kids.

742
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:45,110
You know how Alzheimer's patients often get Parkinson's and lose muscle?

743
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:46,820
Do something about that too.

744
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,740
Find a way to stop that from happening.

745
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,160
Help everyone who lives to be 100

746
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:57,790
avoid Alzheimer's and be able to keep their nice, juicy muscles.

747
00:54:57,870 --> 00:54:58,710
Just go to sleep.

748
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:11,260
You've got to make it happen, Dr. Lee!

749
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:14,100
I'm counting on you!

750
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:04,020
Damn it.

751
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:07,570
This clumsy body.

752
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,370
I'm not going back empty-handed.

753
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,050
What? What are you doing?

754
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:15,010
Back off!

755
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,320
Have you been drinking?

756
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:33,820
Yeah.

757
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:41,870
Look, what did I do that was so wrong?

758
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:44,210
I honestly don't think I did anything wrong.

759
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:46,580
Even if I could go back, I'd do the same thing.

760
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:49,590
Open up the hatch, jump out like an idiot, and save you.

761
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:51,920
Would I have been rewarded

762
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,470
if I had let you die while decompressing and suiting up?

763
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:56,630
I was groveling earlier, but I take it back.

764
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,930
What I did was good. I did the right thing.

765
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:01,060
Give me a pat and tell me I did the right thing.

766
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:07,390
Come on, just say thank you.

767
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:13,780
I really have no idea

768
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:17,030
how I'm supposed to stay out of your sight.

769
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,540
Where did you get the alcohol?

770
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,220
Is it okay if I like you?

771
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:42,390
No?

772
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:54,400
-You're drunk. -I'm not drunk at all.

773
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:08,580
Is that okay?

774
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:34,900
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

775
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:38,650
You absolutely cannot have feelings for me.

776
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:39,950
This is an order.

777
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:41,910
Am I so unattractive?

778
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:44,700
All seven of them have developed into morulas.

779
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:47,200
Don't do it. Dr. Kang Kang-su can take over.

780
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:53,250
He's letting me have 500 billion. Just imagine what he'll ask for in return!

781
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:55,340
I really hate that you're leaving.

782
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,920
Eve doesn't know much about men.

783
00:59:59,010 --> 01:00:01,760
Men who betray women are absolute trash.

784
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:06,600
Ryong doesn't like you as much as you like him.

785
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:07,890
I…

786
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,310
am not getting engaged to you.

787
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:17,110
