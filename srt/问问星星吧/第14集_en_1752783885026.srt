1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,960
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

2
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,010
We're here to honor the innocent souls.

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,260
All lives, though different in nature, are equal.

4
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,560
While your lives were precious, you faced noble deaths.

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,480
Do not resent the heavens or humanity,

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,860
for your sacrifice aids mankind and protects your own kind.

7
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,490
We pray for your gentle spirits and wish you peace,

8
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,700
hoping you'll find a brighter world and eternal life.

9
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,370
We mourn the invaluable sacrifice of animals in experiments…

10
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,620
MEMORIAL FOR LAB ANIMALS

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,290
…creatures who shared emotions and senses like our own.

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,710
We bow our heads in respect and pray for their eternal rest.

13
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,650
Why did the babies die all of a sudden?

14
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,190
They were probably unstable from the moment of conception.

15
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,990
They were barely hanging on.

16
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,070
It's all because of zero gravity?

17
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,210
If it's this hard for a mouse to be born in space,

18
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,670
is it even possible for a human to be born?

19
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,570
I'm so sorry.

20
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,120
Did the surgery go well?

21
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,620
-Yeah. -Good.

22
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,710
They have a strong maternal instinct. Will she be okay?

23
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,630
It wasn't your fault, okay?

24
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,220
Take tomorrow off. You look exhausted.

25
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,300
Get some rest, okay?

26
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,730
Come on, she's doing fine. Go home.

27
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,680
But…

28
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,100
Just go.

29
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,610
Come on.

30
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,580
Cheer up, okay?

31
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,710
You know I'm your secret admirer, right?

32
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,840
Well, you make me feel pretty lonely these days,

33
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,840
but I've always been on your side,

34
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,890
and I always will be, although it hurts my pride a little.

35
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,010
So keep your head up, okay?

36
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,680
What's wrong? Why do you look so tired?

37
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,890
Were you up all night?

38
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,430
No, that's not it.

39
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,310
Take a look at this.

40
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,400
The door is locked.

41
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,950
Hello?

42
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,750
You're still up?

43
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,870
I can't sleep.

44
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,000
It feels like the night before I went to space.

45
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:27,380
Doesn't it feel like just yesterday that we were getting ready?

46
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,930
To be honest, I was really nervous earlier.

47
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,600
The marriage registration form. I thought you might slap me again.

48
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,890
I'm just happy you didn't.

49
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,150
Oh, right. I have one more gift for you.

50
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,530
But then again, I'm not sure if you'll be happy or want to slap me.

51
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,530
I think you might be happy.

52
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,740
It's hard to tell.

53
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,830
What could it be?

54
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,500
Good night.

55
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,260
I'm leaving in three days.

56
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,430
I know.

57
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,520
Good night.

58
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,100
Good night.

59
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,340
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION FORM

60
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,580
IOU, everything is frozen solid.

61
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,830
It's a mess up here.

62
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,660
Make sure you search every corner of the ILS.

63
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,130
If you see anything out of the ordinary, bag it.

64
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,210
Copy that.

65
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,170
ILS 21:50, SEOUL 06:50

66
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,420
Chief, the IOU sent over the footage from the robot arm first.

67
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,600
Is the investigation over?

68
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,390
Yes, the team has left the station with what they collected.

69
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,690
They'll be arriving around 2 p.m., KST.

70
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,150
It looks like the crew

71
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,650
brought back all the experiment subjects,

72
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,490
but they left behind a lot of their stuff in the chaos.

73
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,910
We got the exterior footage

74
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,410
of the hole in the storage module and the areas that need repair.

75
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,040
Dong-a is set for a spacewalk. Should we show it to him?

76
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,960
Yeah, he'll be the one to repair them.

77
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,580
Should I call the commander too?

78
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,000
No, not Eve. Let her rest today.

79
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,590
By the way, look at that hole.

80
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,340
If it had been any bigger, the whole station would've blown up.

81
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,140
Yeah.

82
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,100
FLAVORS OF THE MOUNTAIN, SEA, AND SKY

83
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,150
Look at that. When did she bring her food?

84
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,660
She didn't even say she was going to see her.

85
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,000
And she gave her so much too. Why would she do that for her?

86
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,000
Geez.

87
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,510
You didn't have to come all the way here

88
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,350
just to return this lunch box. It's nothing special.

89
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,350
Thank you for the food.

90
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,140
I hope you liked it.

91
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,980
You really didn't have to bring this back.

92
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,950
I'd love to have your cooking again.

93
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,610
Again?

94
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,030
Yeah, again.

95
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,870
Why?

96
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,170
It was delicious.

97
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,810
I felt bad

98
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,020
after our conversation that day,

99
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,940
thinking I might've hit a nerve just to ease my own mind.

100
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,780
As for the food, I'd be happy to cook for you.

101
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,130
About that Christmas Eve,

102
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,800
you should just forget about it.

103
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,800
It's okay if you do.

104
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,020
Do you really think so?

105
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,270
Yeah.

106
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,370
I hope you stay healthy.

107
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,680
Take care then, Captain.

108
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,270
Will do.

109
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,230
-Oh, all right. -Bye.

110
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,240
Bye.

111
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,920
2024, SPRING

112
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,590
NATIONAL CENTER FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD

113
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,680
It'll be hard since it's been so long,

114
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,180
but I'll try to find her.

115
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,640
Thanks, I'll wait.

116
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,980
This is your first time back in Korea in 37 years.

117
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,020
If I may ask,

118
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,570
why do you want to find your birth mother?

119
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,780
Well…

120
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,670
I just want to know why she abandoned me.

121
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,670
I wonder

122
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,760
if she's had a good life since then.

123
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,890
If she has,

124
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,100
I want to forgive her.

125
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,820
It's okay to look for her, right?

126
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,960
You and I were the same height and weight before the experiment.

127
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:52,680
But after living in space, you grew 5 cm taller.

128
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,760
Your crow's feet smoothed out,

129
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:55,890
and your telomeres,

130
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,850
which are associated with aging, grew longer in space.

131
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,190
That's why you looked so much younger than me.

132
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,900
But my muscle mass, body weight, and bone density have decreased a lot.

133
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,990
With no gravity, there's nothing to resist against.

134
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,700
I guess bones and muscles are the biggest concerns in space.

135
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,540
Space radiation has also increased your risk of cancer.

136
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,700
The increased blood flow to your eyes

137
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,920
has thickened the retinas, which could lead to vision impairment.

138
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,750
Your thickened carotid arteries raised the risk of heart disease and stroke.

139
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,130
During your time in space, 1, 400 of your genes

140
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,220
showed completely different activity patterns,

141
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,010
but this requires further follow-up.

142
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,260
Your immune responses to DNA damage were different from mine.

143
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,360
This is just a year-long comparison with me.

144
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,110
There's no need to worry.

145
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,990
You won't be staying up there for years and years.

146
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,030
There are still no applicants?

147
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,790
No.

148
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,790
Are you going to continue the twin experiment?

149
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,420
For me, I'll just be doing my job in space as usual,

150
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,260
but it's got to be rough on you.

151
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,170
You can't eat what you want or drink alcohol.

152
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,510
Your life will be restricted like mine.

153
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,140
Yeah, exactly!

154
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,060
Look, down here on Earth, it's not easy living like you.

155
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:27,360
Don't you think I'm turning a little hysterical?

156
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,070
I used to be a sweet girl.

157
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,740
It's your call.

158
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,620
I'll follow your decision.

159
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,120
Hey, did you get

160
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,170
a boyfriend or something?

161
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,710
-Is that the issue? -No.

162
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,680
Dona, listen. Actually...

163
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,760
Hey.

164
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,680
You're not into dating,

165
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:05,270
and absolutely no guy is interested in you either.

166
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,020
But that's not the case with me.

167
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,230
When I go clubbing,

168
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,320
there's always a boatload of guys trying to hit on me.

169
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,780
You know how popular I am, right?

170
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,740
If it weren't for the promotion, I'd just…

171
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:25,460
See? If you guys hadn't let Dr. Kang take the lottery ticket,

172
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,540
I wouldn't be having this problem right now!

173
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,750
Lee Seung-jun, that damn idiot!

174
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,680
What happened to your sister? Where's she at?

175
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,180
Leave her out of this.

176
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:04,870
Hi.

177
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,950
Dr. Kang.

178
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,460
Oh, wait…

179
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,920
We're coming in!

180
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,540
Dr. Kang.

181
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,270
What are you trying to pull?

182
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,520
They tossed it in the storage room.

183
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,060
No one can wear it anyway.

184
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,860
Chief Kang is just trying to punish you.

185
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,110
For what it's worth,

186
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,110
we want you to know that

187
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,410
we really appreciate your effort and sacrifice,

188
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,450
your research, your generosity.

189
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,250
I mean, you even bought that robot arm

190
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,870
without any hesitation.

191
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,250
So, this is for you.

192
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,540
It's the least we can do.

193
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,380
You stole it?

194
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,680
Are you into stealing now?

195
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,640
We've already done it once, so what's one more time?

196
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,100
So what if we get caught?

197
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,310
Well, we probably will.

198
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,610
You caught us too.

199
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
Whatever.

200
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,110
Isn't this the least we can do for our teammate?

201
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:03,910
That's right.

202
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:06,320
Look.

203
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,200
You can hate us all you want to.

204
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:12,620
We won't hold it against you even if you decide to.

205
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,380
You think you can wear me down with this

206
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,630
and make me share the lottery winnings with you?

207
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,300
Not a chance.

208
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,930
-It's all mine. -Of course.

209
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,850
We don't even want to look at the ticket anymore.

210
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,570
09:20 P.M. IOU MISSION CONTROL, HOUSTON, USA

211
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,950
But fortunately, the hole was only 2 cm wide

212
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,160
at the base of the storage module,

213
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,080
so in total, seven solar panels were damaged.

214
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,540
Share all the data with the recovery team in Seoul.

215
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,750
Sir! Take a look at this.

216
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,380
I think this belongs to the Korean tourist.

217
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:17,850
Come in.

218
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,190
What?

219
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,150
Is something wrong?

220
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,990
No, I just wanted to get a checkup from you, Doctor.

221
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,040
It was a long wait without an appointment.

222
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,700
She's your last patient.

223
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,790
Really?

224
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,080
All right, I'll handle it then.

225
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,550
Let's go have lunch.

226
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,670
Let's have tteokbokki.

227
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,920
Come on. I had that yesterday.

228
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:56,390
I just wanted to see you at work.

229
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,850
Well, there's nothing to see. Do you want to have lunch together?

230
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,400
-Let's have dinner later. -No, I can't.

231
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,190
-You have surgery? -Yeah.

232
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,410
Ready to go?

233
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,280
You spend your whole day dealing with women in here, huh?

234
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,710
That's right.

235
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:22,630
By the way, Doctor. How many babies have you delivered so far?

236
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,720
I'd say over a thousand, ma'am.

237
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,800
A thousand?

238
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,720
Hey, I'm curious.

239
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:38,350
What do ob-gyns do when it's their own baby?

240
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,890
Do it themselves?

241
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,110
Some doctors do,

242
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:45,110
while others have someone else deliver the baby

243
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,690
because the stress is too much.

244
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,360
What about you? What would you do?

245
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,320
-Me? -Yeah.

246
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:54,080
If it were my baby…

247
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,250
I couldn't even be in the room.

248
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,160
God, no. I'd be too nervous.

249
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,130
There's no way I'd deliver my own baby.

250
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,090
Really?

251
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,090
Why do you ask?

252
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,140
No reason.

253
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:16,310
I was just curious what ob-gyns do when it's their own baby.

254
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,430
I bet most of them are like me.

255
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:23,860
I see.

256
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,150
So?

257
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,110
Where's the gift?

258
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,570
The gift. Aren't you going to give it to me?

259
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,780
You said it was here, right?

260
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,450
Did you come here for that?

261
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,200
I wanted to make sure I got it.

262
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,910
My gosh.

263
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,420
Where is it?

264
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,250
Geez.

265
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,550
I think I might get slapped again.

266
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,510
Come on, I slapped you before

267
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:54,680
because you totally deserved it, Mr. Tourist.

268
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,930
I don't know. Maybe you'll like it.

269
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,600
You're killing me. What on earth is it?

270
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,980
I'm curious. What is it?

271
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,350
Huh?

272
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,520
Give me some more time to think.

273
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,270
Why are you tiptoeing around it? What's the big deal?

274
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,320
There's a good reason for it.

275
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,200
Are you going to give it to me or not?

276
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,780
What's it going to be, huh?

277
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,830
Forget it. Just keep it for now.

278
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,580
You can give it to me when I'm back next year.

279
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,500
You'd better, okay? Coward.

280
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,670
All right, I'll give it to you.

281
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,630
Hang on.

282
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,090
Here.

283
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,800
What's this?

284
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,930
Obstetrics?

285
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,850
Take this with you.

286
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,520
I know how tough and lonely it can get being in space for a year.

287
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,020
I've been there myself.

288
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,980
Use this when you feel like giving up,

289
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,490
when you're scared, exhausted, or in pain,

290
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:56,200
or when your crew is giving you trouble and not listening.

291
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,950
Open this in those moments.

292
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:02,450
An obstetrics book? What am I supposed to do with it?

293
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,830
Smack them with it?

294
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,830
Well, you could. You're good at that.

295
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:10,800
It's way too heavy.

296
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,090
This is… No, it's too heavy.

297
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,420
Come on. Open it.

298
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,310
It must be more complicated than mouse breeding.

299
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,990
Well, I…

300
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,280
I thought it'd be nice to share it…

301
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,960
with your crew when things get rough.

302
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:51,790
Look, even just one drop of this was a huge help for me.

303
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,670
Yeah, this calls for a good slap.

304
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:59,680
Isn't it okay for five people to share this one bottle

305
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,220
over the course of a year?

306
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,520
I got excited for nothing.

307
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,230
Forget it.

308
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,400
Fine.

309
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:20,360
I get it. I guess this was a bad idea after all.

310
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,740
It was inappropriate.

311
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:26,120
I was clearly wrong. It was inappropriate.

312
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,910
Let's go eat now. I'm hungry.

313
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,080
Aren't you hungry? Let's go.

314
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,460
Well, this blows.

315
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,420
-Come on. -At least buy me a nice lunch.

316
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,590
Sure.

317
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,300
Sure.

318
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,340
Let's go have something good.

319
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:44,430
We're having this since we don't have time,

320
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,890
but I'll treat you

321
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:48,890
to the best food in Seoul tomorrow and the day after, okay?

322
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,780
-Why did you bring that here? -What?

323
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,780
That.

324
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:05,990
Oh, I'm going to put it in my car.

325
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,410
I don't want people to see it.

326
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:10,080
So you know it looks bad?

327
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,250
Of course I do.

328
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,760
By the way, did you do it?

329
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:25,850
Do what?

330
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,520
You know what.

331
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,530
You don't need to know.

332
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,280
You shouldn't know.

333
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,410
I'm not an idiot.

334
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,370
Just pretend like you don't know.

335
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,960
Like you don't know anything.

336
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,580
I did the ICSI behind your back

337
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,420
and brought the morula here in secret.

338
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,090
You've never even seen it.

339
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,470
Those are the facts.

340
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,300
Let's pretend you've never even heard of it.

341
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,980
How did you do the ICSI by yourself?

342
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,230
It's impossible to do it alone without a microscope.

343
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,150
Did Kang-su help you?

344
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,740
Did he help you do it?

345
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:28,620
No.

346
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,290
It was on the ninth day

347
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,830
that you told me you had a morula in your pocket.

348
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,920
Since it takes three days for a morula to develop,

349
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,670
that means you must've done it on the sixth day or earlier.

350
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:44,510
There's only one night I'm suspicious of.

351
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:48,260
The night when Mina, Seung-jun, and Santi

352
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,430
were all in the airlock.

353
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:53,770
Was it that night?

354
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:00,020
Look, the three of them just...

355
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,070
Just what?

356
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,530
Don't blame them.

357
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,840
They helped you.

358
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,880
If I hadn't locked the microscope away,

359
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,680
you wouldn't have had to…

360
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,770
It's my fault. It's all on me.

361
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:34,890
I'm sorry.

362
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:37,850
So when is it?

363
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,530
When is it?

364
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,490
Tonight.

365
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:00,250
As the commander, I'm not sure if I should let this happen.

366
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,470
Do you really want to do this?

367
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,180
I do.

368
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,570
Eve.

369
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,160
Just forget about it all.

370
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,470
Good luck, then.

371
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,470
I'll see you later.

372
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,000
Tonight.

373
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,290
Do you really want to do this?

374
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,300
I do.

375
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,550
Eve.

376
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,430
Just forget about it all.

377
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:12,050
Where are you? Come to my office now.

378
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,220
Chief.

379
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,060
It's from the IOU.

380
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,440
The truth is,

381
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,860
I came here to create embryos using the MZ Group heir's sperm

382
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,820
and his wife's eggs.

383
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,330
This was around the time

384
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:43,000
he and Eve were left alone, waiting for the rescue ship.

385
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:48,290
One space tourist is about to ruin everything the KSA has accomplished.

386
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,500
It says Eve didn't know.

387
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,460
I'm sure she wasn't involved.

388
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,260
What if she saw this note?

389
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,930
What if she chose not to report this to me or the IOU?

390
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:03,020
If she knew and still helped him bring the embryo here,

391
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,230
she's an accomplice.

392
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:07,480
Hang on. Are you sure he brought it down to Earth?

393
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,230
The incubator was empty.

394
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,650
They found nothing in the observation module.

395
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,190
They suspect he brought it here.

396
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:20,660
If he implants the illegally created embryo in Seoul,

397
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,450
the KSA will have to take full responsibility.

398
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:26,170
We need to seize it and punish him before that happens.

399
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,710
-I'll talk to Eve. -No.

400
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:31,380
You go get the tourist. I'll handle Eve.

401
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:34,760
Now!

402
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,850
Where's Mr. Gong Ryong now?

403
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:43,770
We're getting GPS signals from Mr. Gong Ryong's cell phone

404
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,810
at the MZ Medical Center.

405
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,400
But are we even allowed to track his location like this?

406
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,310
-What if...-I'll take care of it.

407
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,980
We don't have time. Just get him here before this gets out.

408
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,150
Get the unauthorized embryo too.

409
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,650
It needs to be investigated,

410
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,820
so bring it back exactly as you found it.

411
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,280
Oh, man.

412
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,800
We'll take a family photo together in nine months, okay?

413
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,550
My grandkid better have two eyes, a nose, a mouth,

414
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,970
arms, legs, ears, nostrils,

415
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,760
ten fingers, and ten toes.

416
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,890
You'll make sure of that, right?

417
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:24,930
We'll take a happy family photo

418
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,640
with me holding my grandkid, okay?

419
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,480
I'll do my best, sir.

420
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,190
Keep the room secure so Ryong won't be disturbed.

421
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,400
Yes, sir. Don't worry.

422
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,110
Shall we?

423
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:50,080
We've destroyed the portable freezer and the satellite.

424
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,260
-You're coming? -I know the hospital inside out.

425
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,990
PEDIATRICIAN NA MIN-JEONG

426
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,870
Dr. Na, are you ready?

427
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:29,960
Yes, Dr. Gong.

428
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,960
Please wait in the recovery room.

429
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,040
I'll call you when everything's ready.

430
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,130
Okay.

431
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:55,190
Just the tourist and the commander?

432
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:57,570
Check all the footage. Look for anything suspicious.

433
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,660
EVE

434
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,920
-Hello? -Eve.

435
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,090
I need you at the MCC right now.

436
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,920
What's going on?

437
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,300
I have some questions.

438
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,470
Yeah, all right.

439
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:46,410
Get the other astronauts in here too, but don't say anything.

440
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,200
Okay.

441
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,040
-That car. -What?

442
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,380
It's Mr. Gong's car. I saw it the other day.

443
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,480
EVE

444
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,630
GONG RYONG

445
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,640
EVE

446
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,320
Hi.

447
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,530
The Korea Space Agency MCC, please.

448
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,410
How are things progressing?

449
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,920
Well, Dr. Gong went into the operating room a little while ago.

450
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,380
Should I ask for an update?

451
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,460
Don't bother.

452
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,960
I'll go check on them myself.

453
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,680
All right.

454
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,970
Mr. Gong Ryong is in the restricted area on the first floor, west wing.

455
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,140
What's over there?

456
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,480
The operating rooms for VIP patients.

457
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,310
So he's doing one of two things.

458
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,770
Delivering a VIP's baby…

459
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,450
Or implanting Na Min-jeong's morula.

460
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,860
Who are you people?

461
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,360
We're from the space agency.

462
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,610
You can't come in here!

463
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:28,690
Please leave.

464
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,280
Did you know Dr. Gong conducted an illegal experiment

465
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,410
with your son's sperm and his wife's eggs in space?

466
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,830
All of you. Get out of here now!

467
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,620
It's that room on the left over there!

468
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,670
-It's an operating room. -Please cooperate.

469
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,420
What? Are you threatening me right now?

470
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,840
Space agency? I don't give a damn! Get out!

471
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,430
They're about to implant it! If they do, it's over!

472
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:56,430
-It won't even take five minutes! -Hurry!

473
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,520
-We have to stop them! -Get out!

474
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,190
Are you ready?

475
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,650
Ryong, they caught us!

476
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,570
-Get out of the way! -Move!

477
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,070
Hey!

478
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:17,530
There's no time. Hurry!

479
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,700
Wait, you can't lock the door?

480
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,660
No, you can't lock an operating room.

481
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,000
What do we do?

482
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,420
Get the morula first!

483
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,470
No! Be careful, okay?

484
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,390
If you drop it, the morula will be lost.

485
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,930
It'll die if you tip it over!

486
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:39,890
Take it from him!

487
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,810
All right, I'm taking this with me!

488
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,850
Don't touch me.

489
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,190
Why are you doing this? Please give it back.

490
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,270
Mr. Gong Ryong.

491
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,360
I CAME HERE TO CREATE EMBRYOS…

492
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,200
Have you seen this note?

493
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,780
Did you help keep it alive?

494
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,290
Did you help him?

495
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:08,590
That morula died.

496
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:13,090
This is the one I made after coming back to Earth.

497
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,840
I did the IVF here on Earth,

498
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:18,140
so what's the issue?

499
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,260
Look.

500
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:22,020
That's my son and his wife's baby.

501
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,930
It's more precious to me than my own life!

502
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,940
My son died young, and that's the last of his bloodline!

503
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,070
Everyone, get out of the way.

504
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:33,690
If you touch me, I'll take it as an admission of your crime.

505
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,280
If you come any closer,

506
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,740
I'll drop this, and it's over.

507
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:39,530
Now, move!

508
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,410
Please step aside, Father.

509
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,710
Mr. Gong Ryong.

510
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:55,170
We're taking you in for violating space experiment ethics regulations.

511
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,800
You can make your statement at the MCC. Let's go.

512
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,930
Shall I get an incubator?

513
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,600
The chief wants it undamaged.

514
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,390
There's a portable incubator in the next room.

515
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,020
Please. Please put it in the incubator, okay?

516
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,900
Bring it to my car.

517
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,110
-What do we do, Dr. Gong? -Min-jeong…

518
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,900
What do we do?

519
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,880
GONG RYONG

520
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,180
Is the morula okay?

521
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,930
This is yours, isn't it?

522
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:52,730
It's just like Santi's sperm, which I've seen a million times.

523
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,030
I can tell.

524
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,900
You could never fertilize an egg with this sperm on Earth.

525
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:07,160
All 16 blastomeres are perfectly intact.

526
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,620
This is why he went to space.

527
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,420
He made this on the space station.

528
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,590
Man, I can't believe this.

529
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:16,250
That bastard's got some nerve.

530
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,510
What do we do, Chief?

531
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:20,010
What… What are we going to do now?

532
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:23,010
He managed to bring it down to Earth without a scratch.

533
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:25,850
What happens now?

534
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:33,860
But listen, I went through all the CCTV footage.

535
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:36,570
On the fifth day in the main module,

536
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:39,740
Eve took the ICSI microscope apart and locked it in the rack.

537
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:43,160
The tourist argued with her and tried really hard to stop her.

538
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,830
He clearly needed the microscope up until then,

539
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:47,990
which means he still hadn't done the ICSI.

540
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:52,580
But after that, no one took it out of the rack.

541
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:53,830
Yeah, she's right.

542
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I saw that too.

543
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:59,380
Then how the hell did he do it?

544
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:03,260
Without the microscope, there's no way he could've done it alone.

545
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:18,320
Hey, why didn't you report it?

546
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,530
Why did you leave it out of the report

547
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:23,410
and hide it when you knew everything?

548
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,780
I wanted to let him do it.

549
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:28,990
Are you insane?

550
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,500
I wanted it to survive.

551
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,120
Why? What's the reason?

552
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:37,920
Because you have feelings for him?

553
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,510
Is he here too?

554
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:40,860
So did you open the rack for him without getting caught on CCTV or what?

555
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:43,280
He needed the microscope, right?

556
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:45,400
Did you give it to him?

557
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,120
The commander doesn't know.

558
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:56,000
The CCTV cuts out when the station passes through the radio shadow zone.

559
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:58,420
That's when I did it.

560
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:02,550
In the middle of the night the next day, when everyone was asleep,

561
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:05,130
I stole the keys from her pocket,

562
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:08,300
took out the pipette holders,

563
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,720
connected them to the microscope, and did the ICSI.

564
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,730
Eve never saw the note, right?

565
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,810
Are you sure about that?

566
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:21,560
If she had, the morula and I wouldn't be alive now.

567
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:24,570
She wouldn't have let it slide.

568
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,910
You all saw what happened when Kang-su tried it.

569
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:35,660
She doesn't know anything.

570
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,670
Not what I did, how I brought it here,

571
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,170
or what I was planning to do.

572
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:43,380
She's…

573
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,210
She's just clueless.

574
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,930
If you showed her the note,

575
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,590
I'm going to kill you today.

576
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:55,680
You had the nerve to say you like her after what you did?

577
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:03,820
The MZ Group chairman doesn't know either.

578
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:06,860
I wanted to marry his daughter,

579
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,700
so I did it in secret in space.

580
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:12,120
When I came back, I told him I made it work here on Earth.

581
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,160
I wanted to marry into his family.

582
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,950
That's the reason.

583
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,540
That's why I did it all by myself without telling anyone.

584
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,340
That's right.

585
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:33,260
The sperm could only be straightened out in space.

586
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,310
I…

587
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,770
did fertilize it in zero gravity.

588
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:49,280
Please give it back.

589
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,070
I'm begging you.

590
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:57,370
Please give it back.

591
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:59,080
I wanted to give it a chance.

592
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,910
It would've been too cruel to take that away from it too.

593
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,460
To you,

594
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:07,460
it's just 16 cells created in an illegal experiment,

595
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:10,300
but to those who see it as their last hope,

596
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,300
it's a living being.

597
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,180
It's a human life.

598
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:16,640
So I'm begging you.

599
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,680
Please. Please give it back.

600
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:21,640
Its mother is waiting.

601
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:23,020
Shut it!

602
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,150
Please give it back.

603
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:28,320
Look, if you just give it back,

604
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,570
I…

605
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,490
I'll accept any punishment you decide to give me.

606
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:38,950
I'm begging you.

607
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,080
Please.

608
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:47,880
Please give it back to me.

609
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,590
This isn't just the tourist's mess now. You're in it too.

610
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,510
I don't buy everything he says.

611
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:59,260
Do you even realize what you've done to the KSA?

612
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:03,690
The IOU won't just come after you. They'll grill the entire crew.

613
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:07,150
I even have doubts about the ones Kang made, which are supposedly destroyed.

614
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:09,900
So spill everything you know.

615
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:15,070
I already got Santi, Mina, and Seung-jun to come in.

616
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:18,030
Did the three of them help him?

617
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:24,290
No, right?

618
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,790
If they knew about this,

619
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,630
we're really done for!

620
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,760
You idiots!

621
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:48,860
Did the tourist bribe them into helping him?

622
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:54,030
If all the members of Expedition 3 knew about it…

623
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,320
If they helped him…

624
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,660
I deserve to be fired a hundred times over.

625
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:04,750
This is a huge disgrace to the Korea Space Agency!

626
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,960
If it gets out that we have a morula that was created in space,

627
00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:11,840
the other member countries will go nuts.

628
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,170
They'll demand to do all the banned experiments

629
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:15,880
they weren't allowed to,

630
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:18,840
and we'll be held responsible for it.

631
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:22,180
We'll lose our membership in the IOU, which we fought so hard to secure.

632
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:25,060
All our ongoing projects will be put to a stop,

633
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:28,230
and we'll lose the Maru, which we've poured trillions of won into!

634
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:30,810
The Korea Space Agency will be torn apart!

635
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,230
We'll all be dismissed and banished.

636
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:39,570
We won't be able to do anything related to space ever again!

637
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:53,460
Think about what the IOU wanted to achieve with Santi's sperm.

638
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:57,470
We could explain that the sperm of MZ Group's heir was also misshapen

639
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:01,300
and try to convince them that it's a scientific achievement

640
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:03,260
for solving infertility, Chief.

641
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:05,430
You want to try to have this illegal experiment

642
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,350
recognized as a scientific achievement?

643
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:10,600
You want to gamble the future of the Korea Space Agency

644
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:12,690
on a morula that may or may not become a life?

645
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:14,940
It could be an opportunity for both, Chief.

646
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:16,320
The tourist

647
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,030
performed the ICSI,

648
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,910
smuggled the embryo into Earth,

649
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:23,320
and attempted to implant it.

650
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:26,040
He could face penalties in the hundreds of billions for that alone.

651
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,870
Add the bribery of the astronauts, including the commander,

652
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,580
and the charges become more serious.

653
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:36,000
He'll lose his medical license and face criminal charges.

654
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:37,590
He'll end up in prison!

655
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:43,180
Do you still want to hand over the embryo to the MZ Medical Center?

656
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:50,890
Fine.

657
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:54,810
If you really can't give it up, go ahead and gamble.

658
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,320
Your colleagues, your beloved tourist, and the KSA.

659
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:02,530
If you decide to risk it all as the commander,

660
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,950
I'll do as you say.

661
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,330
What's it going to be?

662
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,630
What should I tell the IOU?

663
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:22,430
Tell me.

664
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,340
Say something!

665
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:46,700
When Dr. Kang did the same thing,

666
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:49,120
Santi was deeply hurt.

667
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,870
Mina and Seung-jun too.

668
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:53,330
The three of them were way more upset than I was.

669
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:57,840
There's no way they helped the tourist.

670
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:01,260
As the commander, I'll handle this.

671
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:03,170
How?

672
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:10,680
Just give me five minutes.

673
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,810
Five minutes with Mr. Gong.

674
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:30,740
Commander.

675
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:34,620
Commander.

676
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:37,040
You'll give it back, right?

677
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:50,100
You haven't changed your mind, right?

678
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:51,930
We felt the same way about it.

679
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:54,060
You…

680
00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:58,400
haven't changed your mind, right?

681
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:01,940
The truth is,

682
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,650
I came here to create embryos using the MZ Group heir's sperm

683
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,160
and his wife's eggs.

684
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:25,800
You're just a tourist.

685
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:30,720
I'm the commander who needs to protect the space station and the space agency.

686
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:34,640
I managed to fertilize an egg.

687
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,890
In my pocket outside

688
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:41,980
is an embryo with 16 cells.

689
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:44,730
A living being.

690
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:55,830
As per space experiment ethics regulations,

691
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:58,870
I'm discarding it.

692
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,170
Don't forgive me.

693
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:19,730
No.

694
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:27,740
Eve!

695
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,490
Don't do it.

696
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:32,530
Don't do it, Eve!

697
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,870
I hope it's born healthy.

698
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:41,540
Don't do it, please!

699
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:46,460
Eve.

700
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:48,050
Don't give up.

701
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,850
Don't do it.

702
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:01,060
Don't do it!

703
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,230
Don't.

704
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:06,730
Don't do it.

705
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:34,010
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

706
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:35,930
I'm sorry.

707
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:37,050
You're sorry?

708
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:39,720
The other members don't know anything, Chief.

709
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:42,100
You're going to pin all the blame on Mr. Gong?

710
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:43,560
So it's just Ryong who's screwed.

711
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:45,400
Go-eun.

712
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,110
Don't do anything for me.

713
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:50,150
I don't deserve anything from you.

714
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:52,110
The defendant, Gong Ryong,

715
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:54,450
is sentenced to two years in prison.

716
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:56,240
They already cut you loose.

717
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,280
It's over.

718
00:56:58,370 --> 00:56:59,370
STRANDED ASTRONAUTS RETURN…

719
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:00,490
Please dismiss me

720
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,040
