1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,960
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

2
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,090
Guess which creatures currently dominate the population on the space station.

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,390
Topping the list are 30, 000 fruit flies,

4
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,560
with 80 mice coming in second.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,690
The real owners of the space station, which can house up to nine astronauts,

6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,110
may be fruit flies and mice.

7
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,650
Since humans and mice share 85 percent of their genes,

8
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,400
studying mice in zero gravity

9
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,660
provides a glimpse into how humans might adapt to space.

10
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,660
Most of human gene functions have been discovered through studies on fruit flies.

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,750
As you can see, the reality of the space station is quite different

12
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,500
from what we might imagine.

13
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,920
Let's hear more from Chief Kang Tae-hui at the Seoul Mission Control Center.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,960
The space station's zero-gravity environment

15
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,260
enables experiments that can't be conducted under Earth's gravity.

16
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,260
The space station's true purpose is

17
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,010
to study how the human cardiovascular, musculoskeletal,

18
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,180
neuroendocrine, and immune systems are affected in space,

19
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,600
using fruit flies and mice for testing.

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,650
The Expedition 3 team, which recently embarked on their space mission,

21
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,980
is ready to break new ground once again.

22
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:16,700
Here's an interview with Commander Eve Kim of Expedition 3.

23
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,950
Our mission is to attempt mating, pregnancy, and breeding in mice again.

24
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,080
Fruit flies, minnows, and cockroaches

25
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,250
are the only species to have successfully reproduced in space.

26
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,330
Mice, like us humans…

27
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,830
Sir, they'll be docking soon.

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,670
…have never mated,

29
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,710
become pregnant, or given birth in space.

30
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,130
For humans to sustain life

31
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,720
and reproduce in space, mice must first succeed in breeding.

32
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,300
Now, what's the mission of the space tourist

33
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,180
who paid a whopping 70 billion won to join them?

34
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,110
G.O-10, approximately 400 meters until rendezvous.

35
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,190
Copy.

36
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,280
Copy.

37
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,860
Initiating the fly-around.

38
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,290
Onboard navigation is working fine.

39
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,790
Standing by for contingency manual docking. Over.

40
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,540
Copy that.

41
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,740
Rotation is nominal.

42
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,000
Engine operation, normal.

43
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,710
150 meters to the ILS.

44
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,000
Changing direction from the Kurs antenna to the docking point.

45
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,960
G.O-10 approaching the ILS.

46
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,510
Stand by for contact.

47
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,550
All right, we're about to dock now.

48
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,390
-Engage your core, sir. -Okay.

49
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,130
Checking the crosshair alignment.

50
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,980
Contact?

51
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,110
Crosshairs are not aligned.

52
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,690
Oh, man.

53
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,200
Stand by for manual docking.

54
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,550
Come on, man.

55
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,670
Contact?

56
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,010
G.O-10 retrying for the alignment.

57
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,350
Five feet.

58
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,640
Three.

59
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,020
Two.

60
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,100
One.

61
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,730
Target in the center.

62
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,060
Here we go, G.O-10. Yeah.

63
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,610
Good boy.

64
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,620
This is IOU. Contact and capture confirmed.

65
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,170
Docking…

66
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,830
complete.

67
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:08,340
Contact and capture confirmed at 16:20 central time, 17:20 eastern time.

68
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,310
Two vehicles are flying high above the Pacific Ocean,

69
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,890
just to the west of Peru.

70
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,930
They have finally docked successfully.

71
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,770
It's on.

72
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,770
It's on! The doping was successful!

73
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,520
It's docking,  okay?

74
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,570
Oh, thank God in heaven.

75
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,240
Victory!

76
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,660
Leak test, complete.

77
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,460
Both docking area completely sealed.

78
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,590
Perfect!

79
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,220
Nice.

80
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,220
Docking area sealed, okay?

81
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,730
Station IOU and Spaceship G.O-10,

82
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,690
you have a go for Step 6.

83
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,240
Ingressing ILS.

84
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,120
Finally, the space station.

85
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,330
Commander, I'm nervous.

86
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,670
I told them several times to make it longer!

87
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,000
It gets tight in my crotch in zero gravity.

88
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,290
I grow taller here.

89
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,220
-You haven't knocked yet, have you? -Not yet.

90
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,800
All right. We'll knock on our side first,

91
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,680
and if we hear them knock back, it means the docking was successful.

92
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,600
Santi, lead the way.

93
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,970
No, you got it.

94
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,390
We don't have all day, Commander.

95
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,810
EVE: COMMANDER OF EXPEDITION 3

96
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,730
Okay.

97
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,900
When they open the hatch and enter, it'll be broadcast live worldwide.

98
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,900
Let's make sure not to touch this part.

99
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,070
Okay.

100
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,620
Our voices won't be broadcast to Earth, right?

101
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,700
Will they?

102
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,780
Ready?

103
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,280
Wait.

104
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,910
-What is it? -Hang on.

105
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,700
Me too.

106
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,830
What's that?

107
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,250
I know better than to show up empty-handed

108
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,750
when I'm invited to someone's house.

109
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,680
What on earth is it?

110
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,050
It's a housewarming gift.

111
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,430
Let's open her up, Commander.

112
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,520
Ready?

113
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,240
What's up?

114
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,570
We are not the only ones here.

115
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,870
What?

116
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,000
When did these guys get on?

117
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,920
Did a couple of fruit flies sneak on board and travel here from Earth?

118
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,550
Can you believe these guys?

119
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,380
I paid 70 billion, and they got a free ride?

120
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,890
Hey, how much did you guys pay?

121
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,730
No! Stop it.

122
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,900
It's a miracle they're here. Don't kill them.

123
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,030
No, don't.

124
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,160
You can't just sneeze them out.

125
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,620
Use your words, will you?

126
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,330
They can't understand me.

127
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,380
Did you just hit me

128
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,500
to get back at me for stitching up your toes without anesthesia?

129
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,090
Shush.

130
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,850
They're not some test subjects that were pumped full of drugs to get here.

131
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,470
They're the first living creatures to come to space

132
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,430
on their own, sitting on a banana.

133
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,650
Santi, go buy some time. Go!

134
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,190
-Eve. -Go!

135
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,830
What's the holdup?

136
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,340
What's going on?

137
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,000
Why aren't they opening it?

138
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,380
What are they doing?

139
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,140
Hey, where are you going?

140
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,940
The male was chasing the female, and now he's finally sitting down

141
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,860
and licking her butthole.

142
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,400
They're about to mate.

143
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,450
What's the big deal about a stupid fruit fly chasing after a female

144
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,780
and leaking her butthole?

145
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,240
You slapped me for that?

146
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:28,960
Don't you see? These guys are doing something even humans can't do.

147
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,040
They're creating life in space, which is incredible.

148
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,050
Look at that.

149
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,590
The male is flapping his wings…

150
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,590
Oh, my God. Do you see how he's making noise with his wings?

151
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,810
He's trying to impress the female with everything he's got.

152
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,890
Gosh, it's so noisy…

153
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,390
I've got to observe this. Wait.

154
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,480
Don't touch them, okay?

155
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,270
Touch them? I'm not doing anything.

156
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,030
Hold on a minute, guys.

157
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,070
Look.

158
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,530
The male is holding the female with his front legs

159
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,500
and bending his abdomen like this. Can you see it?

160
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,000
You have to see this. Come on!

161
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,580
Wow, come look!

162
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,800
Oh, my goodness. Look at that.

163
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
Oh, gosh.

164
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,640
Hold it like this, Dr. Gong.

165
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,640
You see it, right? Can you see it?

166
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,560
-Oh, I can see it. -Right?

167
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,230
That's risqué.

168
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,650
All right, okay.

169
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,190
-They only need 20 minutes. -What? 20 minutes?

170
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,780
They last longer than humans.

171
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,160
Quiet.

172
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,370
Wait, fruit flies can keep going for 20 minutes?

173
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,120
On Earth, they risk getting eaten by dragonflies

174
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,960
and still manage to go for 20 minutes.

175
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,170
They literally put their lives on the line.

176
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,670
And look where we are now. We're in space.

177
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,510
They're doing it in space, all right?

178
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,590
This is

179
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,050
an incredible moment where they're creating life.

180
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,930
They're doing something that mice,

181
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,390
which represent all mammals, have never succeeded at

182
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,140
in zero gravity, let alone humans.

183
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,940
We have to wait for them to finish.

184
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,610
We absolutely do.

185
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,490
Eve.

186
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,910
-Yeah? -Let me get this straight.

187
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,450
So you want to make everyone on Earth

188
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:31,830
wait 20 minutes for these fruit flies? Is that it?

189
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,540
You're just…

190
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:43,670
You're really enjoying this.

191
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,630
Just look.

192
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:48,850
They're going at it.

193
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,970
You got this!

194
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,140
That's it!

195
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,860
EXPEDITION 3 DOCKED

196
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:10,410
It seems the hatch hasn't opened yet.

197
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,620
As soon as it does, we'll connect with the Mission Control Center

198
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,580
and bring you the live feed.

199
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,880
We at MZ Group, a leading global enterprise

200
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,340
that delivers new value with cutting-edge technology,

201
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,880
carried out the 2023-MS-01 Project through our MZ Central Research Center,

202
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,550
which is equipped with proprietary technological expertise.

203
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,430
Let me start by briefly explaining the products.

204
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,770
What the heck is taking so long?

205
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,100
Right. I'll make it quick, sir.

206
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,150
The first one is a cooler.

207
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,730
It weighs 950 g and is made with…

208
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,980
-…the third to enter. -What's taking so long?

209
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,490
-Once he does… -He's in space.

210
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,110
…he will have the honor of becoming the 458th visitor.

211
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,070
Fruit flies?

212
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,280
What in the hell…

213
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,790
They're not even official test subjects

214
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,920
but just some stupid flies that hitched a ride. Are you telling us

215
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,880
to delay the docking and wait for them to finish their business?

216
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,630
Are you insane? This is a big moment.

217
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,760
Tell her to open the hatch right now.

218
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,470
With all due respect,

219
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:15,020
they are doing it on the knob

220
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,060
right now, so opening the hatch would effectively

221
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,270
kill the mood.

222
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,900
So, I mean, we could not do it,

223
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,030
and maybe they would run into a wall or we would step on one of them…

224
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,410
But this is a pleasant surprise, so…

225
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,830
I guess all she needs is 20 minutes.

226
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,120
You think this is funny?

227
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,290
Eve, that goofball. Just when you think she's doing great,

228
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,540
she pulls this crap.

229
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,800
She's got a knack for driving you up the wall.

230
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,760
Come on, the flies are making love.

231
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,010
Why are you here? Go start your new, better-paying job.

232
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,300
Get out!

233
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,720
Listen, make sure no one talks about the fruit flies on air.

234
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,730
How about they open it from the other side?

235
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,110
No, right? That's never happened.

236
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,950
What's going on?

237
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,950
Should we just open it?

238
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:17,200
I don't think it's ever been opened from this side before.

239
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,020
I thought you were the type to never break the rules.

240
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,070
In space, there's no rule

241
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,990
more important than protecting and creating life.

242
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:55,120
Even though they only live for 50 days, fruit flies are no exception.

243
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,840
-Eve. -Call me commander.

244
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,000
Why?

245
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,880
I like your name. It reminds me of Christmas Eve.

246
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,760
I hate Christmas Eve more than anything.

247
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:21,770
Commander.

248
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,770
Let's give these guys some names.

249
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,730
This is a remarkable twist of fate.

250
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:29,570
They risked their lives to come all the way to space with us.

251
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,780
For the male, how about…

252
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,570
Public?

253
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,200
-What? -And for the female…

254
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,620
Indecency.

255
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,500
-Are you joking? -I'm not joking.

256
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,170
Public and Indecency. I think they're the perfect names.

257
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,380
Forget it.

258
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,340
Public and Indecency. I like it.

259
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,960
That's not what they were doing.

260
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,380
That's exactly what it was.

261
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:58,090
-Sir. -For God's sake, stop calling me sir.

262
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,260
I hate that.

263
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,020
Don't you think you're too fixated on those flies?

264
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,390
That slap across my face was a clear sign.

265
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,770
Nothing better comes to mind?

266
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,690
It's settled then. They're Public and Indecency.

267
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,690
They're not your pet flies, sir.

268
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:16,780
Eve.

269
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,910
-Eve? -Call me commander.

270
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,910
You're awesome.

271
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,830
Call me commander.

272
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,830
Eve.

273
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,500
Eve.

274
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,260
MCC, it is taking a little longer

275
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,260
than anticipated to seal the deal.

276
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,680
The large MZ Confectionery logo adds promotional potential as well.

277
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,100
Why won't they go into the space station?

278
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,020
What if the ice cream melts?

279
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,190
Won't it be game over?

280
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,940
Yes, it's all over if it melts.

281
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,780
Is there something wrong?

282
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,740
What if Ryong was scorched by that lightning from earlier?

283
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,280
Come on, don't say that.

284
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,780
It's not easy to get hit by lightning.

285
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,240
Our team is coordinating with the control center

286
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,540
to check if there are any issues.

287
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,460
We'll update you as soon as

288
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,080
-we have more information. -Na-mi.

289
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,500
Our son can't marry the heiress unless he risks his life in space, right?

290
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,840
Otherwise the chairman won't approve?

291
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,550
Come on, Ryong said that wasn't true.

292
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,050
Of course it's true.

293
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,890
The chairman still hasn't given his blessing because of us.

294
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,930
His three moms work at a bar.

295
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,770
Would you like that if you were the chairman?

296
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:30,940
-We've just been informed… -Ryong is coming out.

297
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,650
-Oh, he's coming out! -…the hatch is about to open.

298
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:36,150
-He's coming out! -We'll switch to the live feed.

299
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,860
All right, everyone. The hatch will now open.

300
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
HATCH OPENING LIVE

301
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,280
Here they come.

302
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,450
This is Mission Control, IOU.

303
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:49,960
Official hatch opening time for G.O-10 spacecraft, 22:35 UTC.

304
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,370
Mina!

305
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,340
-We've been eagerly waiting for you guys! -Come on.

306
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,840
Let's go.

307
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,800
Commander.

308
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,430
Do you like babies?

309
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,390
Babies. Do you like them?

310
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,810
Who doesn't like babies?

311
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:12,980
All right, then.

312
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,650
Hola, buenos días. Hello.

313
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,520
Hi to everyone.

314
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,280
Ho, ho, ho. Santa Claus came early this year.

315
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,400
Got you guys a special delivery.

316
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,320
A little something, something.

317
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,410
Ta-da!

318
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,620
Wow, you guys are more excited to see those guys than to see us guys.

319
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:17,340
-You can tell? -Well, no kidding.

320
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,750
Hello, everyone.

321
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,840
Hey!

322
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,050
How have you been?

323
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:24,050
Eve! I missed you!

324
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,550
Long time no see.

325
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,850
If I can just get used to this zero gravity, I can pull it off.

326
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,270
I've practiced a million times.

327
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,480
I can totally do it.

328
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,530
Everyone, this is Mr. Gong Ryong, the tourist.

329
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,610
Say hello.

330
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,990
Oh, hello.

331
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,200
Hello.

332
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,080
Hello.

333
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,880
I… I'm Gong Ryong.

334
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:05,220
But why is our Ryong the only one flailing like that?

335
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,140
…but he certainly looks excited.

336
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,220
SPACE STATION ARRIVAL

337
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,100
I have no idea what's going on over there

338
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,680
because I can't hear them.

339
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,560
Look closely. See if he's okay.

340
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,480
Starting on the 6th, Mr. Gong Ryong will spend 10 days…

341
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,270
Our boy looks handsome.

342
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,860
There's no one better.

343
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,240
No one even compares.

344
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,780
He made it. It's all good.

345
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,370
Well done, baby.

346
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,750
Great work, everyone.

347
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,250
-Great work. -Good job, everyone.

348
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,500
-Good work. -Thank you.

349
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,250
All right, I'll be leaving now.

350
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,790
Are you crazy? Don't be absurd.

351
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,880
What? Why?

352
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,550
Look at you. You all look taller,

353
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:50,180
and your skin looks younger than when I saw you on Earth.

354
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,060
Doesn't this zero gravity

355
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,720
make me look at least three years younger than Dona?

356
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:55,850
Maybe you're right.

357
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:00,770
It even straightened out Santi's misshapen sperm two years ago.

358
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,940
So, how long did it take to get back to your original state?

359
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,690
Oh, gosh. It didn't even last on my way home.

360
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,700
I wish I would've shown my wife.

361
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,370
I feel like every time I reenter the atmosphere,

362
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,620
I get wrinkled.

363
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:17,540
Zero gravity is both a blessing and a curse.

364
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,040
I'm sorry.

365
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,380
By the way, did you come empty-handed?

366
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,920
Where's the thing I asked for?

367
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,050
But why would you of all people…

368
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,430
Is this what you wanted?

369
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,340
Yes, okay.

370
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:34,510
You have to share your fruit fly pregnancy experiment with me now.

371
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,430
All right.

372
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,020
Are those lottery tickets?

373
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,440
Did you get one for all of us?

374
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,310
Hey, we can all watch the numbers together tomorrow!

375
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:47,240
But Dr. Kang, what's the point of you winning the jackpot?

376
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,110
-You already have more money. -Oh, sorry.

377
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,070
That's not my money. It's my father's.

378
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,990
You okay there?

379
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,370
Yeah, I'm fine.

380
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,130
Actually… I also brought a gift.

381
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,090
Regalo.

382
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,850
Following tradition,

383
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:16,810
the astronauts who just arrived are having a welcome ceremony

384
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,980
with the three astronauts already residing…

385
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,310
Father, I think

386
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,230
there might be a way to give you a grandchild.

387
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,650
Is this

388
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,030
really possible?

389
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:36,740
Your body is compressed and distorted by gravity on Earth,

390
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,000
but in space, it returns to its natural state.

391
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,330
The spine stretches, making you taller, wrinkles smooth out,

392
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,210
and even the telomeres at the ends of chromosomes lengthen,

393
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,840
all thanks to zero gravity.

394
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,340
Astronaut Santiago says in that report that his crooked sperm became straight.

395
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,010
It's similar to Dong-hun's case.

396
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,260
-So then… -There's a chance

397
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,890
Dong-hun's sperm will regain normal function in space.

398
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,350
Once restored, we can inject them into my eggs

399
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,930
and create an embryo through IVF.

400
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,390
We should try it right away.

401
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,690
Who should we send up there?

402
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,860
Send Dr. Gong Ryong into space.

403
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,830
What's that?

404
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,660
Ice cream?

405
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,380
How did he know they go crazy for ice cream?

406
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,630
You miss that soft, melting sensation up there.

407
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,920
They don't have anything like that.

408
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,630
That's a nice touch.

409
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,430
I bet he's trying to promote MZ Confectionery ice cream.

410
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,100
It's a PR stunt.

411
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:43,390
No one has ever taken human eggs up to the space station, sir.

412
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,650
How will you keep the eggs frozen and sneak them in

413
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,980
without declaring them?

414
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,730
When they tested human sperm before,

415
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,950
it was only to check the astronauts' health.

416
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,110
The IOU would never allow

417
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,740
human life to be created in space!

418
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,660
If I get caught, I won't be the only one getting punished.

419
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,620
It'll ruin MZ Group, your entire business.

420
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,750
Isn't sperm often sent up to space for experiments?

421
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,760
I'll have Dong-hun's sperm sent there on a cargo ship in advance.

422
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,760
All you have to do is sneak in the eggs.

423
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,430
If you manage to create an embryo using Dong-hun's sperm

424
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,100
and bring me a grandchild,

425
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:25,430
I'll seriously reconsider your relationship with Go-eun.

426
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,810
No, forget it. I can't.

427
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,770
Hey!

428
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:31,820
I'm not asking you to kill someone or steal something, am I?

429
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,190
Min-jeong wants to be a mom, and I want a grandkid.

430
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,070
You're not considering our feelings.

431
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,570
Are those stupid IOU rules more important to you?

432
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,530
Go-eun can't have kids either.

433
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,450
You ended our family line, so you need to take responsibility!

434
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,750
I ended your family line? That's ridiculous!

435
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:52,130
I'll let you marry Go-eun.

436
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,800
Even if you offered me your entire fortune, I wouldn't go.

437
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,380
I mean, I can't.

438
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,760
And don't try to use a child as leverage.

439
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,140
You can't make deals with human life.

440
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,020
Come on, kid!

441
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,230
If you have to go through with this,

442
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:14,030
get an ICSI specialist instead.

443
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,280
The procedure needs to be performed

444
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,320
by a specialist, not an ob-gyn.

445
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,660
There are plenty of great ICSI specialists at the MZ Medical Center.

446
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,950
Look.

447
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,830
Who am I supposed to spill this huge secret to?

448
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,710
You're board certified for ICSI.

449
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,670
You got certified in the US.

450
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,500
Come on, we're family.

451
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,380
I'm trusting you with this because you'll join my family soon.

452
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,510
Who else could I trust with something this big?

453
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,760
I told you, I haven't done it even once since coming back to Korea!

454
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,850
You're the only one I can ask.

455
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,100
I should give up?

456
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:53,860
I became a pediatrician because I love kids.

457
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,610
I even got married to have my own children.

458
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,660
Now that I know there's a way,

459
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,700
how do you expect me to just give up?

460
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:12,000
You're the one who told me to keep trying without giving up.

461
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,340
Dr. Gong, why can't I hear the thing

462
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,380
that you've said a million times?

463
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,630
Congratulations

464
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,260
on becoming a mother.

465
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,050
That's the best thing I could ever hope to hear.

466
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,810
Please let me hear it too.

467
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,100
Ta-da!

468
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,600
Which flavor would you like?

469
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:34,860
I'll take strawberry.

470
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,860
Oh, but…

471
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,690
Oh, come on. Strawberry is…

472
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,160
Give me one too. Me! I'm next.

473
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,240
For you, Ms. Mina Lee, almond.

474
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,410
Thank you.

475
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,290
For you, Mr. Lee Seung-jun, chocolate.

476
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,460
Wow, thank you.

477
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,290
Now, Santi, you get cherry.

482
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,930
Commander, you get mango.

483
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,690
I'll have vanilla.

484
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,570
So this is my gift to you.

485
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:20,230
I picked them according to your tastes!

486
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,330
Did you declare all that?

487
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,370
Declare?

488
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,750
Oh, why is she dragging it out like that?

489
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,540
I mean, what if he gets caught?

490
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,510
Once you're done, tear off the bottom.

491
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,770
That's the secret space.

492
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:55,230
I'll put the eggs under the vanilla ice cream.

493
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,690
Yeah, did you declare it?

494
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:02,150
The personal privilege kit is the only storage assigned to you.

495
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,530
It's small,

496
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,490
and you have to pay by the weight.

497
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,240
You're the first tourist

498
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,030
to fill that expensive, valuable space with ice cream.

499
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,240
Of course I did.

500
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,580
Right.

501
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,040
Then can I have the vanilla?

502
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,920
What? No, I…

503
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,000
Hey! Wait, that's…

504
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,340
The commander just took the vanilla.

505
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,220
Oh, no.

506
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,700

They're studying the differences in human aging and diseases

516
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:18,730

526
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,310

533
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,790

Hey, give it back!

540
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,140
I… I can't eat mango!

541
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,520
Hey, give it back.

542
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,320
Give it back! That's mine!

543
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,910
Why are you obsessing over this?

544
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,620
You're the one who's obsessing, not me.

545
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,540
I asked you if you declared this.

546
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,290
How many times do I have to tell you? I did declare it.

547
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:04,460
I told them I was bringing ice cream and paid for it too.

548
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,250
They opened each one

549
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,670
and checked what was inside.

550
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:11,170
Just ask the IOU or the Mission Control Center

551
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,840
and save me the trouble, okay?

552
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:18,890
You declared five cups of ice cream.

553
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,980
There are five of us on the space station crew, including me.

554
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:30,030
So you brought five housewarming gifts.

555
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,070
That's fine.

556
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,650
But with this vanilla ice cream, there are six in total.

557
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,780
One of them…

558
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,450
is for me.

559
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,000
It's for me.

560
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,960
What? I don't need to declare the one that I'm having, do I?

561
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,420
I put one more tiny cup of ice cream for myself

562
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,090
in my personal storage, which I paid for.

563
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:55,720
Should I just sit and suck my finger while you eat?

564
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,260
Why are you treating me like some kind of criminal

565
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:01,770
just because I brought an extra one for myself too?

566
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,180
If it's not declared,

567
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,730
you can't bring anything up here, even if it's a gift.

568
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:08,940
You have to pay by weight for your personal items, right?

569
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,480
It costs over 100, 000 won per gram.

570
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:14,110
So this one cup of ice cream is worth over ten million.

571
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:17,320
Why would you spend that kind of money on us?

572
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:18,700
You paid 70 billion to come,

573
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,200
so you're entitled to enjoy your money's worth.

574
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,660
So why are you trying to win us over?

575
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,160
Why are you buttering us up?

576
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,290
You're acting suspicious.

577
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,590
Is this some kind of drug?

578
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:30,920
Why didn't you declare it?

579
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,170
Did you bring some dangerous substance

580
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,090
to mess up our experiments or something?

581
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:37,470
If so, come clean.

582
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,470
Did you bring some frozen poison

583
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:43,060
to harm us astronauts? Is that it?

584
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,140
Look.

585
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,850
I'm a doctor.

586
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:48,270
I save people's lives. That's what I do.

587
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,520
Do I look like someone who's here to harm you people?

588
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,780
I'm even more suspicious because you're a doctor.

589
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,860
What?

590
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:57,570
What is your problem?

591
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,530
You're familiar with drugs.

592
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:04,540
Let me eat it and prove it, then.

593
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,000
I'll eat the ice cream, and that will prove it, right?

594
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,790
If there's really poison in it,

595
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:11,000
I'll die if I eat it. Problem solved, right?

596
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,090
Give it to me.

597
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,590
Come on, give it! I'll just eat it and die right here.

598
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:21,930
Let's melt it and see what you've hidden in here.

599
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:26,890
No!

600
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,820
Don't move.

601
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,590
That 70 billion wasn't even his money. His girlfriend paid for it.

602
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:57,460
All he has to do is snap a few pictures up here with her company phone.

603
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,590
Must be nice.

604
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,800
So is the tourist marrying the heiress or not?

605
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,560
Apparently, he even quit his ob-gyn job to marry her.

606
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,600
What?

607
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,560
It's nothing.

608
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,900
They say he's just after her money.

609
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:17,570
He's pretending to be in love with her and even came to space for it.

610
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,780
Everyone's talking about it. He's ambitious.

611
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,570
What is it? Tell me.

612
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,160
Don't worry about it.

613
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,280
Does Eve know?

614
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:27,240
That's why she was against him coming along.

615
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,790
Come on, I want to know. Please?

616
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,880
We're just gossiping.

617
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,040
You don't need to know.

618
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,920
Fine.

619
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,990
Hey, wait!

620
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,080
Keep still.

621
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,130
My ice cream.

622
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,580
Where are the spoons?

623
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,290
Oh, here they are.

624
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,460
Let's eat.

625
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:11,100
I'm sorry I suspected you.

626
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:15,100
Hey, is it good? Let's share it.

627
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,190
No, not with someone so scary!

628
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,480
Come on, just one bite.

629
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:28,120
Hey, don't eat it all. Let me taste…

630
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:29,910
You finished it?

631
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,330
You're kidding.

632
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,460
It's just vanilla.

633
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,250
No! Don't…

634
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,880
This is the important part.

635
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,880
In space, you need to reduce

636
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:48,720
the size of your trash like this, okay?

637
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,350
Now, come here.

638
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:54,640
It says trash here, right? Put the trash in,

639
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,350
and make sure you seal it tight, got it?

640
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,230
Otherwise, the trash might float back up.

641
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,980
I will never forgive you.

642
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,570
I hope you enjoy your stay here.

643
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:11,240
Enjoy my stay? Are you kidding me?

644
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,620
Just move.

645
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,960
Why are you so worked up?

646
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,090
What do I do?

647
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,090
-What do I do? -Oh, and…

648
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,260
You'll hurt yourself if you keep flailing like that.

649
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:36,770
We all once lived in the amniotic fluid of our moms' wombs.

650
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,390
Imagine this is your mom's womb.

651
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,060
Don't fight zero gravity. Just relax,

652
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:44,650
and try to move naturally like a fetus.

653
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:46,150
You'll get the hang of it.

654
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,990
What the hell is she talking about?

655
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,540
Wait, what?

656
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,460
Shoot.

657
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,340
What?

658
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,640
Shoot.

659
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:30,860
Are you sure?

660
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:31,950
Yes, I'm sure.

661
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,580
The eggs seem healthy.

662
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,870
All right!

663
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,370
We're good to go, then.

664
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,340
I've got the eggs now,

665
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,880
and I also got Dong-hun's sperm

666
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:55,600
from the cargo ship and stored it in the portable freezer you sent.

667
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:01,640
I'll proceed as scheduled.

668
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,730
Sir.

669
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,730
What's going on here?

670
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,740
Dr. Kang has the eggs?

671
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,070
Why is he doing what Ryong was supposed to do?

672
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:19,240
Ryong did a good job with the delivery.

673
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,870
Tell him to enjoy the tour.

674
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:26,210
Dr. Gong knows my eggs better than anyone.

675
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,300
He has to be the one to do it.

676
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,880
What do you think that clown can do in zero gravity?

677
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,090
Come to your senses!

678
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,900
Darn it.

679
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:56,990
Which way is it?

680
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,880
Guys, where are you?

681
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,000
Where are they?

682
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,100
GO-EUN

683
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,350
Hey, Go-eun.

684
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,520
Ryong, hi.

685
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,610
I'm looking for it.

686
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,860
I'm on my way to check the other ice cream cups.

687
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,030
Don't worry, I'll find it.

688
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,280
I'm sorry.

689
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,820
Why are you apologizing?

690
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,240
Listen.

691
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,960
You're just a delivery man.

692
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,710
My dad tricked you.

693
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:52,920
Your job was just to deliver the eggs to the space station as a guest.

694
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,670
Kang Kang-su will do the fertilization.

695
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,130
-What? -That was the plan all along.

696
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,010
My dad lied to us.

697
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:01,510
Who?

698
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:05,680
Your ex-boyfriend?

699
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,600
That Kang Kang-su?

700
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:10,980
Mr. Selfish Gene?

701
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,360
What do we do now?

702
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,490
Are you talking about that fucker?

703
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:18,700
Hey, Eve.

704
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:21,370
A grumpy male mouse is having trouble adjusting.

705
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,620
Are you talking about Male Mouse 1?

706
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,750
Yeah.

707
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:34,960
He was the sweetest one back on Earth.

708
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,300
Is zero gravity too much for you? What's wrong, buddy?

709
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:42,100
Hey.

710
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,390
How's the tourist handling zero gravity?

711
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:48,980
Well, he'll probably get the hang of it just in time to leave.

712
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,560
Oh, right.

713
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,190
Listen, I rushed out of the house and left my TV on.

714
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,400
Could you send someone to turn it off?

715
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:00,570
-I don't want a crazy electricity bill. -Okay.

716
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,700
Don't worry about it.

717
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,120
Just make sure you get a mouse pregnant this time.

718
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,290
Let's win the Nobel Prize.

719
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,910
What are you still doing here?

720
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,750
Don't you need to go pack your stuff?

721
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,500
Your junior was offered a great job,

722
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:14,040
so why are you being so jealous? It's so obvious.

723
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,630
Do you want me to stay?

724
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:19,260
-Would you? -What's the matter? Everything looks fine.

725
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,130
Of course not, they're paying me more.

726
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,220
Exactly.

727
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:31,140
Dr. Kang Kang-su also got board certified for ICSI in the US

728
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:33,650
when he was a postdoc in biology.

729
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:37,320
Since he's already used to zero gravity, he obviously has an advantage.

730
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,240
I didn't think of that.

731
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:40,950
I'm sorry.

732
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:45,580
I won't let this slide.

733
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,660
I'll turn everything upside down.

734
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:55,380
The chairman clearly has no intention of letting you marry Mr. Gong Ryong.

735
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,250
Ryong must be…

736
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,260
feeling terrible right now.

737
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,810
Hey. Give me that!

738
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:21,860
Stay out of it.

739
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:24,030
I'll take it from here.

740
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:26,160
You can't take this away from me like this.

741
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,450
Who do you think you are?

742
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:30,120
What are you, a thief? Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

743
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,290
You were a delivery man from the start. Nothing more, nothing less.

744
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:47,430
Damn it. Kang Kang-su, you little…

745
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,640
I am her doctor, okay?

746
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,940
You can't change a patient's doctor without their consent.

747
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,690
You've never even seen her eggs.

748
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,780
You've never stayed up all night trying to figure out what's wrong!

749
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:06,700
Those are her last eggs, okay?

750
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,160
I know them better than you.

751
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,870
I have to be the one to do it! Give them back now!

752
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:12,700
Bring my child back to life then.

753
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,830
-What? -The child that Go-eun and I lost.

754
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:22,340
The one who barely had any time in this world. Bring back my child,

755
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:23,760
and I'll give you the eggs.

756
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:28,850
Look. Both you and her father

757
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:31,680
act like I'm a murderer or something.

758
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,190
Go-eun's condition was more critical than you would think.

759
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:38,100
You don't care what happens to her?

760
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:39,900
You want to marry an heiress?

761
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,520
Are you delusional?

762
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:46,360
Just give up while Mr. Choi is being nice enough to send you to space.

763
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:50,620
I didn't come here as a tourist.

764
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,830
-Zero gravity is no joke. -I prepared for over a year.

765
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:54,120
In zero gravity?

766
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,580
I've been working on this in zero gravity for over a year.

767
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,960
Can you handle a microscopic needle better than me?

768
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,750
Look at you now.

769
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,670
How the hell would you precisely inject the sperm into the egg?

770
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:09,390
Give it up.

771
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,470
Go-eun is mine.

772
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,890
Eve, if Male Mouse 1 is still not adjusted by tomorrow,

773
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:57,770
should we try some medication?

774
00:46:57,850 --> 00:46:59,640
Yeah, I'll check on him overnight.

775
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:02,440
You must be tired. Let's get some sleep, guys.

776
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,400
Good night.

777
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:07,780
This is your first night. Good night, you two.

778
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,910
You know how to sleep in here, right?

779
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,420
Don't just float around here like a corpse all night.

780
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:30,130
Okay?

781
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,050
When will I get used to

782
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:36,010
this stupid zero gravity?

783
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:39,390
By the time you go home?

784
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,900
Why didn't you just shoot me earlier?

785
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:48,940
It's not too late now.

786
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:50,860
Do it. Shoot me.

787
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:52,450
Come on, I said I'm sorry.

788
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:56,700
I can't keep apologizing. Accept it or not, it's on you now.

789
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:15,140
You live in this dump?

790
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:20,560
I'll do it on one condition.

791
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,600
What is it?

792
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,520
I told you, I'll do anything.

793
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,320
It can't be just about your grandchild.

794
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,320
I'm risking my life to go to space,

795
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,580
and I won't do it just for your grandchild.

796
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:42,960
If I succeed,

797
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,460
share the results.

798
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,960
I want MZ Group to build a fertility clinic in space

799
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:54,680
so other people in desperate situations can also have children.

800
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:01,640
A fertility clinic? Who are you kidding?

801
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,310
Just be honest and tell me you want to marry Go-eun

802
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,020
and live in comfort, kid.

803
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,860
We're talking about my life here.

804
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,950
If I'm going to risk it, it should at least be for something like this.

805
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:19,490
Fine.

806
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:25,920
Fine, I'll do it.

807
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:52,020
Chief!

808
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:55,110
GONG RYONG'S 2ND DAY

809
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:03,580
Oh, God. What the… What's that?

810
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:06,540
What's happening?

811
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,880
Male Mouse 1 started biting through

812
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,670
the tails of Female Mouse 2 and 3 in the same cage.

813
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,720
Within minutes, he devoured their legs

814
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,220
and started gnawing at the bars with a bloody mouth.

815
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:39,160
Look at him all messed up and covered in blood.

816
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:41,820
He's just like you, no?

817
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:46,160
This is you.

818
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,210
It'll probably die soon.

819
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:55,340
I did a thorough check just to be sure.

820
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,720
I found signs that Male Mouse 1 attacked

821
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:02,220
the females in another cage too, biting their bellies, legs, and necks.

822
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:05,970
I get that the zero-gravity experiments can be stressful,

823
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:07,520
but we can't just let him be.

824
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,230
What do you mean?

825
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:12,770
If we do, he'll kill all the other mice too.

826
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:16,110
What then? Are you saying we kill him?

827
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:19,200
We should put him down. Each mouse costs over two million won.

828
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,200
We can't do that.

829
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,660
The mice are what we send on the cargo ship the most.

830
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,790
What if they all die? We send another one?

831
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:27,120
Think about the cost!

832
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,830
Let's stick to their policy.

833
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,170
You're a scientist. If you get so emotionally attached to a mouse,

834
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:41,050
we can't do the experiments efficiently.

835
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:43,430
You need to remain objective as the commander.

836
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:45,600
This is a test subject.

837
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:49,430
Just Mouse 1. It doesn't even have a name.

838
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,230
Commander, let's stick to the policy.

839
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,480
If we don't find a solution,

840
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:59,110
we'll have to keep putting them down like this.

841
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:00,950
Please give us some time.

842
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:02,910
You're wasting resources and time.

843
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:05,700
We're here to figure out how we can all live here together.

844
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,370
No, Mouse 1!

845
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:10,540
Mouse 1 is having a heart attack!

846
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:15,790
Good.

847
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,300
Let's just get back to work.

848
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,590
-Dr. Lee. -Let's do it.

849
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:24,800
What are you doing?

850
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:31,810
Hey! For God's sake…

851
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:35,560
One, two, three, four, five.

852
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:38,110
One, two, three, four, five.

853
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:40,110
What are you doing with a dead mouse?

854
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,860
One, two, three, four, five.

855
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:45,070
Come on. One, two, three, four, five.

856
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:48,200
One, two, three, four, five.

857
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,790
Shouldn't you go harder?

858
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:52,620
No, that'll rupture his heart and blood vessels.

859
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,750
One, two, three, four, five.

860
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:00,880
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

861
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,960
What do we do?

862
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:04,590
It looks like he's gone.

863
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,840
I got a cramp.

864
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:07,800
I'm fine.

865
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,680
One, two, three, four, five.

866
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:15,020
Let's open up his chest.

867
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:21,610
I've never done an open-chest cardiac massage on them.

868
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,740
I've done it on a newborn baby.

869
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:27,820
One, two, three, four, five.

870
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,670
One, two, three, four, five.

871
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:44,050
Dr. Lee.

872
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:46,840
Hold Mr. Gong's legs with Santi so he can stand still.

873
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:52,310
Come on.

874
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:04,190
-Show me the glove box monitor. -Yes, Chief.

875
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:14,540
Could you hold me a bit tighter?

876
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:16,290
All right.

877
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,000
Scalpel.

878
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,770
Scissors, please.

879
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:41,150
Okay.

880
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:43,270
No, not that one. The one on the far left.

881
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,320
The far left?

882
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:02,130
Okay.

883
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,920
Commander, get the retractor in.

884
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:14,970
Oh, his vitals are dropping.

885
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:17,850
Give him three micrograms of epinephrine.

886
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:23,060
-Come on. -Hurry, there's no time.

887
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:24,270
You're out of your minds.

888
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,630
All right, relax your body. Relax.

889
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:49,590
Okay.

890
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:53,680
Come on.

891
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,770
Come on.

892
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:07,690
Gently.

893
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:10,440
You're scientists.

894
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:12,530
You've got to be kidding me.

895
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:15,070
What the hell are you doing with a tourist?

896
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,240
You have no idea what you're doing.

897
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:19,250
Enough! Shut it, for God's sake.

898
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:25,040
His breathing seems to have stabilized,

899
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:27,800
but his heart still won't beat on its own.

900
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,300
His heart is so small.

901
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:31,590
I'm not sure how much pressure it can take.

902
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:34,590
His breathing is getting weaker.

903
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:39,720
Commander, maybe we should let him go.

904
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:43,390
No.

905
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:49,480
You've done everything you could. He's in pain.

906
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,700
No.

907
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:58,870
They shouldn't have bothered.

908
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,460
No.

909
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:15,340
Look at him all messed up and covered in blood.

910
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:17,220
He's just like you, no?

911
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:23,980
This is you.

912
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,810
He'll probably die soon.

913
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:39,620
Commander.

914
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:42,660
Switch hands and start compressions.

915
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:45,580
Let's clamp the aortic arch.

916
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:49,750
A mouse is just like a human, only smaller, right?

917
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:56,050
Okay.

918
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:07,480
One, two, stop. Again.

919
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,310
One, two, stop.

920
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:13,530
Again. One, two, stop.

921
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,200
One, two, stop.

922
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:20,070
Again. One, two, stop.

923
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,490
What are they doing?

924
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:23,330
It's what they'd do to a human.

925
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:24,950
By applying pressure on the aorta,

926
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,960
they can make sure the blood circulates throughout the body.

927
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:34,000
One, two, stop.

928
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:36,510
-One, two, stop. -One, two, stop.

929
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:40,260
-One, two, stop. -One, two, stop.

930
00:58:57,030 --> 00:58:58,450
His heart is beating!

931
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:22,180
He lives!

932
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:28,520
Oh, it's beating.

933
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,890
His heart is beating!

934
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:33,150
His heart is beating!

935
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:51,210
-You're okay now. -He's alive!

936
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,880
He's alive.

937
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,890
Si-won, get this on the news.

938
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,220
Okay.

939
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:09,980
Oh, I knew it.

940
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:14,480
Listen, Male Mouse 1 had a mate back on Earth.

941
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:18,400
Wait, what? Is he alive?

942
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,860
He's alive?

943
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:27,030
I'm so glad! Hang in there.

944
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:34,170
There's a reason Mouse 1

945
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:37,210
only attacked the females, not the males.

946
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:40,340
He was missing his mate back on Earth like crazy,

947
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:42,800
but the females kept coming on to him,

948
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,970
and he had to keep rejecting them.

949
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:47,430
In the end, he just lost it and tore them apart.

950
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:50,470
Then why did you send him up there?

951
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:53,640
Well, it's because…

952
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:56,110
Our mission is

953
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:59,780
to get mammals to naturally mate, get pregnant,

954
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,320
and give birth, right?

955
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:04,490
Mouse 1 was very well-mannered, affectionate,

956
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:06,320
and great at mating back on Earth,

957
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:08,740
so we figured he'd get along with the females

958
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:10,950
and be great at mating in space too.

959
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:18,500
And you're telling me this now? Are you kidding?

960
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:20,090
I just found out.

961
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:23,630
You're laughing?

962
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:28,890
Oh, man. How did I miss this?

963
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,520
This is amazing. How is that possible?

964
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:41,820
Can you get me a mouse?

965
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:42,900
For what?

966
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:45,700
No, I don't trust your motives.

967
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:49,870
This restores my faith in humanity.

968
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:56,670
He's alive.

969
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:58,960
He lives.

970
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:17,940
I can't believe it worked.

971
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:21,980
The very first surgery on the space station

972
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:24,320
has successfully saved a mammal, a mouse.

973
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,200
This is truly remarkable

974
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:28,910
as up until now, no surgery had ever been performed

975
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:30,660
in the weightlessness of space.

976
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:32,490
Yes, this has never happened before.

977
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:34,080
This surgery has proven

978
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:38,080
that surgical procedures are now possible on the space station.

979
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:39,080
As MCC chief,

980
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:42,290
I'm so proud of the expedition team and the tourist who saved a life.

981
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:45,710
Didn't she want to put the mouse down until a minute ago?

982
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:48,630
Not too shabby for him.

983
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:54,640
Your car will be here soon.

984
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:56,730
Yeah, okay.

985
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,270
You…

986
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:04,820
Wow! I mean, you!

987
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:05,730
Come on, stop.

988
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:07,030
Fantastic job!

989
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,780
You guys were really awesome.

990
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:13,740
That was insane!

991
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:14,790
Hey, move.

992
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:21,710
Eve. No, I mean, Commander.

993
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:24,170
You can call me Eve now.

994
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:25,340
What?

995
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,510
I never would've thought

996
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:30,970
to open his chest if it hadn't been for you, Doctor.

997
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:35,430
I think they can mate now.

998
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:38,180
I think they can mate and get pregnant.

999
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:40,390
We'll succeed this time, right?

1000
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:41,440
Absolutely.

1001
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,060
I have a really good feeling.

1002
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:49,150
To be honest, I thought you'd just get in our way, so you kind of bugged me.

1003
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,780
But you…

1004
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:54,990
You're a great doctor.

1005
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,130
I'm so glad to have you here in space!

1006
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:06,340
Great work!

1007
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,010
Let's give him a hand!

1008
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:24,900
His heart is actually beating!

1009
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:26,520
GO-EUN

1010
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:43,710
You saved his life.

1011
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:32,340
SPECIAL THANKS TO CHO JUNG-SEOK

1012
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:34,930
This is

1013
01:05:36,010 --> 01:05:37,140
hell.

1014
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:41,720
I'm in hell.

1015
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:45,850
I shouldn't be…

1016
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:49,060
doing this right now.

1017
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,990
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

1018
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:58,240
Where did he go?

1019
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,580
Two men in different rooms with a picture of the same girl.

1020
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:02,790
Oh, my God!

1021
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:05,750
-It's 500 billion won! -It's still valid for another month.

1022
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:09,170
If Kang-su finds out, he'll get jealous and take them away in a second.

1023
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:10,170
What were you doing?

1024
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:13,170
I'm not going to let Kang Kang-su take anything else from me.

1025
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,010
Kang Kang-su.

1026
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:16,470
Are you even human?

1027
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:19,550
I was the one who suggested that and using Gong Ryong as the delivery boy.

1028
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,430
And it was me who offered to do the IVF.

1029
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:23,640
You have to do it yourself, no matter what.

1030
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:27,980
Right now, I'm about to steal back my eggs.

1031
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:31,020
I'm going to get those eggs back, even if it kills me.

1032
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:38,490
