1
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,960
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

2
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,890
-Cheers! -Cheers!

3
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,680
Let's all try to get along.

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,890
Okay.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,770
A day like this calls for a real drink.

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,190
What's this? We're toasting with water.

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,150
They're going to air the lottery numbers soon.

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,070
Right.

9
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,740
-We should all watch it together. -Okay.

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,070
We need the screen to watch it. Where did I put it?

11
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,200
Where's our guest?

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,410
He's the guest of honor. Call him out, Commander.

13
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,670
YOU MUST LOOK AT THIS EVERY DAY

14
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,470
You're a great doctor.

15
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,060
I'm so glad to have you here in space!

16
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,140
Are you sleeping?

17
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,520
Yes, I'm sleeping.

18
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,190
Hey, come on. I said I was sleeping.

19
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,440
-Aren't you hungry? -I'm full.

20
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,070
But you puked on the way here and haven't eaten. How could you be full?

21
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,120
I'm full.

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,540
So full my stomach's going to explode, as is my head.

23
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,660
I just want to be alone.

24
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,080
Hold on, are you hiding something here?

25
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,920
What are you doing?

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Hey, there's nothing here.

27
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,960
Let me hide Public and Indecency here.

28
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,470
If Kang Kang-su sees them, he'll take them to the lab

29
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,840
and pump them full of drugs. They haven't even had babies yet.

30
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,510
Isn't there a pocket here?

31
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,640
They're safest with you.

32
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,310
-Here. -Hey! Come on.

33
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,690
Hide them in your room.

34
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,030
Come out and eat something.

35
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:03,870
It's zero gravity, so your heart rate is slow and your blood pressure will drop.

36
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,500
You don't want your girlfriend to worry, do you?

37
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,770
Now, where did I put it?

38
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,230
Where are you?

39
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,860
Where did I put it?

40
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,360
There you are.

41
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,950
What's this?

42
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,390
How old is this lottery ticket?

43
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,680
Stand by me?

44
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,640
Across the country,

45
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,230
it's the world's favorite jackpot game.

46
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,020
Get ready, everyone. This is World Ball.

47
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,730
Good afternoon, world. I'm Leighton Clarkson.

48
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:22,990
Today's World Ball jackpot is worth an estimated $246, 609, 124.

49
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,450
Three hundred billion won?

50
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,910
That's a lot.

51
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,450
I need some coffee. Mina, do you want some coffee?

52
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,870
What about the results? It'll be over soon.

53
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,120
I'll be right back.

54
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,290
Espresso, right?

55
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,420
The biological module is so far, though.

56
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,000
I mean, I would appreciate it.

57
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,130
-What about you, Commander? -I'm okay.

58
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,880
Have you ever won?

59
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,800
…you'll need to match all five numbers and World Ball.

60
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:49,140
So get your tickets out, pay close attention.

61
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,310
And rea…

62
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,270
Now is the time.

63
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,400
The time to distract everyone.

64
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,870
This was the reason I asked Eve to buy the lottery ticket.

65
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,960
…dy. Here we go.

66
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:49,910
Mr. Chairman.

67
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,540
Surgery in zero gravity

68
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,250
requires more precision and is more demanding than ICSI.

69
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,040
But Ryong did it.

70
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,330
Let's return the eggs to him.

71
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,960
What's the big deal about saving a single mouse?

72
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,500
It's not like he did it alone.

73
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,380
Dad.

74
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,010
Please reconsider.

75
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,090
They're my eggs.

76
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,640
I'm the mother. Shouldn't I be the one to decide?

77
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,930
Dr. Gong knows my eggs better than anyone.

78
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,140
Dr. Kang doesn't know.

79
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,270
But Ryong has no experience in zero gravity.

80
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,980
If you're going to betray him like this,

81
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,360
then was the space fertility clinic a lie too?

82
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,740
That's what Dr. Gong put his life on the line for.

83
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,070
Move.

84
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,830
Dr. Gong was the one who injected my eggs with Dong-hun's sperm.

85
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,120
Father.

86
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,710
It's started, sir.

87
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,300
Time to hit the jackpot.

88
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,140
The first number is down. We have one to lead us off.

89
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,650
By now, he has probably opened the sterilized glove box

90
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,320
and placed Choi Dong-hun's sperm and Na Min-jeong's egg

91
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,820
under the microscope.

92
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,160
Come on!

93
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,160
-Sorry. -Did we get one?

94
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,460
Sorry. Are you okay? Sorry.

95
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,420
-Do we have that number? Shush, quiet. -Hey!

96
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,380
Wait.

97
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,630
-The next number is 65. -I can't see!

98
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,050
-Do we have that number? -I wonder who the lucky winner will be.

99
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,390
-Hot ticket. -We got one number.

100
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,680
The next number is…

101
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,900
He will secure the egg with a holding pipette,

102
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,410
then use another pipette to aspirate the sperm

103
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,120
and inject it into the egg.

104
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,870
The outcome will depend on the extent

105
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,920
to which the sperm's genetic flaws have been corrected

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,750
in zero gravity, sir.

107
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,220
What will the winning World Ball number be?

108
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,560
Find out right after this short break. Stay tuned.

109
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,690
Mom.

110
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,530
-Hi, Ryong! -Hi, Ryong!

111
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,360
Hi, Moms.

112
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,070
Ryong!

113
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,870
It's Ryong. Hi, Ryong.

114
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,410
Have you eaten?

115
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,450
Are you sleeping okay? Are you okay?

116
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,000
Is anyone bothering you?

117
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,620
If there is, let us know.

118
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,830
What were you doing?

119
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,170
What else?

120
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,500
What were you doing in there?

121
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,010
Mom.

122
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,380
Is he crazy?

123
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,470
Whatever.

124
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,470
-Ryong. -Hey, Ryong.

125
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,020
Son, hello?

126
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:57,360
…23, 65, 63, 26.

127
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,370
Next, the winning World Ball number is…

128
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,580
I'm getting a call.

129
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,540
KANG KANG-SU

130
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,540
Hey, Kang-su.

131
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,830
It was a success, sir.

132
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,420
How many did you do?

133
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,880
Gong Ryong followed me, so I couldn't do all ten,

134
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,720
but I got seven done.

135
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,680
He got seven.

136
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,510
If even one of the seven is fertilized, it's a success.

137
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,180
He can freeze it and bring it back.

138
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,430
No.

139
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,770
They will all be fertilized.

140
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,980
I injected the sperm exactly into the center of each egg.

141
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,820
Congratulations, sir.

142
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,110
-Congratulations, Chairman Choi. -Congratulations.

143
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,870
I'm so glad I took you up on your offer.

144
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,620
If you hadn't suggested using Ryong as a delivery man

145
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,910
and volunteered to do it yourself,

146
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,300
I would have relied on Ryong for this and ended up a nervous wreck.

147
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,880
It was a gutsy move.

148
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,220
Hey, buddy.

149
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,060
Check in on my moms and don't let them drink every day.

150
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:04,970
Okay, got it.

151
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,600
That aside, did the deformed sperm really straighten out?

152
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,850
Did you actually see it?

153
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,360
Hey, do you know how to unlock the cryogenic freezer?

154
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,070
What?

155
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,320
I can't hear you.

156
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,030
I need those eggs before Dr. Kang gets it done.

157
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,450
What?

158
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,240
Hey, I'll call you later tonight.

159
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,710
Damn it.

160
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,420
Give it here.

161
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,550
Why did you hang up?

162
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,130
He said he'd call again later.

163
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,090
-Later? Later when? -Yes.

164
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,560
It's so loud there. I couldn't hear a word he was saying.

165
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,310
Damn it. So we have to wait for him to call us.

166
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,020
You're such a dimwit.

167
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,060
Later.

168
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,480
Why does it taste like this?

169
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,860
Like what?

170
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,820
-Can you tell? -It tasted better yesterday.

171
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,740
You always give me…

172
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,280
Can I get another bottle of makgeolli?

173
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,330
-Another bottle? -I made them yesterday.

174
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,660
We need some jeon.

175
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,580
Could we also get some more jeon?

176
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,130
Sure. A bottle of makgeolli.

177
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,580
-I got it. -Hey, flip it.

178
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,340
Get out of there, you dimwit. Move.

179
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,590
-Bye, everyone. -Bye.

180
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,130
Damn.

181
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,050
I never get any of the numbers right.

182
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,350
Did anyone get any of the numbers?

183
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,980
-Santi? -Santi, any luck?

184
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,980
Nah, I just got one.

185
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,560
Coffee delivery.

186
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,560
Did you get any?

187
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,150
No. None.

188
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,360
Thank you.

189
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,570
Mr. Gong, please come and join us.

190
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,570
Okay.

191
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:45,570
We will have our daily meeting at 7:30 tomorrow.

192
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,740
As you are all aware, tomorrow we are scheduled for a spacewalk.

193
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,710
Stand by at the main module for orders from the control center.

194
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,080
-Okay? -Yes.

195
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,250
There's

196
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,130
a spacewalk tomorrow?

197
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,670
-We're going outside? -Yes.

198
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,760
One of the panels tore on our way here because of the SuitSat.

199
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,680
You can't go back to Earth if it's not fixed.

200
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,850
Okay, I'm sure you're all tired. Everyone, back to your rooms.

201
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,390
Santi, cleaning. Thank you.

202
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,620
There's no chair.

203
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,540
Commander, is there really a spacewalk tomorrow? Who's going?

204
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,580
Kang-su is going.

205
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:42,010
So, tomorrow he's going outside the space station, right?

206
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,840
So what you're saying is, Dr. Kang is going outside tomorrow.

207
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,180
Why are you asking?

208
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,800
Won't that take more than a couple of hours?

209
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,060
Three, four hours? Maybe even five or six?

210
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,980
It will take a minimum of seven hours.

211
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,600
It's a job that requires all hands on deck.

212
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,690
Be good and don't cause any trouble.

213
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,730
Okay.

214
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:04,950
Are there cases where you go out but can't come back?

215
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,570
Are you hoping Dr. Kang won't come back?

216
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,950
Yes.

217
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,790
No, not at all.

218
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,580
Hey, just because he's Go-eun's ex

219
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,330
doesn't mean I want something bad to happen to him.

220
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,290
It's because it's dangerous.

221
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,460
That's why we go in pairs.

222
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,260
Have you gone out before?

223
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,800
This will be my third time.

224
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:29,930
Huh?

225
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,140
You're going out tomorrow too?

226
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,060
Yes.

227
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,560
Can't Kang Kang-su go alone?

228
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,570
Isn't it like, really, totally dangerous?

229
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,820
Everything we do here is dangerous.

230
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,280
Why do you have to go out?

231
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,530
What about those people in there who brag about

232
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,700
how they were born soldiers or born walking in zero gravity?

233
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,540
Are you saying I'm not as qualified?

234
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,210
No.

235
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,670
Remember what you said during training?

236
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,880
Don't you remember?

237
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,590
When you were measuring me?

238
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,510
When you were pouring plaster all over me.

239
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,180
What did I say?

240
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,590
Do you want to die?

241
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,430
What I mean is…

242
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:17,230
Can't tourists wear that and go out on a spacewalk?

243
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:20,230
Isn't that essential for this to be a true space adventure?

244
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,770
Spacewalk suits don't have any joints, so we move really slowly.

245
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:30,110
Moving even 0.00001 mm makes your heart feel like it's about to burst.

246
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,320
It's like dying in a jointless prison.

247
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,620
You think that's all?

248
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,580
If even the tiniest hole forms in your glove during the spacewalk,

249
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,040
the pressure inside your space suit drops.

250
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,920
If there is rapid depressurization,

251
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,590
within 15 seconds you'll faint.

252
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,960
After 30 seconds, your heart rate slows,

253
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,170
and after one minute, your lungs, as well as

254
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,510
other vital organs, will suffer permanent damage.

255
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:52,800
Permanent?

256
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,970
And about a minute and a half later, death.

257
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,060
Come on.

258
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,940
I'm sure whoever made it designed it so a hole doesn't form.

259
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,190
Pour it.

260
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,320
Yikes, that's cold.

261
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,620
It's cold.

262
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,910
Once the mold is done,

263
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,960
a seat will be custom-engineered to your specific dimensions.

264
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,540
So, you're telling me I won't be able to wear a spacewalk suit,

265
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,260
and I have to look out at space through the windows

266
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,880
in tiny squares and circles?

267
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,590
You can go out if you want to die.

268
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,100
A spacewalk is essentially a suicide mission.

269
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,640
Even astronauts write a will before they go out.

270
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:49,360
So, did you write a will, Commander?

271
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,410
In an emergency, the commander is supposed to be the first to die.

272
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,410
No.

273
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,660
The commander should be the one to survive till the end.

274
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,670
Where does one learn how to say such nice things?

275
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,260
A space tourist telling the commander what to do.

276
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:19,390
That's overstepping your authority.

277
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,700
It looks like your father took Na Min-jeong's IVF records

278
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,500
and any record of theses on correcting deformed sperm.

279
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,830
He destroyed anything that could be evidence

280
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,170
and left nothing that could be traced to it.

281
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,960
So, if by chance,

282
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,250
Ryong were to spill everything,

283
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,510
he would have nothing to back it up.

284
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:56,130
Don't you think your father has gone too far?

285
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,300
He really is a dangerous person.

286
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,310
What an asshole.

287
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,390
Huh? I'm sorry?

288
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,650
-I must have been out of my mind. -I was just...

289
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,440
I had to have been crazy to like someone like him.

290
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,360
I'll make you pay, Kang Kang-su!

291
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:24,000
There are still some signs of jaundice,

292
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,910
but it's nothing to worry about.

293
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,080
We're so lucky you caught it early.

294
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,540
Thank you so much, Doctor.

295
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,970
DOCTOR GONG RYONG

296
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,940
Are you okay, Professor?

297
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,900
You look a bit tired today.

298
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,860
I'm okay.

299
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,440
Has the ob-gyn collaborative care meet…

300
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,450
meeting been set?

301
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,410
Professor, are you okay?

302
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,330
Doctor!

303
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,330
-Call the ER. -Okay.

304
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,710
Code blue, code blue. Department of Cardiology, ER.

305
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,750
Clear the bed, hurry!

306
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,800
Here, take her.

307
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,630
Doctor, tell us what's wrong...

308
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,640
Get out.

309
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,270
I'm okay, back to work.

310
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,270
Just in case, see if the VIP room is available.

311
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,520
She needs rest. Put the other doctors on standby.

312
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,690
Yes, understood.

313
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,860
Professor Na, if you're not well,

314
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,780
any success they achieve in space will be meaningless.

315
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,490
Don't be stressed.

316
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,780
Does it matter who succeeds?

317
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,910
Just think of the baby.

318
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,450
Sir, wait.

319
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,920
What's wrong with her? Should I call OB-GYN?

320
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,170
Maybe a full physical...

321
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,840
Go. Stop hanging around here.

322
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,750
-Move her to the VIP room now. -Okay.

323
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,510
-Call only me. -Yes, understood.

324
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,090
Director…

325
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,470
He always wants all the success for himself.

326
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,740
This is IOU, Mission Control Seoul.

327
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,870
The ILS's internal pressure is 14.7.

328
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,080
All clear. Over.

329
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,130
This is Seoul, Mission Control IOU.

330
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:39,710
We will decompress the airlock pressure from 14.7 to 12.5

331
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,630
for tomorrow's spacewalk.

332
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,630
Copy and out.

333
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:47,060
In normal circumstances, they'd run on the treadmill for two hours.

334
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,350
They've been busy docking and operating on the mouse.

335
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,520
The calcium levels in their bones have already dropped…

336
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,560
They have to exercise even if it means less sleep.

337
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,610
Should I wake them?

338
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,280
They get mad if you do.

339
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,440
Right.

340
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,080
Did you write a will, Commander?

341
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,200
All right.

342
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:16,630
Should I do a practice round?

343
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,300
MY…

344
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,770
It will be a success.

345
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,390
It will be a success.

346
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,330
GO-EUN

347
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,010
If you got the wrong ice cream,

348
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,380
you should have returned it to Ryong.

349
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,590
It's not too late. Give it back.

350
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,600
I was the one who suggested switching the ice cream

351
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,060
and using Gong Ryong as the delivery boy.

352
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,230
And it was me who offered to do the IVF.

353
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,230
Kang Kang-su.

354
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,190
Are you even human?

355
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,320
Can you even call yourself a man? An astronaut?

356
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,070
Whatever, screw this.

357
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,620
You melon-headed asshole.

358
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,950
Do you think your mother stayed up all night to raise a backstabber?

359
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,160
Spending all that time shaping your head to make you look good?

360
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,750
You're like a fly on shit.

361
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,670
You're covered in shit from head to toe.

362
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,340
Even if you sat on a pile of shit, you wouldn't know it.

363
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,050
Do you even know how disgusting you and my father are?

364
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,550
Did you have to go this far?

365
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,510
If you get chummy with my dad, I'll kill you.

366
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,310
You're wrong if you think this will make me come back to you.

367
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,480
You can't have everything you want.

368
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,350
Don't kid yourself, you asshole!

369
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,980
How pretty.

370
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:10,570
Holy hell…

371
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,490
You twisted sicko.

372
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,300
-So, how long did you run for? -Like, a couple hours.

373
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,890
-You? -Me too.

374
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,010
About two hours?

375
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,520
Is this working better than the one in the observation module?

376
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,390
Yeah. Your treadmill?

377
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,810
Absolute garbage.

378
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,190
Don't you think it's making strange sounds?

379
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:46,940
Yeah, but yours sounds like you.

380
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,530
What? What's that supposed to mean?

381
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,120
Loser cleans the bathroom. Wanna bet?

382
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,240
Oh, hell no. You've got to be kidding me.

383
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:05,800
All right.

384
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,010
Oh, my God!

385
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,280
Oh, my God. No way.

386
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,320
It's… It's 500 billion won!

387
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,950
It's a 500 billion won ticket.

388
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:35,700
Oh, my God.

389
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,050
CALL IS BEING CONNECTED…

390
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,640
-Hey. -What do you want?

391
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,140
You know this place well, right?

392
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,770
-Good job. -Thank you.

393
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,600
-Have a good day. -Thank you.

394
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,690
You were rejected by IOU lots of times.

395
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,770
What are you trying to say?

396
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,780
I lost the eggs.

397
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,320
The cryo...

398
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,240
It's too loud. I can't hear you.

399
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,450
I said, I lost the eggs!

400
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,580
My eggs are in the cryogenic freezer,

401
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,790
but the password is between 0000 and 9999. One of 10, 000 combinations.

402
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,410
You know how to open it, right?

403
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,330
Yeah.

404
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,630
Try them all. It should take you about three days.

405
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,880
Come on, help a friend out, would you?

406
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,960
Isn't there some mathematical trick that can open it in three hours?

407
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,090
Nope.

408
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,840
Guess that's why there's no Nobel Prize for mathematics.

409
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:39,930
Come on, help me out here.

410
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,270
Just take a look.

411
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,190
Why is it so loud there?

412
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,140
Oh, that.

413
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,520
It's the centrifuge spinning.

414
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,820
It sounds like it's going to bust any second.

415
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,400
It's been like that for a while. They said it works fine.

416
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,490
It's just the sound.

417
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,700
If the centrifuge overheats,

418
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,370
the motor might spark and explode.

419
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,240
Then the fire alarm will go off,

420
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:03,040
and then mission control will shut down all power to the module.

421
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,040
The power will go off?

422
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,130
Then

423
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,510
the machines will shut down and the locks will unlock.

424
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,800
That's right.

425
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,470
They'll move all the experiments to another module before things get worse.

426
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,270
That's the protocol for a fire alarm.

427
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,520
Hang on.

428
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,230
It's not just the lab equipment that uses motors, right?

429
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,110
What are you up to?

430
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:40,490
Does this move only when it's in use?

431
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,080
The one in the space station stops if nobody is running. Why?

432
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,920
Then, couldn't I

433
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,500
use my body to start a fire with this?

434
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,710
Hey.

435
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,260
Don't worry. I won't do any damage to the experiments.

436
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,680
You're not going to run until the treadmill explodes

437
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,590
and sets off the fire alarm, are you?

438
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,140
You said if the alarm goes off,

439
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:04,140
the machines will shut down and the locks will disengage.

440
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,600
In zero gravity,

441
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,310
your heart can't pump as hard.

442
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:10,690
The oxygen your blood delivers drops by a quarter.

443
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,320
You'll die, you idiot. For real.

444
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,780
They'll be on a spacewalk for seven hours.

445
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,110
So when everyone is focused on the spacewalk,

446
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:22,530
I'm going to deactivate the locks on the cryogenic freezer

447
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,410
and take back my eggs.

448
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,120
Before the motor explodes,

449
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,040
your heart will explode, you idiot. You'll die.

450
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,630
You're going to die trying to make a baby.

451
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,810
Okay.

452
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,420
Really?

453
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,760
Hello?

454
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,310
Excuse me…

455
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,150
YOU MUST LOOK AT THIS EVERY DAY

456
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,410
Two men in different rooms with a picture of the same girl.

457
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:47,790
Miss Popular, Choi Go-eun.

458
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Mr. Gong.

459
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,170
Mr. Gong.

460
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,390
Indecency is pregnant.

461
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,760
Who?

462
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,390
Public's lady, Indecency. She's pregnant.

463
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:17,690
Do you know how hard it is mating in zero gravity?

464
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:21,740
They pulled that off even without being official test subjects.

465
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:25,360
If Kang-su finds out, he'll get jealous and take them away in a second.

466
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,370
-Kang Kang-su will? -Yes.

467
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:30,290
Are you saying that jerk will try to steal Public and Indecency?

468
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,870
He's in charge of the fruit flies.

469
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,330
But why?

470
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:36,290
These fruit flies aren't part of his experiments.

471
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,630
They walked…

472
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:40,300
I mean, they flew here of their own free will.

473
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,460
Shouldn't surprise me.

474
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,680
He's an expert at taking things that don't belong to him.

475
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:49,050
That's why we have to keep this from him no matter what.

476
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,390
If he gets his hands on them,

477
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:53,890
they'll be injected with drugs, like the test fruit flies.

478
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,190
And as test subjects,

479
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:58,440
they'll have to live in constant pain.

480
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,480
Even their mating will be studied.

481
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:03,780
And they'll be forced to breed and give birth, all for human benefit.

482
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,740
I mean, on the one hand, I feel bad for the other test subjects,

483
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,160
and I'm grateful to them too.

484
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,080
But on the other hand, these guys put their trust in us

485
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,210
and followed us to space.

486
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:16,870
We'll protect them and help them when they give birth.

487
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,880
And then when we go back, we'll help them adjust to life on Earth.

488
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,250
That's all I'm saying, okay?

489
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,260
I'm a doctor.

490
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,340
Pregnancies and births are my areas of expertise.

491
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,180
I'm the expert here, not that Kang Kang-su.

492
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,810
I can, you know, do a better job.

493
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:34,730
That's right.

494
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,900
I'm not going to let Kang Kang-su

495
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,650
take anything else from me.

496
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,070
Worried he's going to steal your girlfriend?

497
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,830
Come on out of there. Go to the CQ and get some sleep.

498
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,250
I can't sleep.

499
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,330
I'm becoming increasingly alert.

500
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,130
Let me take a look.

501
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,090
Oh boy, you also have a fever.

502
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,350
You must be worried the enemy will steal the heiress.

503
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,560
Your veins are about to pop.

504
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,100
Please, that's not true.

505
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,440
You're single, aren't you?

506
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,480
I too have a partner.

507
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:37,120
Later, when we get back to Earth, let's meet up sometime.

508
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,000
In a year?

509
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,920
We can do that, can't we?

510
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,180
My will.

511
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:55,760
What?

512
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,430
Just in case.

513
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,060
You're giving your will…

514
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,320
Read it after I leave.

515
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,700
You'll find the answer in there.

516
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,420
She's about to give birth.

517
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,420
See?

518
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,420
Did you see that?

519
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:32,590
Push.

520
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,600
Breathe, Indecency, breathe.

521
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,670
I see you called multiple times.

522
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:06,170
I called all night. Why didn't you pick up?

523
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,130
Is there anyone beside you?

524
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,920
Go somewhere you can be alone.

525
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,800
What?

526
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,590
Really?

527
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,470
Are you serious?

528
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:24,100
It's 500 billion won, Dona.

529
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,490
The prize money…

530
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,160
You have a year to claim the winnings, right?

531
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,990
Right, Mina?

532
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,410
It's still valid for another month.

533
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:43,290
We can still claim the money.

534
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,710
The lottery ticket is still valid.

535
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,800
We're going to be rich, Mina.

536
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,010
Dona.

537
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:55,050
But this ticket isn't ours.

538
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:58,140
You don't know who it belongs to. Nobody does.

539
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,930
Whoever lost it hasn't looked for it in a year.

540
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,440
It doesn't belong to anyone.

541
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:08,730
The person who wrote Stand by me is probably the owner.

542
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,480
You…

543
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:16,070
You need to hide that in a safe place, got it?

544
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,040
Return that ticket, and you can forget you have a twin.

545
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,580
Okay.

546
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:28,420
It's… It's 500 billion won.

547
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,410
I am rich!

548
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,760
Wow!

549
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,640
Thank you.

550
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:30,810
I am rich.

551
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,980
Thank you.

552
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,880
This is Seoul.

553
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,680
The 141st spacewalk mission is

554
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,890
to remove the damaged solar panel of the G.O-10.

555
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,300
GONG RYONG'S 3RD DAY

556
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:07,060
Okay, I just turned off all the power to the solar panels.

557
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,480
Copy. Radio check, over.

558
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,060
Radio check.

559
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,980
Radio is okay.

560
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:16,320
I'll keep the comms open in case there's an emergency, all right?

561
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,230
Copy.

562
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:20,200
The mission will be over with the robot arm

563
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,620
putting the disengaged panels into the trash cargo

564
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:27,620
once EV1 and EV2 remove the torn panels from the spacecraft.

565
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,710
If you see any sign of danger,

566
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:34,170
you two abort the mission and get back inside, okay?

567
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,840
EV1, copy.

568
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,000
Copy, Seoul.

569
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:39,630
EV: CALL SIGN FOR ASTRONAUTS WORKING OUTSIDE SPACECRAFT

570
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,050
EV1, departing ahead to the mission point.

571
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,950
DR. GONG RYONG

572
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,370
Hello, Dr. Na.

573
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,500
I'll ask this one last time as your doctor.

574
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,420
If you say you are fine with Kang Kang-su working on it,

575
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,920
I will step aside.

576
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,210
Do you want to put him in charge?

577
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,590
No.

578
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,880
Our situation

579
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:09,260
isn't just a simple case of inserting sperm into an egg.

580
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:11,850
We need you to monitor Dong-hun's sperm

581
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,850
to see if the genetic flaws are corrected

582
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,650
as it reshapes itself, ensuring successful fertilization

583
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:19,310
and embryonic development

584
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,230
up to the morula stage.

585
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:24,950
That's why I persuaded the chairman that it had to be you.

586
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,330
Right now, I'm about to steal back my eggs.

587
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,050
You have to do it yourself, no matter what.

588
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,050
I'm counting on you.

589
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,220
I'm going to get those eggs back, even if it kills me.

590
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,600
DR. NA MIN-JEONG

591
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,860
EV1, commencing work.

592
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,430
Seoul, the sun is coming back around.

593
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,560
Lower your sunshade. Hurry, or it could be disastrous.

594
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,560
EV1, copy.

595
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,680
EV2, copy.

596
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,740
On Earth, this would take ten seconds.

597
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,410
We've been doing this for ten minutes.

598
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,770
Careful, don't drop the screws.

599
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:02,770
Any lost tool can become a projectile and strike the space station.

600
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,270
EV1, copy.

601
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:05,560
EV2, copy.

602
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:30,300
EV1, I'm removing the last screw.

603
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,520
This one's a bit tighter than the last one.

604
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,040
Are you okay, Commander?

605
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,130
Geez!

606
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,960
Are you okay?

607
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,550
Eve, are you okay?

608
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,090
I'm fine.

609
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,720
You need to be careful, Eve.

610
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,930
Secure your footing first.

611
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:21,720
Copy.

612
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,160
Eve, if you grab too tightly, it's dangerous. Be careful and go slow.

613
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,410
That was a close one.

614
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,590
Okay, the screw's loose.

615
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:55,420
All you have to do now is pass the panel to the robot arm.

616
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:56,550
Copy.

617
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:05,120
Observation deck, the robot arm has grasped the folded solar panel.

618
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,750
Okay, EV1 and EV2

619
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:14,500
will now secure the folded solar panel with rope.

620
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:22,140
What's that?

621
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:25,140
Whose is that? What's happening?

622
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,310
What is going on?

623
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:28,100
-Is it the commander? -Is it Dr. Kang?

624
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:34,980
What's going on?

625
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,400
Dr. Kang. Is everything okay?

626
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:44,870
Everything

627
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,410
is not okay.

628
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,460
Kang Kang-su.

629
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,630
Nothing bad is going to happen to you just because I wished you ill, is it?

630
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:59,050
Come back.

631
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:01,470
Come back.

632
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:03,300
Hurry, come back.

633
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,270
What's your suit pressure reading?

634
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,520
EV2, 3.9 psia.

635
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:19,030
EV2, body temperature is 38 degrees and heart rate has dropped to 70.

636
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:20,440
Check your gloves.

637
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:24,240
No sign of a leak in the gloves.

638
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,200
I can't pinpoint the source of the leak.

639
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,200
Anything below 4.0 is cause for concern.

640
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:33,330
Dr. Kang, return to the station immediately.

641
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,920
No. I'm going to finish the job.

642
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,080
Dr. Kang, go back.

643
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:38,210
If the pressure drops, you'll be in trouble.

644
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:39,960
I should be done in less than ten minutes.

645
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,840
If you stay here, you'll make me too nervous to work.

646
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:48,470
Stop wasting precious oxygen, and get back inside.

647
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,350
What is it now?

648
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,110
That's the sound of the fire alarm in the space station.

649
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,730
What? Where in the space station?

650
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,720
It's the biological module.

651
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,140
A fire out of the blue?

652
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:32,890
The thing is, a few days ago,

653
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:35,690
the centrifuge motor started to sound a bit off.

654
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:37,770
It's possible that a spark came from there.

655
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:40,230
Is it empty? Is there someone in there?

656
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,690
Could Mr. Gong be in there?

657
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:43,690
Our crew is heading to the module now.

658
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,740
I don't see him on the CCTV. Where the hell could he be?

659
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,410
Is the lab equipment unlocked now?

660
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:51,080
Yes, they unlocked automatically.

661
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,080
Dr. Lee, first check if everyone is safe.

662
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,080
Once confirmed, now that the power is off and the locks are open,

663
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,380
hurry and move the samples to the main module before they thaw.

664
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,380
Copy.

665
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:07,590
Then is Mr. Gong in the biological module?

666
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,010
Are the locks open?

667
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:12,640
Stop being stubborn, and go back inside, Dr. Kang.

668
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,060
Hurry. That's an order!

669
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:15,890
I'm done here.

670
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:18,940
Go inside, Dr. Kang. The job here is almost complete.

671
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:25,820
I'm sorry.

672
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,560
Mr. Gong.

673
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,570
-Mr. Gong? -Mr. Gong.

674
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:05,070
Shit…

675
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:08,240
-Oh, my plants. I can't believe this. -Mr. Gong.

676
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:09,820
Where did he go?

677
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:10,820
Mr. Gong?

678
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:13,830
What are you doing over there?

679
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:15,120
I don't see a fire.

680
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,250
What is all that smoke?

681
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:25,170
Mr. Gong, what are you doing?

682
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,300
Shit.

683
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:34,510
That's mine!

684
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:37,850
I…

685
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:40,350
Are you okay? What are you doing?

686
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:42,940
Are you hurt?

687
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:44,560
No.

688
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:48,690
I was looking for the fire extinguisher.

689
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,610
I was on the treadmill,

690
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,660
and I saw smoke coming from the motor.

691
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,370
That's what caused the commotion.

692
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:56,450
Sorry about that.

693
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:00,660
Sorry. You must have been alarmed.

694
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:07,500
Just how fast were you running

695
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:09,840
to make the treadmill motor smoke?

696
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,800
Were you trying to kill yourself?

697
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,640
At that rate, your heart will explode.

698
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,300
Were you born with two hearts? Or maybe you have three.

699
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:18,680
Did your money buy you more than one heart?

700
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:20,220
Are you crazy?

701
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:22,230
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

702
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:24,020
What, is dying in space cool?

703
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,150
That's enough.

704
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:28,520
I told him to get some exercise while we were out here.

705
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:31,860
It was his first time working out here.

706
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,320
It's my fault. I didn't tell him how to work out.

707
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:36,030
How could he know?

708
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,500
Okay, let's drop it.

709
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:44,290
It's fine as long as Mr. Gong isn't hurt.

710
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:45,500
It's not a big deal.

711
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:49,920
The sensors are extremely sensitive, so the alarms sometimes go off, right?

712
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,880
Thankfully, it wasn't a big accident.

713
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:54,840
Hurry and restore power to the biological module.

714
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:57,140
Aren't the samples fine if it's been under three minutes?

715
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:00,350
-They can stay put, right? -Right. It hasn't even been a minute.

716
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:01,970
Okay.

717
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:11,820
I'm so sorry.

718
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,530
What's in your hand?

719
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:17,280
Huh?

720
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,750
Oh, this…

721
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,540
I brought this from Earth.

722
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:29,250
It's something I recorded for when I'm working out.

723
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:32,840
Do you want to listen?

724
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:36,680
Put that away. Screw your music.

725
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:42,310
From now on, you have to get our permission before working out.

726
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:44,100
Is that understood?

727
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,600
Yes.

728
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:49,110
First, go and get some rest. You must have been scared.

729
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:51,730
You might have caused some strain on your heart.

730
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:52,780
Okay.

731
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:56,860
Now where are you going?

732
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:01,280
Is it okay if I get some water?

733
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:03,200
Sure, let's go.

734
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:07,330
I'll get you some water. You go lie down in the CQ.

735
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:08,710
Okay.

736
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,880
EV2 has returned to the station.

737
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:18,760
I'm going to pick up the pace.

738
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:39,360
I connected the umbilical cable.

739
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:58,090
EV2, body temperature is 37 degrees, heart rate is 75 and stabilizing.

740
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,600
Don't go anywhere.

741
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:13,690
If you leave this room, we'll send you back to Earth immediately.

742
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,490
Stay put.

743
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:35,630
Finally…

744
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,430
I did it.

745
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,980
Seoul, that should be secure enough.

746
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:57,940
I'm going to wrap it one final time.

747
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,610
Let's see

748
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:24,950
what she wrote in her will.

749
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,620
Grab whatever you can, Eve.

750
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:30,430
I've got it.

751
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,060
She's got a hold of it.

752
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:36,020
Eve, are you okay?

753
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:39,190
Yes, I'm okay.

754
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:44,730
Hey, don't do this to me.

755
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:48,530
Are you hurt?

756
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:51,570
I'm sorry.

757
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:54,950
I think my glove is damaged.

758
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:57,910
What?

759
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,540
How bad is the damage? Is it a suit pressure emergency?

760
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:04,920
SPACE SUIT PRESSURE LEAK CODE

761
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:09,130
A piece of the panel at least 6 mm in size

762
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,550
appears to have penetrated the pressurized layer.

763
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,300
So, are you hurt? How bad is it, Eve?

764
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:15,060
Enough that my palm stings.

765
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:17,850
But I don't think it's cut.

766
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:21,270
Don't move your hand.

767
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:23,860
If you do, you'll lose oxygen and become unconscious in 15 seconds.

768
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:26,400
Then fatal damage to your organs after a minute.

769
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,360
Copy.

770
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,610
Screw the solar panels. Get back inside, now.

771
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,240
Mina, get ready to pull her in.

772
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,360
Copy, airlock.

773
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,200
Okay. Don't move your hand.

774
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:39,750
I'm going to move the solar panel with the commander to the airlock door.

775
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:41,750
Eve, unhook the safety tether.

776
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,390
I think the hook is broken.

777
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:01,810
It won't open.

778
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:05,110
Then you have to release the safety tether attached to G.O-10.

779
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,530
Commander, can you do it?

780
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:12,320
I'll try. Get me as close as you can.

781
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:36,300
Okay.

782
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:57,990
Commander, can you reach?

783
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:02,620
The solar panel is too wide. I can't reach it.

784
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:06,710
Rotate it at an angle and try to get me closer.

785
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:08,460
Okay, I'll try rotating it.

786
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:21,310
Okay, EV1 is approaching.

787
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:33,940
Shit.

788
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:35,740
Are you okay, Eve?

789
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:38,950
I'm okay.

790
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:42,410
I can't bring you any closer.

791
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:44,830
Okay.

792
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:02,470
Commander, no.

793
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,380
I'm losing my mind here.

794
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,840
Hey, Seung-jun.

795
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:48,810
Dr. Lee.

796
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:51,440
Airlock 1, I'm going to go and unhook the safety tether.

797
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:56,650
Guys, I'm going to Airlock 2. It'll be faster to decompress from there.

798
00:58:56,740 --> 00:59:00,240
No, Santi. Someone has to cover the robot arm.

799
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,410
He's right, Santi. Hold your position.

800
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:03,990
I need you to stay there.

801
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,080
For Christ's sake!

802
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:08,250
Please.

803
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:10,170
Come on.

804
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:30,230
EV1, body temperature 37.3 degrees, your heart rate…

805
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:31,730
Fifty-seven?

806
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,740
Eve, check your glove. Is the hole bigger?

807
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:39,190
Her ECG levels are falling.

808
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,320
EV1, check your CO2 levels.

809
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:43,160
EV1?

810
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,410
EV1?

811
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:53,880
Eve!

812
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,170
Eve, stay with me.

813
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:02,050
Eve!

814
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,140
Stay with me, Eve!

815
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:06,970
Open your eyes, Eve. Are you okay?

816
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:08,970
Stay awake!

817
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:44,550
Eve!

818
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:11,160
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

819
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,830
EV1's heart rate is dropping fast.

820
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:16,000
I think I'm fine.

821
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,130
Look at me. Eve!

822
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:22,510
CEO Choi Go-Eun has announced her engagement to Dr. Gong Ryong.

823
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:24,470
I miss you.

824
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:26,390
Please make it home safe and sound.

825
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:27,300
PRESS CONFERENCE

826
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:30,720
This lottery ticket belongs to whoever wrote Stand by me.

827
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:33,180
Later on, help me just one time, no questions asked.

828
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:35,190
I guess you can't do anything now.

829
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:36,980
Let me clue you in on something.

830
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:39,440
The eggs are back in my possession.

831
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:41,820
I won't give up.

832
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,190
I'm not going back empty-handed.

833
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:49,740
