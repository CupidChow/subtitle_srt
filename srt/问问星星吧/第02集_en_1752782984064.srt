1
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:47,964
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

2
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:52,093
Guess which creatures currently dominate the population on the space station.

3
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:55,388
Topping the list are 30, 000 fruit flies,

4
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,558
with 80 mice coming in second.

5
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:02,687
The real owners of the space station, which can house up to nine astronauts,

6
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,105
may be fruit flies and mice.

7
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,650
Since humans and mice share 85 percent of their genes,

8
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,402
studying mice in zero gravity

9
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,655
provides a glimpse into how humans might adapt to space.

10
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,659
Most of human gene functions have been discovered through studies on fruit flies.

11
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:20,747
As you can see, the reality of the space station is quite different

12
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,499
from what we might imagine.

13
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,919
Let's hear more from Chief Kang Tae-hui at the Seoul Mission Control Center.

14
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,962
The space station's zero-gravity environment

15
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:31,257
enables experiments that can't be conducted under Earth's gravity.

16
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,259
The space station's true purpose is

17
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,012
to study how the human cardiovascular, musculoskeletal,

18
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:39,182
neuroendocrine, and immune systems are affected in space,

19
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,601
using fruit flies and mice for testing.

20
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,646
The Expedition 3 team, which recently embarked on their space mission,

21
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,982
is ready to break new ground once again.

22
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:52,695
Here's an interview with Commander Eve Kim of Expedition 3.

23
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:56,950
Our mission is to attempt mating, pregnancy, and breeding in mice again.

24
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,077
Fruit flies, minnows, and cockroaches

25
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,247
are the only species to have successfully reproduced in space.

26
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,331
Mice, like us humans…

27
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,833
Sir, they'll be docking soon.

28
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,668
…have never mated,

29
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,712
become pregnant, or given birth in space.

30
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,131
For humans to sustain life

31
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,717
and reproduce in space, mice must first succeed in breeding.

32
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,303
Now, what's the mission of the space tourist

33
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,181
who paid a whopping 70 billion won to join them?

34
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,109
G.O-10, approximately 400 meters until rendezvous.

35
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,193
Copy.

36
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,278
Copy.

37
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,864
Initiating the fly-around.

38
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,285
Onboard navigation is working fine.

39
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:44,789
Standing by for contingency manual docking. Over.

40
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,541
Copy that.

41
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,744
Rotation is nominal.

42
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,996
Engine operation, normal.

43
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,707
150 meters to the ILS.

44
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,002
Changing direction from the Kurs antenna to the docking point.

45
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,963
G.O-10 approaching the ILS.

46
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,506
Stand by for contact.

47
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,550
All right, we're about to dock now.

48
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,385
-Engage your core, sir. -Okay.

49
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,127
Checking the crosshair alignment.

50
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,981
Contact?

51
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,109
Crosshairs are not aligned.

52
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,694
Oh, man.

53
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,195
Stand by for manual docking.

54
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,545
Come on, man.

55
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,673
Contact?

56
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,010
G.O-10 retrying for the alignment.

57
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,345
Five feet.

58
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,638
Three.

59
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,015
Two.

60
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,099
One.

61
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,727
Target in the center.

62
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,062
Here we go, G.O-10. Yeah.

63
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,606
Good boy.

64
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,621
This is IOU. Contact and capture confirmed.

65
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,165
Docking…

66
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:34,834
complete.

67
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:44,343
Contact and capture confirmed at 16:20 central time, 17:20 eastern time.

68
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,305
Two vehicles are flying high above the Pacific Ocean,

69
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,890
just to the west of Peru.

70
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,934
They have finally docked successfully.

71
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:53,770
It's on.

72
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,772
It's on! The doping was successful!

73
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,523
It's docking,  okay?

74
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,568
Oh, thank God in heaven.

75
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:06,240
Victory!

76
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,661
Leak test, complete.

77
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,457
Both docking area completely sealed.

78
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,585
Perfect!

79
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,222
Nice.

80
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,224
Docking area sealed, okay?

81
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,731
Station IOU and Spaceship G.O-10,

82
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,691
you have a go for Step 6.

83
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,235
Ingressing ILS.

84
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,116
Finally, the space station.

85
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,327
Commander, I'm nervous.

86
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,666
I told them several times to make it longer!

87
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,001
It gets tight in my crotch in zero gravity.

88
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,294
I grow taller here.

89
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,215
-You haven't knocked yet, have you? -Not yet.

90
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,801
All right. We'll knock on our side first,

91
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,679
and if we hear them knock back, it means the docking was successful.

92
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,597
Santi, lead the way.

93
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,974
No, you got it.

94
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,394
We don't have all day, Commander.

95
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,812
EVE: COMMANDER OF EXPEDITION 3

96
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:18,729
Okay.

97
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,899
When they open the hatch and enter, it'll be broadcast live worldwide.

98
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,901
Let's make sure not to touch this part.

99
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,069
Okay.

100
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,616
Our voices won't be broadcast to Earth, right?

101
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,703
Will they?

102
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,775
Ready?

103
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,281
Wait.

104
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,908
-What is it? -Hang on.

105
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,703
Me too.

106
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:19,832
What's that?

107
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,251
I know better than to show up empty-handed

108
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,754
when I'm invited to someone's house.

109
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,675
What on earth is it?

110
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,052
It's a housewarming gift.

111
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,433
Let's open her up, Commander.

112
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,518
Ready?

113
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,237
What's up?

114
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,573
We are not the only ones here.

115
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:54,867
What?

116
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,999
When did these guys get on?

117
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,920
Did a couple of fruit flies sneak on board and travel here from Earth?

118
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,548
Can you believe these guys?

119
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,384
I paid 70 billion, and they got a free ride?

120
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,886
Hey, how much did you guys pay?

121
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,726
No! Stop it.

122
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,895
It's a miracle they're here. Don't kill them.

123
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,027
No, don't.

124
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,158
You can't just sneeze them out.

125
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,619
Use your words, will you?

126
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,329
They can't understand me.

127
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,375
Did you just hit me

128
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:48,504
to get back at me for stitching up your toes without anesthesia?

129
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,089
Shush.

130
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,845
They're not some test subjects that were pumped full of drugs to get here.

131
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,472
They're the first living creatures to come to space

132
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,433
on their own, sitting on a banana.

133
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,648
Santi, go buy some time. Go!

134
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,191
-Eve. -Go!

135
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:23,831
What's the holdup?

136
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,335
What's going on?

137
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,004
Why aren't they opening it?

138
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,381
What are they doing?

139
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,138
Hey, where are you going?

140
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,939
The male was chasing the female, and now he's finally sitting down

141
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,859
and licking her butthole.

142
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,403
They're about to mate.

143
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,448
What's the big deal about a stupid fruit fly chasing after a female

144
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,784
and leaking her butthole?

145
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,243
You slapped me for that?

146
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,955
Don't you see? These guys are doing something even humans can't do.

147
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,042
They're creating life in space, which is incredible.

148
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,046
Look at that.

149
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,590
The male is flapping his wings…

150
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,593
Oh, my God. Do you see how he's making noise with his wings?

151
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:21,806
He's trying to impress the female with everything he's got.

152
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,891
Gosh, it's so noisy…

153
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,394
I've got to observe this. Wait.

154
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,479
Don't touch them, okay?

155
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,272
Touch them? I'm not doing anything.

156
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,025
Hold on a minute, guys.

157
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,073
Look.

158
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,534
The male is holding the female with his front legs

159
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,495
and bending his abdomen like this. Can you see it?

160
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:45,996
You have to see this. Come on!

161
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,581
Wow, come look!

162
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,795
Oh, my goodness. Look at that.

163
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:55,840
Oh, gosh.

164
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,635
Hold it like this, Dr. Gong.

165
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,638
You see it, right? Can you see it?

166
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,557
-Oh, I can see it. -Right?

167
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,228
That's risqué.

168
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,646
All right, okay.

169
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,191
-They only need 20 minutes. -What? 20 minutes?

170
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,776
They last longer than humans.

171
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,156
Quiet.

172
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,367
Wait, fruit flies can keep going for 20 minutes?

173
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,121
On Earth, they risk getting eaten by dragonflies

174
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,957
and still manage to go for 20 minutes.

175
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,168
They literally put their lives on the line.

176
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,670
And look where we are now. We're in space.

177
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,505
They're doing it in space, all right?

178
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,590
This is

179
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,051
an incredible moment where they're creating life.

180
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,930
They're doing something that mice,

181
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,391
which represent all mammals, have never succeeded at

182
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,143
in zero gravity, let alone humans.

183
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,938
We have to wait for them to finish.

184
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,607
We absolutely do.

185
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,485
Eve.

186
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,905
-Yeah? -Let me get this straight.

187
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,449
So you want to make everyone on Earth

188
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:07,828
wait 20 minutes for these fruit flies? Is that it?

189
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,541
You're just…

190
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,673
You're really enjoying this.

191
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,634
Just look.

192
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:24,845
They're going at it.

193
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,973
You got this!

194
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,141
That's it!

195
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:41,862
EXPEDITION 3 DOCKED

196
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:46,408
It seems the hatch hasn't opened yet.

197
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,620
As soon as it does, we'll connect with the Mission Control Center

198
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,580
and bring you the live feed.

199
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,875
We at MZ Group, a leading global enterprise

200
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,336
that delivers new value with cutting-edge technology,

201
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,881
carried out the 2023-MS-01 Project through our MZ Central Research Center,

202
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:05,553
which is equipped with proprietary technological expertise.

203
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,430
Let me start by briefly explaining the products.

204
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,766
What the heck is taking so long?

205
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,102
Right. I'll make it quick, sir.

206
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,145
The first one is a cooler.

207
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,731
It weighs 950 g and is made with…

208
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,984
-…the third to enter. -What's taking so long?

209
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,485
-Once he does… -He's in space.

210
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:25,114
…he will have the honor of becoming the 458th visitor.

211
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,074
Fruit flies?

212
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,284
What in the hell…

213
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,788
They're not even official test subjects

214
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,916
but just some stupid flies that hitched a ride. Are you telling us

215
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,878
to delay the docking and wait for them to finish their business?

216
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,629
Are you insane? This is a big moment.

217
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,757
Tell her to open the hatch right now.

218
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,469
With all due respect,

219
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:51,015
they are doing it on the knob

220
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:54,059
right now, so opening the hatch would effectively

221
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,270
kill the mood.

222
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,899
So, I mean, we could not do it,

223
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:04,028
and maybe they would run into a wall or we would step on one of them…

224
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,406
But this is a pleasant surprise, so…

225
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,826
I guess all she needs is 20 minutes.

226
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,121
You think this is funny?

227
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,292
Eve, that goofball. Just when you think she's doing great,

228
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,543
she pulls this crap.

229
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,795
She's got a knack for driving you up the wall.

230
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,756
Come on, the flies are making love.

231
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,009
Why are you here? Go start your new, better-paying job.

232
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,302
Get out!

233
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,724
Listen, make sure no one talks about the fruit flies on air.

234
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,728
How about they open it from the other side?

235
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,106
No, right? That's never happened.

236
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,945
What's going on?

237
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,948
Should we just open it?

238
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:53,202
I don't think it's ever been opened from this side before.

239
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:22,022
I thought you were the type to never break the rules.

240
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,067
In space, there's no rule

241
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,987
more important than protecting and creating life.

242
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,115
Even though they only live for 50 days, fruit flies are no exception.

243
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,836
-Eve. -Call me commander.

244
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,004
Why?

245
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,881
I like your name. It reminds me of Christmas Eve.

246
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,759
I hate Christmas Eve more than anything.

247
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:57,766
Commander.

248
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,769
Let's give these guys some names.

249
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,730
This is a remarkable twist of fate.

250
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,566
They risked their lives to come all the way to space with us.

251
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,776
For the male, how about…

252
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,571
Public?

253
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,198
-What? -And for the female…

254
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:15,617
Indecency.

255
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,495
-Are you joking? -I'm not joking.

256
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:23,167
Public and Indecency. I think they're the perfect names.

257
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,376
Forget it.

258
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,337
Public and Indecency. I like it.

259
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,964
That's not what they were doing.

260
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,382
That's exactly what it was.

261
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:34,094
-Sir. -For God's sake, stop calling me sir.

262
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,262
I hate that.

263
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,015
Don't you think you're too fixated on those flies?

264
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:41,393
That slap across my face was a clear sign.

265
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,772
Nothing better comes to mind?

266
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,691
It's settled then. They're Public and Indecency.

267
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,693
They're not your pet flies, sir.

268
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:52,780
Eve.

269
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,909
-Eve? -Call me commander.

270
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,911
You're awesome.

271
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,831
Call me commander.

272
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,832
Eve.

273
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:08,504
Eve.

274
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,258
MCC, it is taking a little longer

275
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,261
than anticipated to seal the deal.

276
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,681
The large MZ Confectionery logo adds promotional potential as well.

277
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,101
Why won't they go into the space station?

278
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,019
What if the ice cream melts?

279
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,187
Won't it be game over?

280
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,941
Yes, it's all over if it melts.

281
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,776
Is there something wrong?

282
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,737
What if Ryong was scorched by that lightning from earlier?

283
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,280
Come on, don't say that.

284
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,783
It's not easy to get hit by lightning.

285
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,244
Our team is coordinating with the control center

286
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,538
to check if there are any issues.

287
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,456
We'll update you as soon as

288
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,083
-we have more information. -Na-mi.

289
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,503
Our son can't marry the heiress unless he risks his life in space, right?

290
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,839
Otherwise the chairman won't approve?

291
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,550
Come on, Ryong said that wasn't true.

292
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,051
Of course it's true.

293
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,887
The chairman still hasn't given his blessing because of us.

294
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,931
His three moms work at a bar.

295
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,767
Would you like that if you were the chairman?

296
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,937
-We've just been informed… -Ryong is coming out.

297
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,648
-Oh, he's coming out! -…the hatch is about to open.

298
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:12,151
-He's coming out! -We'll switch to the live feed.

299
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,862
All right, everyone. The hatch will now open.

300
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,197
HATCH OPENING LIVE

301
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,282
Here they come.

302
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,450
This is Mission Control, IOU.

303
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:25,956
Official hatch opening time for G.O-10 spacecraft, 22:35 UTC.

304
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,374
Mina!

305
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:30,335
-We've been eagerly waiting for you guys! -Come on.

306
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,839
Let's go.

307
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,799
Commander.

308
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,428
Do you like babies?

309
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,390
Babies. Do you like them?

310
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,809
Who doesn't like babies?

311
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:48,979
All right, then.

312
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,645
Hola, buenos días. Hello.

313
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,521
Hi to everyone.

314
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,276
Ho, ho, ho. Santa Claus came early this year.

315
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,403
Got you guys a special delivery.

316
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,322
A little something, something.

317
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,409
Ta-da!

318
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,624
Wow, you guys are more excited to see those guys than to see us guys.

319
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,335
-You can tell? -Well, no kidding.

320
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,753
Hello, everyone.

321
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:55,837
Hey!

322
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,047
How have you been?

323
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,050
Eve! I missed you!

324
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,551
Long time no see.

325
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,851
If I can just get used to this zero gravity, I can pull it off.

326
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,271
I've practiced a million times.

327
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,480
I can totally do it.

328
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,529
Everyone, this is Mr. Gong Ryong, the tourist.

329
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,613
Say hello.

330
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,993
Oh, hello.

331
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,202
Hello.

332
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,079
Hello.

333
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,877
I… I'm Gong Ryong.

334
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:41,216
But why is our Ryong the only one flailing like that?

335
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,135
…but he certainly looks excited.

336
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,219
SPACE STATION ARRIVAL

337
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:48,098
I have no idea what's going on over there

338
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:50,684
because I can't hear them.

339
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,561
Look closely. See if he's okay.

340
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,480
Starting on the 6th, Mr. Gong Ryong will spend 10 days…

341
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,274
Our boy looks handsome.

342
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,860
There's no one better.

343
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,236
No one even compares.

344
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,780
He made it. It's all good.

345
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,365
Well done, baby.

346
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,745
Great work, everyone.

347
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,247
-Great work. -Good job, everyone.

348
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,499
-Good work. -Thank you.

349
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,251
All right, I'll be leaving now.

350
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,794
Are you crazy? Don't be absurd.

351
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,879
What? Why?

352
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,550
Look at you. You all look taller,

353
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:26,178
and your skin looks younger than when I saw you on Earth.

354
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,055
Doesn't this zero gravity

355
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,724
make me look at least three years younger than Dona?

356
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:31,850
Maybe you're right.

357
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,772
It even straightened out Santi's misshapen sperm two years ago.

358
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,941
So, how long did it take to get back to your original state?

359
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,694
Oh, gosh. It didn't even last on my way home.

360
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,696
I wish I would've shown my wife.

361
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,365
I feel like every time I reenter the atmosphere,

362
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,617
I get wrinkled.

363
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:53,538
Zero gravity is both a blessing and a curse.

364
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,040
I'm sorry.

365
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,375
By the way, did you come empty-handed?

366
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,919
Where's the thing I asked for?

367
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,047
But why would you of all people…

368
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,425
Is this what you wanted?

369
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,344
Yes, okay.

370
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:10,514
You have to share your fruit fly pregnancy experiment with me now.

371
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:11,431
All right.

372
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,016
Are those lottery tickets?

373
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,435
Did you get one for all of us?

374
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,314
Hey, we can all watch the numbers together tomorrow!

375
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:23,235
But Dr. Kang, what's the point of you winning the jackpot?

376
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,112
-You already have more money. -Oh, sorry.

377
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:28,073
That's not my money. It's my father's.

378
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:31,993
You okay there?

379
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,371
Yeah, I'm fine.

380
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:40,127
Actually… I also brought a gift.

381
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,090
Regalo.

382
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,845
Following tradition,

383
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,806
the astronauts who just arrived are having a welcome ceremony

384
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,975
with the three astronauts already residing…

385
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,310
Father, I think

386
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:01,231
there might be a way to give you a grandchild.

387
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,652
Is this

388
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,029
really possible?

389
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,742
Your body is compressed and distorted by gravity on Earth,

390
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,995
but in space, it returns to its natural state.

391
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:18,331
The spine stretches, making you taller, wrinkles smooth out,

392
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:21,209
and even the telomeres at the ends of chromosomes lengthen,

393
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,836
all thanks to zero gravity.

394
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,339
Astronaut Santiago says in that report that his crooked sperm became straight.

395
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,008
It's similar to Dong-hun's case.

396
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,260
-So then… -There's a chance

397
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,889
Dong-hun's sperm will regain normal function in space.

398
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,349
Once restored, we can inject them into my eggs

399
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,934
and create an embryo through IVF.

400
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,394
We should try it right away.

401
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,689
Who should we send up there?

402
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,860
Send Dr. Gong Ryong into space.

403
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:56,828
What's that?

404
00:24:58,747 --> 00:24:59,664
Ice cream?

405
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,376
How did he know they go crazy for ice cream?

406
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,629
You miss that soft, melting sensation up there.

407
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,923
They don't have anything like that.

408
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,633
That's a nice touch.

409
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,427
I bet he's trying to promote MZ Confectionery ice cream.

410
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,095
It's a PR stunt.

411
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:19,392
No one has ever taken human eggs up to the space station, sir.

412
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:22,646
How will you keep the eggs frozen and sneak them in

413
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,981
without declaring them?

414
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,733
When they tested human sperm before,

415
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:29,945
it was only to check the astronauts' health.

416
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,113
The IOU would never allow

417
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,741
human life to be created in space!

418
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,661
If I get caught, I won't be the only one getting punished.

419
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,621
It'll ruin MZ Group, your entire business.

420
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:46,753
Isn't sperm often sent up to space for experiments?

421
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,757
I'll have Dong-hun's sperm sent there on a cargo ship in advance.

422
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,760
All you have to do is sneak in the eggs.

423
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,429
If you manage to create an embryo using Dong-hun's sperm

424
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,098
and bring me a grandchild,

425
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:01,434
I'll seriously reconsider your relationship with Go-eun.

426
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,812
No, forget it. I can't.

427
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:04,771
Hey!

428
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:07,816
I'm not asking you to kill someone or steal something, am I?

429
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,193
Min-jeong wants to be a mom, and I want a grandkid.

430
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,070
You're not considering our feelings.

431
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:15,573
Are those stupid IOU rules more important to you?

432
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,534
Go-eun can't have kids either.

433
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:20,453
You ended our family line, so you need to take responsibility!

434
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:23,748
I ended your family line? That's ridiculous!

435
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,128
I'll let you marry Go-eun.

436
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,797
Even if you offered me your entire fortune, I wouldn't go.

437
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,382
I mean, I can't.

438
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,760
And don't try to use a child as leverage.

439
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:39,139
You can't make deals with human life.

440
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,019
Come on, kid!

441
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,230
If you have to go through with this,

442
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:50,025
get an ICSI specialist instead.

443
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,277
The procedure needs to be performed

444
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,321
by a specialist, not an ob-gyn.

445
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:58,658
There are plenty of great ICSI specialists at the MZ Medical Center.

446
00:26:58,742 --> 00:26:59,951
Look.

447
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:03,830
Who am I supposed to spill this huge secret to?

448
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,707
You're board certified for ICSI.

449
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,667
You got certified in the US.

450
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,503
Come on, we're family.

451
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,381
I'm trusting you with this because you'll join my family soon.

452
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,508
Who else could I trust with something this big?

453
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,762
I told you, I haven't done it even once since coming back to Korea!

454
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,847
You're the only one I can ask.

455
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,100
I should give up?

456
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:29,856
I became a pediatrician because I love kids.

457
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,611
I even got married to have my own children.

458
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,655
Now that I know there's a way,

459
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,701
how do you expect me to just give up?

460
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:47,999
You're the one who told me to keep trying without giving up.

461
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:51,336
Dr. Gong, why can't I hear the thing

462
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,381
that you've said a million times?

463
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,632
Congratulations

464
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,258
on becoming a mother.

465
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,053
That's the best thing I could ever hope to hear.

466
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:02,806
Please let me hear it too.

467
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,101
Ta-da!

468
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,603
Which flavor would you like?

469
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:10,855
I'll take strawberry.

470
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,857
Oh, but…

471
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,693
Oh, come on. Strawberry is…

472
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,155
Give me one too. Me! I'm next.

473
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,242
For you, Ms. Mina Lee, almond.

474
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,410
Thank you.

475
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,287
For you, Mr. Lee Seung-jun, chocolate.

476
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,455
Wow, thank you.

477
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,291
Now, Santi, you get cherry.

SANTI: OBSERVATION MODULE

482
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,928
Commander, you get mango.

483
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,687
I'll have vanilla.

484
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,565
So this is my gift to you.

485
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:56,234
I picked them according to your tastes!

486
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,325
Did you declare all that?

487
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,370
Declare?

488
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:10,749
Oh, why is she dragging it out like that?

489
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,544
I mean, what if he gets caught?

490
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,507
Once you're done, tear off the bottom.

491
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,766
That's the secret space.

492
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:31,227
I'll put the eggs under the vanilla ice cream.

493
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,688
Yeah, did you declare it?

494
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:38,151
The personal privilege kit is the only storage assigned to you.

495
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,527
It's small,

496
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,488
and you have to pay by the weight.

497
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,239
You're the first tourist

498
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:46,034
to fill that expensive, valuable space with ice cream.

499
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,244
Of course I did.

500
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,580
Right.

501
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,041
Then can I have the vanilla?

502
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,918
What? No, I…

503
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,003
Hey! Wait, that's…

504
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,342
The commander just took the vanilla.

505
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,219
Oh, no.

506
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,699
The genius scientist who was nominated for a Nobel Prize.

00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,910

They're studying the differences in human aging and diseases

516
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,727

526
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,306

Commander!

533
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,789

Hey, give it back!

540
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,141
I… I can't eat mango!

541
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,520
Hey, give it back.

542
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,316
Give it back! That's mine!

543
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,905
Why are you obsessing over this?

544
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:31,616
You're the one who's obsessing, not me.

545
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,535
I asked you if you declared this.

546
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,288
How many times do I have to tell you? I did declare it.

547
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,458
I told them I was bringing ice cream and paid for it too.

548
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,251
They opened each one

549
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,671
and checked what was inside.

550
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:47,173
Just ask the IOU or the Mission Control Center

551
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,842
and save me the trouble, okay?

552
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,889
You declared five cups of ice cream.

553
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,980
There are five of us on the space station crew, including me.

554
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:06,025
So you brought five housewarming gifts.

555
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,068
That's fine.

556
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,654
But with this vanilla ice cream, there are six in total.

557
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:14,784
One of them…

558
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,453
is for me.

559
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,998
It's for me.

560
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,959
What? I don't need to declare the one that I'm having, do I?

561
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:26,421
I put one more tiny cup of ice cream for myself

562
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:29,090
in my personal storage, which I paid for.

563
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,718
Should I just sit and suck my finger while you eat?

564
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,262
Why are you treating me like some kind of criminal

565
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,765
just because I brought an extra one for myself too?

566
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,183
If it's not declared,

567
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,728
you can't bring anything up here, even if it's a gift.

568
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:44,939
You have to pay by weight for your personal items, right?

569
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,483
It costs over 100, 000 won per gram.

570
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,111
So this one cup of ice cream is worth over ten million.

571
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,322
Why would you spend that kind of money on us?

572
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:54,699
You paid 70 billion to come,

573
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:57,201
so you're entitled to enjoy your money's worth.

574
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,662
So why are you trying to win us over?

575
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,164
Why are you buttering us up?

576
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,291
You're acting suspicious.

577
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,585
Is this some kind of drug?

578
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,919
Why didn't you declare it?

579
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,173
Did you bring some dangerous substance

580
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,091
to mess up our experiments or something?

581
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:13,468
If so, come clean.

582
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:16,471
Did you bring some frozen poison

583
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,057
to harm us astronauts? Is that it?

584
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,141
Look.

585
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:21,851
I'm a doctor.

586
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:24,270
I save people's lives. That's what I do.

587
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:27,523
Do I look like someone who's here to harm you people?

588
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,776
I'm even more suspicious because you're a doctor.

589
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:30,860
What?

590
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,571
What is your problem?

591
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,532
You're familiar with drugs.

592
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,536
Let me eat it and prove it, then.

593
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,997
I'll eat the ice cream, and that will prove it, right?

594
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,791
If there's really poison in it,

595
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:47,001
I'll die if I eat it. Problem solved, right?

596
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,087
Give it to me.

597
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,590
Come on, give it! I'll just eat it and die right here.

598
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,929
Let's melt it and see what you've hidden in here.

599
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:02,892
No!

600
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,819
Don't move.

601
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:29,585
That 70 billion wasn't even his money. His girlfriend paid for it.

602
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:33,464
All he has to do is snap a few pictures up here with her company phone.

603
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,591
Must be nice.

604
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,803
So is the tourist marrying the heiress or not?

605
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:42,557
Apparently, he even quit his ob-gyn job to marry her.

606
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,599
What?

607
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,560
It's nothing.

608
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,897
They say he's just after her money.

609
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:53,568
He's pretending to be in love with her and even came to space for it.

610
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,778
Everyone's talking about it. He's ambitious.

611
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,572
What is it? Tell me.

612
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,157
Don't worry about it.

613
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,283
Does Eve know?

614
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:03,244
That's why she was against him coming along.

615
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,790
Come on, I want to know. Please?

616
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,877
We're just gossiping.

617
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,044
You don't need to know.

618
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:14,922
Fine.

619
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:43,993
Hey, wait!

620
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,079
Keep still.

621
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,128
My ice cream.

622
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,581
Where are the spoons?

623
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,291
Oh, here they are.

624
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:37,463
Let's eat.

625
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,098
I'm sorry I suspected you.

626
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:51,102
Hey, is it good? Let's share it.

627
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,187
No, not with someone so scary!

628
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,484
Come on, just one bite.

629
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:04,115
Hey, don't eat it all. Let me taste…

630
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:05,908
You finished it?

631
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,327
You're kidding.

632
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,456
It's just vanilla.

633
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,253
No! Don't…

634
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,879
This is the important part.

635
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,881
In space, you need to reduce

636
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:24,719
the size of your trash like this, okay?

637
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,346
Now, come here.

638
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,641
It says trash here, right? Put the trash in,

639
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,352
and make sure you seal it tight, got it?

640
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:36,230
Otherwise, the trash might float back up.

641
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,984
I will never forgive you.

642
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,571
I hope you enjoy your stay here.

643
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,241
Enjoy my stay? Are you kidding me?

644
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,617
Just move.

645
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,958
Why are you so worked up?

646
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,087
What do I do?

647
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,090
-What do I do? -Oh, and…

648
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:08,262
You'll hurt yourself if you keep flailing like that.

649
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,767
We all once lived in the amniotic fluid of our moms' wombs.

650
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,394
Imagine this is your mom's womb.

651
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:18,064
Don't fight zero gravity. Just relax,

652
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,649
and try to move naturally like a fetus.

653
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,151
You'll get the hang of it.

654
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:27,990
What the hell is she talking about?

655
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,539
Wait, what?

656
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:39,460
Shoot.

657
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,338
What?

658
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:50,638
Shoot.

659
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:06,862
Are you sure?

660
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:07,947
Yes, I'm sure.

661
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,577
The eggs seem healthy.

662
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,871
All right!

663
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,373
We're good to go, then.

664
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,337
I've got the eggs now,

665
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,882
and I also got Dong-hun's sperm

666
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:31,595
from the cargo ship and stored it in the portable freezer you sent.

667
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:37,643
I'll proceed as scheduled.

668
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,729
Sir.

669
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,731
What's going on here?

670
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,737
Dr. Kang has the eggs?

671
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,073
Why is he doing what Ryong was supposed to do?

672
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,244
Ryong did a good job with the delivery.

673
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:56,871
Tell him to enjoy the tour.

674
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:02,209
Dr. Gong knows my eggs better than anyone.

675
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,295
He has to be the one to do it.

676
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,881
What do you think that clown can do in zero gravity?

677
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,090
Come to your senses!

678
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,903
Darn it.

679
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:32,990
Which way is it?

680
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,875
Guys, where are you?

681
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,002
Where are they?

682
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,095
GO-EUN

683
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,352
Hey, Go-eun.

684
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:02,520
Ryong, hi.

685
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:04,605
I'm looking for it.

686
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,857
I'm on my way to check the other ice cream cups.

687
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,025
Don't worry, I'll find it.

688
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:11,278
I'm sorry.

689
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,822
Why are you apologizing?

690
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,242
Listen.

691
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,955
You're just a delivery man.

692
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,708
My dad tricked you.

693
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:28,921
Your job was just to deliver the eggs to the space station as a guest.

694
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,674
Kang Kang-su will do the fertilization.

695
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,133
-What? -That was the plan all along.

696
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,010
My dad lied to us.

697
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,513
Who?

698
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:41,684
Your ex-boyfriend?

699
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,604
That Kang Kang-su?

700
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:46,981
Mr. Selfish Gene?

701
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,359
What do we do now?

702
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:52,486
Are you talking about that fucker?

703
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,697
Hey, Eve.

704
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,366
A grumpy male mouse is having trouble adjusting.

705
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,619
Are you talking about Male Mouse 1?

706
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:01,745
Yeah.

707
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,963
He was the sweetest one back on Earth.

708
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:16,302
Is zero gravity too much for you? What's wrong, buddy?

709
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,095
Hey.

710
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:21,390
How's the tourist handling zero gravity?

711
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:24,977
Well, he'll probably get the hang of it just in time to leave.

712
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:28,564
Oh, right.

713
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:32,192
Listen, I rushed out of the house and left my TV on.

714
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,403
Could you send someone to turn it off?

715
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,572
-I don't want a crazy electricity bill. -Okay.

716
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:37,698
Don't worry about it.

717
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,117
Just make sure you get a mouse pregnant this time.

718
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,285
Let's win the Nobel Prize.

719
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,912
What are you still doing here?

720
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,748
Don't you need to go pack your stuff?

721
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,499
Your junior was offered a great job,

722
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,044
so why are you being so jealous? It's so obvious.

723
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,630
Do you want me to stay?

724
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:55,257
-Would you? -What's the matter? Everything looks fine.

725
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,134
Of course not, they're paying me more.

726
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,218
Exactly.

727
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,144
Dr. Kang Kang-su also got board certified for ICSI in the US

728
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,647
when he was a postdoc in biology.

729
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:13,317
Since he's already used to zero gravity, he obviously has an advantage.

730
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,235
I didn't think of that.

731
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:16,945
I'm sorry.

732
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:21,575
I won't let this slide.

733
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,663
I'll turn everything upside down.

734
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:31,377
The chairman clearly has no intention of letting you marry Mr. Gong Ryong.

735
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:33,253
Ryong must be…

736
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,257
feeling terrible right now.

737
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,811
Hey. Give me that!

738
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,861
Stay out of it.

739
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,030
I'll take it from here.

740
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,157
You can't take this away from me like this.

741
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:03,450
Who do you think you are?

742
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,120
What are you, a thief? Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

743
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:14,294
You were a delivery man from the start. Nothing more, nothing less.

744
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,429
Damn it. Kang Kang-su, you little…

745
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:26,640
I am her doctor, okay?

746
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:29,935
You can't change a patient's doctor without their consent.

747
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:33,689
You've never even seen her eggs.

748
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:37,776
You've never stayed up all night trying to figure out what's wrong!

749
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:42,698
Those are her last eggs, okay?

750
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:44,158
I know them better than you.

751
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,869
I have to be the one to do it! Give them back now!

752
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:48,704
Bring my child back to life then.

753
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,834
-What? -The child that Go-eun and I lost.

754
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:58,338
The one who barely had any time in this world. Bring back my child,

755
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,756
and I'll give you the eggs.

756
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:04,845
Look. Both you and her father

757
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:07,681
act like I'm a murderer or something.

758
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:11,185
Go-eun's condition was more critical than you would think.

759
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,104
You don't care what happens to her?

760
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,898
You want to marry an heiress?

761
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,524
Are you delusional?

762
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:22,362
Just give up while Mr. Choi is being nice enough to send you to space.

763
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,617
I didn't come here as a tourist.

764
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,827
-Zero gravity is no joke. -I prepared for over a year.

765
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,120
In zero gravity?

766
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,581
I've been working on this in zero gravity for over a year.

767
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:34,958
Can you handle a microscopic needle better than me?

768
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:36,752
Look at you now.

769
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:40,672
How the hell would you precisely inject the sperm into the egg?

770
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:45,385
Give it up.

771
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,474
Go-eun is mine.

772
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:31,890
Eve, if Male Mouse 1 is still not adjusted by tomorrow,

773
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,767
should we try some medication?

774
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,644
Yeah, I'll check on him overnight.

775
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,438
You must be tired. Let's get some sleep, guys.

776
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:40,399
Good night.

777
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,777
This is your first night. Good night, you two.

778
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:55,914
You know how to sleep in here, right?

779
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:04,423
Don't just float around here like a corpse all night.

780
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,133
Okay?

781
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,052
When will I get used to

782
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,014
this stupid zero gravity?

783
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,392
By the time you go home?

784
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:21,898
Why didn't you just shoot me earlier?

785
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:24,943
It's not too late now.

786
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,862
Do it. Shoot me.

787
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:28,447
Come on, I said I'm sorry.

788
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:32,701
I can't keep apologizing. Accept it or not, it's on you now.

789
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,136
You live in this dump?

790
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,558
I'll do it on one condition.

791
00:48:58,602 --> 00:48:59,603
What is it?

792
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,522
I told you, I'll do anything.

793
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,319
It can't be just about your grandchild.

794
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:10,322
I'm risking my life to go to space,

795
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:14,576
and I won't do it just for your grandchild.

796
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:18,955
If I succeed,

797
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:21,458
share the results.

798
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,962
I want MZ Group to build a fertility clinic in space

799
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:30,676
so other people in desperate situations can also have children.

800
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:37,641
A fertility clinic? Who are you kidding?

801
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:41,311
Just be honest and tell me you want to marry Go-eun

802
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,021
and live in comfort, kid.

803
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,856
We're talking about my life here.

804
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:49,945
If I'm going to risk it, it should at least be for something like this.

805
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,492
Fine.

806
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,915
Fine, I'll do it.

807
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:28,024
Chief!

808
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:31,111
GONG RYONG'S 2ND DAY

809
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,578
Oh, God. What the… What's that?

810
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:42,539
What's happening?

811
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:48,879
Male Mouse 1 started biting through

812
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:51,673
the tails of Female Mouse 2 and 3 in the same cage.

813
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,717
Within minutes, he devoured their legs

814
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,219
and started gnawing at the bars with a bloody mouth.

815
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:15,155
Look at him all messed up and covered in blood.

816
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:17,824
He's just like you, no?

817
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,162
This is you.

818
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,207
It'll probably die soon.

819
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:31,338
I did a thorough check just to be sure.

820
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,715
I found signs that Male Mouse 1 attacked

821
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:38,220
the females in another cage too, biting their bellies, legs, and necks.

822
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,973
I get that the zero-gravity experiments can be stressful,

823
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,517
but we can't just let him be.

824
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,228
What do you mean?

825
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:48,772
If we do, he'll kill all the other mice too.

826
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:52,108
What then? Are you saying we kill him?

827
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:55,195
We should put him down. Each mouse costs over two million won.

828
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,197
We can't do that.

829
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,658
The mice are what we send on the cargo ship the most.

830
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:01,785
What if they all die? We send another one?

831
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:03,119
Think about the cost!

832
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,834
Let's stick to their policy.

833
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:15,173
You're a scientist. If you get so emotionally attached to a mouse,

834
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,050
we can't do the experiments efficiently.

835
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:19,427
You need to remain objective as the commander.

836
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,596
This is a test subject.

837
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:25,433
Just Mouse 1. It doesn't even have a name.

838
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:29,229
Commander, let's stick to the policy.

839
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:32,482
If we don't find a solution,

840
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:35,110
we'll have to keep putting them down like this.

841
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:36,945
Please give us some time.

842
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:38,905
You're wasting resources and time.

843
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,700
We're here to figure out how we can all live here together.

844
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:44,369
No, Mouse 1!

845
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:46,538
Mouse 1 is having a heart attack!

846
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:51,793
Good.

847
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,295
Let's just get back to work.

848
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:57,591
-Dr. Lee. -Let's do it.

849
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:00,802
What are you doing?

850
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,809
Hey! For God's sake…

851
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:11,563
One, two, three, four, five.

852
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,107
One, two, three, four, five.

853
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,109
What are you doing with a dead mouse?

854
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,862
One, two, three, four, five.

855
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:21,072
Come on. One, two, three, four, five.

856
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:24,200
One, two, three, four, five.

857
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:25,785
Shouldn't you go harder?

858
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,622
No, that'll rupture his heart and blood vessels.

859
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:31,750
One, two, three, four, five.

860
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:36,880
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

861
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:37,964
What do we do?

862
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:40,592
It looks like he's gone.

863
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,844
I got a cramp.

864
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:43,803
I'm fine.

865
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,684
One, two, three, four, five.

866
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,019
Let's open up his chest.

867
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:57,609
I've never done an open-chest cardiac massage on them.

868
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,737
I've done it on a newborn baby.

869
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,823
One, two, three, four, five.

870
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,670
One, two, three, four, five.

871
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,048
Dr. Lee.

872
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,842
Hold Mr. Gong's legs with Santi so he can stand still.

873
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,306
Come on.

874
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:40,193
-Show me the glove box monitor. -Yes, Chief.

875
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,537
Could you hold me a bit tighter?

876
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:52,288
All right.

877
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:53,999
Scalpel.

878
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:15,770
Scissors, please.

879
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:17,147
Okay.

880
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,274
No, not that one. The one on the far left.

881
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:20,316
The far left?

882
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,126
Okay.

883
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,921
Commander, get the retractor in.

884
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:50,972
Oh, his vitals are dropping.

885
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:53,850
Give him three micrograms of epinephrine.

886
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:59,064
-Come on. -Hurry, there's no time.

887
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:00,273
You're out of your minds.

888
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:24,631
All right, relax your body. Relax.

889
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:25,590
Okay.

890
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:29,677
Come on.

891
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:33,765
Come on.

892
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:43,691
Gently.

893
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,444
You're scientists.

894
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,530
You've got to be kidding me.

895
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:51,074
What the hell are you doing with a tourist?

896
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,243
You have no idea what you're doing.

897
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:55,245
Enough! Shut it, for God's sake.

898
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:01,042
His breathing seems to have stabilized,

899
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:03,795
but his heart still won't beat on its own.

900
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:05,296
His heart is so small.

901
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,590
I'm not sure how much pressure it can take.

902
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:10,593
His breathing is getting weaker.

903
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:15,723
Commander, maybe we should let him go.

904
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:19,394
No.

905
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:25,483
You've done everything you could. He's in pain.

906
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:28,695
No.

907
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,868
They shouldn't have bothered.

908
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,456
No.

909
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:51,342
Look at him all messed up and covered in blood.

910
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,219
He's just like you, no?

911
00:57:59,100 --> 00:57:59,976
This is you.

912
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:02,812
He'll probably die soon.

913
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:15,617
Commander.

914
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,661
Switch hands and start compressions.

915
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:21,581
Let's clamp the aortic arch.

916
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:25,752
A mouse is just like a human, only smaller, right?

917
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:32,050
Okay.

918
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:43,478
One, two, stop. Again.

919
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,314
One, two, stop.

920
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,526
Again. One, two, stop.

921
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,196
One, two, stop.

922
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:56,074
Again. One, two, stop.

923
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:57,492
What are they doing?

924
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,327
It's what they'd do to a human.

925
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:00,954
By applying pressure on the aorta,

926
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:03,957
they can make sure the blood circulates throughout the body.

927
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:10,004
One, two, stop.

928
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,507
-One, two, stop. -One, two, stop.

929
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:16,261
-One, two, stop. -One, two, stop.

930
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:34,445
His heart is beating!

931
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:58,177
He lives!

932
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:04,517
Oh, it's beating.

933
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,894
His heart is beating!

934
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:09,147
His heart is beating!

935
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:27,206
-You're okay now. -He's alive!

936
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:29,876
He's alive.

937
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:40,887
Si-won, get this on the news.

938
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:43,222
Okay.

939
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,975
Oh, I knew it.

940
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:50,480
Listen, Male Mouse 1 had a mate back on Earth.

941
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:54,400
Wait, what? Is he alive?

942
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,860
He's alive?

943
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:03,034
I'm so glad! Hang in there.

944
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:10,166
There's a reason Mouse 1

945
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:13,211
only attacked the females, not the males.

946
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:16,339
He was missing his mate back on Earth like crazy,

947
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:18,800
but the females kept coming on to him,

948
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:20,968
and he had to keep rejecting them.

949
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:23,429
In the end, he just lost it and tore them apart.

950
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,474
Then why did you send him up there?

951
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:29,644
Well, it's because…

952
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,105
Our mission is

953
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:35,775
to get mammals to naturally mate, get pregnant,

954
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,318
and give birth, right?

955
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:40,488
Mouse 1 was very well-mannered, affectionate,

956
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:42,323
and great at mating back on Earth,

957
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:44,742
so we figured he'd get along with the females

958
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:46,953
and be great at mating in space too.

959
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:54,502
And you're telling me this now? Are you kidding?

960
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,087
I just found out.

961
01:01:58,631 --> 01:01:59,632
You're laughing?

962
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:04,887
Oh, man. How did I miss this?

963
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:15,523
This is amazing. How is that possible?

964
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:17,817
Can you get me a mouse?

965
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:18,901
For what?

966
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,696
No, I don't trust your motives.

967
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,867
This restores my faith in humanity.

968
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:32,665
He's alive.

969
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:34,959
He lives.

970
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:53,936
I can't believe it worked.

971
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:57,982
The very first surgery on the space station

972
01:02:58,065 --> 01:03:00,318
has successfully saved a mammal, a mouse.

973
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:02,195
This is truly remarkable

974
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:04,906
as up until now, no surgery had ever been performed

975
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:06,657
in the weightlessness of space.

976
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:08,493
Yes, this has never happened before.

977
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:10,077
This surgery has proven

978
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:14,081
that surgical procedures are now possible on the space station.

979
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:15,082
As MCC chief,

980
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:18,294
I'm so proud of the expedition team and the tourist who saved a life.

981
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:21,714
Didn't she want to put the mouse down until a minute ago?

982
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:24,634
Not too shabby for him.

983
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:30,640
Your car will be here soon.

984
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:32,725
Yeah, okay.

985
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:38,272
You…

986
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:40,817
Wow! I mean, you!

987
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:41,734
Come on, stop.

988
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,027
Fantastic job!

989
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:47,782
You guys were really awesome.

990
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:49,742
That was insane!

991
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:50,785
Hey, move.

992
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:57,708
Eve. No, I mean, Commander.

993
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:00,169
You can call me Eve now.

994
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:01,337
What?

995
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:04,507
I never would've thought

996
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:06,968
to open his chest if it hadn't been for you, Doctor.

997
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:11,430
I think they can mate now.

998
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:14,183
I think they can mate and get pregnant.

999
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,394
We'll succeed this time, right?

1000
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:17,436
Absolutely.

1001
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:20,064
I have a really good feeling.

1002
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:25,152
To be honest, I thought you'd just get in our way, so you kind of bugged me.

1003
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:27,780
But you…

1004
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:30,992
You're a great doctor.

1005
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:40,126
I'm so glad to have you here in space!

1006
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:42,336
Great work!

1007
01:04:45,923 --> 01:04:47,008
Let's give him a hand!

1008
01:04:59,478 --> 01:05:00,897
His heart is actually beating!

1009
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,523
GO-EUN

1010
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:19,707
You saved his life.

1011
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,339
SPECIAL THANKS TO CHO JUNG-SEOK

1012
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:10,925
This is

1013
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:13,135
hell.

1014
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:17,723
I'm in hell.

1015
01:06:20,851 --> 01:06:21,852
I shouldn't be…

1016
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:25,064
doing this right now.

1017
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,987
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

1018
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:34,240
Where did he go?

1019
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:36,575
Two men in different rooms with a picture of the same girl.

1020
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:38,786
Oh, my God!

1021
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:41,747
-It's 500 billion won! -It's still valid for another month.

1022
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:45,167
If Kang-su finds out, he'll get jealous and take them away in a second.

1023
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:46,168
What were you doing?

1024
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:49,171
I'm not going to let Kang Kang-su take anything else from me.

1025
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:51,007
Kang Kang-su.

1026
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:52,466
Are you even human?

1027
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:55,553
I was the one who suggested that and using Gong Ryong as the delivery boy.

1028
01:06:55,636 --> 01:06:57,430
And it was me who offered to do the IVF.

1029
01:06:57,513 --> 01:06:59,640
You have to do it yourself, no matter what.

1030
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:03,978
Right now, I'm about to steal back my eggs.

1031
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:07,023
I'm going to get those eggs back, even if it kills me.

1032
01:07:12,486 --> 01:07:14,488
