1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,010
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

2
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,970
Informing the ILS. Code yellow, code yellow.

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,680
1, 836 pieces of space debris

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,850
have collided in succession, forming a debris cloud.

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,640
We think the space debris will pass through in 40 minutes.

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,440
Prepare to evacuate if necessary.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,770
Pack only the essentials and wait in the Crew Scorpion.

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,520
Are you saying we could go back to Earth today?

9
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,650
Mr. Tourist, collect your personal items,

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,150
go to the Scorpion, and stay put.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,200
Is it a morula yet?

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,700
Forget it.

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,540
Is there a hidden spot to plug this in on the Scorpion?

14
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,620
Code red, code red.

15
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,920
The debris will hit earlier than expected.

16
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,880
Scorpion, switch to departure mode.

17
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,140
I saw him in the observation module.

18
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,100
We're ready to go. Commander, take your seat.

19
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,060
I'm not leaving.

20
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,020
I'm in here.

21
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,850
I said, I'm not leaving.

22
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:05,980
I'm in here.

23
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,190
Can't anybody hear me? I'm still here!

24
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,520
Open the hatch!

25
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,530
I won't leave him alone here to die.

26
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,280
I'll find him and go back down with him on a G.O ship.

27
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,780
No!

28
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:20,950
Incoming!

29
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,830
Go back, Eve!

30
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,410
Eve, take cover!

31
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,430
When we're back on Earth and standing on solid ground,

32
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,390
let's go on dates like they do on Earth.

33
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,390
They're doing the final test on the spacecraft now.

34
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,810
We'll depart in an hour.

35
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,820
The engine module gave out during the test and blew apart.

36
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,190
It won't get you back to Earth.

37
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,280
Eve. What… What do we do now?

38
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,320
There's nothing we can do.

39
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,950
We're running out of emergency power.

40
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,870
This is probably our last transmission.

41
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,500
We'll launch within 30 hours max.

42
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,420
Please don't give up on us, guys.

43
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,550
By the time IOU gets there, they'll both be dead.

44
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,220
Call Bongani and tell him to get it done in 30 hours!

45
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,510
Even if he does, they'll both be dead in 30 hours!

46
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,890
They'll suffocate to death from the CO2 buildup

47
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,350
and lack of oxygen!

48
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,060
You know Eve. If she says two days, it means they've got less than that!

49
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,060
GONG RYONG'S 9TH DAY

50
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,070
ILS 21:00, SEOUL 06:00

51
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,240
STRANDED FOR 40 HOURS

52
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,580
You said

53
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,370
the space station would be passing over Seoul right now.

54
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,790
Yes, it's true

55
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,960
that it's passing over Seoul right now, but…

56
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,760
But what?

57
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,850
If there was an issue with the power,

58
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,430
it's very likely that they haven't been able to turn on the lights.

59
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,940
You need power to make oxygen.

60
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,310
Yes.

61
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,440
So it's currently orbiting directly over Seoul,

62
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,940
but it's not visible or shining

63
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,400
because they can't turn on the lights.

64
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:26,370
And it might also be impossible for them to generate oxygen?

65
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,490
Yes.

66
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,290
Are you even hearing yourself?

67
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,500
Are you saying there's a good chance

68
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,290
Ryong is dead because he has no oxygen and can't breathe?

69
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,130
And that my future grandchild might also suffer the same fate?

70
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,720
Is that what you're saying?

71
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,100
-Damn it. -Sir!

72
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,640
Take a look at this.

73
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,480
The freezer is finally sending out a signal,

74
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,600
and video is being transmitted.

75
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,560
The portable freezer must have exited

76
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,400
the signal interference zone.

77
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,570
So, they're still alive, right?

78
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,950
Yes.

79
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,410
You should take the elevator.

80
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,580
I'm too excited to wait for the elevator.

81
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,710
This is driving me crazy.

82
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,530
What's that?

83
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,950
That's a morula, sir.

84
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,960
The fertilized egg has divided into at least 16 cells.

85
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,460
Remember the freezer we gave to Gong Ryong?

86
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,250
He stored it properly in that freezer.

87
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,550
The freezer is sending

88
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,130
images of the morula in real time via the satellite we launched.

89
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,680
What about Dr. Gong, Father?

90
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,390
Look, it's completely blocking all of the unknown cosmic rays in space.

91
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,390
It cannot be physically altered.

92
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,900
In this state, even Earth's atmosphere is no threat.

93
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,230
And its self-charging capacity exceeds 30 days,

94
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,280
so all that's left is to bring it back.

95
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,110
Are you still unable to reach Dr. Gong on his phone?

96
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,620
The freezer uses our private satellite for discreet communication.

97
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,830
It operates on a different system than a phone.

98
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,420
I will never

99
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,670
let Ryong die.

100
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,270
And a one, two, three, four.

101
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:07,150
You're a guy who threw a stone

102
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,030
At the heart of an innocent girl

103
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,830
You, I'm talking about you

104
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,910
Man, my moms are having a blast.

105
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,290
They must be so happy right now.

106
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,040
Hey, I want you to emcee my wedding.

107
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,710
It's a chaebol wedding. You think I'm up for it?

108
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,930
I'm going to keep it small and have the reception here,

109
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,390
not somewhere that makes my moms self-conscious.

110
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,770
After I get married, I'm going to keep my job as a doctor.

111
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,640
No matter how crazy things got with me delivering babies every day,

112
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,480
coming here to have drinks with you

113
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,190
and seeing my moms always relieved my stress.

114
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,980
Sounds good, you punk.

115
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,030
-Here, let me. -Okay.

116
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,820
Don't you dare change because you're marrying an heiress.

117
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,120
Let's keep hanging out like we always have, okay?

118
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,290
What?

119
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,540
You better not ditch me.

120
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,210
Stop saying stupid things, you idiot.

121
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,840
Come back in one piece

122
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,090
or I'm taking your things.

123
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,010
You got it.

124
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,380
You can have it all. It's all yours.

125
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,390
-Is this what you want? -What?

126
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:16,890
Are you happy?

127
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:23,770
Cheers.

128
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
They're here.

129
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,990
Everybody, step back, please.

130
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,410
What is the current situation?

131
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,120
Please explain what is going on.

132
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,840
What's the latest on getting the tourist back from the space station?

133
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,750
When will the official briefing be held?

134
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,220
-Please tell us. -Please give us a statement.

135
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,890
Can you give us a statement?

136
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,350
Is there a plan in place?

137
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,310
Is the tourist in good health?

138
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,850
-Why aren't you saying anything? -Say something.

139
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,190
When will the rescue ship be launched?

140
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,360
-Please say something. -Is the tourist okay?

141
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,440
Wait.

142
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,910
This area is restricted to authorized personnel.

143
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,580
How could they come back down and leave the tourist stranded up there?

144
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,540
Our commander is still up there.

145
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,750
To you people, he's probably just some rich tourist,

146
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,840
but to me,

147
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,170
he's my fiancé.

148
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,680
The woman I want to marry is also up there.

149
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,890
I'm going to go up there myself and bring her back no matter what.

150
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,760
So go back home and wait.

151
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,890
No.

152
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,640
I want to talk to the person in charge.

153
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,650
James!

154
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,320
My family's future existence depends on this.

155
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,080
You wouldn't understand because you have loads of kids and grandkids.

156
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,870
But it would be the end of my family line.

157
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,750
Have I ever asked you for a favor before?

158
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,750
James, my family's future existence depends on this.

159
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,970
You don't understand how much it means to me

160
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,550
because you have many children and grandchildren.

161
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,760
It would be the end of my family line.

162
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,850
Have I ever asked you any favor before?

163
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,520
Please.

164
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,900
Please, can you pull some strings to get the IOU

165
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,230
to launch the rescue ship right away?

166
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,490
You trade satellites,

167
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,490
so you must know somebody.

168
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,450
I'll pay whatever you ask!

169
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,540
Please, can you pull some strings at the IOU

170
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,000
to launch the rescue ship immediately?

171
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,460
You trade satellites, so you must know somebody.

172
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,050
I'll pay whatever you ask.

173
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:57,010
A rescue ship launch would put the pilots' lives at stake too.

174
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,550
It doesn't matter how much you pay.

175
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,300
Astronauts' lives cannot be bought.

176
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,390
He said that

177
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,890
rushing the rescue ship launch would put the pilots' lives at risk.

178
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,480
He said you can't buy the astronauts' lives with money.

179
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,940
Then…

180
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:18,530
Then what about my future son-in-law and my grand…

181
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,570
Huh?

182
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,490
Are you saying we should let him die there?

183
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,700
Do you have any idea how much you gouged me for

184
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,080
to launch our satellite?

185
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:34,170
You said we had to pay double because it had to be kept secret.

186
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,300
Now you're saying we can't and give up?

187
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,550
Screw that!

188
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,680
James!

189
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,050
You…

190
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:46,010
I know you ripped me off, you crook.

191
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,730
I knew what you were doing, but I turned a blind eye.

192
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,100
I've never asked you for anything before.

193
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,940
And you can't do this for me, you bastard?

194
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,690
Interpret that word for word.

195
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,860
Interpret it!

196
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,030
Convey exactly how furious I am.

197
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,890
-Hang on. -Please grab my shoes.

198
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,980
Oh, my slipper.

199
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,230
Hang on a moment, please.

200
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,900
My stomach hurts.

201
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,440
-We're almost there. -Careful.

202
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,160
We'll leave as soon as we're ready.

203
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,330
Nobody knows we snuck out.

204
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,840
What if we get in trouble later?

205
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,590
We abandoned the commander and the tourist.

206
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,130
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?

207
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,970
Why? Do you want to continue playing astronaut?

208
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,550
That's why we're going back.

209
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,600
We'll save them, even if it's just us.

210
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,600
You know, Dr. Kang, we have a conscience too. And pride.

211
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,890
Why say it like that?

212
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,400
-Anything you need, sir? -Yeah, hi.

213
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,900
Could you bring me a bunch of waters, please?

214
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,070
-Okay. -Yeah, thank you.

215
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,700
Guys, this Earth water is just so amazing.

216
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,830
Oh, my God.

217
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,540
I mean, so much better than that purified piss we've been drinking, huh?

218
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,500
I mean, this is life!

219
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,840
I feel so alive.

220
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,960
Here you are.

221
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:45,180
This damn gravity is making my body feel so heavy.

222
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,760
I already miss zero gravity.

223
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,470
When will we get used to gravity?

224
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:55,100
I'm so dizzy it's making me crazy.

225
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,110
Let me help.

226
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,360
You should put your seat belt on first.

227
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:09,910
Right.

228
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,010
You guys are to blame for all this.

229
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,430
What?

230
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,180
That's why you should've let the tourist do it on his own.

231
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,140
Why did you help him?

232
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,560
All the while giving me the cold shoulder.

233
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,570
We're in this mess because he risked his life

234
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,190
to bring that thing back.

235
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,280
Now, even the commander could die.

236
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,610
And what if they both die?

237
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,120
If they do, are you guys going to take responsibility?

238
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,200
I knew something was off. It's impossible without a microscope.

239
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:58,080
Since when have the three of you been so tight?

240
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,370
Was I an outcast?

241
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,500
What do you mean?

242
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,590
Listen to this guy…

243
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,590
Oh, geez.

244
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,720
Are you okay?

245
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,920
What is it?

246
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:11,760
What are you accusing us of helping him with?

247
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,350
You're pinning the blame on the wrong people, Dr. Kang.

248
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:18,060
After we rescue the commander and tourist, you guys are dead.

249
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,140
I'm…

250
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,230
going to make you all pay.

251
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,570
What, so are we also going to be stripped of

252
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,740
our astronaut qualifications or something like that?

253
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,870
That's not what you're talking about, is it?

254
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,540
Oh, here.

255
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,020
Huh? Where is it?

256
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,480
Where did the manikin go?

257
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,780
The main module's control board

258
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,490
can be used to monitor the power in the observation module.

259
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,740
So we're checking it every minute.

260
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,200
But even with only essential life support running,

261
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,790
power is dangerously low.

262
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,000
If we don't send a rescue ship today,

263
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,790
we'll lose both the commander and the tourist.

264
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,380
GONG RYONG'S 10TH DAY ILS 00:00, SEOUL 09:00

265
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,000
Emergency oxygen status?

266
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,340
Because the cargo ship

267
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,970
was supposed to take more up in ten days,

268
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,390
even that's almost gone.

269
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,010
What's the latest from IOU and Houston, Chief?

270
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,350
They hope to send a ship by tomorrow evening.

271
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,060
I told you, they have to send it by midnight today.

272
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,070
Hello?

273
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,130
The thief is here.

274
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,670
Security, come and get him.

275
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:19,100
Vibration test, sound pressure test, erector test, wet test.

276
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,180
All passed.

277
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,020
I went to the assembly team and engine team

278
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,230
and verified it with my own eyes.

279
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,570
We're ready. I'm willing to stake my life on it.

280
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,570
How can he drive? He has no arms.

281
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,650
I…

282
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,160
can do a better job than him.

283
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,950
Please let me go.

284
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,660
Let him go, Chief.

285
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,660
We don't have any other options. Let him go.

286
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,460
Han Si-won, really, you too?

287
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,790
The launch window won't even open, and debris

288
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,790
is destabilizing ILS's attitude control.

289
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,260
The original launch window is no longer viable.

290
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,760
You know it's going to take at least a week to set a safe window.

291
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,430
Instead of wasting time on the negatives,

292
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:02,060
let's put our heads together and figure out a way to get there.

293
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,600
I'll do whatever it takes to reduce the time.

294
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,690
We don't have time, Chief.

295
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,020
Give up on the stable launch time.

296
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,090
OXYGEN REMAINING IN STATION: 13%

297
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,930
SURVIVAL TIME REMAINING: APPROXIMATELY 10 HOURS

298
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,190
Despite the circumstances, the fertilized egg

299
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,230
has divided into a morula and is alive.

300
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,060
We're getting signals from the freezer

301
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,820
that it has survived

302
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,490
the harsh conditions of space and is safe and sound.

303
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,030
Gong Ryong is doing a good job.

304
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,160
But do we know how Ryong is doing?

305
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,500
Fine, keep the reports coming.

306
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,920
Where are you? I'll come get...

307
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Damn it.

308
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,290
His life is more important.

309
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:17,010
What was he doing that prevented him from escaping?

310
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,260
That dumbass!

311
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,760
He's a complete idiot!

312
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,890
It's standard procedure

313
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,430
that when a problem arises on a ship or airplane,

314
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,520
tourists are safely evacuated first,

315
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,270
and the crew last.

316
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,020
Isn't that just common sense?

317
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,690
How could the crew abandon the tourist and evacuate first,

318
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,240
resulting in a situation

319
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,200
where he is left stranded with just the commander?

320
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,740
How is it acceptable that his family

321
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,290
had to find out about the accident from the news?

322
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,710
When is the rescue ship going up there?

323
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,550
We are formulating a plan as we speak.

324
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,050
I don't want some vague answer like that.

325
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,140
It's seven o'clock right now.

326
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:11,640
Tell me right now the exact time the rescue ship is going to leave.

327
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,940
Could they die?

328
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,580
You have to trust us.

329
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:32,080
We're going to do everything we can to ensure that doesn't happen.

330
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,760
I'm going to watch with my own eyes as the rescue ship goes up there,

331
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,390
reaches the station, and rescues him.

332
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,180
I'm also going to bring his mothers here.

333
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,890
Because it could be goodbye.

334
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,610
Assuming a successful first launch,

335
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,440
it will take seven days for the Maru to dock with ILS.

336
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,030
Is there any way to shorten seven days to one?

337
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,950
What if we maintain thrust longer at the beginning?

338
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,030
In reality, reaching an altitude of 200 km above Earth

339
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,330
only takes ten minutes.

340
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,040
But it takes a full seven days to climb any higher.

341
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,710
Why not simply boost it to 400 km right off the bat?

342
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,670
Then we only have to go another 50 km to get to the station.

343
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,670
If we look at the OpsCon,

344
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,130
it'll take more than 3 days to cover those 50 km.

345
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,090
It's too late.

346
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,010
We can reach the station in two hours.

347
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:27,930
Is that possible?

348
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,310
Normally we launch the Maru at a lower altitude.

349
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,220
Instead,

350
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,850
when the station

351
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,610
passes over South Korea,

352
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,860
we'll launch the Maru directly at it

353
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:44,070
at the same angle as the station's orbit, as if we're aiming directly at it.

354
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,160
Upon entering orbit,

355
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,700
we can get the Maru close to the station's keepout area in one shot.

356
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,330
SAFETY ZONE AROUND SPACECRAFT

357
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,370
After that, we can start the rendezvous and dock.

358
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,090
So, it continues toward the station without stopping.

359
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,670
It may be possible. Your thoughts?

360
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,960
Isn't it too dangerous?

361
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,010
If we push too hard and it's too fast, it could veer into space.

362
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:10,640
Worst-case scenario, you might crash right into the station.

363
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,470
We don't know exactly what the mass properties

364
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,770
of the Maru are.

365
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:17,560
We don't understand how the Maru will react

366
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,560
to specific forces in space.

367
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,730
We also

368
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,400
haven't calculated how much the thrusters accelerate in space per second.

369
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,320
It's reckless.

370
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,240
Even the CTV, which is a cargo ship,

371
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,160
still takes four days to ascend.

372
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,370
There's a reason for that.

373
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,370
Considering we're transporting people, a collision

374
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,710
would be catastrophic for both the station and the rescue ship.

375
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,250
We have to find a safer way.

376
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,630
There are too many variables, and we haven't tried this before.

377
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,260
While all that is true, this is the fastest way to get to them.

378
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,430
Since we've had to scrap all our original plans,

379
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,770
it will be our first time for everything. The whole thing is a gamble.

380
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:56,890
There's another issue.

381
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,100
Even if you made it there,

382
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,610
their systems are down, so we have to dock manually.

383
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,690
The odds of you docking alone without help are slim.

384
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,400
If we at least had communication,

385
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,950
Eve could use the robot arm from the tech module to secure the Maru

386
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,990
and dock it.

387
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,790
A robot arm was made for delivery to Spain.

388
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,290
Isn't it at Hwasin Aerospace?

389
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,540
And it's compatible with the Maru.

390
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,050
Okay then, if the station's robot arm can't help,

391
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:28,220
we can attach two robot arms to the Maru and use them

392
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,180
to grab on to the station for docking.

393
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,390
Let's do it.

394
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:34,350
Let's get the okay from Spain and Hwasin and take the arms, okay?

395
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,930
The Spanish company is private, so I doubt they'll agree.

396
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,980
Call Santi.

397
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,600
The penalty is going to cost us a fortune.

398
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,400
Can we release the funds immediately?

399
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,110
Is he on the line?

400
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,320
What's taking so long? Isn't he in Houston now?

401
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,320
07:50 P.M. IN THE SKIES OVER NEW ORLEANS, USA

402
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,990
Is it Bongani? Is it?

403
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,370
Put him on speaker and…

404
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,040
And tell him we're on our way to Florida right now.

405
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,420
If the rescue ship is ready, we will get on it.

406
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,630
And that will be faster.

407
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,130
Okay.

408
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,260
Bongani?

409
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,340
Hey, Santi, this is Chief Kang.

410
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:17,220
Can you connect me with the Spanish aerospace company?

411
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,060
The one that's supposed to get the robot arms.

412
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,270
Of course.

413
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,060
Why? Why, Chief Kang?

414
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,600
We will lift off from Seoul today.

415
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:27,440
We will attach the robot arms and manually dock to the station.

416
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,780
What? I'm coming with.

417
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,990
-I'm going too. -I'm going to go too.

418
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,160
We were going to leave from Florida.

419
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,030
If you'll let me,

420
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,410
I want to go to rescue the commander and the tourist too.

421
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,160
-Dr. Kang. -Yes?

422
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,710
The robot arms are really expensive.

423
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,510
I'll buy them.

424
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,560
We also have to pay a penalty.

425
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,350
It's a drop in the bucket for me.

426
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,060
KING OF MONEY

427
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,150
Thanks for giving me a chance to spend money.

428
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:06,940
Thank you, Chief.

429
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,150
How much would it cost?

430
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,320
Do not negotiate the price.

431
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,320
Double the price? Triple?

432
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,620
Tell them I will pay

433
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,870
whatever penalty fee they ask for, okay?

434
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,790
Okay.

435
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,000
Santi, we're in a hurry.

436
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,290
We need to get them ASAP.

437
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,580
You're talking about the latest model, right?

438
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,750
Anything to save the commander and tourist.

439
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,840
I'll make it happen.

440
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,090
-We'll head to Seoul. -Okay.

441
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,760
Han Si-won, find me a launch window for this mission.

442
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,680
Let's go.

443
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,560
And, Dong-a, go get ready to leave.

444
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,470
Okay.

445
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,650
Let's get ready to open.

446
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,610
You guys make the jeon.

447
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,660
How can you think of opening on a day like this?

448
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,870
If we don't at least open, I think I might go out of my mind.

449
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,120
Fine. Let's open for business.

450
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,960
This is messed up, seriously.

451
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,390
Let's serve noodles as well.

452
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,770
What's with this?

453
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,480
Damn this stupid thing.

454
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:34,650
You're built like a brick house, but you can't even do that?

455
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,150
Press harder.

456
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,580
Screw this damn lighter!

457
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,410
And this damn gas stove that's like a pile of space debris!

458
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,090
Where is it?

459
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,680
Hwa-ja, don't! Not the water!

460
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,390
Hwa-ja! Stop!

461
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,940
Hwa-ja!

462
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,190
I can't believe this.

463
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:20,160
FLAVORS OF THE MOUNTAIN, SEA, AND SKY

464
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,620
Isn't that a fire?

465
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,040
Shouldn't we call 911?

466
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,750
What's going on?

467
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,120
This is Flavors of the…

468
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,250
Holy shit, we're screwed!

469
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,250
I'll do it!

470
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,390
-Oh, no! -I can't believe this.

471
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,900
Oh, my God.

472
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,570
You have a severe second-degree burn.

473
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,820
You'll need to come every day

474
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:01,660
and have surgery to remove the damaged tissue.

475
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,540
Why did you go there by yourself?

476
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,620
Give me back the car keys.

477
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,500
How are Ryong's mothers?

478
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:13,540
I saw their results. They're all fine.

479
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,880
It looks like she's done.

480
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,180
-Should we go in? -Yes.

481
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,400
-We're sorry. -We're sorry.

482
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:39,440
It was my hand that dropped the colander. It should be my wrist that's hurt.

483
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:42,280
I feel terrible that someone like you got hurt instead of me.

484
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,990
If Ryong finds out,

485
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,620
he'll be so mad at us.

486
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,580
Mothers,

487
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,750
come with me to see Ryong.

488
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,750
That's what I went there to tell you.

489
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,340
What?

490
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:02,430
MCC is going to send up a rescue ship.

491
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,180
Our Ryong is alive, right?

492
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:10,470
Of course he is. He has to be. He will be.

493
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,020
So come with me so we can send Ryong some positive vibes.

494
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,650
Let's just have one of us go.

495
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,150
If the people there find out

496
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,570
that he has three mothers, it would look so bad for him.

497
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,540
I'm the oldest, so I'll go.

498
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,290
That's a bad idea. You have a short fuse.

499
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,290
We need to think of Ryong's reputation.

500
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,170
I'm the prettiest, so I'll go.

501
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,590
You're a crybaby, so also not a good idea.

502
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,380
I'm the calmest, so I'll go.

503
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,340
The rescue ship is about to leave for the ILS.

504
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,630
It's Chief Kang.

505
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,140
I'm sorry.

506
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,770
We're going to launch the Maru toward the ILS orbit.

507
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:59,190
According to our calculations, it will work if we launch toward Taiwan.

508
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:02,740
And it will fly over the Hong Kong and Taiwan airspace on the way.

509
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,650
We need international cooperation.

510
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,200
Okay. Don't worry.

511
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:32,310
We took out the chairs, any excess items, and pretty much all the equipment.

512
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,020
We even took out the toilet.

513
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,100
I think this is the first time it's been emptied out to lose weight.

514
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,650
It's probably really light right now.

515
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,940
Hell, I should starve myself too.

516
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,820
Don't drink water, lose weight,

517
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,990
urinate and defecate everything out.

518
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:52,240
I might as well shave my head too while I'm at it.

519
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,540
Keep your emotions in check.

520
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,670
Promise me.

521
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,250
Do everything by the book. Follow the instructions in the manual.

522
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,050
If there's a problem, follow the MCC's orders.

523
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,220
Don't you dare try to wing it.

524
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,430
The minute you try to improvise,

525
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,430
your chances of dying increase. So promise me.

526
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,350
I promise.

527
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,610
If you die, it's all over.

528
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:24,860
You can't save Eve.

529
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:31,410
Geez, stop with your nagging.

530
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,370
Tae-hui.

531
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:43,880
I love Eve.

532
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,020
I'm really sorry.

533
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:06,280
Come back in one piece. You can apologize to me then.

534
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,910
You were just going to sneak off anyway.

535
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,910
Here, take this, you punk.

536
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,390
Bring them back no matter what.

537
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,970
You better…

538
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,020
come back alive too. I'll be waiting.

539
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,810
GONG RYONG'S 10TH DAY

540
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,980
ILS 8:30, SEOUL 17:30

541
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,190
STRANDED FOR 50 HOURS

542
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,400
08:40 P.M. 20 MINUTES TO THE MARU LAUNCH

543
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,030
Yeah, we're here.

544
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,340
Those little…

545
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:58,550
-Hurry up, you guys. -Dona looks like she's going to kill us.

546
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,690
Over here.

547
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,110
After floating around like Superman for months,

548
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,860
you think gravity's a joke?

549
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:18,410
Are you trying to get yourselves killed running around like that?

550
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,120
-One, two, three. -One, two, three.

551
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,950
-Slowly. -Hurry and get them inside.

552
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,830
Are you crazy?

553
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,270
One minute to Maru launch.

554
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,820
Park Dong-a.

555
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:56,280
This is going to be the fastest spacecraft you've been on.

556
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,610
You have to get through it.

557
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,570
Copy.

558
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,530
Stop worrying. Just get me as close as you can to the ILS.

559
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,290
In 12 minutes, I'll be safely in space.

560
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,710
Be careful.

561
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,500
Good luck.

562
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,790
Ten seconds to launch.

563
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,710
Ten,

564
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,050
nine,

565
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:14,300
eight,

566
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,300
seven, six,

567
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,880
five,

568
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:19,180
four,

569
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,180
three, two,

570
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,010
one, zero.

571
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,520
-Liftoff. -Liftoff.

572
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:47,500
Starting pitch maneuver at 300 m.

573
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,460
PITCH MANEUVER: ADJUSTING SPACECRAFT'S NOSE

574
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,130
UP OR DOWN TO CHANGE TRAJECTORY

575
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:02,220
Altitude 6.8 km, speed 1, 839 km per hour.

576
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,300
The spacecraft has reached supersonic speed.

577
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,470
It has reached max q.

578
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,230
POINT OF MAXIMUM AERODYNAMIC PRESSURE

579
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:12,100
Altitude 11 km, speed 2, 187 km per hour.

580
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,530
What's going on?

581
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,910
There's too much vibration!

582
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:24,070
Maybe the robot arms are throwing it off.

583
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,580
Come on.

584
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,920
Altitude 59 km. First-stage separation confirmed.

585
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,680
-What's that? -What is it?

586
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,480
Wasn't the first stage separation a success?

587
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,900
The life support system on ILS has shut down.

588
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,150
The oxygen generator is off and there's no power.

589
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,280
They're no longer…

590
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,160
getting oxygen.

591
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,750
Eve.

592
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,130
Oh, God, Ryong.

593
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:37,110
Faster!

594
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:40,320
We have to go faster!

595
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,360
Fairing separation.

596
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,450
We lost one of the robot arms.

597
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,700
Shit, already?

598
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,620
Is this going to mess up the whole plan?

599
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,500
One arm will be enough.

600
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,130
You can manage with one arm?

601
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,550
At least we have one. I've done it without before.

602
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:09,010
Altitude 400 km. The spacecraft is rapidly climbing to the target.

603
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,620
Current speed is 31, 300 km per hour.

604
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,570
Approaching within a 2 km radius of the station.

605
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:08,950
Extending robot arm.

606
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,260
Farther, just a little farther.

607
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,520
Approaching within 200 m of ILS's keepout area.

608
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,270
I know you can do it.

609
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,240
Now! Grab it!

610
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,250
Got it!

611
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,510
It's too much for one arm. The robot arm won't hold!

612
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,060
The Maru will be flung out of orbit.

613
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,100
I'm going to connect the docking probe.

614
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,850
I have to dock right away.

615
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,450
The soft capture latch has grabbed the probe tip.

616
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,610
Hard capture confirmed.

617
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,200
All eight hooks are engaged.

618
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,080
Docking confirmed.

619
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,300
Once repressurized, I'll enter the station.

620
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,480
Oh, my God.

621
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,950
CO2 levels inside the station

622
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,870
are 2, 010.

623
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:04,000
Eve, just hold on a little longer.

624
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,470
To stay alive, they'd be in the observation module.

625
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,550
Hurry.

626
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:25,270
Opening the observation module hatch.

627
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,790
It's a portable oxygen tank.

628
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:07,560
Ryong.

629
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,520
Ryong.

630
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,440
-Ryong… -Mr. Gong.

631
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,070
Mr. Gong?

632
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:21,030
Is he alive?

633
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,200
Yes, he's alive.

634
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,410
Ryong.

635
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,870
Do you see Eve? What about Eve?

636
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,460
Is there another tent? Shine the light to the left.

637
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,900
What's that pink…

638
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:08,790
I found her.

639
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:11,540
Eve, hold on a little longer.

640
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,040
It's okay now. You made it.

641
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:17,420
Just hang on a little longer, Eve.

642
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,540
Good job!

643
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:55,380
They did good.

644
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:57,340
They both did good.

645
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:00,170
You have to do that to survive.

646
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,380
You have to stick together like that.

647
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:04,760
Is that right?

648
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:07,510
Should they have frozen to death alone?

649
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,310
That position is standard procedure.

650
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:11,770
Right.

651
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:15,520
What are you doing? Snap out of it, Dong-a!

652
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:17,360
Oh, right.

653
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:20,440
Eve!

654
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,450
Eve, are you okay?

655
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:28,330
She's alive. She made it.

656
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:30,120
Eve, can you see me?

657
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,210
I can't tell if they're conscious or not.

658
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,670
They're hypothermic. Hurry and get them to the Maru.

659
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:06,780
Eve.

660
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,700
Are you awake? Are you okay?

661
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,040
Dong-a.

662
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,120
Yeah.

663
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,420
How did you get here?

664
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,420
Thank you.

665
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:22,420
Thank you for staying alive, Eve.

666
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:28,140
Let's go home.

667
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:31,810
It's time to go home.

668
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:33,140
Don't worry about a thing.

669
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:35,140
It won't be long now.

670
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:46,910
Mr. Gong.

671
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:53,200
You're going to be fine now.

672
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,830
Your fiancée has been worried sick about you.

673
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,500
She and your mother are watching from the MCC.

674
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,630
Mom.

675
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,340
Ryong, are you okay?

676
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:11,470
Mom.

677
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,100
Go-eun's here.

678
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:17,980
Go-eun.

679
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,810
I miss you, Ryong.

680
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:23,650
We're going to be…

681
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,200
together again soon.

682
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,280
I love you.

683
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:49,010
Their safe return is our top priority.

684
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:50,510
The suits aren't the right size,

685
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:53,430
and the seats haven't been customized to their bodies.

686
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:57,350
To withstand the vibrations at reentry, we have to time the departure exactly.

687
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:58,690
Calculate the deorbit burn.

688
00:46:58,770 --> 00:46:59,980
Okay.

689
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,400
ENGINE FIRING FOR REENTRY

690
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,610
To avoid shock during reentry,

691
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:07,650
ensure they've had enough oxygen therapy.

692
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:17,950
Undocking complete.

693
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,580
In eight hours, the closest approach to South Korean waters

694
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:23,420
will be at 09 hours, 12 minutes and 45 seconds.

695
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,340
It will then initiate its final burn to begin reentry.

696
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,760
All right, let's meet on Earth tomorrow, everyone.

697
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:34,760
See you then.

698
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,060
Stay safe.

699
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:40,940
The Maru has just begun to slow down

700
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,770
and adjust its orbit.

701
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:45,320
It will soon reenter Earth's atmosphere.

702
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,280
It is expected to land 300 km south of Mara Island.

703
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:52,780
We'll be there to cover every emotional moment

704
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:55,120
as these astronauts and the tourist

705
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,580
make their dramatic return to Earth.

706
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:00,870
However, the Maru has not completed a return test,

707
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,040
so they're still not out of the woods.

708
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:06,000
Now comes the most dangerous part.

709
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:08,590
Yes, that's correct. Before entering the atmosphere,

710
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:10,760
the trunk needs to be detached.

711
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,930
This allows the thick heat shield on the bottom of the spacecraft

712
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:16,550
to tilt downward at a 30-degree angle for reentry.

713
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,430
As you can see on the screen, it must descend in that position

714
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,520
to withstand the 1600-degree Celsius heat

715
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,690
and incredible speed of Mach 25.

716
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:26,310
-Oh, God. -Why is it so hot?

717
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,320
Once it slows down to 500 km per hour, they can deploy the parachute.

718
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,860
-If for any reason… -The parachute has to open.

719
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:36,660
If it isn't positioned correctly as it enters the atmosphere, it won't be able

720
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:37,870
to slow down…

721
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:40,160
What do those idiots know?

722
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,660
Why are they spewing all that gloom and doom?

723
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,620
Let's take a look at the images again.

724
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:48,800
Trunk separation confirmed.

725
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,760
The impact from the explosion was mild.

726
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:54,300
Eve, Mr. Gong, you guys handling it okay?

727
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,260
Yes.

728
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,220
Yes.

729
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,720
The Maru is entering the atmosphere. Prepare for impact.

730
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:22,080
The Maru has appeared on radar.

731
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,380
Isn't it coming in too fast?

732
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:33,010
What does that mean?

733
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:34,090
Oh, it's nothing.

734
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,270
Ryong!

735
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,600
What's going on?

736
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:50,940
Look outside!

737
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:57,820
What's happening?

738
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,200
Holy hell!

739
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:02,200
The trunk is still attached.

740
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:31,900
Ryong.

741
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,860
My baby.

742
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:37,200
What was that trunk separation confirmation about?

743
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,860
The Maru's control system malfunctioned.

744
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:41,910
That's why it didn't detect it.

745
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,210
My chest…

746
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:49,460
It's too hot.

747
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:54,000
If we don't slow down,

748
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:55,710
we'll overheat from the friction!

749
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,260
Let's deploy the parachute!

750
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:58,970
Deploy it and slow this thing down!

751
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:01,720
It will incinerate at this speed if you deploy it now.

752
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,300
You want to bring home corpses?

753
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:04,890
Just hold on a little longer!

754
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:06,720
The trunk will burn off soon.

755
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:09,310
We're going to die from the heat!

756
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:11,020
I'm deploying the parachute!

757
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:14,610
The trunk has separated!

758
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:10,370
What happened to them?

759
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,370
Ryong?

760
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:13,790
Are they on radar?

761
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,500
I can't believe this.

762
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:40,290
This is the Maru

763
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,510
reporting.

764
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:46,010
The time is 10:14:19.

765
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:51,720
Commander Eve,

766
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:54,680
tourist Gong Ryong…

767
00:53:57,650 --> 00:53:58,900
and pilot Park Dong-a

768
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:01,820
have all

769
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:05,860
safely returned.

770
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:52,160
Way to go, Park Dong-a.

771
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,540
You did it, Commander.

772
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:57,040
You made it, Gong Ryong.

773
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:03,000
Thank you!

774
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:19,190
Thank you.

775
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,150
Thanks to you, I've experienced both heaven and hell.

776
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:25,730
I'm Park Dong-a.

777
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:39,120
Do either of you feel nauseous?

778
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:41,920
No, I'm okay…

779
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:50,840
It's okay, puke it all out.

780
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,300
We're on Earth.

781
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:55,430
It's okay to puke, you know?

782
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:58,640
Throw up everything you ate in space!

783
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,230
Puke your guts out! Empty it all out!

784
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:04,610
While you're at it, empty out every crevice in your body!

785
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,650
This is Earth, people.

786
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:09,070
It's okay to puke.

787
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:11,860
We're on Earth.

788
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:15,410
We're alive!

789
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,140
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

790
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,440
How did you two manage to withstand the cold of space until the very end?

791
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,030
Don't get it confused. You're with Choi Go-eun.

792
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:53,780
And Eve is with me.

793
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:56,780
They will investigate the accident.

794
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:58,080
Chairman Choi!

795
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,700
You did good.

796
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:00,870
You did great, Ryong.

797
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:03,080
I saw you two right before you were rescued.

798
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,000
Did you kiss?

799
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:06,920
Who the hell are you to make Go-eun cry?

800
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,130
What about her feelings?

801
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:11,170
Go-eun, don't waste your time on an opportunist like me.

802
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:35,970
