1
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,960
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

2
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,430
He risked his life by boarding the Maru,

3
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,720
a domestic spacecraft which hadn't completed a reentry test, to rescue…

4
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,640
Welcome back.

5
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,310
I'm fine.

6
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,520
Yeah, you are.

7
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,190
First of all, welcome back.

8
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,320
How did a commander and a tourist end up stranded on the space station alone?

9
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,240
The storage module in the observation area was

10
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,910
severely damaged by space debris,

11
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,330
which caused the hatches on both sides to seal shut.

12
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,660
The tourist was trapped inside

13
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,040
and couldn't reach the main module.

14
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,750
Even if it was to save a colleague,

15
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,710
you risked your life boarding a spacecraft

16
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,800
that hadn't completed a reentry test. That couldn't have been easy.

17
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,050
I didn't just go up there to save the tourist,

18
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,600
but to save the woman I love with all my heart.

19
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,930
I didn't even have time to be scared.

20
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,440
So you two are in a relationship?

21
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,480
Are you a couple?

22
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,900
There's no one in the world I love more.

23
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:44,200
We actually have another well-known couple here.

24
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,040
CEO Choi Go-eun of MZ Electronics, you're here for

25
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,830
your fiancé, Mr. Gong Ryong.

26
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,040
You must've been very worried about him.

27
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,290
You recently announced your engagement.

28
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,590
When is the wedding going to be?

29
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,390
I'd marry him right now if I could.

30
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,730
A question for the commander.

31
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,610
I heard the solar array was damaged when the space debris hit.

32
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,320
How did you two manage to withstand the cold of space until the very end?

33
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,780
Well…

34
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,550
If…

35
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,180
If we make it back alive…

36
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,270
Will you stop saying if?

37
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:55,270
Each of these portable oxygen tanks lasts about 15 minutes.

38
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,110
It's too soon to be saying if.

39
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,410
If…

40
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,670
I told you not to say that.

41
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,130
If we make it back alive…

42
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,550
I'm going to kiss you every 15 minutes.

43
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,230
If we make it back alive…

44
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,320
we'll have bowls of steaming noodles…

45
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,950
at those tables outside convenience stores…

46
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,410
together.

47
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,880
And we'll blow on the hot noodles as we eat.

48
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,590
I want to do that every day.

49
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,510
Okay, sounds nice.

50
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,890
I want to grow old with you…

51
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,270
until I'm frail and weak

52
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,360
and die by your side when I'm 100.

53
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,990
Okay.

54
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,330
I want…

55
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,620
to take you out on dates

56
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,500
on Earth.

57
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,170
I'll give my all to be with you…

58
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,350
to love you…

59
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,060
and…

60
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,400
to live fully.

61
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,280
Eve.

62
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,450
Here.

63
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,020
-Well...-The protocol in situations like that

64
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,650
is to strip down and hold each other close,

65
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,030
no matter who you're with.

66
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,820
That's how you keep each other warm.

67
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:55,240
In those moments, you're not a man and a woman.

68
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,040
You're just colleagues fighting for survival together.

69
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,630
All members of Expedition 3, Commander Eve,

70
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,420
Kang Kang-su, Lee Seung-jun, Mina Lee, Santi, and the tourist,

71
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,420
have returned to Earth safely.

72
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,220
They'll return to the space station

73
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,640
as soon as they recover and the repairs are made.

74
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,220
All right, we'll head to Seoul now.

75
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,560
Commander, any words for your boyfriend who risked his life for you?

76
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,310
-Please say a few words. -Any plans for a press conference?

77
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,520
What happened to your arm? You're so clumsy.

78
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,420
That hits the spot.

79
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,460
I thought you quit smoking.

80
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,640
You look scared.

81
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,730
Are you feeling anxious?

82
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,540
You're probably right about what you're thinking.

83
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,310
Commander!

84
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,560
Don't get up. I told you to stay as still as possible for a while.

85
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,520
Feel like throwing up?

86
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,190
I don't have anything left to throw up.

87
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,440
-Do you think you can take this off? -Yeah.

88
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,320
-I can't breathe. -I got it.

89
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,840
Remove your suit and lie down.

90
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,590
Balancing will be hard with your vestibular system messed up.

91
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,680
This blue compression suit

92
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,640
might feel a bit tight, but you have to keep it on.

93
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,310
Can you lift your bottom?

94
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,610
All right, here we go.

95
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,650
One, two, three.

96
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,780
There you go.

97
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,030
Good job.

98
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,830
Dong-a, go get some rest in your room. We can take it from here.

99
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,540
It was just a one-day trip for me. I'm totally fine.

100
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,670
By the way, where's Dr. Kang?

101
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,250
Where did he slip off to this time?

102
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,250
Can I lie down now?

103
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,420
The floor is spinning.

104
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,180
Take off all his clothes minus the suit.

105
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,220
-Okay? -You got it.

106
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,550
What? No, wait.

107
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,850
It's fine.

108
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,230
My stomach hurts.

109
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,190
Listen, can I use the bathroom?

110
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,820
You might get dizzy and fall if you try to move.

111
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,570
You should go help him.

112
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,820
No, I can go by myself.

113
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,740
After your miraculous return to Earth,

114
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,030
you want to crack your head open and die in the bathroom?

115
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,290
No way.

116
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,330
Let's go.

117
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,000
No, I don't…

118
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,290
-It's no trouble. -I don't need your help.

119
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,670
You really don't have to.

120
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,510
Let me help you.

121
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,260
No, I can handle this.

122
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,640
You can't do this alone.

123
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,940
Your body can't even tell whether you're in gravity or zero gravity right now.

124
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,730
Why are you being so nice to me?

125
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,820
Is there a reason I shouldn't be?

126
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,540
Don't be so nice to me.

127
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,510
What?

128
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,720
From the moment you open the door and go back out there,

129
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,930
stay the hell away from Eve.

130
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,860
You almost got her killed.

131
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,940
What were you doing in the observation module that

132
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,030
kept you from getting to the main module in time?

133
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,200
Like I said, you almost got Eve killed.

134
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,580
Your dramatic space trip is over now,

135
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,540
so stay away from her.

136
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,910
Don't get it confused.

137
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,920
You're with Choi Go-eun.

138
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,210
And Eve is with me.

139
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,100
I can pull down my own pants.

140
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,060
I'll be sitting down, not standing up.

141
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,610
I can handle it, all right?

142
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:04,530
Get out.

143
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,530
Where's my son-in-law?

144
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,160
Isn't this his room?

145
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,780
Is he being seen by a doctor?

146
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,660
Family visits are not allowed right now. Please leave.

147
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,270
Are you okay, Ryong?

148
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,980
Geez, what did I tell you?

149
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:21,560
Come on.

150
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,730
Lay him down on the bed.

151
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,570
-And take off his clothes. -Got it.

152
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,780
No, hold on a second! I'm going to puke!

153
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,700
I can't lie down.

154
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:31,660
I thought you were done.

155
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,280
Your stomach should be empty.

156
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,660
Chairman Choi!

157
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,580
Yes.

158
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,160
You did good.

159
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,540
You did great, Ryong.

160
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,210
I know.

161
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,590
I told you not to bend over!

162
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,760
You can marry Go-eun.

163
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,510
He's throwing up again.

164
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,760
He's going to get dehydrated. For God's sake.

165
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,940
I'll go get him an IV.

166
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,730
Sir, please take this.

167
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,860
What? Me?

168
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,870
I can't ask them to wash this for me, can I?

169
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,040
Come on, take it.

170
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,000
Don't just throw it away. Make sure you wash it, okay?

171
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,710
This sock has been to space, you know.

172
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,840
Could you guys give me a hand?

173
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,800
This is killing me.

174
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,820
Sir, that's the portable freezer we gave him!

175
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,580
I was worried he might've left it at the space station,

176
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,250
but it's okay now. He did it.

177
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,580
Congratulations, sir.

178
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,670
Go-eun.

179
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,670
Min-jeong.

180
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,380
My baby. Thank goodness.

181
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,180
-Come on, lift your arm. -No, I can't.

182
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,260
Not even a little?

183
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,850
Go-eun.

184
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,400
The morula is safe.

185
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,860
It passed through the atmosphere without any issues.

186
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,730
-Really? -Are you serious?

187
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,990
Thank God.

188
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,610
-Yi-man. -Yeah?

189
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,910
-You know Dr. Na, right? -Yeah.

190
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,120
Is she doing all right?

191
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,870
Oh, right. I'll go check on her. I'll be right back.

192
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,160
You…

193
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,880
You did it!

194
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,960
Wait.

195
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,420
Hey, you… You stink of cigarettes.

196
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,550
Have you been smoking?

197
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,760
You're the best.

198
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,470
What happened to your arm?

199
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,060
You shouldn't be smoking when you're hurt.

200
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,530
The commander doesn't smoke?

201
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,450
You can't smoke up there.

202
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,000
I saw you two right before you were rescued.

203
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,180
Did you kiss?

204
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,060
Did you kiss her?

205
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,620
Go-eun.

206
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,920
Don't waste your time on an opportunist like me.

207
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,300
Your father wouldn't let me work as an ob-gyn,

208
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,180
so I wanted to get back at him

209
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,470
and work my way up.

210
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,190
Luckily,

211
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,110
you fell for me.

212
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,070
And I played along, knowing that I was being a jerk.

213
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,620
Being with you

214
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,790
made me feel reassured, like I was rich.

215
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,420
And I thought…

216
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,170
I'd come to love you in time.

217
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,090
But when you asked me to marry you,

218
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,470
I just couldn't say yes.

219
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,190
I felt like…

220
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,980
I'd be a real jerk if I did that.

221
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,700
You're lying.

222
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,700
Go-eun.

223
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,750
Sorry it took me so long to be honest.

224
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,840
I'm sorry.

225
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,640
Then be an opportunist till the end.

226
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,610
If you do this now…

227
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,110
what am I supposed to do?

228
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:11,330
Tell me you're pushing me away because you have feelings for someone else.

229
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,500
I'd rather deal with that.

230
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:18,630
At least then, I could fight for you.

231
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,130
At least then…

232
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,970
I wouldn't feel so pathetic.

233
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,120
WELCOME BACK TO EARTH

234
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,660
What are you doing out of bed again?

235
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,370
You don't even need to take this test.

236
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:17,580
I won't stay for long.

237
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,380
You just won't listen.

238
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,000
You never do.

239
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:28,090
You should go get some rest, Dong-a.

240
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,180
Don't bother.

241
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,100
You think he'll listen to you when he won't even listen to me?

242
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,820
The IOU will send an investigation team to the station soon.

243
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,860
They will investigate the accident.

244
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,530
What was the tourist doing in the observation module anyway?

245
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:58,160
He said he was trying to grab the camera from there

246
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,870
when he got stuck.

247
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,040
You know how messy the cables are over there.

248
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,960
Why would he care about some stupid camera in a life-or-death situation?

249
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,510
Things were pretty chaotic. I think he was a bit flustered.

250
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,890
I'll need a more detailed report on what happened when you two were alone.

251
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,060
Was there any specific issue?

252
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,180
Well…

253
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,480
We only had 15-minute oxygen tanks.

254
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,610
What?

255
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,860
What about the one-hour tanks?

256
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,740
There weren't any.

257
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,570
What else?

258
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,580
Sorry?

259
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,160
Tell me more in detail.

260
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,210
Well, is that all?

261
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,920
Yeah.

262
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,180
When I talk to the investigation committee,

263
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,390
I'll give them all the details I remember.

264
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,640
Just 15-minute tanks?

265
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,270
You had a close call.

266
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,520
We only had nine 15-minute tanks.

267
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,620
That feels good.

268
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,540
Did you sleep well?

269
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,460
Yeah.

270
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,290
I slept like a rock.

271
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,050
I feel so much better.

272
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,800
I see you're doing much better.

273
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,100
You want water? Let me get it for you.

274
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,310
Let me try.

275
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,190
Sure.

276
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,320
Impressive…

277
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Bravo.

278
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,170
I knew you'd recover quickly.

279
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,390
Would you like more water?

280
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,300
Damn, it's tight.

281
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,600
Gong Ryong, you bastard.

282
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,020
I won't let you get away with it.

283
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,750
-Are you Mr. Gong Ryong? -Yes.

284
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,460
Sit up nice and easy.

285
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,840
-Enjoy. -Thanks.

286
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,180
Excuse me.

287
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,390
Yes?

288
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:06,020
Eve Kim, the patient in Room 2. Has she been eating well?

289
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,140
Yes.

290
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:10,730
HOSPITAL ROOM 2 EVE KIM

291
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,480
Hi, I brought your meal.

292
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,650
Thank you.

293
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,240
-Enjoy. -Thanks.

294
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,210
ANY PLANS FOR AFTER YOU'RE DISCHARGED?

295
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,550
GONG RYONG HOSPITAL ROOM 1

296
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,550
Any plans for after you're discharged?

297
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,570
You never loved me?

298
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,570
Me? How's that even possible?

299
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,950
Are you trying to get revenge for my dad betraying you and giving Kang-su your job?

300
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:07,120
If you want revenge, go after my dad. Why are you taking it out on me?

301
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,120
I get it. You're saying you were miserably lonely and sad in space.

302
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,090
Fine, I'll put up with your whining this time.

303
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,630
I left you alone when you were feeling humiliated,

304
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,510
so now you're like, Screw them all.

305
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,720
You want to pull this off and rub it in their faces, right? Fine.

306
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,930
You're sick of my family?

307
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,980
Fine.

308
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,350
They won't be my family anymore.

309
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:42,700
Do you seriously expect me to believe what you said?

310
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:59,670
HOSPITAL ROOM 2 EVE KIM

311
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,600
Come in.

312
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,490
Time for your oxygen therapy.

313
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,780
All right.

314
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,660
How's the hospital food? Good enough?

315
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:28,330
Yeah. After all the dry, powdery stuff I had to eat,

316
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,410
it tastes amazing.

317
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,080
Great.

318
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,620
I almost forgot. Ryong wanted me

319
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,290
to give this to you.

320
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,670
This is for me?

321
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,840
He said it's a gift and I shouldn't give it to anyone else.

322
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,470
-Weird guy, right? -Right.

323
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,560
-Shall we? -Sure.

324
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:52,850
The bed is so comfy, by the way.

325
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,520
For the oxygen therapy, let's pair them up

326
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:02,030
-based on their oxygen saturation levels. -Okay.

327
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,200
Did you have your heart checked? Is everything okay?

328
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,490
Yeah, they said it's fine.

329
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,950
You look even prettier than you did in space.

330
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,950
Me?

331
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,920
You're just experiencing a grayout, Dr. Lee.

332
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
The gravitational acceleration during reentry damaged your vision.

333
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,090
It'll clear up once you adjust to the gravity.

334
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,760
Dona.

335
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
No, that's not it.

336
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,340
Eve and Gong Ryong were hypoxic when they were rescued.

337
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,010
-Let's pair those two. -Okay, sure.

338
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,190
Dong-a.

339
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,410
Have you finished eating?

340
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,080
Yeah, what about you?

341
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,080
Yeah, me too.

342
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,450
No, it's okay. Leave it.

343
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,500
I know the smell bugs you. I'll take it out.

344
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,580
You don't have to.

345
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:26,030
That couldn't have been easy.

346
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,150
Right.

347
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,200
I didn't just go up there to save the tourist,

348
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,700
but to save the woman I love with all my heart.

349
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,120
So you two are in a relationship?

350
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,330
Are you a couple?

351
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,540
There's no one in the world I love…

352
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,800
I put you on the spot, didn't I?

353
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,510
I'm sorry.

354
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,560
What are you doing?

355
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,190
It's Chief Kang.

356
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,150
I slept with her.

357
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,200
While you were away…

358
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,290
I must've been completely out of my mind.

359
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,000
There's no excuse for it.

360
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,670
I'm sorry.

361
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,960
When all I could think about was saving you, I was shameless.

362
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,210
I acted like a nutjob

363
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,010
and had the courage to say,

364
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:36,180
I'll go crazy if I don't save her.

365
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,520
We'll live or die as one.

366
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,520
But now, I can't even look you in the eye.

367
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:51,360
Being here alone with you, I'm shaking,

368
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,570
and I can't breathe.

369
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,910
I don't know what I was thinking.

370
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,210
Get up.

371
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,960
Please forgive me.

372
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,470
Get up, Dong-a.

373
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,640
You know how simple-minded I am.

374
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,350
I don't like complicated stuff. I can't understand it.

375
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,810
Please cut me some slack.

376
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,020
I'll wait until you can forgive me.

377
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,760
Are you still working?

378
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,130
CLOSED FOR DINNER

379
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,300
Sorry? Oh, yeah.

380
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,180
Ryong is still undergoing tests, so you should visit him tomorrow.

381
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,020
I'll go with you ladies.

382
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,480
That's so kind of you to think of us. Thank you, Ms. Choi.

383
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,150
Ms. Choi, how's the burn on your arm?

384
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,190
I hope it won't leave a scar.

385
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,030
Please don't call me Ms. Choi.

386
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:15,320
Who addresses their daughter-in-law like that?

387
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,410
What should we call you then? We're just so grateful.

388
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,200
Just call me Go-eun.

389
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,080
-What? -What?

390
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:27,620
By the way, why is he still getting tests taken?

391
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:31,170
He must be in terrible shape if he has to take so many.

392
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,460
It's not just Ryong.

393
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:37,180
They're standard tests for all astronauts, so don't worry.

394
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:40,510
They say it takes about 3 to 4 days to readjust to gravity.

395
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,100
-I see. -It takes that long?

396
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,680
We're taking up too much of her time.

397
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,640
Right, we'll let you go now.

398
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,270
See you soon, Ms. Choi.

399
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,400
All right.

400
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:07,040
Let's just stay and work then.

401
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,540
-Should we? -Yeah.

402
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,710
Wait, but I want to meet that woman too.

403
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,260
We should thank her.

404
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,970
Who? The commander?

405
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,930
Why would you want to meet her?

406
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,020
Any discomfort?

407
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,150
Are you good?

408
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,150
Yes.

409
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,860
Okay, then. Don't talk. It'll reduce the effect.

410
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:41,070
-Okay. -All right.

411
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,460
Will the results for Santi's sperm test be out soon?

412
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,540
Yes.

413
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,340
Let's get started.

414
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,310
This place reminds me of the space station.

415
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,030
This will last longer than 15 minutes, right?

416
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:25,120
Do you remember when we argued over the nine oxygen tanks?

417
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,170
We both insisted the other should take the last one.

418
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:37,090
I guess we were terrified of being the one to watch the other die first.

419
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,630
We're selfish people.

420
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,110
What a waste of oxygen.

421
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,610
You're breathing it to stay alive after what you did?

422
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,280
-Dr. Kang. -Who the hell are you to make Go-eun cry?

423
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:09,160
How dare you crush her pride and hurt her like that?

424
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,080
All she ever did…

425
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,000
All she ever did was like you!

426
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,340
You think only your feelings matter?

427
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,670
What about hers?

428
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,840
What about her feelings?

429
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,060
You have no problem

430
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,140
breaking her heart and tearing it into shreds?

431
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,520
I hope you suffocate and die.

432
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,940
You arrogant dirtbag!

433
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,070
You heartless bastard!

434
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,080
I'm not telling you to make things right with Go-eun.

435
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,500
So don't try to make amends.

436
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,120
Don't even apologize.

437
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,540
If you do that just to make yourself feel better,

438
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,420
I'll kill you for real.

439
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,090
What's going on here?

440
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,380
Ryong!

441
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,260
What the hell?

442
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,340
-Aren't you a space scientist? -If you…

443
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,640
-Let go! Hey! -If you hurt Go-eun again…

444
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:13,060
Let go. Let go of him!

445
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,480
I swear I'll make you pay!

446
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,770
Why are you fighting like a couple of thugs in the hospital?

447
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,940
Are you insane?

448
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:21,400
Are you all right?

449
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,660
What the hell happened here?

450
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,490
He really laid into you.

451
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,080
Why didn't you stop them?

452
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,170
It looked like he deserved it.

453
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:43,340
Come on, you're not helping.

454
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,550
She's right.

455
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:48,430
I… I deserved it.

456
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,640
I can't believe you people!

457
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,310
You fought so hard to survive in space,

458
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,810
so why are you acting like you want to die now?

459
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,940
I'll get the first aid kit. Stay right here.

460
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,440
We'll finish therapy later.

461
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,210
Man, that's rough.

462
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,510
Look at us. This is just great.

463
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,550
I know.

464
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,450
KOREA SPACE AGENCY

465
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,120
The Korean astronauts are amazing.

466
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,990
Yeah, I agree.

467
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,750
A spacecraft will head to the ILS as planned.

468
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:01,460
The mission has changed to investigate the incident.

469
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,250
Since restoring power is the highest priority,

470
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,630
we'll look over the solar panel, the energy conversion device,

471
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:10,470
and the perforation of the storage module.

472
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,090
By the way,

473
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:15,600
how did the tourist get left behind in the observation module?

474
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,060
He said that he was isolated while trying to get his baggage.

475
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:23,150
Was he not briefed on the severity of the situation?

476
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:27,150
I guess he was just

477
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,900
bemused or something.

478
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,990
Please try to find the tablet and the cell phone

479
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,780
that the team left behind.

480
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,990
Is there anything else we can do to support you?

481
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,990
THE TRUTH IS, I CAME HERE TO CREATE EMBRYOS…

482
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,360
Here's your meal.

483
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,610
You're doing much better.

484
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,110
Could I ask you something?

485
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,950
What's that place with all the tables down there?

486
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,540
Oh, it's a convenience store.

487
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,000
It's a convenience store?

488
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:06,710
Thank you.

489
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,920
Sure, hope you enjoy!

490
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,050
Will do.

491
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,050
How about I find us a good place to eat?

492
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,680
Code blue, code blue.

493
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,520
Paging Dr. Lee from Cardiothoracic Surgery to the Gravity Adjustment Ward.

494
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,690
Code blue, code blue.

495
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:29,360
Paging Dr. Lee from Cardiothoracic Surgery to the Gravity Adjustment Ward.

496
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,150
Code blue, code blue.

497
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,440
-Eve? -Paging Dr. Lee.

498
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:35,900
-Report to the Gravity Adjustment Ward. -Ryong?

499
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,250
Are you all right?

500
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,540
-Monitor, please. -I'm on it.

501
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:55,720
Dona, are you okay?

502
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,630
Yeah.

503
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,400
Si-won, let's go.

504
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:18,700
Dong-a has no idea it's his birthday today, does he?

505
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,530
I think everyone else forgot as well.

506
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,740
Even the commander?

507
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,290
Even her.

508
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:25,410
She's been caught up in gravity readjustment.

509
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,800
I found it in his sock.

510
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,260
That dude is so…

511
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,720
Mina, are you feeling okay?

512
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:51,020
Wait, what are you all doing here?

513
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:52,480
Nothing.

514
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,820
What brings you here?

515
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:58,530
Oh, it's Dong-a's birthday today. We planned a little surprise party.

516
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:00,320
Should we light the candles here?

517
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:02,450
Sure.

518
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:06,580
By the way, where's Dr. Kang?

519
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:11,250
He's probably in his room.

520
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,880
Should we invite the tourist too while we're at it?

521
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,960
Sure, why not?

522
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:18,090
-What's going on? -Gosh.

523
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,760
What are you all doing without me?

524
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:23,260
Nothing. We're here to celebrate Dong-a's birthday.

525
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,970
We were just about to come get you.

526
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:27,390
Chief Kang is coming too.

527
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:31,230
By the way, where is Dong-a?

528
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:38,230
Happy birthday to you

529
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:43,570
Happy birthday to you

530
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:44,490
Happy birthday…

531
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:47,490
-You know what? Forget it. -No, we're doing this together.

532
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:48,700
All right, fine.

533
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:53,210
Happy birthday to you

534
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:58,670
-Olé! -Happy birthday.

535
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,960
Well, this is embarrassing.

536
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:04,260
Chief, I appreciate it, but could you guys leave now?

537
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,510
-I knew he wouldn't be so happy. -Ta-da!

538
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:08,720
-Ta-da. -What's that?

539
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:09,810
Well,

540
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:13,690
I thought the commander should see this.

541
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:14,940
Si-won, why would you…

542
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:16,860
What is it?

543
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,610
We were supposed to do the abort and reentry tests

544
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:22,570
with that manikin, but Dong-a took it down,

545
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:24,530
insisting on taking its place.

546
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:28,330
He was all, Eve will die waiting for a rescue ship.

547
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:30,250
I'll be the manikin.

548
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:31,620
He wouldn't budge.

549
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:48,930
Come on. Turn that off.

550
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:51,020
-Not a chance. -Why? What is it?

551
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,480
-Hang on. -Yeah, let's see it.

552
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,440
-Yeah, you haven't seen anything yet. -Wait, what's this video?

553
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:06,450
Eve.

554
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:11,700
I'm scared.

555
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,580
I'm terrified.

556
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,590
You must be so scared right now too.

557
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,270
I'm coming for you.

558
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:41,570
Just hold on a little longer…

559
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,110
Don't give up, okay?

560
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,120
I know I'm not the most reliable,

561
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,370
but you still have to trust me

562
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:56,330
if you're going to survive!

563
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:01,840
I'm coming for you.

564
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:07,970
I'll never let you die alone, okay?

565
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,810
I won't let you die up there so lonely like that

566
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:14,470
with no one around.

567
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,390
No matter how scared I am,

568
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:21,400
I'm coming for you, Eve.

569
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,340
Give me the remote. Come on, turn it off now!

570
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:52,140
-Come on. -This is the highlight, okay? This is it.

571
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,850
-Hang on. -Why? I think it's cool.

572
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,350
We have to go faster!

573
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:01,810
Hey, listen. You've seen enough. Thanks for coming.

574
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,190
Come on, you should leave. Get out.

575
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:05,690
Yeah, thanks. Just go.

576
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:09,900
No, let's keep watching. I'm coming for you!

577
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,300
Dr. Gong.

578
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:27,760
Dr. Na.

579
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:28,880
Dr. Gong.

580
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:32,890
Thank you so much for everything you've done.

581
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,260
I'm sorry.

582
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:39,140
Don't be. Now it's time for you to do your job as the mom.

583
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:42,770
So, how are you doing?

584
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:43,860
Me?

585
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,400
I've got some tough competition.

586
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,690
-Sorry? -What?

587
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,160
I have to admit.

588
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,160
The guy is pretty great and impressive.

589
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:01,500
No one in this world,

590
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:06,040
on this entire planet, is as great or impressive as you.

591
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:08,170
There's no way. Who could compare?

592
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:13,430
They say infertility could lead to the end of life on Earth.

593
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:16,180
You're the one who saved our planet and everyone on it.

594
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:19,520
Come on, you're exaggerating way too much.

595
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:27,070
Do you really think I'm a decent guy?

596
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,440
I think

597
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,950
I'm nothing more than a speck of cosmic dust.

598
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:37,870
A selfish, petty, and jealous…

599
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,450
speck of dust.

600
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,090
I'm not part of the Choi family.

601
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:50,050
I hope you find someone you love,

602
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:52,760
who loves you back,

603
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,050
and stay happy and healthy with them.

604
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,770
Do I deserve that?

605
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,480
Of course.

606
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,850
Will it happen for me?

607
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:07,020
Absolutely.

608
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,070
I don't think it will.

609
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,580
Any plans for after you're discharged?

610
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:24,830
How about a movie?

611
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:30,800
Do you want to go for a walk?

612
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:33,510
How about I find us a good place to eat?

613
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:35,130
Why don't we go get a haircut?

614
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:42,970
BUY TICKETS HERE

615
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:58,030
HOW ABOUT A MOVIE?

616
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:35,900
DO YOU WANT TO GO FOR A WALK?

617
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:54,840
RYONG, PARTY OF 2

618
00:50:54,920 --> 00:51:00,760
HOW ABOUT I FIND US A GOOD PLACE TO EAT?

619
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:11,560
HAIR SALON

620
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:18,690
WHY DON'T WE GO GET A HAIRCUT?

621
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,870
Let's do all of these things here on Earth.

622
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:39,720
Come in.

623
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:55,980
You didn't eat your dinner.

624
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:57,280
Or take your meds.

625
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:03,660
Ryong.

626
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:07,580
Mr. Tourist.

627
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,700
I'm not hungry.

628
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:14,500
Do you want to go to the convenience store?

629
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:38,070
Are you cold?

630
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:39,940
No.

631
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,990
Let's go.

632
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:51,790
Come on.

633
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:55,120
Ten seconds left.

634
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:56,750
-Hurry. -This is hard.

635
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:04,090
I can't believe we're doing this.

636
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:05,970
I know, me neither.

637
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,810
You added the entire seasoning packet?

638
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,600
-Yeah. -It's going to be too salty.

639
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:16,850
It's supposed to be salty.

640
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:19,110
You should add more water.

641
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:22,860
Come on, ramyeon should be salty. That's what makes it tasty.

642
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,280
I'm finally having some,

643
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:26,490
so I'm eating it the way I like,

644
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:28,070
the way I think tastes best.

645
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:33,080
-Eve. -Yeah?

646
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,960
That'll spike your blood pressure.

647
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:36,620
Good, mine's too low.

648
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:40,800
Come on, add more water.

649
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,340
All right, let's see how salty it is.

650
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:48,760
All right.

651
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:52,010
Let's eat!

652
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,820
I feel alive.

653
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:11,030
It's so satisfying.

654
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:17,290
MU CUP NOODLES SLURP, ALL DONE

655
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:20,880
All done.

656
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,460
Thanks.

657
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:26,380
Hot food makes your nose run, huh?

658
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:36,850
I'm so happy right now.

659
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:43,900
Ryong.

660
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:45,860
Yeah?

661
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:50,320
Let's pretend like it never happened.

662
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:54,740
What do you mean?

663
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,700
The sex.

664
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:02,210
I've snapped back to reality.

665
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,170
Everything that happened in space feels like a dream.

666
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,600
I risked my life walking out into space for some guy.

667
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:15,930
I saved his life

668
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,140
and kissed him.

669
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,480
Even when you said you'd created a human embryo, I wasn't mad.

670
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:22,980
And when I thought…

671
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,190
we were going to die, I had sex with you in the freezing cold.

672
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,330
I don't do that.

673
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:43,830
To me, that's like a dream.

674
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,460
A good dream.

675
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:53,470
That's not who I am.

676
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:57,560
I've woken up from the dream.

677
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,560
You should too.

678
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:06,270
That's not who you are?

679
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:11,030
Dong-a risked his life to save us.

680
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:14,910
That's not as easy as it sounds. It's not something to take for granted.

681
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:17,450
And you have a woman who trusted and waited for you.

682
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:25,960
Let's not hurt the people who love us

683
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:29,550
just because of the ten short days we spent in space.

684
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:35,390
I'm going back to space in a month.

685
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:39,430
Once I do, I'll never think about you again.

686
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:43,810
You keep denying yourself.

687
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,020
You keep denying your feelings.

688
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,730
Why do you do that?

689
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:51,940
For what?

690
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:53,360
For who?

691
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:59,240
You asked about my plans after I get discharged.

692
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:05,080
I want to be done with you. That's my plan.

693
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,800
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

694
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:35,590
It looks like

695
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,970
the two of them had sex.

696
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:40,300
So did you keep his legs still?

697
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:42,810
He gave the ticket back because you did it, right?

698
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:46,480
Whether or not you and Ryong end up together, it's all the same to me.

699
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,270
I wanted to meet you. I kept thinking about you.

700
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:52,730
You're heading back to space soon.

701
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,610
Why don't you reconsider? Stay with me a bit longer.

702
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:57,990
I'll need separate reports from each of you.

703
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:00,070
Make sure you leave that part out, okay?

704
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,240
You're ashamed of what we did. Is that it?

705
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:12,500
