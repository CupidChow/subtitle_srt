1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,010
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

2
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,430
Think about what the IOU wanted to achieve with Santi's sperm.

3
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,110
We could explain that the sperm of MZ Group heir was also misshappen

4
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,650
and try to convince them that it's a scientific achievement

5
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,650
for solving infertility, Chief.

6
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,360
You want to try to have this illegal experiment

7
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,160
recognized as a scientific achievement?

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,620
You want to gamble the future of the Korea Space Agency

9
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,750
on a morula that may or may not become life?

10
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,040
It could be an opportunity for both, Chief.

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,380
The tourist

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,500
performed the ICSI,

13
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,920
smuggled the embryo into Earth,

14
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,880
and attempted to implant it.

15
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,680
He could face penalties in the hundreds of billions for that alone.

16
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,350
Add the bribery of the astronauts including the commander,

17
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,970
and the charges become more serious.

18
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,810
He'll lose his medical license and face criminal charges.

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,100
He'll end up in prison!

20
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,780
Fine.

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,740
If you really can't give it up, go ahead and gamble.

22
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,330
Your colleagues, your beloved tourist, and the KSA.

23
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,500
If you decide to risk it all as the commander,

24
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,880
I'll do as you say.

25
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,220
What's it going to be?

26
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,470
What should I tell the IOU?

27
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,230
Tell me.

28
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,270
Say something!

29
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,150
Over here, Ms. Choi.

30
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,860
Hey, why won't you pick up your phone?

31
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,070
You have to go to the MCC now!

32
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,370
Ryong,

33
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,870
the morula, they're…

34
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,850
-Is table four ready? -Yes.

35
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,980
-Okay, let's hurry it up. -Yes.

36
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,890
Mr. Kang.

37
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,100
Get everyone out of here.

38
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,980
I'm sorry, but we need you to step out.

39
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,820
Everyone, please leave the kitchen.

40
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,940
You need to go to the MCC first!

41
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,200
Did you get rid of the portable freezer?

42
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,870
And the link to the freezer is off?

43
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,000
The legal team did.

44
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,710
Thankfully, Mr. Ryong told them that the confiscated morula

45
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,170
was fertilized here on Earth.

46
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,090
Oh, geez.

47
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,970
Come on! You need to go there now!

48
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,020
CHIEF KANG

49
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:17,980
Hello?

50
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,030
Get over here.

51
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,910
Go and do whatever it takes to get Ryong out of there.

52
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,380
Tell them the morula was fertilized here and get it back. Okay?

53
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,340
They'll both survive this, right?

54
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,300
The morula that should never have ended up on Earth

55
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,760
was confiscated at MZ Medical Center right before the transplant.

56
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,850
The IOU would be appalled.

57
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,480
If this gets out, your dad is finished, so pull yourself together.

58
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,570
We have to side with the MCC on this.

59
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,940
That's the only way we'll survive.

60
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,030
Do you understand?

61
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,410
Commander.

62
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,250
Commander.

63
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,670
You'll give it back, right?

64
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,220
You haven't changed your mind, right?

65
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,310
We felt the same way about it.

66
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,020
You…

67
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,610
haven't changed your mind, right?

68
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,280
You're just a tourist.

69
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,460
I'm the commander who needs to protect the space station and the space agency.

70
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,000
As per space experiment ethics regulations…

71
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,420
I'm discarding it.

72
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,550
Don't forgive me.

73
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,530
Dr. Kang had already performed an illegal experiment up there.

74
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,200
The eggs and sperm I failed to destroy were used to create a new morula.

75
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,330
But when I found out,

76
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,370
I was afraid that it would jeopardize my status as commander,

77
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,790
so I couldn't report it to the IOU or KSA.

78
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,840
Even after I came down,

79
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,180
I intentionally left it out of my report on the tourist.

80
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,180
It was an unacceptable, cowardly act from a commander.

81
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,230
I only thought about myself.

82
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,820
I've brought shame to the KSA and Expedition 3.

83
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,030
The other members don't know anything, Chief.

84
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,080
I don't deserve to be the commander.

85
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,540
Please dismiss me

86
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,000
and let me take full responsibility.

87
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,980
I'll dispose of it now.

88
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,820
Chief.

89
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,070
Please report to the IOU that I disposed of the morula at the station.

90
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,410
The morula never made it down to Earth.

91
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,500
It was thrown away in a shredder, and that's why the investigation team

92
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,420
couldn't find it.

93
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,540
Open the door!

94
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,620
Open this door!

95
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,340
Eve!

96
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,670
Don't do it!

97
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,880
Don't do it, Eve!

98
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,360
Don't do it, please!

99
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,030
Don't do it!

100
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,780
Please, damn it!

101
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,660
Don't do it!

102
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,710
It survived the unknown rays…

103
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,330
and radiation.

104
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,880
It made it this far…

105
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,300
against all odds.

106
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,180
Why?

107
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,270
Why does it have to die in the hands of humans?

108
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:43,890
Don't do it.

109
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,020
Don't do it!

110
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,270
Don't do it, you bastards!

111
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,150
Who is this code of ethics for?

112
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,700
Tell me, for whom does this code of ethics exist?

113
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,820
The mother wants it.

114
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,870
The mother wants her baby!

115
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:08,770
I…

116
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,060
am going to save you no matter what.

117
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,400
BIOMEDICAL WASTE

118
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,560
Let's say this morula was disposed of at the station.

119
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,150
You showed me the note on your phone,

120
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,400
confessed, reflected on your actions,

121
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,160
and together, we agreed

122
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,030
to dispose of it up there.

123
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,200
That was why we left that part out of our reports.

124
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,500
It never made it back down to Earth.

125
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,000
If they find out you brought it down to Earth,

126
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,510
it will land you a heavier sentence.

127
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,380
Even if they have their suspicions,

128
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,260
KSA and MCC want to believe

129
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,890
that you secretly smuggled the eggs up to the space station

130
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,480
without telling MZ or the egg's owner to marry the MZ chairman's daughter.

131
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:02,440
And they want to believe that you alone prepped

132
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:08,200
the microscope and performed ICSI when you were at the radio wave dead zone.

133
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,330
The official explanation will be

134
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,330
that the morula confiscated from MZ Medical Center

135
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,210
was fertilized here on Earth as per your statement.

136
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,800
You have to stand trial.

137
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,970
You can't avoid punishment, so be prepared.

138
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,260
Did you…

139
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,060
Did you…

140
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,480
really do it?

141
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,450
Did you do it?

142
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,050
Don't touch it!

143
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,770
You must remember…

144
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,480
the morula was disposed of at the station.

145
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,520
That's the only way you'll survive.

146
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,690
You have to protect yourself too.

147
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,110
You're not doing this for me.

148
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,830
Are you saying that you disposed of it because of me?

149
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,910
Since you've already disposed of seven,

150
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,710
getting rid of one more

151
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,250
was nothing, wasn't it?

152
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,380
Now that you've disposed of all eight of them,

153
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,130
are you happy now?

154
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,140
When you…

155
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,930
disposed of it…

156
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,980
you've killed me too.

157
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,660
You got rid of it to save yourself!

158
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,880
You people disposed of it to save yourselves!

159
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,550
Am I wrong?

160
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,430
You're right.

161
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,810
I…

162
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,600
I was wrong about you.

163
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,440
Don't forget what you did…

164
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,110
for the rest of your life.

165
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,280
Because I won't forget this too.

166
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,230
I'm sorry, Commander. We…

167
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,700
It's all because of that damn lottery ticket.

168
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,530
It would have been impossible if he worked on it alone.

169
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,700
We created this mess because we were blinded by money.

170
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,960
What's gonna happen to him?

171
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,280
Isn't it the same as yours?

172
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,320
Do you have proof?

173
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,110
-It's the same, right? -Why?

174
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,070
You took my suit. Now you want my underwear?

175
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,580
Weren't you all in a hurry to shred the evidence at the station?

176
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,080
There's no point in expanding the investigation to MZ.

177
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,620
Do you think they would have left any evidence behind?

178
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,550
You're going to pin all the blame on Mr. Gong?

179
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,630
And the morula?

180
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,300
When they were alone up there,

181
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,100
Eve disposed of it when she found out.

182
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,350
Is that how it is?

183
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,810
I thought the one confiscated today was fertilized by Ryong on Earth.

184
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,060
Am I wrong?

185
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,030
You're not, of course.

186
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,820
Then we won't investigate MZ Group.

187
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,660
Because the survival of the KSA is on the line.

188
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,750
That also applies to you.

189
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,010
So it's just Ryong who's screwed.

190
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:04,180
Don't ever let me see either of your faces again.

191
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,700
Let's go see Dr. Na.

192
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,580
I'll break it to them.

193
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,960
Let's just go.

194
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,260
Do you think you'll be welcome there?

195
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,800
They'll skin you alive and make a carpet out of you.

196
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:46,890
There's no morula.

197
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,430
Shut your mouth.

198
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,810
They already cut you loose.

199
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,810
They only treated you well when you had the morula.

200
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,980
The chairman treats even a person like me like vermin.

201
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,730
It's over.

202
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,120
You're the only one who will end up losing.

203
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,580
They've already made you look like an asshole here.

204
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,000
If you show up empty-handed, those people won't care what you say.

205
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,310
What…

206
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:35,810
is this?

207
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,980
Did you bring a dead one?

208
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,700
Did you?

209
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,240
Answer me.

210
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,120
Answer me, you bastard.

211
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,000
You promised to make me a grandchild.

212
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,420
I'm sorry.

213
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,630
Sorry? You're sorry?

214
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,050
Answer me,

215
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,510
before I rip your mouth apart.

216
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,380
You better choose your words wisely, you useless piece of shit!

217
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,970
You worthless idiot.

218
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,930
-Sorry? -Please, dad.

219
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,600
MZ MEDICAL CENTER

220
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,740
I'll get you a lawyer.

221
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,450
Don't worry about the fine.

222
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,750
Ryong, you shouldn't be driving right now. Let me drive.

223
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,130
Go-eun…

224
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,010
you should be with Dr. Na and the chairman.

225
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,510
Don't do anything for me.

226
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:54,100
I don't deserve anything from you.

227
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,880
I'm revoking your commander status.

228
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:10,300
Ma Eun-su will take over the mouse experiments.

229
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,810
Your dismissal will depend on the IOU's decision.

230
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,480
I'm disappointed in you.

231
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,150
You better behave yourself.

232
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,360
Yes, ma'am.

233
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,290
Come back down after three months.

234
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,870
Make amends for leaving it out of the IOU report, then quit.

235
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:45,500
Go up with Park Dong-a and finish the repairs on the station.

236
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,800
It was damaged on our watch,

237
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,130
so we should finish the job.

238
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,560
It's amazing you got a permission for her to go back up

239
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,310
when she has a disciplinary committee waiting for her.

240
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,980
How did you do it?

241
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,070
They were all set on firing her. How did you stop them?

242
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:14,530
It's the right thing.

243
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,700
She needs to say her good-byes to the stars.

244
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,450
I'm sure Eve is grateful

245
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,750
that you stuck your neck out for her.

246
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,880
You need to get lost too.

247
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,430
TO EVE KIM

248
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,780
STRANDED ASTRONAUTS RETURN…

249
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,670
TWO MONTHS LATER

250
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:25,060
Santi, this is EV1. Get me closer.

251
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,980
10-4, stand by.

252
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,690
Drawing nigh.

253
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,070
Getting you closer there.

254
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,110
Okay.

255
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:39,320
Thank God this was the extent of it.

256
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:42,080
If the hole was any bigger, the station would have exploded.

257
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,300
All right,

258
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,760
we've finished drilling.

259
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,810
EV2, covering the exterior O-ring patch.

260
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:21,240
Dr. Lee, start fastening it on the inside.

261
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:32,250
I'm going to seal the gap with silicone.

262
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,230
We're done injecting the silicone. Turn it now, Eve.

263
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:22,050
EV2, we've finished repairs on the damaged hole.

264
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,050
Dr. Lee,

265
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,760
start checking for any leakage in the storage module.

266
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,970
I'll start after one hour.

267
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,190
If there aren't any leaks,

268
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:35,360
we can finally open the sealed observation module tomorrow.

269
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,150
Nice!

270
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,860
I missed my CQ. My bathroom!

271
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,660
Great job fixing the station. Good job, both of you.

272
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,700
How about you put your money where your mouth is

273
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,910
and when Santi and I return to Earth in two days,

274
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,830
you give us a big fat raise, huh?

275
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:54,750
And make sure to give Eve a generous severance.

276
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,050
Eve.

277
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,340
Next month when you come down, you should get a medical check.

278
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,970
You've had a fever lately, and you've lost a lot of weight.

279
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,640
Why do you keep losing weight?

280
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,220
Even now, your temperature is a bit high.

281
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,600
You went up too soon without proper rest.

282
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,940
I'll do that, Dona.

283
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:17,230
I really hope nothing more will happen to the station.

284
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,780
Let's keep it this way, intact, without any major problems.

285
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,190
COURT

286
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,950
I will declare the sentence now.

287
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:05,860
DEFENDANT

288
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,620
This case represents a truly heinous crime.

289
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,200
One where the defendant preyed upon the desperate hopes

290
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:15,830
of an infertile couple who longed for a child,

291
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,040
and who had placed their trust in him for years.

292
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:22,420
It was a grossly immoral act

293
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,720
where an ob-gyn, whose primary duty is to respect life,

294
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,510
took the lead in violating the bioethics law.

295
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,720
Given the grave nature of this crime,

296
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:35,430
the medical association has already revoked the defendant's license

297
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,520
and the International Space Agency has imposed a 140 billion won penalty

298
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:44,400
for significantly damaging the reputation of our country's space program.

299
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,820
Therefore,

300
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:51,870
pursuant to Articles 66, 67, and 68 of the Bioethics and Safety Act,

301
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,660
the Court rules as follows.

302
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:58,210
The Court orders that the defendant, Gong Ryong,

303
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,880
is sentenced to two years in prison.

304
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:05,460
However, the sentence will be suspended for four years,

305
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:08,090
beginning on the date this judgment becomes final.

306
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,890
Oh, my God.

307
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,230
He can't be a doctor anymore and two years in prison?

308
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,270
Is our Ryong going to prison?

309
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,600
-Is he? -No.

310
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:23,360
He's going to prison and what's this suspended sentence thing?

311
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,570
Why four years? What is he supposed to do now?

312
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,740
No, he's not going to prison.

313
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,860
We should be relieved.

314
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,990
-Relieved? -How is that a relief?

315
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:34,580
MZ Group has announced that Gong Ryong and MZ Electronic CEO, Choi Go-eun,

316
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,160
have called off their engagement.

317
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,660
Gong Ryong was found guilty of violating Bioethics and Safety Act,

318
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,830
had his medical license revoked and was sentenced to two years in prison

319
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,840
with a four year suspended sentence. He was fined 140 billion won.

320
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,670
It seems that Choi Go-eun,

321
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,470
who had up until recently openly expressed her affection for Gong Ryong

322
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,390
in front of the whole world, could no longer turn a blind eye

323
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,390
to her fiancé's unethical actions.

324
00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:00,100
After spending 70 billion won to send Gong Ryong into space,

325
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:03,860
accusations that they knew of and condoned Gong Ryong's illegal experiments

326
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,400
seem to be waning in the wake of this recent breakup.

327
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,070
You no longer have to worry.

328
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,450
Mr. Ryong will be the only one held accountable.

329
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,950
Aren't you sorry for what you did to Ryong?

330
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,660
We made Ryong out to be

331
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,080
a shameless doctor, just so we could save ourselves.

332
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,800
Not just as a doctor,

333
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:31,510
you completely ruined a man's life.

334
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,510
Do you think I don't know?

335
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,810
That bastard cheated on you up there.

336
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:43,940
It's true, isn't it?

337
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:17,600
GO-EUN

338
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:06,400
I heard the news all the way in Houston while I was collecting my winnings.

339
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,770
Two years in prison and 140 billion won.

340
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,650
I really wanted to see you as I was leaving the airport.

341
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:18,240
As soon as Eve comes back from finishing the repairs,

342
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,530
she'll be fired.

343
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,660
If she was fired right away,

344
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,630
Chief Kang was worried that IOU might get a whiff of something,

345
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,380
so she pushed it back three months.

346
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:35,420
She gave Eve a ton of work and managed to fool them.

347
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:39,010
You have to admit, Chief Kang is very sly, like a fox. Don't you think?

348
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,100
How annoying.

349
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,270
Maybe I should recruit her for my company after she retires.

350
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:52,230
Serves Eve right for getting fired.

351
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,820
Bet you're upset though, right?

352
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,950
I hope it works out with Eve.

353
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,870
That way I can reap the benefits.

354
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,420
I'm going to give it another shot with Go-eun.

355
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,050
-Hey. -Leave.

356
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,260
I have the prize money in my bank account.

357
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,310
Want me to pay the fine?

358
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,270
When Eve comes back down, try to make it work.

359
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,270
Damn!

360
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,030
Hey.

361
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:39,860
Listen, don't stay here and live like this.

362
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:42,160
Go to the US and get your medical license again.

363
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,490
You're more than capable of doing that.

364
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:48,330
When Eve comes down, she'll stay in the US.

365
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,540
You should pay for the drinks you had…

366
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,050
How much is the bill?

367
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:05,390
FLAVORS OF THE MOUNTAIN, SEA, AND SKY

368
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,900
This anger is burning me up inside.

369
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:21,910
Hwa-ja, I'm so mad, I could die.

370
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,320
That goes for me too.

371
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,830
We'll do it. Go home.

372
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,420
I told you to get out of the kitchen.

373
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,800
Why would you wash the dishes?

374
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,260
If you want to do nothing, at least read a book.

375
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,130
Hurry, get out.

376
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,050
You little brat.

377
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:45,850
Are you disobeying us because we're not your biological mothers?

378
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:47,180
Are you ignoring us?

379
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,350
Cat got your tongue?

380
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:52,020
Do you plan on staying silent forever?

381
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,350
Don't you have a lot you want to say?

382
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,730
Listen, you little shit!

383
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,320
Take off those rubber gloves!

384
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,940
Take it easy, okay?

385
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,650
How can Dr. Ma take it easy?

386
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,030
She's going up soon, and it's her first time.

387
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,740
I'm going to have babies too.

388
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,990
Is that right?

389
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:33,620
Pregnancy and childbirth aren't the same thing.

390
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,250
Even if you're not pregnant up there, you lose calcium,

391
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,500
which weakens your bones.

392
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,210
But imagine having a baby inside you,

393
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,090
the baby will relentlessly suck the female's calcium and nutrients

394
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,630
from her bones.

395
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,050
And when the mother pushes during birth, her pelvic bone could break.

396
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,260
The moment her bones break inside her body…

397
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,270
it's game over.

398
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,930
The mother will die giving birth.

399
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,650
You know you can't perform proper surgeries in zero gravity, right?

400
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:01,150
A C-section is absolutely impossible.

401
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,230
It has to be a natural birth, no matter what.

402
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,690
Why are you trying to put a damper on things?

403
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,740
So does that mean humanity can only live on Earth?

404
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,830
Don't forget we already did heart surgery on a mouse.

405
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:14,790
We just started on mice, don't get carried away.

406
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,540
There's still a long way to go.

407
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,000
It's going to be one hurdle after another.

408
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,760
Whatever.

409
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,600
Good job. You did good.

410
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,640
Isn't she beautiful?

411
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,770
Good job.

412
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,810
Good job, everyone.

413
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,440
-Good job. -Nice work.

414
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,610
DELIVERY ROOM

415
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,240
NEW MESSAGE FROM EVE KIM

416
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,330
EVE KIM

417
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,540
Wait a second.

418
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,630
What is this?

419
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,930
I'm sorry, but could you take a look at it first, Doctor?

420
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:14,100
Is it what I think it is?

421
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,140
I'm sorry?

422
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,520
Does it look okay?

423
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,980
Is this really a baby?

424
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,440
What is?

425
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:30,070
Yes, it's a 12-week-old fetus, about 5.4 centimeters.

426
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:45,210
I'm scared to death we're going to get caught.

427
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,880
It's not like we are committing a crime.

428
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,630
What would people in Seoul say if they found out we were secretly dating?

429
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,090
Let's go see the stars.

430
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,020
The baby's arms and legs are moving a lot, which is good.

431
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,310
Amniotic fluid level is also fine.

432
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,230
Really?

433
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:03,480
Hurry, get out of here.

434
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,400
Could you tell me if the baby's organs are developing normally?

435
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,240
Is there no sign of deformity?

436
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:12,950
No.

437
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:18,240
The brain is symmetrical and shaped like a butterfly.

438
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:20,120
The lower body and both legs…

439
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:24,120
Let's see, the knees, calf bones, and tibia

440
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:26,000
are all developing normally.

441
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,420
The placenta looks good too.

442
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:31,920
Normally, when a fetus is about 5 centimeters,

443
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:35,050
it has a heart, stomach, kidneys, and all the other organs,

444
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:38,100
but they're just not visible on the ultrasound.

445
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:42,270
The cervix seems a bit short, though.

446
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,940
But, Commander,

447
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:52,320
this doesn't look like it was taken by a professional.

448
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,700
Who took this ultrasound?

449
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,700
Who is the mother?

450
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,830
Please, don't tell anyone. I'm begging you.

451
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:15,130
Of course. I am, after all, a doctor.

452
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,180
What can I do to help?

453
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,810
Can I ask you one more thing?

454
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,640
Yes, anything.

455
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,730
When passing through the Earth's atmosphere,

456
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,940
the crew experiences a force of 4G.

457
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:35,490
Can a fetus withstand a force of 4G?

458
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:43,410
Commander…

459
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,710
even though the baby

460
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:51,340
is in the mother's womb and is being protected by her womb,

461
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,460
a force of 4G

462
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:57,880
could cause a sudden change in the mother's blood pressure,

463
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,430
potentially cutting off the baby's oxygen supply temporarily.

464
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:03,140
So, in other words…

465
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:09,350
Yes, the baby could die.

466
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:12,650
The chances of it dying are high, Commander.

467
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:51,900
Dr. Gong.

468
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:55,570
I'm leaving.

469
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:01,280
I'm going to continue my studies in the place I was going to live

470
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,820
after I got pregnant.

471
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,040
Come with me.

472
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,620
You should continue your studies too, Dr. Gong.

473
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:14,090
What would be the point?

474
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:18,380
I'm sick of it all. It would be useless anyway.

475
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,510
I'm sorry.

476
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,560
I'm the one who's sorry.

477
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:37,070
I can't sleep at night because I feel like I ruined your life, Dr. Gong.

478
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,740
Please take some time to think about it then come.

479
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,200
I'll set everything up.

480
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:44,990
I'm not using the chairman's money.

481
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:55,420
Dr. Gong, in my eyes, there's no other ob-gyn like you.

482
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,340
You're the best.

483
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:05,050
I'm not confident delivering babies anymore.

484
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:09,100
It was a terrifying and frightening thing.

485
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,520
I had no fear back then.

486
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,060
Now, I feel like

487
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,030
every baby I deliver is going to die.

488
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:31,830
-Eve. -Eve.

489
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,880
Eve.

490
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,260
What are you going to do?

491
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:52,350
Aren't you scared?

492
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,520
Of course, I'm scared.

493
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:04,030
Does the father know?

494
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,830
I'm going to have to tell him.

495
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:12,660
Who is it?

496
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,840
It happened when Gong Ryong and I were left here alone.

497
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,590
Here?

498
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,760
Of all places, I can't believe it was here.

499
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,060
Isn't this kid amazing?

500
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,440
When he finds out, he's going to be shocked too.

501
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:48,870
Will he hate the baby too…

502
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:54,080
since he's disappointed in me?

503
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,970
If I decide to go back to Earth,

504
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:09,590
will this baby understand me?

505
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:13,810
It probably already knows I'm having these doubts.

506
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:14,890
What should I do?

507
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:21,860
When I wake up tomorrow morning,

508
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:24,690
I just wish we're both back on Earth.

509
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:32,530
Why are you being so foolish when you already know the answer?

510
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,540
You have to go back down.

511
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:40,080
How could this baby have come to someone like me?

512
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:42,420
What does it see in me that makes it trust me

513
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,010
so completely, depending on me for everything?

514
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:51,720
It's so heartbreaking it makes me angry.

515
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:13,580
EVE

516
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:29,590
EVE

517
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:31,650
JEON YI-MAN

518
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:35,370
I can't believe this. Come on already!

519
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:37,240
The person you called is…

520
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:45,880
Pick up the phone. Please pick up the phone.

521
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,260
-Enjoy your dinner. -Thank you.

522
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,260
Hwa-ja, the assorted jeon is ready. Table five.

523
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,390
Got it, table five.

524
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,140
You little brat.

525
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,100
Have you given up on life?

526
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:05,480
I heard this place has amazing jeon.

527
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,270
Oh, it's here. Oh, that's a lot.

528
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,900
Wow, it looks good.

529
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,190
Come on, let's dig in.

530
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:17,320
EVE

531
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:21,790
Stop getting in the way and go change the music.

532
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,840
-Can we get some water here? -I'll get you more water.

533
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,380
Come on, answer.

534
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:32,590
Ryong, answer the phone. Please, answer!

535
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,590
Come on, pick up.

536
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:46,890
-Dr. Jeon, we're ready for you. -Oh, yes.

537
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,520
Got it, I'll be right there.

538
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,650
The person you called is…

539
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:53,280
You're driving me crazy, come on.

540
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:05,200
JEON YI-MAN

541
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:14,550
JEON YI-MAN

542
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:18,130
Oxygen supply and power in all modules

543
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,760
are now functioning normally.

544
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:23,970
The station is safer and better than it was before the accident.

545
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,060
You did a good job.

546
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,270
How's your health?

547
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,310
It's good.

548
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,440
Time to get ready to head down.

549
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:39,700
Let me know if there's anything else I need to take up with me, Eve.

550
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:41,820
No, there's nothing.

551
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:44,490
Now all that's left is to pack.

552
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:46,620
Are you all packed?

553
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,340
Well? Did you pack everything?

554
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,320
There's nothing more to consider. You're going down, Eve.

555
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,030
Let's go pack.

556
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:23,120
I'll pack everything.

557
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:32,080
This is between the three of us. This never happened.

558
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:33,920
The baby won't make it anyway.

559
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:37,050
I don't want this to get out and ruin Eve.

560
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:39,840
If I have to, I'll use force

561
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,050
to get you on the spacecraft.

562
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:44,050
We have to go down.

563
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:48,640
We're all going down.

564
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,150
Are you worried I'll die up here?

565
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,610
Are you?

566
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:04,820
Yes.

567
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:07,490
Yes.

568
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:14,920
I'm scared you're going to die.

569
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:23,340
I'm not going to die.

570
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:31,830
Why is it beating so fast?

571
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:42,340
Hey, Ryong!

572
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:54,140
Where did you go this early?

573
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,190
Also, answer your phone, damn it!

574
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:03,110
Are you in touch with the commander?

575
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,900
She's not a commander anymore.

576
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,070
Did you sleep with her?

577
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:16,790
Did you sleep with her here in Seoul?

578
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:21,960
-No, I didn't. -You didn't?

579
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,880
Then whose baby…

580
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,340
This is driving me nuts.

581
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:30,050
If it's been 12 weeks, it's right around that time.

582
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,010
Or did she sleep with someone else?

583
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,060
-Get out. -What?

584
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:36,390
Get out.

585
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,690
Hang on a second.

586
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:42,060
Holy shit!

587
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:48,070
I don't know much about zero-gravity, okay?

588
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:51,410
Although you feel uncomfortable, he knows better than I do.

589
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:53,780
I didn't say anything. I didn't say a word.

590
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,870
Answer it! Answer the phone!

591
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:12,180
EVE KIM

592
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,400
-Hey. -What?

593
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,360
Why does this woman keep calling you?

594
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:27,860
What, since I'm not picking up, she's calling every guy she knows?

595
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:33,280
Am I the only loser who still has feelings for her

596
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:36,330
that I can't even answer her calls?

597
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:38,540
Why are you asking me

598
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:41,250
whether she slept with me or some other guy?

599
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:42,290
Damn it.

600
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:55,010
NEW MESSAGE FROM EVE KIM

601
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,970
The baby's heart rate is too fast.

602
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:00,020
Please get back to me as soon as possible.

603
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,870
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

604
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,460
I'm pregnant.

605
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:08,000
It's been three months.

606
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,170
-We should try for a baby again, too. -Are you crazy?

607
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:13,670
Wow, he must be crazy.

608
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,390
I still can't forgive my mother.

609
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:19,350
I refuse to give up on my life

610
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:21,220
and the life of my baby.

611
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:23,430
There's only one person

612
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,310
who would be willing to risk their life.

613
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:28,810
Please let me go and be by Eve's side.

614
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,820
Please, I'm begging you.

615
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:27,290
