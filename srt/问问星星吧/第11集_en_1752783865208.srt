<i>There's no information available</i>

<i>1988, Christmas Eve.</i>

00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,350
<i>You were found in a taxi</i>

6
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,940
<i>The police couldn't identify your parents</i>

7
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,280

00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,370

10
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,200

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,440
-Ryong.
-Yeah?

13
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,190
Can you grant us one wish?

14
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,980
What is it?

15
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,480
Don't ever leave Earth again.

16
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,200
Don't go to space or anywhere like that.

17
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,990
It's not a place you can go
whenever you feel like it.

18
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,740
Stillâ€¦

19
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,790
Okay, fine.

20
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,330
While you were at that station,
we were so freaked out

21
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,290
about you dying in space
that we lost our minds

22
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,710
and almost burned the place down
getting ready.

23
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,800
Didn't you see the bandage
on Ms. Choi's arm?

24
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,970
She got injured trying to save us, Ryong.

25
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:05,800
She didn't tell you?

26
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,640
I guess not.

27
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,230
My goodness.

28
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,440
You should properly thank her.

29
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,690
You will, right?

30
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,110
Yes, I will.

31
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,450
Ryong.

32
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,080
When you get married, forget about us.

33
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,490
Live happily, just you two.

34
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:33,580
Tell Ms. Choi she doesn't
have a mother-in-law.

35
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,630
Got it?

36
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,300
I'm sleepy.

37
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,890
Why are you hitting him?
He barely made it back alive.

38
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,760
Do you know why I hit you?

39
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,100
I think you know why.

40
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,940
I don't know.

41
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,150
You're turning your back to us
because you know.

42
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,690
I said I don't know.

43
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,900
You'd better listen to me carefully.

44
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,780
If you take your pants off
for anyone but Ms. Choi,

45
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,280
I'll kill you myself.

46
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,820
Ryong took his pants off?

47
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,740
Somewhere else? Why did he do that?

48
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,660
Alone?

49
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,500
Did you see him take his pants off?

50
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,710
Hey!

51
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,620
He's still--

52
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:20,420
You can take everything else off,
but you better keep your pants on.

53
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,170
No matter how badly,
how desperately you want to take them off,

54
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,430
if you don't take them off
in the wrong place,

55
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,260
you can achieve great things.

56
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,390
Understand what I'm saying?

57
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,810
Answer me.

58
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,640
-Aren't you going to answer me?
-Damn it.

59
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:36,730
Do you know how old I am?

60
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,520
So what? What about your age?

61
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,070
Forget it.

62
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,070
See? You have nothing to say.

63
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,030
Whatever.

64
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,200
Unbelievable.

65
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,160
What was that all about?

66
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,540
-Damn it.
-Geez.

67
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,370
FLAVORS OF THE MOUNTAIN, SEA, AND SKY

68
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,010
<i>You asked about my plans</i>
<i>after I get discharged.</i>

69
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
I want to be done with you.
That's my plan.

70
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,830
We were about to die,

71
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,420
and we said to each other,

72
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,510
"Let's date."

73
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,090
Now that

74
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,140
we're here on Earth,
there's plenty of oxygen and hot food.

75
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,310
Now that we're in a position

76
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,480
to do whatever we want,

77
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,270
you're going to end it?

78
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,490
You want to end it?

79
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:08,700
Why?

80
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,660
Now that you're back here,

81
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,990
are you ashamed
that you slept with a guy like me?

82
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,960
As commander, you want to be successful
and move up in the world.

83
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,500
Are you embarrassed you had sex
with a tourist on your first assignment?

84
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,930
Is offering a plausible excuse
supposed to be a final act of kindness?

85
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,850
"He's not the kind of guy
I'd date on Earth."

86
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,430
"He'd only hold me back.
I should get rid of him."

87
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,110
So, one last time.

88
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,240
You're ashamed

89
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,530
of what we did. Is that it?

90
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,170
Let's just say that I am.

91
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,970
It was just a one-night stand.

92
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,030
Okay, let's end it.

93
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,700
Fine.

94
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,530
You know what? I'm sick of you too.

95
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,460
If I had died up there,

96
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,210
I would've died happy,
thinking we loved each other.

97
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,390
You're basically saying,
"Eat this and get lost."

98
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,470
Say something.

99
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,860
I'm never going to eat
cup noodles ever again.

100
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,130
No, don't think about it.

101
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,550
That was the only way to end it.

102
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,930
MZ MEDICAL CENTER OB-GYN
DR. GONG RYONG, ROOM 3

103
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,940
Lee Mina.

104
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,940
Yes?

105
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,310
I'll be right back.

106
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,030
Come in.

107
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,170
He's a real doctor.

108
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,090
Didn't you go to Dr. Jeon
for outpatient care?

109
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,300
Yi-man was disappointed.

110
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,550
Yes, but Eve still goes to Dr. Jeon.

111
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,800
I told her to change doctors,
but she said no.

112
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,220
She's also waiting outside.

113
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,440
Having my period was a pain in the butt,
so I started taking medication

114
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,810
about three months ago,

115
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,310
but I've been getting headaches.

116
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,070
Medications don't work the same way
in space as they do on Earth.

117
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,150
Be careful.

118
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,200
If your estradiol level is 90,

119
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,160
it's almost back to normal,
so just wait a little bit longer.

120
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,910
Okay.

121
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,920
But what brings you here, Seung-jun?

122
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,290
It's not like you're married.

123
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,510
Thank you, Ryong.

124
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,630
I washed it for you.

125
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,550
Thank you.

126
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,600
How did the lottery ticket
end up with you?

127
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,640
We thought for sure Dr. Kang had it.

128
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,690
We thought it wasn't meant to be,
so we had given up on it.

129
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,860
We feel terrible for coming down first.

130
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,440
We're just thankful
you both made it back alive.

131
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,820
I can't believe
the ticket made it in one piece too.

132
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,400
I'm still in a state of shock.

133
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,530
It's amazing.

134
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,870
So,

135
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,910
what happens to the things we left behind?

136
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:29,750
In a few days, the IOU will head up there
and conduct a thorough search.

137
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,380
Why do you ask?

138
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,970
I lost my phone and looked all over
the airlock for it, but it wasn't there.

139
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,100
It would be bad if someone saw it.

140
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,020
I'm not sure if
it got sucked into the engine explosion

141
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,390
or if it flew into space.

142
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,060
Do you think the IOU will find my phone?

143
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,940
It's a mess there.
They can't find something that small.

144
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,070
You think?

145
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,940
It took a year to find the lottery ticket.

146
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:02,410
If it's stuck somewhere in space,
it will be impossible to find.

147
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,450
I lived there for a year,
so I'm quite sure.

148
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:08,370
We're going up next,
so we'll find it and send it to you.

149
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,960
Please, I would really appreciate it.

150
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,750
When did you say
you last had some spotting?

151
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,250
-Yesterday.
-Yesterday?

152
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,880
-A lot?
-No, just a little.

153
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,840
But I've never experienced this before.

154
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,550
I have a slight fever,
and my breasts feel heavy.

155
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,140
I also feel a dull pain
that comes and goes.

156
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:35,360
Gravity adaptation seems to cause symptoms
that mimic early pregnancy.

157
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,020
I'm not pregnant.

158
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:40,150
Of course not.
I'm not saying you're pregnant.

159
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,280
It's just that there was nothing
out of the ordinary in the results.

160
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:44,820
And your period?

161
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:49,200
Well, I sometimes skip a month.
I'm pretty irregular.

162
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,870
Okay.

163
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,670
We did one last time,
but how about we do another ultrasound?

164
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,830
Okay.

165
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,170
I examined you just in case
there was a problem with your uterus.

166
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,760
But as you can see,
there's nothing abnormal.

167
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,930
Thank you, Doctor.

168
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:13,100
You're probably under a lot of stress
from what you've gone through

169
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,810
at the space station and
are now undergoing gravity adjustment.

170
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,770
So, you should eat whatever you want,

171
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,440
get a lot of sleep,
and spend time with good people.

172
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,240
-Then you'll feel better in no time.
-Okay.

173
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,120
When did you say you were going back up?

174
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,240
In about two weeks,
but that could be pushed back a few days.

175
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,750
If you have any questions
after you go back up, feel free to ask.

176
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,750
Thank you.

177
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,630
EXAMINATION ROOM 3

178
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,880
-Hello.
-Hi.

179
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,510
Are you feeling okay?

180
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,430
How's the new medication working out?

181
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,160
Are you crying again?

182
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,790
Who's crying?

183
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,880
I refuse to cry.

184
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,260
I won't use tears to win him back.

185
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,220
Then what will you use?

186
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:57,460
If it's too tough,
you can bow just 7 or 21 times.

187
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,710
Even 108 prostrations
aren't enough for you.

188
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,760
You need to bow 1,080 times.

189
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,300
The number 108
represents the 108 sufferings

190
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:16,140
that afflict humans
across the past, present, and future.

191
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,810
If you've come to pray
for Choi Dong-hun's peaceful rebirth

192
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,560
and forget your agony,

193
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,730
as well as let go
of all your worldly attachments,

194
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,860
then performing 108 prostrations
is a way to release those burdens

195
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,700
according to the Buddha's teachings.

196
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:46,710
<i>Aspiration for rebirth in the Pure Land</i>

197
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,420
<i>I bow to Amitabha Buddha</i>

198
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,680
<i>Who resides in the Pure Land</i>

199
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,430
<i>And guides sentient beings</i>

200
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:02,480
<i>I aspire to be reborn in that world</i>

201
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:08,110
<i>Please look upon me</i>
<i>With your compassion and mercy</i>

202
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,670
Did you know
this was an arranged introduction?

203
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,340
Do you know who I am?

204
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:39,020
I came knowing that you were
the MZ Group chairman's only daughter.

205
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,310
I've only heard bad things about you.

206
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,150
I've heard all sorts of rumors.

207
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,780
SECRETARY GO

208
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,670
I hate leaving things unfinished.

209
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,170
If I do 108 prostrations,

210
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:52,880
all of my 108 agonies
are supposed to go away.

211
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,720
So even if I destroy my knees,

212
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,300
I want to do all 108.

213
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,390
I don't want to hear
a strange man breathing,

214
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,190
and my own heavy breathing even less so.

215
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,030
Isn't it nice?

216
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,120
You're being rude to the Buddha.

217
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,740
Either answer it or turn it off.

218
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:27,500
Buddha, you're always listening
to people chanting prayers.

219
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,670
Isn't this music a nice change?

220
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,260
I think it's nice.

221
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,010
Turn it off before one of the monks comes.

222
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,470
The Buddha says he likes it.

223
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:44,850
What?

224
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,320
The Buddha is smiling.

225
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,990
He's angry.

226
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,860
He looks angry to me.

227
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,800
Then let's just say he's angry with you

228
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,970
but smiling at me.

229
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,810
Do you like that song?

230
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:11,940
That ringtone

231
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,070
is a song my brother used to sing to me.

232
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,450
It's my first time at a temple.

233
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,370
To be honest,
I've been interested in you for a while.

234
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,620
"She's the pretty daughter
of the MZ Group chairman."

235
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,460
"Totally my style."
That's all I used to think.

236
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,540
Your brother's shoes.

237
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:40,380
The huge shoes you had to fill
must've been a burden, but you did it.

238
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,470
In fact, it blew me away how well you did.

239
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,510
I kept thinking about you.

240
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,720
I wanted to meet you.

241
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,190
So, this going to space thing.

242
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,610
Why do you keep going back and forth?

243
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,820
To show off?

244
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,070
Do you see that up there?

245
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,700
What?

246
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,240
Look at my fingertip.

247
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,290
Do you see that star at my fingertip?

248
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:15,420
See that big square over there?

249
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,340
-That's Pegasus.
-Yes.

250
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,300
Do you see Aquarius below it?

251
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,260
To the left is Cetus, the Whale,

252
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,180
and above it is Pisces.

253
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,300
That's Aries.

254
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:30,810
And that thing above Aries
that looks like a person

255
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,390
is the void left by your brother.

256
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,620
Can I fill the void he left?

257
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,710
The song he used to sing to you.

258
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,290
I'll sing it for you.

259
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,220
Come on, let's go.

260
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,310
Above Aries

261
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,270
is Perseus.

262
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,020
Who do you think you're fooling?

263
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:16,980
"Fill the void"?

264
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,270
Let's go.

265
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,290
Is that kosher?

266
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,870
Well, it is in the manual.

267
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:55,980
Hello?

268
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,810
<i>Mr. Gong?</i>

269
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,230
What time do you finish today?

270
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,320
Can you come here after work?
I have a favor to ask.

271
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,530
I'll be there by seven.

272
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:09,530
Okay.

273
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,370
-I'm back.
-Okay.

274
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,960
-You're eating some, right?
-Yeah.

275
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,470
By the way,
should we just leave that as is?

276
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,420
What do you mean?

277
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:31,340
I mean, when they start
the accident investigation,

278
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,720
we have to submit all this to the IOU.

279
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,020
That's a littleâ€¦

280
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,940
That's a little what?

281
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,480
What I mean is, it'sâ€¦

282
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,520
It looks like

283
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,030
the two of them had sex.

284
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,660
I'm not saying they did have sex.

285
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,620
Just that it looks like it.

286
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,580
Stop playing word games.

287
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:06,420
Even mice, the most prolific breeders
of all mammals,

288
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,170
couldn't manage to do it.

289
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,970
There's no way humans could have had sex.

290
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,800
But their expressionsâ€¦

291
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:17,140
That's the expression
of someone who's just had sex.

292
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:23,190
Do youâ€¦ sleep like that?

293
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,980
There's something weird about it.

294
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,360
When we saw them for the first time,

295
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,900
everyone here was stunned.
It was like we were struck by lightning.

296
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:34,030
Honestly, we all thought
it was a bit strange.

297
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,660
I hate to say this,

298
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:40,450
but if male and female mummies
were discovered in that state,

299
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,040
I bet archaeologists

300
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,130
would report that they had discovered
the mummies of lovers.

301
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,210
Hey, they were running out of oxygen.

302
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,170
They were going to
either live or die together.

303
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,380
Even enemies would feel a connection.

304
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,300
Should they have faced away
from each other

305
00:23:55,390 --> 00:24:00,390
and looked disgusted while facing
the prospect of freezing to death?

306
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:03,140
It's because the commander
acted out of character.

307
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,440
Think about the commander we know.

308
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,940
I get that she stripped down
to save him according to the manual.

309
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,490
But then she would've held him tightly
like a soldier would.

310
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,320
But look.

311
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,870
She's nestled in his arms.

312
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,660
Thisâ€¦

313
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,370
This is really weird.

314
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,290
You better keep your mouth shut.

315
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,590
In the IOU,
sex between astronauts is taboo.

316
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:34,050
No human has ever attempted
to have sex in space.

317
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,100
What's wrong with trying?

318
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,400
Dong-a.

319
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,520
You're already here.

320
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:52,110
-I ordered for you.
-Good, thanks.

321
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,950
It's a beautiful day.

322
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,620
-I know, it's really nice.
-Yeah.

323
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,540
Can't believe I'm on Earth.

324
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,710
You're heading back to space soon.

325
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,260
Why don't you reconsider?

326
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,300
It's too soon.

327
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,760
I left in the middle of a mission.
I need to get back and finish.

328
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,640
Santi and the IOU team
will handle the repairs.

329
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,680
Right.

330
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,740
Stay with me a bit longer.

331
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,530
Come to Houston with me.

332
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:40,660
Relax for a while.
You could go back up in a year or two.

333
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:44,500
It feels like I ran off
without finishing my work.

334
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,790
How could I relax?

335
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,380
Andâ€¦

336
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,710
I'm not staying with you.

337
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,670
I keep thinking about Chief Kang.

338
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,970
You will forever be my mentor and hero.

339
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,560
The greatest astronaut I know.

340
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,230
So don't hang your head like that.

341
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,820
-Eve--
-Just treat me like a valued colleague.

342
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,820
That way I can always respect
and root for you.

343
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,200
You risked your life to save us.
I will never, ever forget that.

344
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:26,200
I don't care about being a hero,
getting your respect, or any of that.

345
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:31,210
That thing with Chief Kang
was just a mistake.

346
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,040
Chief Kang is amazing.

347
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,800
She has more experience with men
and is way more popular.

348
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,630
You've always had feelings for her.

349
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,510
She just wasn't interested at the time.

350
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,100
It's not like I didn't know.

351
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,640
Let's be honest here.

352
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,730
You're pushing me away
because you're interested in another guy.

353
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,390
Chief Kang is just an excuse.

354
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,230
You and the tourist, right?

355
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,200
That bastard.

356
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,740
Can we just end this cordially?

357
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,990
With dignity.

358
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,370
We work in the same industry,
so our paths will always cross.

359
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:12,750
So with civility and dignity,
accept that it was just one mistake.

360
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:17,510
Can't you just look the other way?

361
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:20,970
You can't because you like some other guy.

362
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,970
Just be honest with yourself.

363
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:29,810
Fine.

364
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,270
Right.

365
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,820
The only way to end this
is to become sworn enemies.

366
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,200
That's how a breakup should be.

367
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,780
Okay.

368
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,620
From now on, we'll be enemies.

369
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,800
Did you enjoy being there at the end,
just the two of you?

370
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,090
Did you?

371
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,100
You fucking idiot.

372
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,070
How is your health?

373
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,200
I'm fine now.

374
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,580
By the way, we're having dinner
with the crew tomorrow.

375
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,670
You should come.
You're part of the family.

376
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,920
Is that the favor you wanted to ask?

377
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,420
Hang on, I'll explain when she comes.

378
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,550
Is someone else coming?

379
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,090
Come in.

380
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,650
You're not going to say hi to each other?

381
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,690
She told me not to acknowledge her.

382
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,020
Really?

383
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,440
Why did you say that?

384
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,650
Did you two have a fight?

385
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,450
Did Mr. Gong do something wrong?

386
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,780
No, I didn't do anything wrong.

387
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:13,120
Then why are you acting like that?
You two faced death together.

388
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,870
If you're mad at each other, talk it out.

389
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:20,800
Now, I need a minute-by-minute account
of everything that happened

390
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,050
in the last three days
when it was just the two of you.

391
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,380
I'll need separate reports
from each of you.

392
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,800
Make sure you submit one.

393
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:31,260
The astronauts leaving
for the space station investigation

394
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,430
would like to take your reports with them.

395
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,100
They said it was necessary
to conduct a more efficient investigation.

396
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,690
It's mandatory.

397
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,440
You're the only ones who know
what happened inside the station.

398
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:46,320
It's to prevent accidents like this
from happening again.

399
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,200
You're the only ones who came back alive.

400
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,490
We have to record everything
for the safety of those who go after you.

401
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,450
Any questions?

402
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,160
Go ahead.

403
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,660
Can't the commander write it alone?

404
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,080
Weren't you alone for quite a while
before the commander went out

405
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,750
to rescue you?

406
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,500
Who's going to record that?

407
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:08,090
It doesn't matter
if everyone's memory is different.

408
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,850
We can glean a lot from both perspectives.

409
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:15,560
We need to hear it from both the tourist's
and the commander's point of view.

410
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,680
Understood.

411
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:21,400
Of course, it will be painful to recount
every minute of something

412
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,280
that nearly killed you,
but it's something you have to do.

413
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,360
That's part of your duty as a tourist.

414
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,740
Write everything truthfully,
exactly as it happened.

415
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,370
Don't change or leave anything out. Okay?

416
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,700
Write everything exactly as it happened?

417
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,080
That's without question.

418
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,500
Write everything truthfully,
exactly as it happened, minute-by-minute.

419
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,500
Okay.

420
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,680
Make sure you leave
those three parts out, okay?

421
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:59,440
Leave them out and send it to me.

422
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,270
Then I'll clean up those parts

423
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:05,770
and write some lie
to fill in whatever is missing.

424
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,940
Got it?

425
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:10,110
What three parts exactly?

426
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,620
As if you don't know.

427
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,700
I don't know.

428
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,460
Now, who was it that wanted to deny
what happened up there?

429
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,080
I thought it was over.

430
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,920
I don't remember anything.

431
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,420
Are you really going to be like this?

432
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,050
This is work.

433
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,970
This document is going to be
a part of space history.

434
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,930
Now, listen to me carefully, Mr. Gong.

435
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,600
You need to write this properly

436
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,020
with a sense of responsibility and duty
so it helps future astronauts.

437
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,140
Got it?

438
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,810
Oh, I'm so scared.

439
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,190
Fine.

440
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,250
What did Mr. Gong say?

441
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,300
Didn't you go to the OB-GYN
to get your results?

442
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:11,050
Yeah, he said everything's fine.

443
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,890
So did you keep his legs still?

444
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,550
What?

445
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,180
Why did he want you to hold his legs?

446
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,100
He gave the ticket back
because you did it, right?

447
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,610
I didn't do anything. He justâ€¦

448
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,650
He didn't ask me to do anything.

449
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,450
He just gave it to you?

450
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:34,530
Yes.

451
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,870
He was trying to run some tests
for his project,

452
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,540
and the debris hit.

453
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,330
So he couldn't do it, that's all.

454
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:50,210
Hey, instead of going home,
let's go eat something expensive.

455
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,960
We're rich now.

456
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,280
<i>Make sure you leave</i>
<i>those three parts out, okay?</i>

457
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,600
Damn it.

458
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,460
EVE

459
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,050
Hello?

460
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,600
Are you writing it?

461
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,600
You said it was a part of space history.

462
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:31,770
I get the part about leaving out
the kissing and having sex,

463
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,900
but what's the other thing?

464
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:37,400
Like I said,
just don't think about those parts.

465
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:40,990
Don't I at least need to know what it is
so I can leave it out?

466
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,700
I'm hanging up.

467
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:47,960
How the hell
am I supposed to know what to do?

468
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,890
I was in the observation module.

469
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,940
Because I hid the morula in the incubatorâ€¦

470
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,190
EVE

471
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:23,660
Okay, the part when you were alone
in the observation module at the end.

472
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,870
What did you write for that?

473
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,740
<i>You hid the morula in the incubator.</i>

474
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:30,330
You were late because you dawdled
while trying to unplug the incubator.

475
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:32,370
<i>You're not going to write that, are you?</i>

476
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,210
I wrote that the bathroom door
was broken and wouldn't open,

477
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,420
so I struggled with it,
which is why I was late.

478
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:42,010
Santi knows that the door
was always getting stuck.

479
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:44,010
No, no, you can't write it like that.

480
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,890
I already told Chief Kang

481
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:49,140
that you were late
because you were trying to get the camera.

482
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,640
How am I supposed to know

483
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,440
whether you lied or not?

484
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,030
You know, you didn't exactly
explain things to me nicely and patiently.

485
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:01,110
You threatened to end things
before we were even discharged.

486
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,570
Why should I have to do this

487
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,700
<i>with someone who is ashamed</i>
<i>to have been with me?</i>

488
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,790
Okay. So this is
what we're going to write.

489
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:12,620
Write down everything I say.
"The camera was"--

490
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,210
Yeah, I'll write what I want.

491
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,410
Is this your hideout?

492
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,210
Have some decency.
Does this look like your house?

493
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,580
Why do you go around
dressed like you own the place?

494
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,920
Back to your old nagging ways?

495
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,380
It's before seven. It's not like
there's anyone here to see me.

496
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,680
Why are you staying here?

497
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,510
I thought that maybe
you'd be here these days.

498
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:12,060
You sometimes stay here
on the top floor instead of at home.

499
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,480
Looked like you were renovating.

500
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:16,730
Building a love nest?

501
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:22,280
I came here because
my dad was getting on my nerves.

502
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,240
Now I can't stay
because you're getting on my nerves.

503
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,360
I know you like the back of my hand.

504
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,530
Whatever.

505
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:32,910
I have something to ask.

506
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Ask away.

507
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:38,380
What happened up there
between the commander and Ryong?

508
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,380
That's a question for him.

509
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:49,180
Even if they work out, you have no chance.

510
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,310
Whether Ryong and Eve end up together,

511
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:58,440
or you and Ryong end up together,
it's all the same to me.

512
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,730
I only have eyes for you.

513
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:06,450
There aren't many men
who could stick it out by your side.

514
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:11,990
There are very few people in the world
who could give you what you want.

515
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,370
Find someone like that,
not a jerk like Ryong,

516
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:15,450
and I'll let you go.

517
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,120
Go back up and get some sleep.

518
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,130
If the boss works too hard,
everyone else will slack off.

519
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,170
Your skin looks terrible.

520
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,230
Damn it.

521
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:08,880
ACCIDENT REPORT
GONG RYONG

522
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,140
EVE

523
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:38,120
<i>How much have you written?</i>

524
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,620
<i>I'm hard at workâ€¦</i>

525
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:47,170
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU WRITTEN?

526
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,630
Okay, then I'll let Chairman Choi know

527
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,390
he is free to do as he pleases.

528
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:58,970
Goodbye.

529
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:10,530
Okay, one, ten, hundred, thousand,
ten thousand, hundred thousand, million.

530
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:12,820
Ten million.

531
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,240
One hundred million!

532
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,030
He gave us this money to buy one outfit?

533
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,660
Hwa-ja, that's 100 million won.

534
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:22,540
Is he telling us to wear
a 100-million-won outfit to meet him?

535
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:27,340
The chairman must have finally
taken a liking to our Ryong.

536
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,250
Yeah.

537
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,550
One hundred million!

538
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,050
KOREA SPACE AGENCY

539
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,810
If you're done, send it to me first.

540
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:41,730
I'll revise it and submit it.

541
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:43,140
<i>I'm busy right now.</i>

542
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,730
Huh? Why?

543
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,190
<i>I'm birthing a baby.</i>

544
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,560
Oh, that's notâ€¦

545
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,200
You're here.

546
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:04,120
Happy to be back in Seoul?

547
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,750
I know it was tough
getting here from Florida.

548
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,920
Since this is home,
it should be easy to adjust, right?

549
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:13,380
Female Mouse 3 ate a ton
as soon as she got here.

550
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,590
What a good girl.

551
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,180
There's no other mouse like Male Mouse 1.

552
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:24,980
What do you think about
taking him back with you?

553
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:26,690
Huh?

554
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,730
Let's take a look.

555
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,570
No can do.

556
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:38,530
It's too dangerous for him to go up.

557
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,120
We'll have to find another male.

558
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,620
Why is the stitching crooked?

559
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,960
What? It's not crooked.
This is perfectly acceptable.

560
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:53,210
Any way you look at it, it's crooked.
How can you say that this is fine?

561
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,800
Can you stitch like this?
In zero gravity no less?

562
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,680
What's with you?

563
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,680
Didn't you always get on my case
about my stitching being uneven?

564
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,890
I can't believe you.

565
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,890
This is outstanding.
Not even I could do that.

566
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,560
Dr. Lee probably couldn't stitch it
this well either.

567
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:12,190
Hey, who would
sew up a mouse like this anyway?

568
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,700
Our professor once said,

569
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,780
"You can learn a lot about someone
by how they stitch."

570
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:24,080
He said you shouldn't date
someone like that.

571
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:26,450
Dr. Ma,

572
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,420
you need to date a guy like this.

573
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,820
That's Mr. Gong's car.

574
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,320
How do you know?

575
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,490
The MZ Medical Center logo is on it.

576
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:59,530
Since when were you so observant?

577
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,160
FLAVORS OF THE MOUNTAIN, SEA, AND SKY

578
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,120
-Hello.
-Welcome.

579
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,580
-Hello.
-Hi.

580
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,660
Hello.

581
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,170
Excuse me.

582
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,670
I ordered more drinks ages ago.
What's the hold-up?

583
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,840
Whoa, Dr. Kang, you're quite the drinker.

584
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,010
Let me pour you a drink.

585
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:25,970
-Thanks.
-For what, you jerk?

586
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,390
-For keeping your mouth shut.
-It's not always shut.

587
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,360
You didn't go around blabbing, which means
you're not as big of an ass as I thought.

588
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,730
Thanks.

589
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:36,650
You're all nuts.
We both performed an ICSI,

590
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:39,320
but they only help one guy
and screw the other--

591
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,950
What are you talking about?

592
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:44,070
So, when do you think
they'll discipline you?

593
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:46,490
Geez, Dr. Ma,

594
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:49,120
does it bother you that I'm here?

595
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,330
They haven't fired me yet.
Give me some napkins.

596
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:52,580
Stop it, you guys.

597
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:54,670
Dr. Ma, because Dr. Kang
bought the robot arms,

598
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,840
we were able to dock successfully.

599
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,510
Exactly, so let's drink.

600
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:00,260
Let's all have a drink together.

601
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:04,800
It's all thanks to everyone here
that I was able to make it back alive.

602
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:06,100
-Thank you.
-Applause!

603
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,680
Thanks, everyone.

604
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,640
Cheers!

605
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,600
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

606
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,270
Cheers!

607
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,980
-I need napkins.
-You're so sloppy.

608
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,690
Why do you feel the need
to sit here with us?

609
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,740
-Let me pour you a drink, Chief.
-Thank you.

610
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,120
Thank you for rescuing our Ryong.

611
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,200
-Would you like more meat?
-No.

612
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,370
-Would you?
-No, thank you.

613
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:29,450
-Oh no, you're out of kimchi.
-It's okay.

614
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,450
Thank you.

615
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,330
I didn't know about you two.

616
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,960
You're not that kind of person.

617
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:39,500
Don't concern yourself with it.
My feelings for him are gone.

618
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:41,630
Don't worry about me.
He's just a subordinate.

619
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,390
Let's drink till we drop.

620
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,220
Cheers.

621
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,730
How cute.

622
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:56,270
No, it's okay.

623
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:58,820
-What you do think of my buddy Yi-man?
-Stop it.

624
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,150
Why are you doing this?

625
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,740
Yi-man already has
his sights set on someone.

626
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:06,660
-Who?
-Who? Me?

627
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,030
I know who it is.

628
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,030
Who?

629
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,830
This was destined to be ours.

630
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:15,330
But Kang-su knows! We helped Fantasia.

631
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,210
What if he reports us or something?

632
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:22,710
Should we just return the lottery ticket
for his silence?

633
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,130
I mean, the winning prize is 500 billion,

634
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:29,510
and maybe he would share some of it
for us giving it back,

635
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:33,020
like a gratuity, 10% or something?

636
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,230
Hi.

637
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,980
What did Dr. Kang say?

638
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,730
Mom, we need more food here.

639
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:42,780
Coming.

640
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:44,740
Dr. Kang is going to give me
a heart attack.

641
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,410
Here you go.

642
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,410
It was only a few days, but it looks like
you're close to our Ryong.

643
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:52,540
Yes, of course.

644
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:54,200
-Please watch out for him.
-Okay.

645
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:55,120
-Hi!
-Hi.

646
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,410
Thank you.

647
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:00,670
Dr. Kang won't say anything.

648
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:06,010
He would never do anything that would
cause trouble for the girl he likes.

649
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,300
Okay.

650
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,180
No problem.

651
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,890
No problem.

652
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:16,430
I'm going to go to the bathroom. Santi.

653
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:22,110
Dr. Kang is leaving.

654
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:30,320
I hope you all have a nice life.

655
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:34,620
I'm grateful for what you did,
but you can't avoid punishment.

656
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,790
Yes, I'm fully prepared for it.

657
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:38,750
-Bill, please.
-Sure.

658
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:40,460
-It's okay.
-But sheâ€¦

659
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:41,580
Just go.

660
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:44,300
Have a nice evening.

661
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,340
Hello.

662
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:51,720
Did you finish it?
It's due tomorrow morning.

663
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:55,100
Yes, I've been working very hard on it.

664
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:00,980
Mr. Gong.

665
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,190
You're interested in Eve, aren't you?

666
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:12,370
When I saw you two up there,
you looked like a couple.

667
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:13,910
Park Dong-a, shut up.

668
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:15,120
Why?

669
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:19,580
Come on, this tourist spends
a grand total of ten days in space,

670
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:23,000
and now he's trying to ruin
the commander's career.

671
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:26,630
Nobody has ever talked trash about Eve,

672
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:30,170
but thanks to you, people are gossiping
about her behind her back.

673
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,550
What the hell, are you drunk?

674
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:33,850
Hey, Han Si-won.
Get him out of here. He's drunk.

675
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:36,810
Why are you always on my back, Chief?

676
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:38,060
Listen, you jerk.

677
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:40,180
Si-won, I'm totally fine.

678
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,850
It's okay.

679
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,240
You have no idea
what Eve went through to get here.

680
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:52,740
Until she became commander,

681
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:56,410
she never once dated anyone,
and she put love on the back burner.

682
00:47:56,490 --> 00:47:58,620
It took ten years

683
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,910
for Eve to open up to me.

684
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,580
Who the hell do you think you are?

685
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:07,300
You're engaged, yet you come along
and mess with her heart

686
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,050
and ruin her reputation.

687
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:11,420
Why?

688
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:15,850
Why did you have to create
a messy situation

689
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:20,060
where you had to be butt naked
in a sleeping bag together to survive?

690
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,680
Enough!

691
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:23,560
You're crossing the line.

692
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:30,070
Ryong, go back to your table, okay?

693
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,870
I was just joking.

694
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:51,420
You're right.

695
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:56,640
I'm nothing but a stupid tourist
who was up there for a mere ten days,

696
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,100
but I hit on the commander.

697
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:00,140
What did you say?

698
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:01,470
The commander is someone

699
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,980
who is filled with love,
who valued even the lives

700
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:07,810
of a single fruit fly or mouse.

701
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:14,320
She risked her life to save me.

702
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:17,410
She was like a sexy Wonder Woman.

703
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,330
How could I not love her?

704
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,420
Ryong.

705
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:30,840
Dong-a, what are you doing?

706
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,760
Let me go! Leave me alone, don't touch me.

707
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:36,260
I'm fine.

708
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:40,220
I deserved that.

709
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:47,810
I did something that deserves punishment.

710
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:52,110
Butâ€¦

711
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:56,780
it was just me.

712
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,660
She didn't feel the same way.

713
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:04,040
It was all me.

714
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:09,830
I was the only one who felt that way.
The commander didn't even bat an eye.

715
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:14,420
When we were in that bag
butt naked, trying to survive,

716
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:16,300
I had other thoughts.

717
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,430
But the commander
was just trying to survive.

718
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:22,680
Her only thought was keeping me alive.

719
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,430
That situation must have been

720
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:27,810
so awful for her.

721
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:29,850
But Eveâ€¦

722
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:35,820
never wavered once as the commander.

723
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:43,080
As commander, not once
did she cross the line with the tourist.

724
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,790
Not once did she give me a chance
or encourage me in any way.

725
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:51,540
And even though she hated me,

726
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:54,800
she gritted her teeth
and shared her body to keep me warm.

727
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:58,630
I'm the lunatic, okay?

728
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:03,140
I'm the crazy bastard!

729
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,690
I'm sorry.

730
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,770
I'm so sorry.

731
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:43,220
I just spoke with
the tax accountant in Houston.

732
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,720
He said to come straight to the bank.

733
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,770
Well, I guess we should get going then,
since it expires soon.

734
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:48,890
Yeah.

735
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,060
About thisâ€¦

736
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:55,770
Yeah, what about it?

737
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:58,900
He would never know it was his
if it's gone.

738
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:02,200
I bet he doesn't even remember
the numbers.

739
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,120
He doesn't even know
that he lost the ticket.

740
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,530
So let's just erase it.

741
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:09,410
The bank might take a photo
of the winning ticket.

742
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:11,960
And without this "Stand by me,"

743
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,290
Kang Kang-su
will never find out if he saw it.

744
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:18,550
Yeah, but look.
It's already in really bad shape.

745
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:21,970
What if we rip it or something
trying to erase this?

746
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:23,760
I think it's too risky.

747
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,470
-Yeah, I know.
-What's this?

748
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:45,820
Why would you carry it around, you idiot!

749
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:50,290
Give me my money!

750
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:52,710
Please, please, please! Calm down!

751
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:54,750
Where are you going? Come here!

752
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:57,880
Get over here!

753
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,020
What are you doing here?

754
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,650
Just write what I tell you to write.

755
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:17,440
We don't have time.

756
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:24,360
All I remember about the last three days
is kissing and having sex.

757
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:26,280
What is it you want me to write?

758
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:30,910
You're going to edit it
and write what you want anyway,

759
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:32,950
so just write it yourself.

760
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,960
-Let's go to KSA and write it together.
-Forget it.

761
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,630
Until I went out on the spacewalk,
you were in there alone.

762
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:40,800
Ryong.

763
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,010
Are you going to keep making me suffer
because I said we should end it?

764
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:48,090
Then what are you going to do?
It's due tomorrow.

765
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:53,140
You're either being difficult on purpose,
spiteful, or just plain dumb.

766
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:54,140
For God's sake.

767
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:58,900
Stop being so short-sighted.

768
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,440
Are you even qualified to be a doctor?

769
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:04,570
Then come in and we'll write it.

770
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:08,360
Let's go and write it at KSA.

771
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:10,320
Why? Are you scared to come in with me?

772
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:11,700
Why would I be scared?

773
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,540
Just write whatever you want.

774
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:21,000
I won't complain. Go.

775
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:28,190
Are you an animal?
That's all you can remember?

776
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,360
Yeah, I'm an animal.

777
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,620
That's all I can remember.

778
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:38,830
Either take off your shoes and come in,

779
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:40,580
or keep your shoes on and leave.

780
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:43,290
Why are you so indecisive?

781
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,210
Why are you only indecisive with me?

782
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:47,460
Am I someone you can just walk all over?

783
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:51,220
Why can't you call a spade a spade?

784
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,010
You're always so clear and decisive
with everyone else,

785
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,810
so why aren't you like that with me?

786
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:58,100
With me, it doesn't matter.

787
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:00,020
Am I that insignificant to you?

788
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,480
Get out.

789
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,040
I think of you all day long.

790
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,540
I can't stand
how good those three days were.

791
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:24,170
It's true.

792
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,880
Ever since you stitched up my toes,

793
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:29,670
you got under my skin.

794
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:34,470
Since the day we operated on the mouse,

795
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,640
it's true, I've felt butterflies.

796
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:41,560
When you jumped out
the spacecraft window like a crazy person

797
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:44,190
to save me,

798
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:46,730
I started falling for you like mad.

799
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:50,820
Remember when you came to my CQ drunk
and asked if you could like me?

800
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,190
Fine, I admit

801
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:54,030
I almost said yes then.

802
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:57,160
Do you think

803
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,870
if it was someone other than you,
that as commander

804
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:02,830
I would've jumped into space
because they were left alone?

805
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:05,370
Do you think I'm that righteous
and ambitious,

806
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,840
that I'm someone
with an overwhelming sense of duty?

807
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:10,420
I'm not.

808
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:12,170
The three parts?

809
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:15,220
Yeah, kissing and having sex,
and loving each other.

810
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,970
Yes, that's what I was referring to.

811
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:21,560
That day when
we were sharing the oxygen tank

812
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,940
and our body heat as we faced death,

813
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:26,900
talking about Earth.

814
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:31,070
That's love, isn't it?

815
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:34,950
Fine, write it all down.

816
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:37,910
Just write all of it and submit it.

817
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:40,080
Sure, we should do that.

818
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,660
You think you're so smart, you jerk.

819
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:45,210
I've gone crazy, haven't I?

820
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:47,170
I'm the crazy one, right?

821
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:50,340
It was my first command.
I must have lost my mind.

822
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:53,050
-Right?
-So what? What's your point?

823
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:54,300
I hate you!

824
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:55,550
You!

825
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,150
Fine, the whole thing is a lie.

826
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:20,240
Take your shoes off.

827
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:46,060
Let's write it.

828
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:04,790
Let's write it quickly.

829
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,290
You came in on your own.

830
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:15,050
There's no leaving now.

831
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:17,840
Okay.

832
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,560
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

833
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:10,890
<i>Don't meet the tourist personally anymore.</i>

834
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:14,270
If everyone is against it,
there's probably a good reason.

835
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:16,770
<i>Was Ryong the ringleader?</i>

836
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,650
This guy is turning
taking my things into a hobby.

837
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,240
-Do you really want to start something?
-You asshole.

838
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,160
<i>You're going down with me.</i>

839
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,450
Do you have another woman?

840
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:28,120
<i>Ryong is actually</i>

841
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,160
<i>quite materialistic.</i>

842
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:32,830
<i>This is where we part ways.</i>

843
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,920
We weren't allowed to meet, ever.

844
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:37,130
<i>I'm leaving for space in a few days.</i>

845
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:40,550
SPACE, CRISIS, RESCUE, RETURN

846
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:25,300
