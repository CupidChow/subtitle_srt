00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

[Episode 2]

19
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,970
Looking at this extravagant style

20
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,100
and untamed demeanor,

21
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,810
is this really belonging to an immortal?

22
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,840
I'll have to find out.

23
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,900
Ms. Bai, you said you would come another day.

24
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,360
I thought you would come a few days later.

25
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,890
I didn't realize it was so urgent.

26
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,330
I also didn't expect that

27
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,420
you would remember what I said

28
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,920
despite our brief meeting.

29
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,190
Last night, you said

30
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,100
you are devoted to the pursuit of enlightenment and possess remarkable skills.

31
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,990
I am free to test you however I wish.

32
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,120
In that case...

33
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,810
Wait.

34
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,600
That was last night.

35
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,060
Today is today.

36
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,810
Let's not rush into talking about unrelated matters.

37
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:31,600
Since we are destined to meet,

38
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,750
we should at least get to know each other.

39
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,910
Here in Ning'an City,

40
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,440
there's a drinking tradition to spice things up.

41
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,860
One shot for one question.

42
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,350
If I drink,

43
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,350
you'll have to answer.

44
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,250
Would you take on the challenge?

45
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,160
You were extraordinary at first sight.

46
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,880
May I know your name and which lineage and sect you are from?

47
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,810
What are you doing here in my city?

48
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,010
I am Fan Yue.

49
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,080
I trained under the previous Sect Leader of the Lanling Sect.

50
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,910
I've spent many years in spiritual cultivation, traveled far and wide,

51
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,210
and I am just passing through this place.

52
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,340
How lucky I must be to be able to meet you.

53
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,800
I caught you even when you're traveling.

54
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,070
I've been seeking immortality for years.

55
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,560
Although I haven't mastered the art of immortality,

56
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,070
I have some knowledge in these matters.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,290
There are many swindlers nowadays.

58
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,240
Since you are so famous,

59
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,430
it's not too much to show me your skills, right?

60
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,780
How dare you compare me

61
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,960
to those wandering charlatans?

62
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,240
Of course not.

63
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,860
As an immortal, you are definitely different from them.

64
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,040
The problem is on me.

65
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,240
I’ve learned to be wary after being deceived many times.

66
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,830
I have to learn to be smart.

67
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,159
If I've offended you,

68
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:45,070
I'll drink this to make amends.

69
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,930
What do you want to see, Ms. Bai?

70
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,510
Summoning the wind and rain, wielding thunder and lightning.

71
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,130
Are these...

72
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,350
too hard for you?

73
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,480

-It's pouring!

00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,580
Rain conjured by demon aura?

76
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,870
There are demons in the city?

77
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,090
Why is it suddenly raining?

78
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,930
This...

79
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,120
Chong Zhao, you just came back. Where are you going?

80
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,560
Take an umbrella with you.

81
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,540
What else do you want to see, Ms. Bai?

82
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,510
Flames sweeping through the city, and pests plaguing the land?

83
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,850
I'll show you everything

84
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,380
you desire.

85
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,270
It's enough.

You immortals are powerful.

87
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,230
I believe you now.

88
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,880
As for this third toast...

89
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:50,350
You've asked so many questions.

90
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,770
It's my turn now.

91
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:55,909
What are you doing?

92
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,280
She's indeed capable.

93
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,190
Don't move.

94
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,180
What is he doing?

95
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,330
Is this a test of my competencies?

96
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,650
Strange.

97
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,170
Why can she trigger a reaction from the Desireless Stone,

98
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,960
but not activate it?

99
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,920
Is it because her contemplation power is too weak?

would act like this?

Don't fret, Ms. Bai.

Forget it if you don't want to learn it.

109

Do you think I'm stupid?

110
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,350
I've never heard of any sect's magic that

111
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,409
requires a stone to be press against a person's head.

112
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,120
What disciple of the immortals?

113
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,760
You seem more like a demon to me.

If you have never heard,

116
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,640
it just means you're ignorant.

Ms. Bai.

118
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,070
I sympathize with your pursuit of enlightenment,

119
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,690
so I made an exception to meet you.

120
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,760

The Lanling Sect...

127
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,520
They've actually tracked us down?

What a strong aura!

129
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,240
This person seems unfathomable.

130
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,780
He must have used his powers,

131
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,680
for there is no trace of demonic aura.

Who would have thought that such different individuals would be engaged?

00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,240
Could it be that...

138
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,700
Ms. Bai is someone special?

139
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,320

No matter what your intention is,

144

00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,330
do let us know in advance,

150
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,360
so as to

151
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,680
avoid misunderstandings.

152
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,960

Why are you in such a hurry?

162
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,070
This is not a place to stay for long.

163
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,890
We'll talk about it when we get back.

164
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
I'm here on serious business.

165
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,020
What kind of serious business would you have here?

166
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,740
Uncle Bai will be angry if he finds out.

167
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,590
Let's go back.

00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:25,730

Come and watch me dance next time.

171
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,760
Didn't you go out of town for business?

172
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,390
Why were you at Unbridled Pavilion?

173
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,630
You happened to know the owner?

174
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,600
No, I don't.

175
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,920
You don't?

176
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,030
But when you were talking to him just now,

177
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,600
you guys were clearly speaking cryptically,

178
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,750
as if there was common understanding.

179
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,020
What about you, Shuo?

180
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,330
What were you doing at Unbridled Pavilion?

181
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,870
Master Sun directed me there.

182
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,620
She said that the pavilion's owner is an immortal.

183
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,790
An immortal?

184
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,290
And you believe it?

185
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,150
I initially didn't.

186
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,250
But after testing him today,

187
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,400
he actually does have some supernatural skill.

188
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,550
Shuo.

189
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,340
That Unbridled Pavilion is not a good place.

190
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,790
I know you want to be an immortal,

191
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,170
but they are all swindlers.

192
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,690
Don't be fooled by them.

193
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,760
You've always been kind to others.

194
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,610
Why are you so hostile towards Unbridled Pavilion?

195
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,600
Or...

196
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,740
is there something you know?

197
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,030
I...

198
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,030
I'm just afraid that you'll be cheated.

199
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,630
That's all?

200
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,400
You're not hiding something from me, are you?

201
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,910
No.

202
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,110
It better be.

203
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,960
As you know,

204
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,480
I hate it when people lie to me.

205
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,630
Our residence is right ahead.

206
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,750
Go back early.

207
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,680
I have something to do at the steamed bun stall.

208
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,830
I'll be back later to keep you company.

209
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,080
Zhao is acting weird today.

210
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:56,960
That Fan Yue

211
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,220
doesn't look like a decent immortal either.

212
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,460
I must clarify with Master Sun.

213
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,620
Master.

214
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,800
Are we just going to let the kid from Eternal Race get away?

215
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,500
If he spreads the news that us Demon Race has entered Ning'an City

216
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,460
back to Lanling Sect,

217
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,400
we won't be able to operate Unbridled Pavilion anymore.

218
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,570
I really don't care about

219
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,200
Lanling Sect, actually.

220
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,240
What I’m interested in now

221
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,880
is Bai Shuo.

222
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,880
A human

223
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,050
who can not only light up the Desireless Stone,

224
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,660
but also engaged to someone from Lanling Sect.

225
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,040
Don't you think it's interesting?

226
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,240
Master.

227
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,050
You mean...

228
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,660
Bai Shuo could be a trap by the Eternals?

229
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,790
Could they have already known

230
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,550
you were the one who took the Desireless Stone?

231
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,440
We'll know

232
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,950
once we test it.

233
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,110
If she is really an outcast of the Eternals,

234
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,290
and had approached me

235
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,840
to find out my secrets,

236
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,560
I will

237
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:51,410
give her a good home where her soul vanishes.

238
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,920
Aren't demons supposed to eat people?

239
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,660
He could easily slap me to death,

240
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,210
so why does it seem like he's teasing me?

241
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,640
We've passed by so many houses on the way,

242
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,700
but he is going nowhere.

243
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,010
He is only coming for me.

244
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,420
The things given by Master Sun are really useless.

245
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,880
This demon chased me all the way,

246
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,190
but isn't trying to kill me.

247
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,570
Is it a coincidence or is someone trying to test me?

248
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,240
Grand Master, for your judgement.

249
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,320
The Demon Race has entered Ning'an City

250
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,600
and opened an Unbridled Pavilion for guests.

251
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,020
Their purpose is currently unknown.

252
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,510
Demonic aura?

253
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,140
[Ruiyun Hall]

254
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,580
As expected of the top courtesan!

255
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,940
Shen, go!

256
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,480
Go, Shen, go!

257
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,910
What's going on?

258
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,570
Shen!

259
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,010
Young man.

260
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,950
Come and watch me dance next time.

261
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,250
It's you.

262
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,800
The top courtesan of Unbridled Pavilion?

263
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,470
So what?

264
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:50,860
What exactly are you trying to do

265
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,250
by infiltrating Ning'an City?

266
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,310
As a demon,

267
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,870
aren't we supposed to harm others?

268
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,200
You're so stupidly funny

269
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,260
for an immortal.

270
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,050
[Unbridled Pavilion]

271
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:57,380
[Closed]

272
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,030
Master,

273
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,590
we may now have this wolf demon.

274
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,670
If Bai Shuo is a part of the Eternals,

275
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,650
she would use magic at critical moments.

276
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,150
But if she's just a human

277
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,520
and we drive her to death,

278
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,990
the plan to activate the Desireless Stone will be all in vain.

279
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,230
I've placed a restraining curse on the wolf demon.

280
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,630
It will only hurt, but never kill.

281
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,630
It's enough to test Bai Shuo's capabilities.

282
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,400
Boss!

283
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,080
Boss, there's a demon!

284
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,080
Why are you here?

285
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,440
I'm having a bad year.

286
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,810
I ran into a demon the minute I stepped out.

287
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,400
My dear immortal,

288
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,340
let's see if your Lanling magic is legit or not.

289
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,960
Ms. Bai, didn't you

290
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,560
think that I'm an evil person?

291
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,590
Now that you are in trouble,

292
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,240
you believe that I'm an immortal?

293
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,080
Being an immortal doesn't count

294
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,590
if all you can do is summon rain and thunder.

295
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,850
The real test is whether you can help me tonight.

296
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,820
Even in such grave danger,

297
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,730
you're still looking to test me.

298
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,100
You're quite bold.

299
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,270
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

300
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,270
This talisman of mine is useless.

301
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,600
It's useless in your hands,

302
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,000
but it's not in mine.

303
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,250
Scram!

304
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,670
So, am I

305
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:21,890
a god or a demon?

306
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,990
God, you're a god.

307
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,550
When this wolf demon goes berserk,

308
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,460
even two people can't take him down.

309
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,460
That's no way to test something.

310
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,590
It seems that they are not on the same side with the wolf demon.

311
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:52,940
It's her blood.

312
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,820
A talisman stained with human blood should subdue demons.

313
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,490
Why is it that Bai Shuo’s blood enhances demonic power instead?

314
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,440
Who is she exactly?

315
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,420
The Desireless Stone.

316
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,470
Stop!

317
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,270
Master?

318
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,350
Where did he go?

319
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:07,480

320
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,050
What is this place?

321
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,360
Desireless Stone...

322
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,890
What is this stone?

323
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,630
How did it get into my body?

324
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,780

325
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,750

He was there just now.

Stop playing dumb.

I can't extract it out.

It has recognized its master.

349
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,750
The Desireless Stone is a divine object.

There are no longer divine deities in this world.

00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,030
What grounds do you have to be its master?

352
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,880

00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,080
it will be beneficial to Cold Spring Palace.

Stop shouting.

374
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,920
Master and her were taken away by the Desireless Stone.

375
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,560
It's a divine object. There's no point looking for them.

376
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,640
Then what should we do?

377
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,570
Dear immortal...

378
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,920
I don’t have time

379
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,470
to continue playing games with you.

380
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,970
Tell me, who are you?

381
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,880
How did you get a divine object to recognize you as its master?

382
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,460
How could you have entered this divine realm?

383
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,040
That stone is a divine object?

384
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,030
Just now...

385
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,290
he was trying to kill me?

386
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,810
I don't know what you're talking about.

387
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,210
What divine object?

388
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,610
What divine realm?

389
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,190
♫What kind of tree never takes root?♫

390
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,670
I merely wanted to seek guidance on the pursuit of enlightenment.

391
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,030
I am Bai Shuo.

392
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,720
Stubborn.

393
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,720
Great.

394
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,840
If you die,

395
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:54,820
♫What kind of roots never turn into trees♫

396
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,870
the Desireless Stone will come out.

397
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:04,630
♫ To break the roots of love, to look at the past and seal one's heart ♫

398
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:10,440
♫I'm your wanderer♫

399
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,780
Master!

400
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:20,960
Master!

401
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,830
Wait.

402
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,850
Something is wrong with our master.

403
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:32,080
Can you... save me first?

404
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,880
Oh no,

405
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,050
Master's Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal is acting up.

406
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,580
Kill her!

407
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,580
Wait.

408
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,970
Your master was injured by me.

409
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,680
If you want to kill me,

410
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,400
you'll have to see if you've got what it takes.

411
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,200
Kill her!

412
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,000
Wait.

413
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,230
You said it yourself.

414
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,400
The Desireless Stone is a divine object.

415
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,560
If it recognizes me as its master,

416
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,120
it means I'm definitely not an ordinary person.

417
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:02,920
Fan Yue.

418
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,310
I don't know who you are,

419
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,330
and I don't know why you came to Ning'an City.

420
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,470
But I'm sure that

421
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:08,970
the Desireless Stone is very important to you.

422
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,800
Did you really think

423
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,830
I wouldn't kill you because of this?

424
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,640
Of course you will.

425
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,580
But killing me won't do you any good.

426
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:15,960
What I want to negotiate with you

427
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,780
is a deal.

428
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,940
As a mere human,

429
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,570
what qualifies you to strike a deal with me?

430
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,360
An ordinary human wouldn't dare.

431
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,450
But I'm different.

432
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,790
Whatever it is you aim to accomplish,

433
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,720
I'll help you with it.

434
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,530
But you have to help me too.

435
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,980
What can I help you with?

436
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:30,770
Help me go back to that place,

437
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,230
and find someone very important to me.

438
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:41,790
Zhao.

439
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,630
Uncle Bai.

440
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:47,930
When did you return to the city?

441
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,350
Why are you here so late?

442
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:52,180
I...

443
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:55,830
Chong Zhao.

444
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,070
I raised you up.

445
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,440
When did you pick up the habit of visiting brothels?

446
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,140
Uncle Bai, I haven't.

447
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,270
I'm looking for someone.

448
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,070
Who isn't here

449
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,680
to look for someone?

450
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,410
Who are you looking for?

451
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,190
Don't tell me Bai Shuo is also inside?

452
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,360
No.

453
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,510
That brat.

454
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,350
How dare she visits a place like this?

455
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,880
I'll break her legs!

456
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,510
Oh no, there are demons everywhere inside.

457
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,240
If we run into them, Uncle Bai...

458
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,200
What did you see in the Lunar Hidden Sea?

459
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,510
Someone who once saved my life.

460
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,930
He was inside.

461
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,550
It doesn't seem like she's lying.

462
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,370
But if someone exists in the Lunar Hidden Sea,

463
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:37,560
does that mean the Divine Race still exists in this world?

464
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,630
Is that the reason why the Desireless Stone chose her?

465
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,160
To try and strike a deal with me...

466
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,440
Aren’t you afraid of death?

467
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:44,520
Yes, I am.

468
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,400
Humans may not be able to live beyond a hundred years,

469
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,140
but my benefactor is an immortal.

470
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,300
I may be afraid of death.

471
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,160
But I'm more afraid of not having a chance to repay him.

472
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,870
So even if I am being used by you,

473
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,670
I'll never expose your identity.

474
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,260
But it must be an equal exchange,

475
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,560
and you must fulfill my wish.

476
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,470
Why should I believe you?

477
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:01,970
You claimed that you are capable.

478
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,440
I'm just a mere mortal, so what is there to fear?

479
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,310
Open the door!

480
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:07,410
Uncle Bai.

481
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,780
-Uncle Bai, calm down.
-Open the door!

482
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,640
-Uncle Bai!
-If you don't open the door,

483
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,540
[Unbridled Pavilion]

484
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,790
I will break it down!

485
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,270
-Calm down, Uncle Bai.
-Open the door!

486
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,000
It's my father.

487
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,510
Why is he here at this hour?

488
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,200
Fan Yue is most likely a demon.

489
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,620
These two next to him are no good either.

490
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:20,970
If there's a conflict,

491
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,560
they might not hurt me,

492
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,900
but my father will be the one to suffer.

493
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,160
Bai Shuo!

494
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,720
Give our cooperation some more thought.

495
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,640
My father is the city's governor.

496
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,240
It won't be any good if he

497
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:29,920
sees you like this.

498
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,950
Let’s avoid him for now.

499
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,740
You want me to avoid a human?

500
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,880
Our human rules state that

501
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,260
the city's governor is the most important.

502
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,160
If you offend my father,

503
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,440
no matter what your plans are,

504
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,160
you wouldn't be able to continue operating here.

505
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:42,530
Your master is unwell.

506
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,470
Take good care of him.

507
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,640
Don't let him speak.

508
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,530
Don't go downstairs.

509
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:53,980
Check the building.

510
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,480
Uncle Bai, calm down.

511
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,550
Say nothing!

512
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,110
Calm down!

513
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,030
Don't stop me!

514
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,740
I told you not to speak!

515
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,400
Uncle Bai!

516
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,960
Little brat.

517
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,320
Uncle Bai.

518
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,840
How dare a mere human

519
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,870
-threaten me like this!
-Master!

520
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,330
Master.

521
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,520
Bai Shuo said

522
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,140
we mustn't make a sound

523
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:12,180
or go downstairs.

524
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,230
Father.

525
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,720
What a coincidence.

526
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,750
You're here to have fun too?

527
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,160
I’m not fooling with you!

528
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,920
Little brat.

529
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,970
Come here!

530
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,800
How dare you scold me?

531
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,400
You brought so many people to the brothel.

532
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,820
How can you answer to my late mother?

533
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,110
I'm here to patrol!

534
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,760
Do you think we have nothing better to do?

535
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,070
Brat,

536
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,640
I'll beat you to death today.

537
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,440
-Move aside!
-Uncle Bai.

538
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,400
Move! Move!

539
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,470
-No, no.
-Move away!

540
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,460
Uncle Bai.

541
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,570
I have something to tell you.

542
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,550
We'll talk later.

543
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,240
Uncle Bai!

544
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,590
I must say it now.

545
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,590
Fine, speak.

546
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,900
My engagement with Shuo was arranged long ago.

547
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,200
I had wanted to be successful

548
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,570
so that I can take good care of her.

549
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,350
But I don't want to wait anymore, Uncle Bai.

550
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,030
Will you honor the engagement

551
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:05,720
and let Shuo marry me?

552
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:15,930
Good chap.

553
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,300
After so many years,

554
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:20,610
I finally got you to say that.

555
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,500
Let's go home.

556
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,270
Let's get drunk today!

557
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,740
Let's go home and drink.

558
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,670
Little brat.

559
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,150
Go home.

560
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,470
Let's go.

561
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,510
You’ve finally wised up, huh?

562
00:30:58,910 --> 00:30:59,590
Master.

563
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:00,790
Master!

564
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,880
-Master!
-Master!

565
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,510
He's good at disguise.

566
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,710
He can teleport.

567
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,440
He's cruel and bloodthirsty.

568
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,400
A demon?

569
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,830
If Fan Yue is really a demon,

570
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,870
it's hard to say if he won't

571
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,620
get me in trouble after he recovers.

572
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,920
Or even...

573
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,640
If you die,

574
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,880
the Desireless Stone will come out.

575
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,200
Or even kill me.

576
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,020
I may have negotiated a deal for now,

577
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,570
but I still have to be careful.

578
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,570
Such bad luck.

579
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,470
Why are you crying?

580
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:47,460
Our master is not dead.

581
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,170
The Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal on him

582
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,710
will burn his heart and soul every time it acts up.

583
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:52,770
It's unbearable pain.

584
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,280
This is already the forth time.

585
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,510
If it keeps happening, he will...

586
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,740
As long as he can activate the Desireless Stone

587
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,150
and obtain its divine power,

588
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:59,740
Master will definitely survive.

589
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,110
But this is just a legend of the world.

590
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,440
Will it really work?

591
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,520
Before, when the Desireless Stone laid dormant,

592
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,230
I still had my suspicions.

593
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,340
But now that the Desireless Stone had been activated

594
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,970
and entered Bai Shuo's body,

595
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,540
that means it's possible.

596
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,160
I'll go get Bai Shuo now.

597
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:16,750
Stop!

598
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,180
What's the point of getting her now?

599
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,000
If we can't gather all Five Contemplations,

600
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,880
we can't activate the Desireless Stone

601
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,290
and still won't be able to save Master's life.

602
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,510
There are still three stars left.

603
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,650
We still have a chance.

604
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,570
We mustn't raise anymore alarms

605
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,430
and let Bai Shuo gain more leverage.

606
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,220
Understand?

607
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:44,640
It's your birthday present.

608
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,750
Open and take a look.

609
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:46,720
What is it?

610
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,670
So mysterious.

611
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,090
How did you know I wanted this?

612
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,480
I'm your sister.

613
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,640
Of course I know.

614
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,240
This dagger was made by the masters in the temple.

615
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,640
It can repel and avoid evil.

616
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,680
I wish you good luck in all your future endeavors,

617
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,930
where you'll turn misfortune into fortune.

618
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,200
Turn misfortune into fortune?

619
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:04,400
Xi,

620
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,810
I have a question for you.

621
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,110
Do you really not remember

622
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,510
the last time when we met an immortal?

623
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:16,630
But as long as you think so,

624
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,400
I'll believe you.

625
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:20,670
But they all said I had gone crazy.

626
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,820
Don't care what others say.

627
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,239
Just do what you want.

628
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,550
Remember what Mother used to say?

629
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:27,960
I'm Chenxi.

630
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:29,360
You're Xingyue.

631
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,699
The stars shine brightly

632
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,239
as the moon emerges from the clouds.

633
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,610
Our dearest Shuo

634
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,730
will be like the stars and moon in the sky,

635
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,949
shining where it is darkest.

636
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,300
Today is my birthday.

637
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,159
Do you really have to make me cry?

638
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:44,130
I'm serious, Shuo.

639
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,790
If you've made up your mind, just go for it.

640
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,699
I'll always be behind you.

641
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,520
Thank you, Sister.

642
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,350
Xi.

643
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,980
I think I really met a demon.

644
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,200
He said the Desireless Stone is a divine stone.

645
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:06,550
But why did a divine stone

646
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,110
enter my human body?

647
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,210
Also, I met my benefactor today.

648
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,430
The Desireless Stone belongs to Fan Yue.

649
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,850
Could he be related to my benefactor?

650
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,270
Is this guidance from my benefactor

651
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,330
or a ruse by Fan Yue?

652
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,450
Zhao.

653
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,540
Have you finished drinking with my father?

654
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,430
Shuo.

655
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:42,890
Let's talk.

656
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,660
Thank you for today.

657
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,020
You even mentioned the proposal

658
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,920
to help me get out of that situation.

659
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,740
I owe you a big favor this time.

660
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,920
What if I'm not just trying to help you?

661
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,660
Are you serious about marrying me?

662
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,840
You know how bad my reputation is

663
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,840
in this city.

664
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:03,230
Are you out of your mind?

665
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,020
I just want to take care of you.

666
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,820
With that frail body of yours,

667
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,510
maybe let me take care of you instead

668
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,560
when I achieve immortality.

669
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,380
But Shuo,

670
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:14,400
the boss of Unbridled Pavilion

671
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,920
doesn't look like a deity at all.

672
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,670
Don't be fooled by him.

673
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,360
Zhao is simple and weak.

674
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,560
Apart from making steamed buns, he knows nothing about martial arts.

675
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,960
It's better to not get him involved

676
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,030
in these dangerous matters.

677
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,630
Don't worry.

678
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,180
I won't trust him easily.

679
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,110
I'll take care of it.

680
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,800
It's getting late.

681
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,760
I'm going to bed.

682
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,000
You too.

683
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,630
Don't tire yourself out.

684
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,590
Wait.

685
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,620
There's something in Shuo's body.

686
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,520
What's wrong?

687
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,550
Nothing.

688
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,200
Go back and rest.

689
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,680
The Desireless Stone?

690
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,810
Why is it in Shuo's body?

691
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,840
Zhao.

692
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,570
What's wrong with you?

693
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,880
I can't let Shuo find out that I'm an Eternal.

694
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,150
I can't extract it out now.

695
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:18,770
I'm fine.

696
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,150
I'm just too sleepy.

697
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,130
Go back and rest.

698
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,370
I’m going back.

699
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:32,540
Zhao is being weird today.

700
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,540
I actually can't extract it out.

701
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,920
Shuo went to Unbridled Pavilion

702
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,800
and came back with the Desireless Stone.

703
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,150
The demons in Unbridled Pavilion

704
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,000
must have something to do with the Desireless Stone going missing.

705
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,230
But why did the Desireless Stone

706
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,100
recognized Shuo as its master when she's just human?

707
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,980
I wouldn't know if it's a blessing or a curse

708
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,670
if the Eternals know about this.

709
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,360
I mustn't report it rashly.

710
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,150
This pill can only temporarily relieve the pain.

711
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,400
It can't cure the symptoms.

712
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:43,350
We need to gather the Five Contemplations as soon as possible.

713
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,370
Back then, the deities perished in the Divine War against the Hidden Lord.

714
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,420
The Divine Region collapsed,

715
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,850
and the Divine Realm ceased to exist in this world.

716
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:50,510
Legend has it that the Lunar Hidden Sea

717
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,590
is where Goddess Xingyue of the Lunar Race cultivates.

718
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,790
For the past 60,000 years,

719
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:55,720
no one has ever found it,

720
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,910
let alone go inside.

721
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,600
Exactly who is this Bai Shuo?

722
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,140
Desireless Stone is Xingyue's divine stone.

723
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:02,480
It's very likely that

724
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,590
the Desireless Stone was what brought us into the Lunar Hidden Sea.

725
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,290
She can activate the Desireless Stone at the critical moment.

726
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,620
Her blood can also increase the wolf demon's power.

727
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,140
No matter who she is,

728
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,620
she must have secrets that I don’t know.

729
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,930
But when I probed again yesterday,

730
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,030
the aura around her

731
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,890
is indeed a human's.

732
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,280
Bai Shuo's identity

733
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,680
is a mystery.

734
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,990
Yet, she has many tricks.

735
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:27,140
After just two or three interactions,

736
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,340
she has roughly figured out my plans.

737
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,560
Our priority

738
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,500
is to find a way

739
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,920
to bring her back to Bright Moon Palace.

740
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,160
But Master,

741
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,740
you failed to extract the stone yesterday.

742
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,160
I'm afraid she's already prepared.

743
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,550
What if we give her

744
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,650
a reason she can't refuse?

745
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,280
What is the best tool to use

746
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:58,460
to subdue demons?

747
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,510
But none of these has never worked.

748
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,590
Will it work?

749
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:10,140
[Invitation]

750
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:16,400
We'll close the pavilion at 5 p.m. today

751
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,220
as we're looking forward to speaking with you.

752
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,000
Speak with me?

753
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,870
Whether you are a deity or a demon,

754
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,410
I have to meet you again.

755
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,050
You're saying

756
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,550
you know my benefactor?

757
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,530
Of course.

758
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:39,880
Otherwise,

759
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,970
I wouldn't have travelled around with the Desireless Stone.

760
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:44,780
It's all to save my best friend.

761
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:46,660
Previously, I thought it was strange too.

762
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:49,080
How can a human control the Desireless Stone?

763
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:50,730
But you said

764
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,620
my friend is your benefactor.

765
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,000
Then it all makes sense.

766
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,440
Do you really think I'm a fool?

767
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,240
Yesterday, we were about to kill each other.

768
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,970
And now, when trouble strikes,

769
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,560
aren't we supposed to be turning against each other?

770
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,500
The Lunar Hidden Sea is a Divine Realm.

771
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:09,970
There are no divine deities in this world.

772
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,660
You could enter the last time

773
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:14,350
as the Desireless Stone was accidentally activated.

774
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,180
If you want to enter the Lunar Hidden Sea again,

775
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,270
you have to activate the Desireless Stone.

776
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,150
I don't want to believe either

777
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:22,130
that the Desireless Stone chose a human.

778
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,850
But that's the truth.

779
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:26,360
In order to save my best friend,

780
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,810
I can only cooperate with

781
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,100
a mere mortal like you.

782
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:32,000
Since there are no divine deities in the world,

783
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,590
and no one can enter the Lunar Hidden Sea,

784
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,270
then why is my benefactor trapped?

785
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:37,480
Since you know him,

786
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,480
you must know the reason.

787
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,880
Ms. Bai keeps claiming

788
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,110
that my friend is your benefactor.

789
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,140
How would I know

790
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,270
you are not lying?

791
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,620
On what grounds

792
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,640
should I share all of this with you?

793
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:56,130
Since you and I have the same goal

794
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,210
to some extent,

795
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,540
there's indeed no need to investigate.

796
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,030
What should I do

797
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,150
to activate the Desireless Stone?

798
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,310
You're quite straightforward, Ms. Bai.

799
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:05,910
However,

800
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,370
aren't you afraid

801
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,700
that I'm a demon?

802
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,140
I wouldn't say that I am completely unafraid.

803
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,000
From last night to this morning,

804
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,470
I've been thinking,

805
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,010
if you are a demon,

806
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,120
how should I keep you in check?

807
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,380
In my sleeve,

808
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,330
I've hidden a knife that is meant to kill you.

809
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,850
But that seems too naive.

810
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,940
Demon kills human, human kills demon.

811
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,290
It's easy to tell

812
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,280
who will win.

813
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,770
So as we've said before,

814
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:37,150
let's make a deal.

815
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,580
Whether you are a god

816
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:39,940
or a demon,

817
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,490
I wouldn't ask about your origin

818
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,080
nor care about who you really are.

819
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,670
As long as you can save my benefactor,

820
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:46,890
I will cooperate with you.

821
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:48,620
Not bad.

822
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,720
A wise man

823
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,570
will live longer.

824
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,490
The Desireless Stone is a divine object.

825
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,120
To activate the Desireless Stone,

826
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,190
must be gather

827
00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:01,900
the Five Contemplations of love, hate, kill, greed,

828
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:02,860
and benevolence.

829
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,010
Contemplations?

830
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,350
These are so intangible.

831
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:09,560
How should I gather it? Where should I go?

832
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,630
We will depart

833
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:13,260
for the Infinite Cosmos immediately.

834
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,610
♫The person standing far away♫

835
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:16,250
One word from you, and you want me to leave my hometown

836
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,400
and come with you?

837
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:18,970
♫Don't be afraid♫

838
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,320
You've been seeking immortality for ten years,

839
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:23,930
♫The stars will guide you to me♫

840
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,960
but you found no way out.

841
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,280
After wasting so much time, energy and money,

842
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,030
you still know little about matters relating to deities and demons.

843
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:31,060
♫Walk towards me♫

844
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:29,320
You really think you can save someone with those

845
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,710
human-made fairy tales?

846
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:31,800
Dream on.

847
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:34,510
Whether you believe me or not,

848
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:36,000
♫My heart feels so...♫

849
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:36,640
I am your only choice.

850
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:42,370
♫It's pounding as I wait for you♫

851
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,590
You know that very well.

852
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,030
Of course.

853
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,480
If you don't believe me,

854
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:48,070
♫The stars light up your eyes♫

855
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,200
you can stay.

856
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,550
With my benefactor stuck,

857
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:54,900
♫You are my distant call♫

858
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:53,610
I'm the only one who can save him.

859
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,110
If I want to save him, I must leave Ning'an City.

860
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:59,790
♫You are my first and last♫

861
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:58,880
You're not a good person,

862
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,100
yet you dragged me into a game that I have to play.

863
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,280
Three days.

864
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,190
I'll give you an answer in three days.

865
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,320
Why exactly three days?

866
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,840
You've seen my father.

867
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:09,880
I've been seeking immortality all these years.

868
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,570
I've already made him angry enough.

869
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,800
I can't be a dutiful daughter

870
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,100
if I want to return the favor.

871
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,550
I owe it to him.

872
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:17,530
My father's birthday is in three days.

873
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,150
Regardless whether I leave or not,

874
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:21,390
I want to celebrate his birthday with him.

875
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:23,210
Humans are troublesome.

876
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:25,190
You're not human.

877
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:26,280
Of course you don't understand.

878
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:28,240
Life is barely a hundred years long.

879
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:29,800
Every birthday

880
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,950
should be spent well.

881
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,580
If I really leave,

882
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,270
I don't know when I'll be back.

883
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:38,040
I should have a proper farewell with him,

884
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:39,110
isn't it?
