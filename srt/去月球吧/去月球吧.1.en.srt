00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,290
there is another troublesome matter

570
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,660
to discuss with you all.

571
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:08,900
What is it?

572
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,100
You've snuffed out the little bit of warmth here.

573
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,730
Okay.

574
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,980
Let me say it then.

575
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,300
Everyone remembers the Desireless Stone, right?

576
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,500
Lanling has been keeping

577
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,420
Goddess Xingyue's divine object all this time.

578
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,490
After so many years,

579
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,770
we became lax.

580
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,450
Maybe...

581
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:33,250
Perhaps...

582
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,160
Anyway,

583
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:35,940
well,

584
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,820
it was lost. Dismissed.

585
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:38,970
What?

586
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,490
Wait, wait, wait.

587
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:40,530
-Lost it?
-Lost it?

588
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:41,180
This can't be lost.

589
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,130
No way.

590
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,710
Why didn't you say so earlier?

591
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,550
That's a divine object.

592
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,750
How can it be lost?

593
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,110
-Yeah.
-You must make it clear.

594
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,420
What exactly happened?

595
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,450
You must explain.

596
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,380
-Yes.
-Yeah.

597
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,410
-Make it clear.
-You have to explain.

598
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,050
Make it clear.

599
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,140
As we all know,

600
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,900
the Desireless Stone belonged to the Goddess Xingyue.

601
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,140
Although it has been damaged

602
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,010
and can't show its divine power,

603
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:07,770
it's still a divine object of the Eternal Race

604
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:10,100
and the dignity of Lanling.

605
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,010
So we've been keeping it in the sect's secret realm

606
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,900
without disturbing it.

607
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,250
Last month,

608
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,050
we accidentally discovered that it was stolen.

609
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,940
And the only thing left at the scene

610
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,530
was the Demon Race's aura.

611
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,420
The Demon Race even attacked our home.

612
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,180
We're doomed!

613
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,970
Although it's a useless item,

614
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,940
it's still the face of Lanling.

615
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,660
We can't

616
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,640
just let this go.

617
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,820
-We can’t let it go.
-We can’t let it go.

618
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,340
Yes, we can't let it go.

619
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,490
I agree with you all.

620
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,530
But take a look.

621
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,630
Our sect

622
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,230
is short of money

623
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,710
and shorthanded.

624
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,530
There are many things we're unable to do.

625
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:52,490
Anyway,

626
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,620
if you find any clues

627
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,790
of the Desireless Stone in your cities,

628
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,050
just report it back. Dismissed.

629
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:00,660
No!

630
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,100
-No!
-The Demon Race has gone too far.

631
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,940
We must seek an explanation from the Demon Race!

632
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,250
At worse, we'll just fight them!

633
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,530
Get it back!

634
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,880
How dare they!

635
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,140
Let's go together.

636
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,050
You're all right!

637
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,250
The missing of the Desireless Stone

638
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,900
has embarrassed Lanling.

639
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,900
We should ask the demons for an explanation.

640
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:36,100
But if we fight the demons for this,

641
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,940
it will definitely

642
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,580
affect the entire Lanling Sect.

643
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,250
I should bear

644
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:46,530
such a big mistake by myself.

645
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,730
Yu Feng!

646
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:50,940
Come here!

647
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,050
Sect Leader.

648
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:54,820
Sect Leader.

649
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,490
After I leave,

650
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:58,900
this huge Lanling

651
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,340
and the responsibility of the world

652
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:05,490
will be in the hands of you all.

653
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,820
Please!

654
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:09,940
Master!

655
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:10,860
Master!

656
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,620
Sect Leader!

657
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:12,340
Sect Leader!

658
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,280
-Sect Leader!
-Master! Master!

659
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,490
You've all been graced by the sect for years.

660
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,600
Are you really going to blame Sect Leader for this?

661
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,380
Sect Leader,

662
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,940
we just said a few words.

663
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,620
Why did you take it seriously?

664
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,210
The demons in Baihua City are rampant.

665
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,490
We're very busy.

666
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:30,940
Sect Leader,

667
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,860
I'll take my leave.

668
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,620
Me too.

669
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,100
I have to collect rent from my shops.

670
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:35,730
Yes.

671
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:36,960
Me too.

672
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,290
Let's go.

673
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,490
Sect Leader, wake up!

674
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,100
Sect Leader!

675
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,250
You're all dismissed.

676
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,870
Chong Zhao, stay here.

677
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,010
Chong Zhao,

678
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,420
you were scared on my behalf?

679
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:11,620
Come, help me up.

680
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:13,900
Kneel.

681
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,390
Do you admit your mistake?

682
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,290
Do you admit your mistake?

683
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,770
You want to compete in being stubborn with me?

684
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,140
Were you wrong?

685
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,100
Were you wrong?

686
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:35,970
Were you wrong?

687
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:37,830
You—

688
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,660
I'm usually busy with city matters.

689
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,290
I don't have time to discipline you.

690
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:48,820
I didn't expect you to be so spoiled,

691
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,380
causing trouble everywhere.

692
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,290
Don't think I don't know.

693
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,940
You made a scene at the Taoist temple during the day

694
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,690
and went to a brothel at night.

695
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:58,660
Is this what the governor's daughter should do?

696
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,430
I'm the governor's daughter,

697
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,140
but I am also myself.

698
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,770
I know what I'm doing.

699
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,180
Before you be yourself,

700
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,340
do you still remember how your mother raised you?

701
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:11,070
[Spirit Tablet of Madam Han of the Bai Family]

702
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:11,610
Do you remember today is her death anniversary?

703
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:15,960
[Spirit Tablet of Madam Han of the Bai Family]

704
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,770
These years, what do you remember

705
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,140
other than becoming an Eternal?

706
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,660
What else do you care about?

707
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:24,750
I advised you to give up many times, but you didn't listen.

708
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,140
In the past,

709
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,530
you were clever and mischievous but still obedient.

710
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:30,670
Now,

711
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,940
you're stubborn and arrogant.

712
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,620
Today,

713
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,620
in this ancestral hall

714
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,940
and before your mother,

715
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,830
[Spirit Tablet of Madam Han of the Bai Family]

716
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:39,780
I want you to swear

717
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,970
to give up your Eternal obsession.

718
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,160
Otherwise,

719
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,100
I'll disown you.

720
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,610
Swearing is easy,

721
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,660
but I don't want to lie in front of my mother.

722
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,800
[Spirit Tablet of Madam Han of the Bai Family]

723
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,250
I want to become an Eternal

724
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,380
to repay one's kindness.

725
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,610
This is my lifelong wish.

726
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,450
No matter how many years it's been or how many people oppose it,

727
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,730
I won't give up.

728
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,530
Even if you break ties with your father?

729
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,600
Answer me!

730
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,250
Yes.

731
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,380
Remember what you said.

732
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,820
From now on, don't call me your father.

733
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:53,210
It's been a long time since we've stolen the Desireless Stone from the divine race.

734
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,970
We've been to so many places

735
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,620
and tried hundreds of ways,

736
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,320
but it never lit up.

737
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,810
What is

738
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,770
so special about Bai Shuo

739
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,310
that she could make the divine stone light up?

740
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,660
Have you forgotten

741
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,140
why we came to the Human Race's territory?

742
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,290
Of course.

743
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,180
The Desireless Stone is an ancient

744
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,050
divine object of the Lunar Race's Goddess Xingyue.

745
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,180
During the Divine War 60,000 years ago,

746
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,180
countless deities died.

747
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,780
The Desireless Stone was damaged during the Divine War.

748
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,380
No one has been able to activate it.

749
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,100
Legend has it

750
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,210
that as long as one gathers

751
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:23,820
the Five Contemplations of love, hate, kill, greed, and benevolence,

752
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,050
one can reactivate the Desireless Stone

753
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:25,900
and get the divine power

754
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,010
that Goddess Xingyue left in the Desireless Stone.

755
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:29,210
The purpose of establishing

756
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:31,100
the Unbridled Pavilion was to absorb human Contemplations.

757
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:00,970
Humans

758
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:03,690
are the most complicated creatures in the world.

759
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,340
Welcome.

760
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:09,820
Happiness.

761
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,940
-Is it good?
-Yes!

762
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,250
Sadness.

763
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,250
How dare you sell it?

764
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,380
-Anger.
-What are you doing?

765
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,010
Love.

766
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,210
-Thank you.
-Take your time.

767
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,250
Envy.

768
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,660
Fear.

769
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,730
Bloodthirstiness.

770
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:24,970
Greed.

771
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,770
All emotions and distractions converge in them.

772
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,720
I thought that as long as I mixed in with humans,

773
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,290
the contemplation power needed by the Desireless Stone would be collected.

774
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,380
But now, it seems

775
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,360
that Bai Shuo

776
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,730
is the key.

777
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,060
How about

778
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,490
we kidnap her?

779
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,900
Idiot.

780
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,940
Bai Shuo is the governor's daughter.

781
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,160
Ning'an City is guarded by the Lanling Sect.

782
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,420
If we make a scene

783
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,010
and the Eternal Envoy here reports to the sect,

784
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,770
Master’s whereabouts will be leaked.

785
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,730
But you're the Demon King of the Polar Region and master of the Bright Moon Palace.

786
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,210
Unless the Divine Race is revived,

787
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,490
no current Eternal or demon

788
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:01,100
is a match for you.

789
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,250
We don't need to be afraid of the Lanling Sect.

790
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,900
I don't like trouble.

791
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,449
The scum from Jingyou Mountain and Cold Spring Palace

792
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,130
are looking for me everywhere.

793
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,179
If they know

794
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,969
we have the Desireless Stone,

795
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,260
it'll just add more trouble.

796
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,610
Boring.

797
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,650
You're foresighted

798
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:22,900
and confident.

799
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,170
I admire you.

800
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,570
Is this what I want to hear?

801
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,260
Then what do you mean?

802
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,300
Master means

803
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,780
that the Desireless Stone responds to Bai Shuo,

804
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,150
so it's very likely that she has one of the Contemplations.

805
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,050
I'll go to the Governor's Mansion to keep an eye on her.

806
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:39,449
I...

807
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:40,420
Me too.

808
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:44,699
Bai Shuo.

809
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:48,580
Interesting.

810
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,989
[Spirit Tablet of Madam Han of the Bai Family]

811
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,719
Mother.

812
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,130
I'm sorry.

813
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,220
I forgot your death anniversary.

814
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,820
I'm an unfilial daughter.

815
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,970
Actually, I don't want to make Father angry.

816
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,330
But...

817
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,570
Mother,

818
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:15,130
if it weren't for that immortal ten years ago,

819
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,720
Xi and I would have died.

820
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,570
Many people live

821
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:22,010
but don't know what they're living for.

822
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,630
But I know myself.

823
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,440
[Spirit Tablet of Madam Han of the Bai Family]

824
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,240
I want to become an Eternal

825
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,780
to repay his kindness.

826
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,300
That was my promise to the divine deity.

827
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,570
I must repay

828
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:33,900
the favor I was given.

829
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:35,820
I've lost contact with Xi.

830
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,820
I don't know whether she’s alive or dead.

831
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,090
I'll repay on her behalf too.

832
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,520
Everyone can say I'm stubborn

833
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,420
and stupid.

834
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,780
But if even I break my promise,

835
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,570
it'll be no different from me being dead.

836
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:54,410
[Spirit Tablet of Madam Han of the Bai Family]

837
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,700
Right,

838
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,340
Mother?

839
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:04,650
Yesterday, your uncle and I observed the tray

840
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:08,280
and found there are demons in Ning'an City.

841
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:11,240
But we haven't found the exact location yet.

842
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:14,260
You're the immortal in charge of Ning'an City.

843
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,010
Be careful when you go back.

844
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,270
Don't worry, Master.

845
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,560
I understand.

846
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:21,650
All these years,

847
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:24,310
you've been my most capable and outstanding disciple.

848
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,780
You've become

849
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,210
a city's immortal

850
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,090
at such a young age.

851
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,780
So I have

852
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,610
a very important task for you.

853
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,610
Master,

854
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,530
do you want me

855
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,130
to track down the whereabouts of the Desireless Stone?

856
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,340
No.

857
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,820
I just wanted to ask

858
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,130
about the business of your steamed bun stall

859
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,070
in Ning'an City.

860
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,110
Any profits?

861
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:53,300
The cost of saving humans has been too high recently.

862
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,300
Besides, this house is old and shabby.

863
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,500
It needs renovation.

864
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,260
-Master, Senior Uncle.
-So...

865
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,570
We are Eternals.

866
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:03,260
Why can't we just use magic?

867
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,390
No.

868
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,780
Hundreds of years ago, when demons and Eternals had a truce,

869
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,130
they promised

870
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:11,490
not to use magic in the human race's territory.

871
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,570
But we're in the Eternal Race's territory right now.

872
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,570
We have to make a habit out of things.

873
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,860
If you rely on magic for everything,

874
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,820
you might accidentally expose yourself

875
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,260
in the human race's territory.

876
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,450
By then, if the demons find something on us

877
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,650
and trouble us first,

878
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,650
that would be bad.

879
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:28,900
What if the demons break their promise

880
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,090
and wreak havoc among the humans?

881
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:31,450
Can't we use magic against them?

882
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,780
Don't worry.

883
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:36,780
Recently, there's been chaos among the demons.

884
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,940
Even if they want to harm the human race,

885
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,940
I'm afraid

886
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,740
they don't have the energy for that.

887
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,080
Also, Master,

888
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,780
about the Desireless Stone, I still think that...

889
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,090
60,000 years ago,

890
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:48,380
Hidden Lord caused a disaster and the Divine Race fell.

891
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,920
Since then, there is no divine deity in the world.

892
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,740
Now the upholding of justice

893
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,780
lies with us, the Eternals.

894
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,910
And you

895
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:57,860
are my

896
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,700
favorite private disciple.

897
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:04,090
So the burden of all living beings

898
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,090
must fall on your shoulders.

899
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,520
Don't worry, Master.

900
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,490
I will follow your teachings.

901
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,050
I won't use magic to run the steamed bun stall.

902
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,610
I won't let all living beings down.

903
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:18,570
Thank you for your hard work.

904
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:20,300
Hurry and return to the city.

905
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,300
What a naive child.

906
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,940
Yeah.

907
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,940
But what do living beings

908
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,300
have to do with making money?

909
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,970
They have everything to do with it.

910
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,900
The demons are wreaking havoc nowadays.

911
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,700
The Cold Spring Palace is especially eager to make a move.

912
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,130
Zhen Yu is ruthless

913
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:47,780
and keeps expanding his power.

914
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,780
We'll have to fight this battle sooner or later.

915
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:52,970
Have you ever heard of

916
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:55,740
winning a war without provisions?

917
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,050
This is the territory of the human race.

918
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,010
How dare the Cold Spring Palace make trouble here

919
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,260
and besiege the Eternal Race?

920
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,370
Where is the Desireless Stone?

921
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:05,900
Tell me,

922
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,610
and you live.

923
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:07,570
Don't tell me,

924
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:08,490
and you die.

925
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,740
It's a secret of the Eternal Race.

926
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,940
You will never know!

927
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,700
Fellow Eternal.

928
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,380
Are you all right?

929
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,410
Who are you?

930
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,170
I'm just a wandering Eternal, passing by.

931
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,420
Thank you for saving my life.

932
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,530
No need to thank me.

933
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,220
The demons

934
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,450
besieged my fellow kind.

935
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:43,170
Of course I had to help.

936
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:44,740
Just now,

937
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,740
I heard that the demon mentioned the Desireless Stone.

938
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,490
Could that be

939
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:50,220
the cause of the fight tonight?

940
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,900
Yes.

941
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,050
Everyone knows that

942
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:56,170
the Desireless Stone is with the Lanling Sect.

943
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,780
Why did he ask that?

944
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,090
You don't know.

945
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,240
The Desireless Stone

946
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,490
was stolen some time ago.

947
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:03,300
Stolen?

948
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,730
By whom?

949
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,160
I don't know who it was.

950
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,970
I only know it was done by a demon.

951
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,260
A demon?

952
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,220
Any more leads?

953
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,230
No.

954
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,490
If you have

955
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,050
no other leads,

956
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,300
I have

957
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,220
no reason to let you live.

958
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,700
[Fu Ling, Demon, General of Cold Spring Palace]

959
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,490
Grand Master.

960
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,340
[Zhen Yu, Demon, Master of Cold Spring Palace]

961
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,780
You're just impatient.

962
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,780
Couldn't you have waited till he was further away?

963
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,010
You got blood all over me.

964
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,260
I don't have the patience.

965
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,900
When you killed our people,

966
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,270
you didn't hesitate either.

967
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,380
So quick to talk back.

968
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,780
The Desireless Stone was in the secret realm of Lanling.

969
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,570
Even I can't enter and get it easily.

970
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,300
A demon managed to

971
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,010
silently sneak in and steal it.

972
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:15,380
In this world,

973
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,650
there's only

974
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:18,090
one person who can do that.

975
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:19,420
The Master of Bright Moon Palace?

976
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,300
Yes.

977
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,810
That Fan Yue...

978
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,940
Back then, he used the Zhanhuang Chain

979
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,170
to chop off my demon tail.

980
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:26,490
It cut off the possibility

981
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:28,860
of me raising my cultivation level.

982
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,060
I will

983
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,530
make him pay with his life.

984
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,570
I've disguised myself as a top courtesan

985
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:36,230
and successfully infiltrated Unbridled Pavilion.

986
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,440
Hurry up.

987
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,890
While you

988
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,780
find the Desireless Stone's whereabouts,

989
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,090
lead the Eternals

990
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:43,900
to fight against Bright Moon Palace.

991
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,050
Even if they can’t die together,

992
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:47,860
we can

993
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,570
reap the benefits.

994
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,090
Yes.

995
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,740
Just tell me if you want to starve me to death.

996
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,340
Someone is proud

997
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,680
and full of ambition.

998
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,530
She won’t starve to death.

999
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,970
Didn’t Zhao say he went out for business yesterday?

1000
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:25,820
Why hasn’t he come back?

1001
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,420
When someone went to the brothel,

1002
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,170
why didn't she remember that

1003
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,220
she had a fiance named Zhao?

1004
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,420
I didn’t go to a brothel.

1005
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,650
That wasn't a brothel either.

1006
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:34,780
That someone doesn't have to explain anything.

1007
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,480
I've already cut familial ties with that person.

1008
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,670
She can go wherever she wants.

1009
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:49,050
Patrol.

1010
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:51,860
Go wherever I want?

1011
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,810
You said it yourself.

1012
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,450
How did it go?

1013
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,910
Bai Shuo is indeed the daughter of Bai Xun, the governor.

1014
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:10,830
She has been searching in vain for a Eternal for the past decade.

1015
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:12,510
People call her the Eternal fanatic.

1016
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,170
A Eternal fanatic?

1017
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,510
She made the Desireless Stone glow.

1018
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,420
I don't believe she's just an ordinary person.

1019
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,400
Unless...

1020
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:20,900
Master was mistaken last night,

1021
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:23,260
and the Desireless Stone did not glow.

1022
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:29,050
But that's impossible,

1023
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:29,700
Master.

1024
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,740
Why don't I catch her

1025
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,050
and let you interrogate her?

1026
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:32,800
No need.

1027
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,090
She's here.

1028
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,090
Boss.

1029
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,740
I'm here to see you.

1030
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,130
Let's continue our chat

1031
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:43,300
from last night.

1032
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:46,730
Master.

1033
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:48,450
Shall I catch and interrogate her,

1034
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:50,050
or throw her out?

1035
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:51,280
This is the human race's territory.

1036
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:52,630
Calm down.

1037
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,980
Don't make trouble.

1038
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,620
Since we know what she wants, why interrogate her?

1039
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:59,670
I just need to pretend to be a immortal

1040
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,010
and fool her into believing it.

1041
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:04,070
Then, she'll happily answer my questions.

1042
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:06,610
By then, it won't be hard

1043
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:08,260
to test if her emotions can really

1044
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:10,280
affect the Desireless Stone.

1045
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:19,130
Look at this extravagant style

1046
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,270
and untamed demeanor.

1047
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,260
Can this really belong to a deity?

1048
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:25,340
I'll have to find out.
