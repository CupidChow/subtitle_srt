1
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimesâ€¦

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

[Moonlight Mystique]

18
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,920
[Episode 4]

19
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,880
Young Lord.

20
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,000
That Eternal, Chong Zhao,

21
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,560
does not seem to be in the city anymore.

22
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,290
Your plan to frame him must have worked.

23
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,480
He must've went back to Lanling Sect

24
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,910
to tell on Bright Moon Palace.

25
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,520
Well then, let's make this city even more chaotic,

26
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,500
so that when the Five Eternals of Lanling arrive,

27
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,810
they get to see the best of hell.

28
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,060
If you die,

29
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,310
the Desireless Stone will come out.

30
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,630
That demon Fan Yue wanted to cut open my heart to extract the stone,

31
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,029
but was jolted away by Desireless Stone's divine rays.

32
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:22,160
It seems that the Desireless Stone is protecting me.

33
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,240
So, if I cut open my own heart,

34
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,140
will I be able to activate my divine powers,

35
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,940
and break through Chong Zhao's barrier?

36
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,159
My father is waiting for me.

37
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,420
I have to go back.

38
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,970
It's fifty-fifty.

39
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,600
I either live or die.

40
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,710
Xi,

41
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,940
you will protect me,

42
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,990
right?

43
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,530
Xi.

44
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,010
I did it!

45
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,110
You didn't go back to Lanling?

46
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,390
At the very least, I should take you back for interrogation.

47
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,900
Interrogate me?

48
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,980
I thought it's because you were worried about me.

49
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,270
Cut the crap.

50
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,740
From Bright Moon Palace to Cold Spring Palace,

51
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,120
where are you exactly from?

52
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,730
If you are so curious about me,

53
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,850
why don't you come with me

54
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,990
and join the Demon Race?

55
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,850
Since you wouldn't speak,

56
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,340
I will just simply take your body back.

57
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,920
Cloud Fire Bow?

58
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,909
You are indeed Cold Spring Palace's Fu Ling.

59
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,890
So what if I am?

60
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,090
Do you really think you can

61
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,730
lay a finger on my disciple?

62
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,040
Grand Master.

63
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,310
Are you hurt?

64
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,310
I'm fine.

65
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,120
Heavenly Sky Fan?

66
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,090
You are the master of Cold Spring Palace.

67
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,370
You have some knowledge,

68
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,400
but you're not smart enough.

69
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,730
Let me teach you.

70
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,150
In such situations,

71
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,370
even if you recognize this fan,

72
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,200
you should've pretended you didn't know.

73
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,560
Because it's only then

74
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,900
that I could possibly

75
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,250
spare your life.

76
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,280
The moment you used this fan,

77
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,160
you gave up on concealing your identity.

78
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,020
He's not that stupid.

79
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,530
Fine.

80
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,310
Let me test you some more.

81
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:37,970
If

82
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,120
the Eternal Envoy,

83
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,740
Sect Leader Jin Yao's head disciple

84
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,130
were to die a terrible death here in Ning'an City,

85
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,130
tell me,

86
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,190
how many people will the Eternals send here?

87
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,240
Will the murderer Fan Yue

88
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,040
still survive?

89
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,700
So you guys were the ones who framed the Master of Bright Moon Palace.

90
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,650
Yes.

91
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,159
I will need to trouble you

92
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,390
to lend me your life.

93
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,840
Give me a reason.

94
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,870
Fan Yue is a demon. He wouldn't save you.

95
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,820
He saved me once.

96
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,190
You mean...

97
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,060
You want to repay his kindness?

98
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,520
You know what he will say to those old men

99
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,570
when he returns to Lanling, right?

100
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,940
I know I was wrong.

101
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,900
I'm willing to be punished.

102
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,350
According to the rules of Cold Spring Palace,

103
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,120
the mistake you made today

104
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,900
is worthy of your death.

105
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,540
You are free to punish me.

106
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,050
But I saved him

107
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,520
not only to repay his kindness,

108
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,160
but because I think

109
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,740
he is a person who could be won over.

110
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:13,950
Win him over?

111
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,510
In order to save Bai Shuo alone,

112
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,850
he placed the lives of everyone in Ning'an city as a lower priority.

113
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,850
Although he is an Eternal,

114
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,460
there is a point of vulnerability in his heart.

115
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,460
If we exploit it well,

116
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,410
you may even have another spy within the Eternals.

117
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,470
A spy within the Eternals?

118
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,270
Your suggestion is interesting.

119
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,150
However,

120
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:33,250
besides that,

121
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:36,030
are you truly not harboring any other thoughts?

122
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,140
Of course not.

123
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:38,200
I, Fu Ling, am devoted solely

124
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,309
to you, Grand Master.

125
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,760
I'm not sparing you punishment today

126
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,280
because

127
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,660
your excuse was convincing,

128
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,480
but because

129
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,920
you are my disciple.

130
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,940
I can't bear to kill you.

131
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,850
If this happens again,

132
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,190
you will be severely punished.

133
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,680
Got it.

134
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,980
It's impossible

135
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,370
to frame Fan Yue now.

136
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,500
However,

137
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,100
the mission of retrieving the Desireless Stone

138
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,530
must be achieved.

139
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,780
Don't let me down again.

140
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,450
I understand.

141
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,890
Master, you seem to already know

142
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,970
which of the five Contemplations will appear in Ning'an City.

143
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,740
With the Nether Poison wrecking havoc,

144
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,850
Ning'an City will turn into hell.

145
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,870
Everyone is trapped with no escape.

146
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,700
The desire to kill will definitely emerge.

147
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,960
Master.

148
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,020
As you expected,

149
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,050
Bai Shuo is here.

150
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,610
Let her come up.

151
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,630
I'll tell you everything

152
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,090
I saw in the Desireless Stone.

153
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,110
In exchange,

154
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,620
I want the antidote to this demonic poison.

155
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,440
Ms. Bai.

156
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,730
Things have changed.

157
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,730
Ning'an City is now in chaos.

158
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,890
Governor Bai is also poisoned by the Nether Poison.

159
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,920
Do you really think you're

160
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,660
in any position to negotiate with me?

161
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,500
All these days,

162
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,400
you've been lying to me to about collecting the Five Contemplations.

163
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,310
You made me trust you and be used by you.

164
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,450
You already know that

165
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,690
my father was poisoned by this demonic poison.

166
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,480
Yet, you wouldn't make use of

167
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,120
this opportunity to try and win me over.

168
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,870
Why?

169
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,860
The Five Contemplations are key to activating the Desireless Stone.

170
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,090
In other words,

171
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,750
everything predicted in the Desireless Stone

172
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,750
is the origins of the Five Contemplations.

173
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,810
The demonic poison in the city might not have been your doing,

174
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,650
but you want to make use of the chaos in Ning'an

175
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,700
to force the Five Contemplations into existence, and use me to absorb their energy.

176
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,120
I did want to see

177
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,660
this Ning'an City turning into hell,

178
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,010
and force the Five Contemplations into existence.

179
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,180
But you are afterall human.

180
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,790
What can you do even if

181
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,250
you know what I am up to?

182
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,440
I'm indeed just a human.

183
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,270
I have nothing to threaten you with.

184
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,440
But regardless what you are after,

185
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,100
you cannot do without me.

186
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,120
If this demonic poison takes hold,

187
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,170
I will become a walking corpse

188
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,480
just like the maniacs out there.

189
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:22,860
Fan Yue.

190
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,040
Now,

191
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,390
do I,

192
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,860
as a human,

193
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,380
have the rights to negotiate with you?

194
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,540
How dare you threaten me?

195
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,380
Do you really think I dare not kill you?

196
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,820
You dare not,

197
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,010
you cannot,

198
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,480
and you will not.

199
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,860
The fact that you let me live until now

200
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,230
has already proven so.

201
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,300
I, Bai Shuo, may not be a big shot,

202
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,380
but I still have my family to protect,

203
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,200
and my benefactor whom I must find.

204
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,360
Everything I have done so far

205
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,120
is not to seek death, but to live.

206
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,260
Only by staying alive

207
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,750
can I accomplish those things.

208
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,130
But the current situation is forcing me to make a choice.

209
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,110
What I am betting on today

210
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,810
is not only your inevitability,

211
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,990
but also your heart.

212
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,830
I bet there's something you can't let go of in your heart too.

213
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,080
You'll give me what I want because of

214
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,090
the reason that compels you to gather the Contemplations.

215
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,430
This is Ghost Grass.

216
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,270
When its flowers bloom, it becomes a medicine.

217
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,620
It is the antidote of the Nether Poison.

218
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,920
But the Nether Poison is the strongest poison of the Demon Race.

219
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,310
There is no cure in the world.

220
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,150
The Ghost Grass can only suppress the poison,

221
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,140
but it cannot completely cure.

222
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,200
If you want to remain human,

223
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,960
consume one flower a day

224
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,080
without missing a single day.

225
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,350
Got it?

226
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,040
How can I

227
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,700
make it bloom?

228
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:45,610
With human blood.

229
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,750
A lot of blood.

230
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,630
Whether with your own or someone else's,

231
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,680
whether you kill yourself or kill or someone else,

232
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:54,700
it's your choice.

233
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,350
Use human blood?

234
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,260
Fan Yue.

235
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,790
Can I still trust you?

236
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,060
You claimed that my benefactor in the Lunar Hidden Sea

237
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,260
was your old friend.

238
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,200
Do you dare claim it's real?

239
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,060
It was fake.

240
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,070
I have no idea who is your benefactor,

241
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,170
nor do I have any idea who is it

242
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,850
you're looking for in the Lunar Hidden Sea.

243
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,960
But the Ghost Grass

244
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,760
is definitely real.

245
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,350
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

246
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,220
Whether you want it or not,

247
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,750
it's also up to you.

248
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,360
If my father is saved,

249
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,770
I will fulfill the promise I made today.

250
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,620
But if you lie to me again,

251
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,680
you can forget about activating the Desireless Stone ever again.

252
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,090
Cold Spring Palace

253
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,380
must be reported to the Eternals as soon as possible.

254
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,650
What does that demoness mean?

255
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,630
Why did she save me?

256
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,360
She must be up to something.

257
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,650
Regardless, I should report to Lanling first.

258
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,180
With human blood.

259
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,230
A lot of blood.

260
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,710
Whether with your own or someone else's,

261
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,900
whether you kill yourself or kill or someone else,

262
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,210
it's your choice.

263
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,270
Master.

264
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,620
Are you still angry?

265
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,130
Angry?

266
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,510
Why should I be angry?

267
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,320
I recall your original plans was for

268
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,930
Bai Shuo to come and beg you,

269
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,190
and the terms of the deal are yours to decide.

270
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,530
But now it seems like

271
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,730
she has the upper hand again.

272
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,420
Again?

273
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,030
Master, you are virtuous

274
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,790
and magnanimous,

275
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,670
and does not argue with the weak.

276
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,910
It's Bai Shuo's huge blessing

277
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,030
to have received help from you.

278
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,670
Enough!

279
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,250
Master.

280
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,010
Now that Bai Shuo is also poisoned by the Nether Poison,

281
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,960
and given that the Ghost Grass cannot fully remove the poison,

282
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,540
does that mean

283
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,620
she has to live on human blood for the rest of her life?

284
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,610
I am only using her to gather the Contemplations.

285
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,780
I donâ€™t care

286
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,080
how she stays alive.

287
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,130
If she chooses to use the grass to save others,

288
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,410
the Contemplations you are after will be gone.

289
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,280
That Ghost Grass is just a medicine for relief.

290
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,130
Human nature is inherently evil.

291
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,780
Once this has been cast

292
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,610
and if greed takes over,

293
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
this herb that is meant to heal

294
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,870
will become a blade that kills.

295
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,850
Bai Shuo,

296
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,850
you took a gamble on human nature with me.

297
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,220
Let's see how you

298
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,520
clean up this mess

299
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,640
if human nature shifts.

300
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,000
Father,

301
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,390
have a good sleep.

302
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,030
When you wake up...

303
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:13,480
When you wake up,

304
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,369
I am not sure what will happen either.

305
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,660
But I won't let you die.

306
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,920
We still have to wait for Xi's return

307
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:23,790
and reunite with her.

308
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,430
But Chong Zhao will

309
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,610
no longer be part of this family.

310
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,200
He...

311
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,930
Forget it.

312
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,860
Let's not talk about unhappy things.

313
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:37,850
Without him,

314
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,240
we can still live a good life.

315
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,740
Truly no regard for her own life.

316
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,650
â™«The person standing far awayâ™«

317
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,890
â™«Don't be afraidâ™«

318
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,440
â™«The stars will guide you to meâ™«

319
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,590
Despite seeking immortality for 10 years,

320
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,890
all she has got is this collection of duds.

321
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:43,920
â™«Walk towards meâ™«

322
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,660
She might be smart,

323
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,130
but also so foolish.

324
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,230
Humans may not be able to live beyond a hundred years,

325
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,080
but my benefactor is an immortal.

326
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,720
â™«My heart feels so...â™«

327
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,130
I may be afraid of death.

328
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,950
But I'm more afraid of not having a chance to repay him.

329
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:54,750
â™«It's pounding as I wait for youâ™«

330
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,640
So I can be used by you,

331
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,720
and I'll never expose your identity.

332
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,160
But it must be an equal exchange,

333
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,390
and you must fulfill my wish.

334
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,000
â™«The stars light up your eyesâ™«

335
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,750
â™«You are my distant callâ™«

336
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,020
â™«You are my first and lastâ™«

337
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:19,490
â™«My heart is trembling for youâ™«

338
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,770
â™«In this moment where we embrace each otherâ™«

339
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,160
Who said the path of cultivation

340
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:27,230
â™«Let's never let goâ™«

341
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,590
must always be the path towards being an Eternal?

342
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,320
I've checked the deaths of several disciples

343
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,970
and their surrounding aura.

344
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,440
It's indeed the work of the Demon Race.

345
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,770
What's weirder is that

346
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,980
the disciples' eternal energy are all missing.

347
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,070
I'm afraid...

348
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,370
it's taken away the demons who killed them.

349
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,720
They killed them,

350
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,850
and even took their eternal energy?

351
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,240
I told you that those demons

352
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,770
are most deserving of death.

353
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,060
Why are you yelling at me?

354
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,210
I didn't steal it.

355
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,460
Chong Zhao.

356
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,990
What happened?

357
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,490
How did you get hurt this badly?

358
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,890
Were you also ambushed by the demons?

359
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,280
I, Chong Zhao, am guilty.

360
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,810
What happened?

361
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,510
I misjudged the Demon Race's tactics

362
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,260
and delayed reporting the real situation of the city.

363
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,960
This caused Ning'an City to be thrown into chaos

364
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,120
as Cold Spring Palace spread the Nether Poison.

365
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,100
I have failed my duty,

366
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,870
so I've come back to seek punishment from all of you.

367
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,330
I also beg that you could

368
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,460
lend assistance to Ning'an.

369
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,410
How could you be so muddled

370
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,920
and not report it right away?

371
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,450
Because if the Eternal Race descends on Ning'an City,

372
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,350
another innocent person will die.

373
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,900
I want to protect the city,

374
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,360
but also protect that person.

375
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,340
My hesitation gave the Demon Race a chance to strike.

376
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:59,930
After quelling the turmoil in Ning'an,

377
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,590
Iâ€™m willing to accept any form of punishment.

378
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,290
Master, I just ask that you

379
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,560
don't hurt Bai Shuo.

380
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,830
Bai Shuo?

381
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,750
What does this have to do with Bai Shuo?

382
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,330
Because...

383
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,270
the Desireless Stone

384
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,040
is in Shuo's body.

385
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,610
Father.

386
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,000
You're alright?

387
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,400
That's great.

388
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,310
I'm glad you're okay.

389
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,670
Why aren't you saying anything?

390
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,000
Why are you looking at me so seriously?

391
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,300
The people in the household said you saved me with a flower.

392
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,090
What kind of flower is that?

393
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,100
How did you get it?

394
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,410
It's just a flower.

395
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,520
I found it by chance.

396
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,960
I don't know what it's called.

397
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,070
I am perfectly aware of

398
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,960
what you're capable of.

399
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,640
A maniac condition that no doctor in the entire city could cure,

400
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,710
yet you happened to have its cure with a single remedy.

401
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,060
Tell me exactly what happened.

402
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,350
I went through so much to find the medicine to save you,

403
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,000
and yet you're not even the least bit moved.

404
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,730
Instead, you questioned me as soon as you came.

405
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,530
You wouldn't believe me even if I told you it was a coincidence.

406
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,170
Then, exactly what kind of answer

407
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,360
would satisfy you?

408
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,140
It's a complete chaos outside.

409
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,540
Half of our people have gotten the maniac condition.

410
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,600
It's not the time for you to be stubborn.

411
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,590
If we really have the medicine,

412
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,170
we should use it to save them.

413
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,600
If you know anything else,

414
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:28,830
spill it all out.

415
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,280
Me being stubborn?

416
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,660
So what is it that you want to hear?

417
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,310
You wouldn't believe everything I just said.

418
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,280
No.

419
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,080
It's not that you don't believe what I just said.

420
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,040
All these years,

421
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,800
you've never once trusted me.

422
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,730
You never once believed my words.

423
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,780
-I...
-Go take care of your people.

424
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:47,850
You don't have to worry about me.

425
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,520
There's too much going on in the city.

426
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,840
I was too anxious just now.

427
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,140
Besides asking about the medicine,

428
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,040
I also wanted to ask you,

429
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:58,440
why did you become so weak overnight?

430
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,180
Shuo.

431
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,880
This maniac condition is not that simple.

432
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,980
I don't want anything to happen to you.

433
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,920
You get some rest first.

434
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,600
We'll talk later.

435
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,080
It's not that I don't want to tell you,

436
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,490
But the Ghost Grass is a demonic object.

437
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,750
It feeds on human blood every day.

438
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,780
How am I supposed to tell you?

439
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,560
Watch carefully.

440
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,390
Don't put them there.

441
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,440
Keep your eyes wide open!

442
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,050
The city's soldiers,

443
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,790
cowering in fear at the first sign of trouble.

444
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,930
How dare you!

445
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,950
Stand straight!

446
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,710
General.

447
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:46,920
How is the city?

448
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,630
Following your orders last night,

449
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,940
majority of the people with the maniac condition

450
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,400
have been locked up in an abandoned yard in the east of the city.

451
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,870
But there are more of such people in the west.

452
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,680
We're short-handed.

453
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,000
There's no way we could hold them.

454
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,030
Now, we can only let the people who had fallen ill

455
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,140
stay at home.

456
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:58,800
Currently,

457
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,580
only the area surrounding the Governor's Mansion is guarded.

458
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,800
It's considered safe.

459
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,870
Don't worry.

460
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,480
The Governor has regained his consciousness.

461
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,880
He must have a way to deal with this maniac condition.

462
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,300
At times like this,

463
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,540
our spirits must remain unshaken.

464
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,840
The Governor has recovered?

465
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,070
-That's great!
-Great!

466
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,250
Didn't they say there's no cure for maniac?

467
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,470
So who could have

468
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,450
cured our Governor?

469
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,560
It's all thanks to Lady Shuo.

470
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,700
She was the one who found the medicine.

471
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,640
I didn't expect Lady Shuo to be so amazing!

472
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,730
It's really hard to notice on normal days.

473
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,840
Who are you to gossip about Lady Shuo?

474
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,400
Guard the gate well.

475
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,470
-Yes!
-Yes!

476
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,000
Grand Master.

477
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,170
How are things?

478
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,680
Although Bai Shuo has been resting at home,

479
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,780
Fan Yue has also been keeping a close watch.

480
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:49,020
It would be unwise to try and recklessly retrieve the Desireless Stone.

481
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,340
But Xixi heard

482
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,640
a piece of news just now.

483
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:52,790
Someone said

484
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,290
Bai Shuo has found a medicine

485
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,670
that detoxified Bai Xun's Nether Poison.

486
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,590
Only the Ghost Grass can alleviate theNether Poison.

487
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,420
And the Ghost Grass

488
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,340
originated from the Demon Region.

489
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,410
It looks like

490
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,810
it's the work of Fan Yue.

491
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,870
In that case,

492
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,760
let's give him a push.

493
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,960
Push?

494
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,050
The Nether Poison is rampant, and everyone is living in fear.

495
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,140
Who doesn't want the antidote?

496
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,060
Let me tell you something.

497
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,490
In this world,

498
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,220
it's not that people fear having nothing,

499
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,010
but that

500
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,610
you have what I don't.

501
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,760
A common's man only crime is to carry jade

502
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,120
that causes other's greed.

503
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,900
If everyone knows

504
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,750
Bai Shuo has the antidote,

505
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,500
does she have

506
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,300
any way out?

507
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,210
Since

508
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,160
the Desireless Stone has recognized its master,

509
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,550
it's not going to be easy to simply extract it from her heart.

510
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,210
I want to see

511
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,880
if

512
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,430
she dies for some other reason,

513
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,160
and the Desireless Stone has no master,

514
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,130
will it then

515
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,390
come out on its own?

516
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,050
I understand.

517
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,380
Iâ€™m on it.

518
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,900
As the Master of Cold Spring Palace, you came all the way here

519
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,850
but didn't come visit me at the Unriddled Pavilion.

520
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,560
Instead, you're hiding here.

521
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,830
Could it be that...

522
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,870
you're afraid?

523
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,370
It has been a long time

524
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,940
since you stole the Desireless Stone

525
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:21,890
from the Eternals.

526
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,950
However, you've been keeping it hidden.

527
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,830
As rumor has it, is it true that

528
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,000
you're injured

529
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,900
and urgently need

530
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:31,470
the Desireless Stone's divine power to save yourself?

531
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,570
Injured?

532
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,660
Bai Shuo belongs to me.

533
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,870
Don't you dare touch her.

534
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,630
You gave her the Ghost Grass

535
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,190
and sent her to death.

536
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,130
I honestly can't tell

537
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,640
you are trying to protect her.

538
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,220
The weapon is in my hands.

539
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,120
Whether I use it,

540
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,900
when and how I use it,

541
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,910
it's none of your business.

542
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,240
Get the Governor to come out!

543
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,690
Bring Bai Shuo out!

544
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:05,580
[Bai Residence]

545
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,610
Calm down, everyone.

546
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,240
The Governor will definitely think of a solution.

547
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,900
The Governor's Mansion clearly has medicine.

548
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,880
Why wouldn't you share it with us?

549
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,630
Come out!

550
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,160
Come out!

551
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:17,940
What happened?

552
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,560
I don't know why, but suddenly word spread that

553
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,100
Lady Shuo could treat the maniac condition.

554
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,800
These people who were hiding at home

555
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,910
had all came to ask for the medicine.

556
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,600
There were also rumors that

557
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,050
that the Governor's Mansion is hoarding the medicine

558
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,260
and doesn't want to share it with the people.

559
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,150
Governor, please give us the medicine!

560
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:36,370
[Bai Residence]

561
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,720
What am I supposed to hear with all this noise?

562
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,440
Speak up and tell me one by one.

563
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,180
Governor!

564
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,410
Please give us the medicine

565
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,070
and save everyone!

566
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,700
Please save us!

567
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,960
Who did you all hear this from?

568
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,180
Everyone said so.

569
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,290
It's said that Lady Shuo found an effective remedy

570
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,640
and saved you, Governor.

571
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,470
They even asked us to come here and ask you for the medicine.

572
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,440
There are more and more people suffering from the maniac condition.

573
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,520
Please take pity on all of us

574
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,730
and give us the medicine.

575
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,330
Please give us the medicine, Governor!

576
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,980
The thing is, that medicine was something

577
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,470
my daughter stumbled upon.

578
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,190
There's really nothing left in the Governor's Mansion.

579
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,850
[Bai Residence]

580
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,350
Governor!

581
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,550
Please get Lady Shuo to come out

582
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:10,090
and treat all of us.

583
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:12,150
[Bai Residence]

584
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,590
Yes, Governor!

585
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,440
Everybody, please do not panic.

586
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,550
I will not leave this matter unresolved.

587
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,640
I ask that you trust me, Bai Xun.

588
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,830
Give me more time.

589
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,340
I will send people to look for the cure.

590
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,560
No matter how difficult it may be,

591
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,300
I will definitely give all of you an explanation.

592
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:28,380
Our Governor has been guarding the city for over 20 years.

593
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,130
He has always kept his word.

594
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,700
Everybody, there's no need to panic.

595
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,170
[Bai Residence]

596
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,310
More importantly, don't speculate.

597
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,110
Please trust me.

598
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,540
Please go home and wait.

599
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,800
Don't come out if there's nothing else.

600
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,620
It's best to avoid anyone with the maniac condition.

601
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,410
To solve this,

602
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,120
we must work together.

603
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,530
I, Bai Xun, promise

604
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:48,320
to keep all of you safe.

605
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,610
Exactly what's going on?

606
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,390
Governor!

607
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,360
Sir, bad news!

608
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,940
Lady Shuo suddenly fainted.

609
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,780
Bai Yu.

610
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:03,770
Calm down! Don't panic!

611
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,710
What's going on?

612
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,970
What happened to Shuo?

613
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,640
Just now,

614
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,110
I checked Lady Shuo's pulse.

615
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,350
There's a deficiency of both qi and blood.

616
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,870
According to my years of military experience,

617
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,290
I'm afraid it's caused by excessive bleeding.

618
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,830
Excessive bleeding?

619
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:23,190
Uncle Wang, how long has it been since you were with the military?

620
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,900
Your experience has long since been outdated.

621
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,090
I just didn't rest well last night.

622
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,540
Sir,

623
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,930
I'll take my leave.

624
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:48,130
Uncle Wang and I have been guarding Ning'an City for decades.

625
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,400
Given our battle-hardened experience,

626
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,450
he can't be wrong.

627
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,300
Tell me the truth.

628
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,800
How did you get that medicine?

629
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,920
How did you get so weak?

630
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,220
You still don't trust me.

631
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,140
It's not that I don't trust you.

632
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:04,660
It's just that the city is in chaos,

633
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:05,770
and people are panicking.

634
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,280
If we still can't find the medicine,

635
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,550
Ning'an City will be destroyed.

636
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,440
Who did it?

637
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,620
No one.

638
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,260
I accidentally hurt myself.

639
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,100
You call this an accident?

640
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,080
Shuo.

641
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,840
Can you tell me the truth?

642
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,020
I'm your father.

643
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,570
No matter how angry you are with me,

644
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,420
what can't you say

645
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,740
at this point?

646
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,830
Father, don't ask anymore.

647
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,370
There are some things that can't be solved

648
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,510
even if you are the governor.

649
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:36,880
Fine.

650
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,990
You wonâ€™t tell me?

651
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,180
Iâ€™ll ask Chong Zhao.

652
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,050
That kid is with you every day.

653
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,190
I want to see

654
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,580
who dares to

655
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:44,650
How dare you touch my daughter!

656
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,870
Father!

657
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,580
If Chong Zhao finds out about

658
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,060
the standoff between the Eternals and the demons,

659
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,880
he might simply destroy the Ghost Grass.

660
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,870
That way, I won't be able to continue the detox for my father.

661
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,190
I will tell you.

662
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,140
The Ghost Grass feeds on human blood.

663
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,720
It can suppress the maniac condition.

664
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,190
Consume one flower a day

665
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:14,340
without missing a single day.

666
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:26,130
â™«What kind of flower would never bear fruit?â™«

667
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,810
Sir, you mustn't!

668
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,220
This is the medicine to cure the maniac condition!

669
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,560
This is not medicine!

670
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,550
This is my daughter's life!

671
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:34,820
â™«What kind of fruit never sees a flower?â™«

672
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,920
As the governor,

673
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,440
I've failed to protect the city and instead caused chaos.

674
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,770
As a father,

675
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,920
I had caused my daughter to cut herself to feed this grass with blood,

676
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:45,440
â™«Withstanding the stillness, you are a broken piece of meâ™«

677
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,460
in order to cure my maniac condition.

678
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,500
Bai Yu.

679
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,780
This is not medicine.

680
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,770
This is Shuo's blood.

681
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:51,370
â™«I am the fruit to your flowersâ™«

682
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,770
What I am consuming every day

683
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,210
is my daughter's blood!

684
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,110
But Sir,

685
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,580
this grass is the only solution to the maniac condition now.

686
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,800
It has already bore fruit.

687
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,950
As long as we give its seeds to everyone

688
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:05,880
and plant it aplenty,

689
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,030
we'll be able to solve the maniac epidemic very soon.

690
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,160
If we need to water it with blood,

691
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,140
I am more than willing.

692
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,130
It won't work!

693
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,850
It won't work.

694
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,160
Governor.

695
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,210
How could this happen?

696
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,240
The Ghost Grass can only temporarily relieve symptoms,

697
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,120
but it cannot cure.

698
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,460
This is an endless abyss.

699
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,680
It's a life for a life.

700
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,540
Bai Yu.

701
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:37,960
You've been with me for more than ten years.

702
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,960
There's no kind of human nature you haven't seen.

703
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,720
You should know that once this grass is distributed,

704
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,640
it will cause bigger trouble

705
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:47,130
as long as someone becomes selfish.

706
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,190
By then,

707
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,460
it won't be chaos from the maniac condition,

708
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,330
but...

709
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:55,870
A massacre.

710
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,710
The vigor of youth often brings about arrogance.

711
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,890
I'll let you know very soon that

712
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,560
not everything

713
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,260
will always go your way.

714
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,150
A dragon without its tail,

715
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,790
no matter how it stirs the storm,

716
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,090
will never transform into a true dragon.

717
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,650
You?

718
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,610
What more can you do to upset me?

719
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,880
No hurry.

720
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,190
When the city is plunged into chaos

721
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,320
and conflicts unfold,

722
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,790
all that you desire and seek

723
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,990
will be in vain.

724
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,290
By then,

725
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,480
you'll know

726
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,900
what is means

727
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,130
to be upset.

728
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,600
The only thing you're trying to exploit

729
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,050
is Lanling Sect, isn't it?

730
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,290
Although those old men are annoying,

731
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,600
but they've been around for over a thousand years and are not fools.

732
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,180
How could they not see through

733
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,050
such a poorly conceived scheme?

734
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,280
Do you really think the Eternals

735
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,970
are the only ones I can exploit?

736
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,820
What else did you do?

737
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,170
The stage is ready.

738
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,110
You just need to

739
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,060
watch the show peacefully.

740
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,620
Since you are in the mood,

741
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,380
Iâ€™ll use your blood

742
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,230
and add some color to this stage.

743
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,510
Itâ€™s a mess outside.

744
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,070
You still have the mood for a barbecue?

745
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,230
Why not?

746
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,850
Can't I indulge myself

747
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,360
on my birthday?

748
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,520
Too many things have happened recently.

749
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,389
I can't believe I forgot about this big day.

750
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:44,659
Don't be sad, Father.

751
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:45,889
I've prepared a birthday present for you.

752
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:46,590
Let me go get it.

753
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,889
What gift?

754
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:49,880
Every penny you spent

755
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,230
came from me, isn't it?

756
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,800
Instead of spending money on those frivolous things,

757
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,699
you might as well sit down

758
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:55,120
and have a meal with me.

759
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:56,739
Where is Chong Zhao?

760
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,320
It's been days. Where did he go?

761
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,070
Maybe something happened at the steamed bun stall.

762
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,580
Who dares to buy steamed buns on the street now?

763
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,760
He better be okay.

764
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,050
I'll send someone to look for him.

765
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,640
Father.

766
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,020
He will be fine.

767
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,270
How would you know?

768
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,330
It's chaotic outside.

769
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,240
Other than steamed buns,

770
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,520
he can't even hold up a knife.

771
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,220
Anyway, just trust me.

772
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,230
Chong Zhao is fine.

773
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,790
Those people with maniac can't hurt him.

774
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:25,270
In a blink of an eye,

775
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,110
you've grown up.

776
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,200
You have your own secrets now.

777
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,230
Fine.

778
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,250
I'll trust you.

779
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,920
I wonâ€™t ask if you donâ€™t want to tell me.

780
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,730
Chong Zhao is a good kid.

781
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,500
I trust him too.

782
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,190
He promised me

783
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,370
he'll take good care of you.

784
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,510
I don't need him to take care of me.

785
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,510
Father, has it ever crossed your mind that

786
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:45,930
even if I don't get married,

787
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,960
I can still live a good life?

788
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,830
Nonsense!

789
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,040
You're just spouting nonsense.

790
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,230
Fine, fine.

791
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,300
It's your birthday,

792
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,110
so you call the shots.

793
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,310
I am not going to make you angry today.

794
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,180
I heard

795
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:03,040
there were people making trouble outside today.

796
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,240
What nonsense?

797
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,700
Why would our people be causing trouble?

798
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,480
They are just afraid,

799
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,940
so they came to ask about it.

800
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,730
On the other hand,

801
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,430
how did you get your hands on

802
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,900
that bizzare Ghost Grass?

803
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:15,400
Don't let the bad guys fool you.

804
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:18,450
The world is full of strange things.

805
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,850
That grass is nothing.

806
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:23,790
After all, I was saved by immortals when I was young.

807
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,490
How hard is it for me to find a grass?

808
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,670
You're being strange today.

809
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,410
I mentioned the immortals,

810
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,670
and yet you are not scolding me?

811
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,020
You want to be scolded?

812
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,670
Weren't you always annoyed by my ramblings about the immortals,

813
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,590
thinking I was a disgrace

814
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,060
and not letting me bring it up?

815
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,230
I can't even keep track of

816
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,960
the number of times you've punished me over this.

817
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:42,170
So,

818
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,070
is my dear father

819
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:43,670
changing his ways?

820
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:45,890
Shuo.

821
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,870
I know you've suffered a lot.

822
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,260
All these years,

823
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:54,230
the city's people have always laughed at you and mocked you.

824
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,080
I am all aware.

825
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,400
You never told me any of your grievances.

826
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:01,930
All you ever did

827
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,440
was hide under the tree your mother planted

828
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,940
and secretly cry at night.

829
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,340
You weren't willing to tell me

830
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,290
because I've never taken your side.

831
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,730
I've never said I trusted you and supported you.

832
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,510
Not only did I not help you

833
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,340
chase away those who mocked you,

834
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,680
I even helped them

835
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,520
shut you up.

836
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,440
Why are you talking about this

837
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,910
all of a sudden?

838
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,200
Shuo.

839
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,560
Let me tell you a story.

840
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,390
Once upon a time, there was

841
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,930
a governor who was blessed

842
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,470
to marry the woman he loved as his wife.

843
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,780
Three years into the marriage,

844
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,480
his wife gave birth to

845
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,110
two adorable daughters for him.

846
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,650
But unfortunately,

847
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:04,570
his wife passed away a few years later due to illness.

848
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,590
The governor was grief-stricken.

849
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:08,570
He swore

850
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,890
he would never marry again,

851
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:13,220
and will raise his two daughters safely and peacefully.

852
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:15,650
But ten years ago on Lantern Festival,

853
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,560
he actually lost both his daughters.

854
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,610
The governor led his soldiers

855
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,870
to search for them everywhere,

856
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:24,560
and almost turned Ning'an City upside down.

857
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,250
In the end,

858
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,330
he found his daughters in a messy mausoleum outside the city.

859
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,330
But at that time,

860
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:32,960
he also saw

861
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,190
an unforgettable phenomenon.

862
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,040
-Lady Xi!
-Xi!

863
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,670
-Lady Shuo!
-Shuo!

864
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,260
Lady Xi!

865
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:41,150
Lady Xi!

866
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,080
-Lady Xi!
-Shuo!

867
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:43,960
Lady Shuo!

868
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,550
-Xi!
-Lady Shuo!

869
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,920
-Lady Xi!
-Shuo!

870
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,350
Xi!

871
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,770
Xi! Shuo!

872
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,330
Shuo!

873
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,070
Shuo!

874
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,020
Xi!

875
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,810
Xi!

876
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:15,980
Sir.

877
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,130
Xi.

878
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:20,990
Tonight,

879
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,840
the girls simply got lost while playing in the city,

880
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,420
and that held them up from going home.

881
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,080
Nothing else

882
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,590
ever happened.

883
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,790
Understand?

884
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,840
Yes, Sir.

885
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:45,970
Father.

886
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,400
Shuo.

887
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,050
I saw that

888
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:00,600
purple moon.

889
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,800
I believe you.

890
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,410
I believe there are gods in this world.

891
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,040
Then why didn't you tell me all these years?

892
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,550
Because I'm the Governor.

893
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,190
The governor of the city must not only protect its people,

894
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,800
but also reassure its people.

895
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,400
Everyone in this city can talk about the supernatural

896
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,590
except for me.

897
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,800
In this life,

898
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,350
people seek gods and divination

899
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,370
just for peace of mind.

900
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,400
In the end, establishing oneself

901
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,860
requires personal effort.

902
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:31,620
â™«If the wind intends to fill the sky with flowersâ™«

903
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,200
If even I falter,

904
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:31,480
if I too start talking about supernatural forces,

905
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,190
then people will also feel anxious.

906
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:39,320
â™«The moon's brightness is also the result of stars falling into placeâ™«

907
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:37,210
So no matter how much I trusted you,

908
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,960
I could not be on your side.

909
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,590
I couldn't even say,

910
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:44,030
â™«As the wind stirs, the clouds gatherâ™«

911
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:44,730
"I trust you."

912
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,280
â™«As the clouds shift, the moon becomes fullâ™«

913
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:46,690
So why

914
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,550
are you telling me now?

915
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:55,050
â™«Love is the hardest thing to understandâ™«

916
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,080
Because I am going to do something.

917
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,150
Something you'll surely object to,

918
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,230
but I must do it anyway.

919
00:40:55,830 --> 00:41:01,300
â™«I'm finally back to where it all startedâ™«

920
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,220
I just wanted to tell you that

921
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,530
from beginning to end,

922
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:08,710
â™«All the answers are already explainedâ™«

923
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,570
I have always loved you,

924
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,830
and I trust you.

925
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:08,970
What are you trying to do?

926
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,930
Father,

927
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,120
let me tell you.

928
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,530
â™«I'll owe you all of my lifeâ™«

929
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,270
You must not do anything foolish that will upset me.

930
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,860
Or else, I won't forgive you.

931
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,360
â™«But we're destined to partâ™«

932
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,720
Shuo.

933
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:24,150
â™«How can I downplay this?â™«

934
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,550
Live well.

935
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,700
What happened just now?

936
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:27,970
â™«When you engrave your love into my heartâ™«

937
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,420
You...

938
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:31,510
â™«When my star falls only for youâ™«

939
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,170
â™«When the heavens fallâ™«

940
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:39,280
â™«I can still connect with you through the waning moonâ™«

941
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,880
You drugged me?

942
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,320
Go to sleep.

943
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,520
â™«When my pain blurs my eyesâ™«

944
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,560
When you wake up,

945
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,290
everything will be fine.

946
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,150
â™«Out of the countless stars, I see only youâ™«

947
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,580
Wang!

948
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:56,630
â™«As you turn into a falling star and crash into my heartâ™«

949
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,000
Sir.

950
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,070
Send Lady Shuo

951
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,410
out of the city immediately.

952
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:52,970
Sir.

953
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,760
Wang!

954
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,240
This city is my responsibility.

955
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,300
I will bear

956
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:58,630
any consequences.

957
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:00,770
Yes.

958
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,680
Father.

959
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,220
No.

960
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,120
[Bai Residence]

961
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,800
Come out! Come out!

962
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,210
Come out!

963
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:21,040
Calm down, everyone!

964
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,230
Our governor has been looking

965
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:25,940
[Bai Residence]

966
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,570
for a solution for everyone.

967
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:26,530
He's not the way you all think he is.

968
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,190
Save us! Screw you!

969
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,660
Step down!

970
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:34,960
Our governor has been trying his best

971
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,290
to come up with a solution for everybody.

972
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:38,850
Please give him more time.

973
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,200
I, Bai Yu,

974
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:41,690
thank you!

975
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,610
Bai Xun!

976
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,890
You scumbag!

977
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:56,990
Bai Xun!

978
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,240
Governor!

979
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,670
Sir, we can't hold the gate any longer.

980
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:13,840
The people outside...

981
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,130
Sir.

982
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:20,860
This...

983
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:23,740
Bai Yu.

984
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:27,800
Do you remember this sword?

985
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:29,820
Yes.

986
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:32,890
This is a gift from all the people in the city.

987
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:35,320
I remember that year,

988
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,180
Ning'an City was overrun with bandits.

989
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,480
I led you brothers

990
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,880
in six months of bloodshed

991
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,280
in order to wipe out the bandits.

992
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,560
The people found a piece of dark iron

993
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,500
and made this sword for me.

994
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:49,720
All these years,

995
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:52,600
I've always cherished it.

996
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,830
Bai Shuo, that child,

997
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:01,990
liked to play swords.

998
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:03,880
She would often sneak into my room

999
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,320
in the middle of the night to play with swords,

1000
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,710
and would get a beating from me.

1001
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:07,840
Because of this,

1002
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,700
we were at odds for a long time after that.

1003
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,920
Back then, Lady Shuo was still young.

1004
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:14,280
She didn't understand your intentions.

1005
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,320
She doesn't understand that

1006
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,190
the value of swords

1007
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:20,890
is not in its quality,

1008
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,310
but its heart.

1009
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,950
The people in the city

1010
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:27,530
had not only given me a sword,

1011
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:31,330
but also the safety of this city.

1012
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:34,300
Bai Yu.

1013
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:36,810
I've protected this city for twenty years.

1014
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,590
It's time I protect it again.
