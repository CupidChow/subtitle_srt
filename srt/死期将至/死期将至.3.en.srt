EPISODE 3
DEATH CAN'T TAKE ANYTHING AWAY.

2
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:58,058
He's worth two billion!

3
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,102
Two billion!

4
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:55,574
Get him!

5
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:18,407
Hey!

6
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,883
Come here!

7
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:43,015
That's right.

8
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,018
The worst I can do is die.

9
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,172
We've lost track of him.

10
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:55,337
Does he have nine lives?

11
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,256
What are you waiting for?

12
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,507
Go and get him!

13
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:09,685
<i>First floor.</i>

14
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:11,812
<i>Going down.</i>

15
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:20,154
That's it.

16
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:22,156
With luck like this,

17
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:24,783
I won't end up dying.

18
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,414
<i>First floor.</i>

19
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:14,750
<i>He must have genuinely loved her.</i>

20
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,219
I was worried that you wouldn't come.

21
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:27,679
I kept thinking

22
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,265
about what I should do if you didn't.

23
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,605
It's all over now.

24
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,276
But where's the money?

25
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,076
Over there.

26
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,078
In the boat with the lights.

27
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,121
Ju-hun.

28
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,442
Fuck!

29
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,324
That bitch!

30
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,219
That girl, Kim Eun-jae.

31
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,638
Why did she kill me?

32
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:56,643
Could Ju-hun have killed
one of her family members in the past?

33
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:57,978
Did she do it for revenge?

34
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:01,398
For someone so simple-minded,
you sure love to complicate things.

35
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,734
You killed yourself over money.

36
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,027
Likewise,

37
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:07,529
she killed you for the money.

38
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,032
Then,

39
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,911
did Lee Ju-hun
end up being killed by her as well?

40
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:14,870
Correct.

41
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,834
Did it never cross your mind,
even when you knew he was doomed?

42
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:22,836
But then again,

43
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,088
a fool like you was bound to die that way.

44
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:27,466
<i>You think I'm a fool?</i>

45
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:28,383
<i>You're wrong.</i>

46
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:31,136
<i>You won't believe the plans I've made.</i>

47
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,599
<i>Lee Ju-hun hid the money
in a location only accessible by boat,</i>

48
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,602
<i>and I'm the only one
who knows where it is.</i>

49
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,687
<i>I'll find that ten billion</i>

50
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:43,023
<i>and escape this prison
that you've put me in.</i>

51
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,401
<i>I'll be the one to have the last laugh.</i>

52
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:48,403
Is that a smile?

53
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,949
Let's see if you can
keep smiling like that.

54
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,033
What?

55
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,498
Damn it.

56
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:08,924
"1-2-0-1"?

57
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,304
What about my ten billion?

58
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,308
What the hell kind of situation is this?

59
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,317
This can't be.

60
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,653
When will I be let out?

61
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,155
Shut up!

62
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,414
How long am I in here for?

63
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,754
-What?
-Come out.

64
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,759
Am I being freed?

65
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,636
What the hell are you saying?

66
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,221
I'm taking you back to your cell.

67
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:57,848
Have you been dreaming?

68
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:04,354
Put your shoes on, you idiot!

69
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,400
What the hell was that for?

70
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:51,943
Come on.

71
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,412
<i>If I'm going back to my cell,</i>

72
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,956
<i>that would mean
there are other inmates there.</i>

73
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,584
<i>Damn it. I'm a little scared.</i>

74
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,216
Go inside.

75
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,104
You're back.

76
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,817
<i>I hope I'll get his memories soon.</i>

77
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,194
<i>What's taking so long?</i>

78
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,406
Welcome back.

79
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:42,786
Where am I supposed to sit?

80
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,204
What's wrong?

81
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,215
We didn't move anything.

82
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,717
What? Never mind.

83
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,012
By any chance,

84
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,974
do you know when I'm getting out of here?

85
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:07,185
How could you forget that?

86
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:09,146
We'll both be released in four days.

87
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,897
Four days?

88
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:12,607
<i>Bingo.</i>

89
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,445
You should control your temper
for the next four days.

90
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:20,157
What if that psychopathic murderer
ends up killing you?

91
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:22,117
What?

92
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,078
A psychopathic murderer
is going to kill me?

Lee Jin-sang.

95
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:39,736
You're back.

96
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,739
See?

97
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,159
You should've controlled your temper.

98
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,459
You bastard.

99
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,420
Are you out of your mind?

100
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,172
I don't know what's going on,

101
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,384
but I'm going to teach you a lesson,
you son of a bitch!

102
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,552
You bastard!

103
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,720
-Die!
-Calm down!

104
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:07,764
Let go of me!

105
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,641
Stop! You could end up in trouble.

106
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,935
What if he ends up killing you?

107
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,188
Wait.

108
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:16,940
You think he's going to kill me,

109
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:19,442
and not the other way around?

110
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,787
What's gotten into you all?

111
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:31,913
You...

112
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,709
You'll never leave this place alive.

113
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,502
What was that?

114
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,603
<i>My name is Cho Tae-sang.</i>

115
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:55,729
<i>I'm 21 years old.</i>

116
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:59,024
<i>I dreamed of being an MMA fighter
since childhood,</i>

117
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:02,777
<i>but I ended up giving up
due to my family's circumstances.</i>

118
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:05,030
Where's our money?

119
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,906
-Please, just a few more days.
-Are you kidding me?

120
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,325
Come on, lady.

121
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:11,870
Give me two more weeks.

122
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:14,372
-I'll pay you back then.
-Where's my money?

123
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,751
<i>Tae-sang. You needed money, right?</i>

124
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:18,918
This is your last chance.

125
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:20,920
You're dead
if you don't pay us back by then.

126
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,048
I'll pay you back after two weeks.

127
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:24,466
Yes.

128
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,925
<i>I'll text you an address.</i>

129
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:26,926
<i>Hurry over there.</i>

130
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:31,306
I'm that man's attorney.

131
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:38,396
If you take the fall
for his hit-and-run case,

132
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,773
I'll pay you 200 million won.

133
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,108
Since you're 18 and still a minor,

134
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,820
according to the law,
they'll have to release you on probation.

135
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:48,823
Okay.

136
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,667
Why aren't there any cops
at a police station?

137
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,093
Darn it.

138
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,896
-Who are you?
-I could ask the same thing.

139
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:22,982
Are you homeless?

140
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,027
I do feel that way sometimes.

141
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,657
So, which officer owes you money?

142
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,076
I'm here to turn myself in.

143
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:34,536
What?

144
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,913
I hit someone
with a stolen vehicle and ran.

145
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,249
And by the way, I'm still a minor.

146
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,751
<i>After turning myself in
with a false confession,</i>

147
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,170
<i>I was taken in for grand theft auto
and a hit-and-run.</i>

148
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:46,506
<i>I was going to pay back
the money my family owed</i>

149
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,925
{\an8}<i>and become an MMA fighter
with the money I was promised.</i>

150
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:50,552
<i>However...</i>

151
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,766
<i>the woman who was hit
ended up dying during the trial.</i>

152
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,686
I hereby sentence Cho Tae-sang
to two years of imprisonment.

153
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,104
<i>I ended up being charged
with manslaughter.</i>

154
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:04,065
What kind of bullshit law is this?

155
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,775
Where's Mr. Kim? Hey, you prick.

156
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,278
You said I wouldn't do any time,
you bastard!

157
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,655
-Mom!
<i>-I received a two-year sentence</i>

158
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:13,116
<i>and ended up saying goodbye to my dream</i>

159
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,285
<i>of becoming an MMA fighter forever.</i>

160
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,665
I specifically asked
to meet him in person.

161
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,502
Why would such an important man
come to a place like this?

162
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:26,755
I'd say he's more of a lowlife than I am.

163
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,007
-What did you say?
-And another thing.

164
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,259
"A place like this"?

165
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,721
He's the one who's supposed to be in here.

166
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:35,805
Be quiet.

167
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,975
You took the money, so we're done.

168
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,312
You seem to have the math all wrong.

169
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,772
I'm doing two years for manslaughter.

170
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:45,940
Don't you think I deserve more now?

171
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:49,861
Give me one billion.

172
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,571
Did you say a billion?

173
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,074
If you don't,

174
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:58,286
I'll find a lawyer and go to the police
the moment I get out.

175
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,704
Let's see.

176
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,373
So, the man who was driving drunk

177
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:05,710
killed someone in a hit-and-run.

178
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:08,296
And he even made a minor
serve time in his place.

179
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,048
God damn.

180
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,217
How many years will they give him?

181
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,846
Let's see what the law says
since you love it so much.

182
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,599
All this big talk about the law,

183
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,310
and you could end up dead.

184
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,898
If there's anything I learned in here,

185
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:29,609
it's how to survive.

186
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,331
How do you want to die?

187
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,960
What are you punks up to?

188
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,878
Get back to your positions.

189
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,507
Hurry up!

190
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,022
Hey, 1201.

191
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:30,879
That bastard...

192
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,884
-Here he comes.
-All of you, sit back up.

193
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,349
Come here, punk.

194
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,062
Seeing how he's so scrawny,

195
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,772
it can't have been assault, right?

196
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:50,690
You're right.

197
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,902
You look like a pervert.

198
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:55,653
Did you get caught taking upskirts?

199
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:58,448
It was murder.

200
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,622
People called me a psychopath.

201
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:08,541
I've always had
an impulse to kill someone.

202
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,544
So I gave it a go.

203
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,421
And trying it out...

204
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,594
made me have a lust for blood.

205
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,805
It made me want more.

206
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:32,023
Unfortunately, I ended up here
before I could satisfy it.

207
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,109
My life is ruined,
so I have nothing more to lose.

208
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:36,152
So why don't we...

209
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:39,530
try our best

210
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,075
to get along?

211
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,661
Unless you want to
become my next victim, that is.

212
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,251
How do you want to die?

213
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:10,561
I didn't know...

214
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,107
that you were such a good actor.

215
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,109
What?

216
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,778
-Jin-u.
-Yes, sir.

217
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,697
Keep watch,
and tell me if the guards come.

218
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:22,073
Yes, sir.

219
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:26,911
Listen up, everyone.

220
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,248
You're in for a beating
if any of you dare to stop me.

221
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,960
-Aren't you going to answer me?
-Yes, sir!

222
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:44,762
So you're a psychopathic killer?

223
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,098
That's right.

224
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:51,853
Why you...

225
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:53,688
Have you lost it?

226
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:57,650
You've been having it easy
by deceiving everyone.

227
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:04,157
I see that you haven't changed at all.

228
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,910
You motherfucker.

229
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,412
Do you want to die?

230
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:16,252
No.

231
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:19,338
I want to kill.

232
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:22,383
What?

233
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:24,886
Hit me back.

234
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,263
Come on.

235
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:30,892
Take a swing, why don't you?

236
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:33,269
Wait. I'm sorry.

237
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,689
Please forgive me. I'm begging you.

238
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:40,902
Forgive you for what?

239
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,654
For picking a fight with you.

240
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:47,992
No.

241
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,203
Wrong answer.

242
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,041
It's because you killed Kwon Hyeok-su.

243
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,961
What?

244
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:04,217
How do you know about Hyeok-su?

245
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,181
Listen up.

246
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:15,061
He's just a loser who was beaten up
by a kid he used to bully in high school.

247
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:17,105
He ended up being bullied afterward

248
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:19,774
and whined to the kid he used to bully,
only to be ignored.

249
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:22,693
So he snuck up to him from behind
and struck him with a brick.

250
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:24,362
And now what?

251
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,740
You're pretending
to be a psychopathic killer?

252
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,828
How did you know all that?

253
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,622
-Is that true?
-Did this bastard lie to us?

254
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,296
If you've taken someone's life,

255
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,881
you should learn to repent.

256
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,384
Don't weaponize it
to scare others, you bastard.

257
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:52,682
Don't let him fool you.

258
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:55,893
Unbelievable. How dare you lie to us?

259
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,020
You're dead. Get him!

260
00:23:58,104 --> 00:23:59,856
-Wait! Don't...
-Get him!

261
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:03,109
Stop. Don't do this.

262
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:06,779
Please stop!

263
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:23,713
What more did I expect from this place?

264
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,133
Jin-sang.

265
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:28,759
Yes?

266
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:30,094
Aren't you going to eat?

267
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:34,974
I'm fine.

268
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,894
Just eat when he asks
if you want some, dumbass.

269
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:39,145
What?

270
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,107
Eat the bones as well.

271
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:44,400
You're dead if you leave any.

272
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:27,026
Hey, aren't you going to say hi?

273
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,945
Are you glaring at me?

274
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:33,157
Stop.

275
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,618
-You're being too harsh.
-Hey.

276
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:36,577
Move.

277
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:40,206
You pretended to be a big shot
and looked down on me.

278
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,626
Now, you need to pay for what you did.

279
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:48,256
He needs to pay for what he did?

280
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:51,592
I can't believe I'm hearing that
in here of all places.

281
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,719
It's very convincing.

282
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:28,921
What the...

283
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,510
-Help me!
-Hold still!

284
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,137
I need some help over here!

285
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:40,224
We need help!

286
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:48,858
Don't go anywhere.

287
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,320
Is he going to be okay?

288
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:54,572
Worry about yourself.

289
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:11,005
What's this?

290
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:12,298
Someone asked us to make sure

291
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,258
that you don't get out of here alive.

292
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:18,220
Who asked you to do that?

293
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:21,182
I'm sure you know who the client is.

294
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:24,393
"Client"?

295
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,272
<i>It must be him.</i>

296
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,816
<i>Don't tell me I'm going to die here.</i>

297
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:32,943
Now, die!

298
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,196
You bastard!

299
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,822
Just give up!

300
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:39,784
Come here!

301
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:44,789
Hey!

302
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,133
You bastard!

303
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:02,681
Take this!

304
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:08,020
You son of a bitch!

305
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:36,465
This body is amazing.

306
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,342
He may be a convict,

307
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,678
but he's young and strong.

308
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:45,891
And he actually didn't do anything wrong.

309
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:49,145
Damn it.

310
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:52,648
What?

311
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:54,066
Is it over already?

312
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:09,498
Aren't you worried?

313
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:11,083
About what?

314
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:13,711
Whether we'll be given a second chance

315
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:16,380
once we're released from here.

316
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:18,883
I really can't tell.

317
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:23,846
Do you regret ending up in here?

318
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:25,890
Yes.

319
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:29,852
I regret it every day.

320
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,399
-What about you?
-What?

321
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:52,625
<i>At first, it felt so unfair.</i>

322
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,961
<i>But now, I regret being trapped
in a prison called death</i>

323
00:29:57,463 --> 00:30:00,007
after going out of the way
to ruin my own life.

324
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:06,764
It's too late now, though.

325
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:18,901
Now that I've seen what hell is like,

326
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:24,365
I've realized that being alive
in itself was a chance.

327
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:26,825
That's why...

328
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,998
I don't think it's too late for you yet.

329
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:34,959
Sorry?

330
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:30,639
It's ready.

331
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:40,107
You're such a sore loser, aren't you?

332
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:43,444
-I knew you'd be at it again.
-"Again"?

333
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,863
How many more years do you think
you'll get if you kill me now?

334
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:46,947
Have you given up everything?

335
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:48,240
It's already over for me

336
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:52,036
since the other inmates see me
as an easy target, you son of a bitch.

337
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,664
Even so,

338
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:57,458
your instinct is to kill again?

339
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:58,834
You scumbag!

340
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:05,799
<i>Should I just kill him myself?</i>

341
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:08,802
<i>No.</i>

342
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:12,014
<i>I need to get out of here
and find that ten billion.</i>

343
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,226
<i>But it pisses me off too much
just to leave him be.</i>

344
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:26,779
Hey.

345
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:29,239
Did it hurt when I slapped you?

346
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:32,785
Did it hurt more than
when Tae-seok slapped you?

347
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:38,290
What?

348
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:45,297
How do you know him?

349
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:51,178
Hyeok-su told me.
He's behind you right now.

350
00:32:59,228 --> 00:33:00,437
Didn't I tell you?

351
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,231
I see dead people.

352
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:04,191
My mom's a shaman.

353
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:05,734
Bullshit.

354
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:07,861
He doesn't believe me, Hyeok-su.

355
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:11,490
What? All right.

356
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:15,327
Hyeok-su tells me that he once poured...
What was that?

357
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:17,079
Right, noodles on your head.

358
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:19,957
How do you know that?

359
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:23,669
Hyeok-su wants to know...

360
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,465
Know what?

361
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,675
"Are you even sorry...

362
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,179
for what you did to me?"

363
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:37,766
That's what he said.

364
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,144
Why would I be?

365
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:44,523
I'm stuck in juvie,

366
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:48,402
and my life is ruined all because of him.

367
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:53,615
He says he knew you'd say that.

368
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:56,118
You piece of shit.

369
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:03,876
Hyeok-su says he'll haunt you forever,

370
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,253
until the day you die.

371
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,965
What's that?

372
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:29,026
<i>Jin-sang literally ended up</i>

373
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:30,944
<i>pissing his pants.</i>

374
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:36,784
<i>And the day of my release arrived.</i>

375
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:39,995
TAEGYEONG JUVENILE DETENTION CENTER

376
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:47,795
Jin-sang.

377
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:53,467
Hyeok-su said he's sorry he's late.

378
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,892
{\an8}STRAWBERRY MILK

379
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:04,394
If you plan on dying,
you better get my milk first.

380
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:06,772
Or I'll beat you to death myself.

381
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:17,074
<i>I really want to beat him to death myself,</i>

382
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,327
<i>but it would be more painful for him</i>

383
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:23,956
<i>to waste his youth away in here.</i>

384
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:32,714
<i>And he'll just have to carry on living</i>

385
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:36,718
<i>regretting how he ended up
ruining his life,</i>

386
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:38,512
<i>just like me.</i>

387
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,406
My baby!

388
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,783
-It was so tough in there.
-Are you okay?

389
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:00,993
-Let's go.
-Goodness.

390
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:05,747
This is good.

391
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:12,254
Cho Tae-sang.

392
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:15,674
Get in.

393
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:38,113
Open it.

394
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,990
No, I'm good.

395
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,325
What do you mean?

396
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:43,535
I don't need the money.

397
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:46,830
I'm going to live honestly from now on.

398
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,458
If you're considering confessing...

399
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:50,959
It's all in the past now.

400
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:52,628
I've done the time already.

401
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,838
It's too late now
to be blaming someone else.

402
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:56,798
What's more,

403
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:59,259
I don't want to accept black money.

404
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,429
I'll take what happened between us
to the grave,

405
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:04,514
so I hope we don't see each other anymore.

406
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:06,183
Goodbye.

407
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,967
But where's the money?

408
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:42,636
Over there.

409
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:46,139
In the boat with the lights.

410
00:37:46,223 --> 00:37:47,182
Ju-hun.

411
00:38:01,822 --> 00:38:04,074
That bitch.

412
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:50,662
I've finally found it.

413
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,465
To think this tiny thing
is worth hundreds of millions.

414
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:05,802
What should I do with all this money?

415
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,221
Get a house and a fancy car?

416
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:14,770
But wouldn't people be suspicious

417
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:17,856
if I bought all of that
when I just got out of juvie?

418
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:25,572
Depositing this cash in a bank
is also out of the question.

419
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:29,284
Do I need to keep holding onto it?

420
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,244
What a headache.

421
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,288
I'm still in trouble,
even with all this money.

422
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:37,667
I'll get some rest first.

423
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:34,266
Mom...

424
00:40:56,413 --> 00:41:00,041
MOM

425
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,169
Mom?

426
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:06,006
MOM

427
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,776
It's nothing. I should just ignore it.

428
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:29,279
I'll just...

429
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:41,625
MOM

430
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,923
Hello?

431
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,008
<i>Son?</i>

432
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:57,515
Well...

433
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,018
Yes, it's me.

434
00:42:01,228 --> 00:42:02,646
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

435
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:06,983
<i>You've been through so much because of me.</i>

436
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,072
<i>You're on your way home, right?</i>

437
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:21,831
Well, actually...

438
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:24,084
I can't wait to see you again,

439
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:26,461
my son.

440
00:42:48,942 --> 00:42:49,985
I am.

441
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:52,988
I'll be there soon, Mom.

442
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:58,595
Will this be enough?

443
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:02,265
If I carry on living as Cho Tae-sang,

444
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:05,185
she won't ever get to see her son again.

445
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:07,979
All right.

446
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:09,856
I'll give her some more.

447
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:13,735
STORAGE LOCKER

448
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,320
<i>Please select a locker.</i>

449
00:44:16,196 --> 00:44:17,947
<i>Please set a password.</i>

450
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:19,157
A password?

451
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,745
I'll make it my inmate number.

452
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:26,581
One, two, zero, one.

453
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:32,337
ITEMS WILL BE CONFISCATED
AFTER FOUR DAYS OF STORAGE

454
00:44:33,755 --> 00:44:35,298
I can use the locker
for four days at most.

455
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:41,221
Then I have until 9 p.m.
four days after today.

456
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,392
It should be fine
since I'll come back right away.

457
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:04,411
This must be the neighborhood
Cho Tae-sang used to live in.

458
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:33,982
Hello?

459
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,028
I'm almost there. Be there soon.

460
00:45:40,697 --> 00:45:41,739
Okay.

461
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:45,368
Hey, Cho Tae-sang.

462
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:19,110
Who are you?

463
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,530
Did those punks send you?

464
00:46:23,031 --> 00:46:23,990
What?

465
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:28,119
Fucking hell.

466
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:33,875
I've waited two years to kill you.

467
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:37,420
I've endured two hellish years
just thinking about killing you,

468
00:46:37,504 --> 00:46:39,756
but you don't even remember me?

469
00:46:41,508 --> 00:46:42,717
Even in her last moments,

470
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:45,261
my little girl didn't get to die in peace

471
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:47,931
because of the injustice of it all.

472
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:51,809
But all you got was two years
because you were still a minor!

473
00:47:01,778 --> 00:47:02,779
Su-yeon.

474
00:47:05,657 --> 00:47:07,158
Su-yeon...

475
00:47:10,954 --> 00:47:13,873
Let's go home, Su-yeon.

476
00:47:13,957 --> 00:47:16,000
Daddy's here to take you home.

477
00:47:16,084 --> 00:47:19,295
Do you have any last words
for the late Ms. Lee Su-yeon?

478
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:20,755
No.

479
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,007
How could you?

480
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:25,468
He killed my daughter!

481
00:47:25,552 --> 00:47:27,679
Your Honor!

482
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:31,266
He killed my daughter, Your Honor!

483
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,351
He killed my daughter!

484
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:35,770
Didn't you hear me? He killed my daughter!

485
00:47:36,271 --> 00:47:37,647
<i>You killed someone</i>

486
00:47:38,231 --> 00:47:40,567
<i>but only got two years
because you're a minor.</i>

487
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:43,403
What kind of bullshit law is this?

488
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:45,154
How is this real?

489
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:49,284
My daughter lived a kind and honest life,

490
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:53,413
and this country only gave you
two measly years for taking it from her.

491
00:47:54,831 --> 00:47:57,458
You can carry on with your life
after serving two years

492
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:59,085
since you're only 20 years old.

493
00:47:59,419 --> 00:48:01,045
But my daughter...

494
00:48:03,006 --> 00:48:05,174
Her life was cut short
at the age of 20 because of you!

495
00:48:08,011 --> 00:48:09,220
I'm sorry.

496
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:14,767
I'm terribly sorry.

497
00:48:17,145 --> 00:48:20,398
But I wasn't the one
who killed your daughter.

498
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,527
-What?
-It wasn't me,

499
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,447
but someone else.

500
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:29,115
What are you talking about?

501
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:31,993
What are you saying?

502
00:48:51,346 --> 00:48:53,222
Are you all right, Tae-sang?

503
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:55,850
Who did this to you?

504
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:00,813
You're not going to die, are you?

505
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:04,317
No. I should be fine.

506
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:06,027
I'll be fine.

507
00:49:07,904 --> 00:49:08,863
I'm so relieved.

508
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,157
You scared me.

509
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,078
I thought someone else got to you first.

510
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:19,457
What?

511
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,502
I should be the one to kill you.

512
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:25,880
Why are you doing this?

513
00:49:27,215 --> 00:49:28,633
We never had any beef.

514
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,177
That's right.

515
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:35,056
But that's only because I laid low
and tiptoed around you, you bastard.

516
00:49:37,517 --> 00:49:38,476
But still...

517
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,187
They said they were going to pay me!

518
00:49:43,773 --> 00:49:44,732
What?

519
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:47,110
What? Is it over already?

520
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:57,829
So you were with them.

521
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:01,165
How slow are you?

522
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:04,919
Didn't I tell you
that I regret ending up in juvie?

523
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:06,587
Fuck.

524
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:09,173
I never should've gotten caught.

525
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:11,509
I should've thoroughly covered my tracks.

526
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:13,052
I've always regretted it.

527
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:14,387
That's why

528
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:17,849
I came up with a perfect plan this time.

529
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:20,309
I'll...

530
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,687
I'll pay you the money instead.

531
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:24,814
As if you have any.

532
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,109
I do.

533
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,153
Hold on.

534
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:34,699
There's no fucking way you have any money.

535
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:36,325
Don't fuck around with me.

536
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:39,704
They promised me
100 million won if I kill you.

537
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:41,539
Just die, you bastard.

538
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:04,061
MOM

539
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:27,418
MOM

540
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:30,922
Mom.

541
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:21,597
Mom.

542
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:55,548
You never fall short of my expectations.

543
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:10,897
I could've avoided dying
if I didn't get stabbed by that man first.

544
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:14,817
I forgot about the dead girl's family
when it should have been obvious.

545
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:16,527
Of course you did.

546
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:19,405
You are a selfish brat
who fails to think about the sadness

547
00:53:20,156 --> 00:53:21,532
the bereaved have to go through.

548
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:24,702
Also, "It should have been obvious"?

549
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:26,829
He thought I'd killed his daughter.

550
00:53:27,622 --> 00:53:29,749
Of course, he'd want to kill me.

551
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:31,584
You sound so certain.

552
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:34,086
Then who would your mother want to kill?

553
00:53:36,339 --> 00:53:37,673
You must be forgetting

554
00:53:38,466 --> 00:53:39,926
that I killed myself.

555
00:53:40,009 --> 00:53:42,011
I wasn't killed by anyone.

556
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:43,679
Idiot.

557
00:53:45,056 --> 00:53:46,599
<i>Let's focus on my next life.</i>

558
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:48,267
<i>I need to retrieve that money.</i>

559
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:50,770
Hurry and shoot me.

560
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,481
Why are you in such a hurry?

561
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:56,359
<i>Hurry up and just shoot me! Come on!</i>

562
00:53:56,984 --> 00:53:59,111
Sure. Since you want it so badly.

563
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:16,629
<i>Just you wait and see, Death.</i>

564
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:20,591
<i>What's going on?</i>

565
00:54:20,675 --> 00:54:22,134
<i>Why can't I get up?</i>

566
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:24,428
<i>Excuse me.</i>

567
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,057
<i>Why can't I talk?</i>

568
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:31,686
<i>What's with this person? Hello?</i>

569
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:33,729
<i>What?</i>

570
00:54:35,231 --> 00:54:36,273
<i>What the...</i>

571
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:37,358
<i>Am I a baby?</i>

572
00:54:41,988 --> 00:54:43,698
<i>So that's what that smirk was for.</i>

573
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:46,033
<i>Then what about my ten billion won?</i>

574
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:47,910
<i>That damn bitch!</i>

575
00:55:05,261 --> 00:55:08,139
<i>My money! My ten billion won!</i>

576
00:55:46,177 --> 00:55:52,641
<i>Are you still standing there?</i>

577
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:58,773
<i>Are you afraid to turn back?</i>

578
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:06,238
<i>The face I somberly remembered</i>

579
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:09,075
<i>The person I'm grateful for</i>

580
00:56:10,076 --> 00:56:12,119
<i>The person I owe</i>

581
00:56:12,453 --> 00:56:19,460
<i>Although there's no miracle we hoped for</i>

582
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:26,592
<i>Nor the strength to get back on our feet</i>

583
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:33,307
<i>Listen to the voice that embraces you</i>

584
00:56:33,808 --> 00:56:40,648
<i>"I love you"</i>

585
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:46,070
<i>"I love you"</i>

586
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:13,013
<i>If you're still hesitating</i>

587
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:16,684
<i>I hope you find the courage</i>

588
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:21,689
<i>To stand up again</i>

589
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:27,862
<i>And overcome it</i>
