{\an8}EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES

2
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:38,205
Are you all right?

3
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:41,125
-Did you see that woman's body?
-Yes. It's unfortunate.

4
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,669
She was just standing there.

5
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:57,975
EPISODE 2
THE REASON YOU'RE GOING TO HELL

6
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,424
I'm going to make it!

7
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:39,183
How could he think of jumping
without a parachute?

8
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,684
He's so reckless.

9
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,145
And you jumped off the roof.

10
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,523
How are you any better?

11
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:49,985
Shall we move on to your next death?

12
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:51,070
Wait.

13
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:54,031
-Let's talk.
-About what?

14
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,076
You said I could survive,
but I died the moment I opened my eyes.

15
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,036
All these deaths are inevitable.

16
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:02,957
They're avoidable.

17
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:04,041
How?

18
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,709
That's for you to figure out.

19
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:07,127
What?

20
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:09,630
I died even after
I was given his abilities!

21
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,090
My head burst,

22
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:12,967
and my damned neck snapped!

23
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:15,845
I said this was a punishment.

24
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:17,888
It's natural that it's painful.

25
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:20,307
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:23,102
About what?

27
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:26,313
About referring to death as just a means.

28
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,275
It's too late.

29
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,945
Your sin is great enough
to even anger God.

30
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,156
What? What did I do?

31
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:40,619
-The fact that I killed myself?
-It's much bigger than that.

32
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:43,539
You'll need to find out what that sin is.

33
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,749
If you fail to figure it out,

34
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,253
you'll go to hell,
even after you've survived this.

35
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,559
But why did you kill yourself?

36
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:08,856
Because

37
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,483
all I could see was darkness...

38
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:16,238
whether my eyes were open or shut.

39
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,826
I was born into a poor family

40
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:23,120
and struggled to improve my life,

41
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,082
<i>but I still failed to get a job.</i>

42
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,045
<i>I even lost all the money I had...</i>

43
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,090
<i>and had to let go of the woman I loved.</i>

44
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:39,929
There wasn't any hope left in my life.

45
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:44,975
So you killed yourself
because your life felt hopeless?

46
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:46,852
Is that so wrong?

47
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:49,063
It's not like I did harm to anyone.

48
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,814
Think carefully

49
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:53,359
if you really didn't harm anyone.

50
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,152
I won't bother.

51
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,321
It's over for me already, so why should I?

52
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:58,906
So that you can regret it

53
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:00,866
and repent.

54
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,118
Will I go to heaven if I regret it now?

55
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,246
Will repenting
give me another chance at life?

56
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:07,998
I won't do it.

57
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,793
You really must not care
about anything but yourself.

58
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:14,129
What else should I care for
other than myself?

59
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,133
Then find a way to survive on your own.

60
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,094
And stop whining about it to me.

61
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,232
<i>What? This is a school.</i>

62
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,442
<i>Am I a teacher?</i>

63
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,361
<i>Or...</i>

64
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:44,702
<i>I need to find a mirror.</i>

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,292
Damn it.

66
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,669
<i>Is he a high schooler?</i>

67
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:55,337
<i>Or maybe he's in middle school.</i>

68
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,715
<i>But how does he end up dying?</i>

69
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,475
This punk always cracks me up.

70
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,858
<i>That bastard...</i>

71
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,819
<i>He's laughing while watching
a video of someone dying.</i>

72
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,697
How can someone be so stupid?

73
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,082
<i>My name is Kwon Hyeok-su.</i>

74
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,667
<i>I'm 17 years old.</i>

75
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:38,088
<i>After my dad passed away when I was five,</i>

76
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,632
-<i>my mom became the family's breadwinner.</i>
-Why are you still up?

77
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:44,011
<i>She worked tirelessly
day and night to support me.</i>

78
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:45,721
<i>Seeing her work so hard</i>

79
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,223
<i>made me think I should study harder,</i>

80
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:51,685
<i>but I hate going to school.</i>

81
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,441
Here's some milk to help you grow.

82
00:05:58,567 --> 00:05:59,985
You need it to grow tall.

83
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:07,785
You should have brought me my money.

84
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:09,870
Hey.

85
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,288
-Take a photo.
-Okay.

86
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,414
Look over this way.

87
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:13,832
Look into the camera.

88
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,709
Look over here, you idiot.

89
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,211
Why don't you smile a little?

90
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,505
You should smile.

91
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,799
I love you, son. I'll see you later.

92
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,427
<i>But I couldn't help but go to school.</i>

93
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,514
<i>If she were to find out
I was being bullied...</i>

94
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:29,473
Go on.

95
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,849
<i>...my existence would become</i>

96
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,393
<i>nothing but guilt that weighed her down.</i>

97
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,981
<i>I became confused
as my hellish school life continued.</i>

98
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,659
<i>Did school become hell
because my bullies are demons,</i>

99
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:52,871
<i>or did I end up falling into hell
because of something I had done?</i>

100
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:55,707
<i>Feeling that I couldn't
carry on living like this,</i>

101
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:56,875
<i>I made a big decision.</i>

102
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,168
If you bully me again,

103
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:00,754
I'm going to jump off the roof.

104
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,714
I mean it.

105
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,509
You idiot.

106
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,804
You think anyone will care if you die?

107
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:10,722
Lower your hand.

108
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,266
I said, lower it.

109
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:16,854
You pathetic moron.

110
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,692
If you plan on dying,
you better bring me my milk first.

111
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,694
Or I'll beat you to death myself.

112
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:32,494
<i>With that, I decided to end my life</i>

113
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,998
<i>and was on my way up to the roof.</i>

114
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,175
What a moron.

115
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:47,634
<i>It must be him.</i>

116
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,271
HE POURED HIS STRAWBERRY MILK
OVER MY HEAD AGAIN...

117
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,941
<i>So Hyeok-su must have
killed himself like me.</i>

118
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,528
<i>Damn it.</i>

119
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,281
<i>I can't believe I'm a high schooler
who's being bullied.</i>

120
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:13,535
<i>Wait.</i>

121
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:16,246
<i>Then that means I won't die
unless I kill myself.</i>

122
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,290
<i>I feel sorry for Hyeok-su,</i>

123
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,584
<i>but I just managed to avoid death.</i>

124
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,085
I don't have to go to hell.

125
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:30,677
What are you laughing about, idiot?

126
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,431
Didn't I tell you to get me
a strawberry milk?

127
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:39,144
If I get back from smoking
and the milk isn't on my desk,

128
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:41,230
you're dead meat.

129
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,566
Moron.

130
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,443
His head must be made of stone.

131
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:49,321
Hey!

132
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:54,826
What are you looking at?

133
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,496
You must be itching to die, insolent punk!

134
00:08:57,788 --> 00:08:59,623
-You son of a bitch.
-Have you lost it?

135
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:01,875
You pathetic loser.

136
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,128
You motherfucker.

137
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,134
-He's strong.
-You're dead, you useless punk.

138
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,346
If anyone tries to stop me, you're dead.

139
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,983
Bet you think you're hot shit.

140
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,321
But there are things
way worse than you in this world.

141
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:34,157
Don't mess with me from now on.

142
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:35,575
Got that?

143
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,997
Apologize.

144
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:42,916
Apologize!

145
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,336
Why should I, you prick?

146
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,681
What do you think you're doing?

147
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,349
What's it to you?

148
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,735
Just die!

149
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,032
Motherfucker.

150
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,368
What the hell's gotten into you?

151
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,796
You hit me while my guard was down,
you son of a bitch.

152
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,173
And with a fucking chair.

153
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,008
You fucking coward!

154
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:34,676
Am I wrong?

155
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,137
Am I wrong or not?

156
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,849
You're right.

157
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,601
Yes, that's right.

158
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,103
-That was a cheap shot.
-You assholes!

159
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:46,355
I'm the coward?

160
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:47,856
Me?

161
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,984
Then how is this any different?

162
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,821
You must have a death wish.

163
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,365
The teacher's coming!

164
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,453
Once school's out,

165
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:03,663
you're dead.

166
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,213
<i>Even in the wide and open countryside,</i>

167
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:14,841
he began to make time for himself.

168
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,635
-Now, what does it say...
-<i>Damn it.</i>

169
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,887
<i>It wouldn't matter if it was just him.</i>

170
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:22,599
<i>I can't do anything
if that big guy comes at me too.</i>

171
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,020
<i>No matter how young they are,
I can't overcome the size difference.</i>

172
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,607
<i>What should I do?</i>

173
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,819
Then find a way to survive on your own.

174
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:36,113
And stop whining about it to me.

175
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,490
<i>I have to find a way.</i>

176
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,786
YEONGWON HIGH SCHOOL

177
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,836
Jin-sang.

178
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:52,003
Let's stop now.

179
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:53,713
I think he got the message.

180
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,090
Let go of me!

181
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:57,426
Are you looking down on me too?

182
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:58,635
That's not it.

183
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,636
Come here.

184
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:01,680
Come on.

185
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,728
Let's get it together, Tae-seok.

186
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:09,813
All right?

187
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:11,481
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,191
Now go and hold him down.

189
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:15,777
Hold him down!

190
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:21,283
Hey, Jin-sang.

191
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,868
What are you doing?

192
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:25,203
Hey, Min-ji. Hi.

193
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:27,289
Hold on.
I need to teach this punk a lesson.

194
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,498
Stop it.

195
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,125
Fine. I'll go.

196
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,835
Watch your step. I'll see you out front.

197
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,597
<i>I survived thanks to that girl.</i>

198
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:47,642
<i>Could she have done that to save me?</i>

199
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,978
What are you looking at, moron?

200
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:53,690
<i>Right.</i>

201
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:57,360
<i>There's no such thing
as a kind-hearted bully.</i>

202
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,466
It feels so weird

203
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:22,302
to enter someone else's house
like it's mine.

204
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:27,599
It's so average.

205
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,769
I guess I'm not rich this time around.

206
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:42,906
<i>Hyeok-su was raised
by a single mother like me.</i>

207
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:55,293
HYEOK-SU, I'LL BE HOME LATE TODAY.
DON'T SKIP DINNER. I LOVE YOU.

208
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,139
<i>Yee-jae, there's stew in the fridge,</i>

209
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,516
<i>so heat it up for dinner.</i>

210
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:11,977
<i>I love you, son.</i>

211
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,367
My goodness.

212
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,829
What are you doing here?

213
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,247
Let me help.

214
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,999
There's no need for that.

215
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,417
Did you eat?

216
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,335
I'll eat with you
after I finish this quickly.

217
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:38,712
What?

218
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,631
Just go inside and have dinner. Go on.

219
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,427
<i>I was raised
by a single mother in poverty.</i>

220
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,470
<i>It was never my goal</i>

221
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:50,140
<i>to become rich.</i>

222
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:55,103
<i>My humble wish was
to get a job, get married,</i>

223
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:59,107
<i>and start a family like everyone else.</i>

224
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:02,027
<i>But to me,</i>

225
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,446
<i>such common things</i>

226
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,990
<i>were an unattainable goal.</i>

227
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,059
I made bulgogi, your favorite.

228
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,564
Why do you look so down?

229
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,399
Did something happen?

230
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:44,277
Not at all.

231
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,739
You're being so polite all of a sudden.
Is something up?

232
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,619
Nothing's up. Let's eat.

233
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:54,663
M...

234
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:56,915
Mom.

235
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,753
Sure. Dig in.

236
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,030
Yee-jae.

237
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,075
Eat as much as you like.

238
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,162
Mom...

239
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:43,795
It's fine.

240
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,264
Everything is fine, Yee-jae.

241
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:07,944
Hyeok-su.

242
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:09,988
Hyeok-su.

243
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,950
You zoned out for a minute.

244
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,120
It's nothing.

245
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,560
Mom...

246
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:45,899
LEE JIN-SANG

247
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,359
<i>You better bring me
50,000 won tomorrow, moron.</i>

248
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,447
This bastard...

249
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:57,368
Pull yourself together.

250
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,537
It's my current life
that I need to focus on.

251
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,799
<i>What's worse
than having to bring them money</i>

252
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,844
<i>is having to lie to Mom for that money.</i>

253
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,555
<i>It makes me hate myself</i>

254
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:19,724
<i>and makes me want to die.</i>

255
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:21,684
Jin-sang, that bastard.

256
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,906
<i>I have a feeling that I'm not the only one</i>

257
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,658
<i>who has a bone to pick with him.</i>

258
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:41,162
<i>Hyeok-su.</i>

259
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,499
<i>I'll make sure to pay that bastard back</i>

260
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,793
<i>for having driven you to your death.</i>

261
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:50,338
It depicted
the turmoil that swept the era.

262
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,382
He was so immersed

263
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,844
-that he read them four times.
<i>-First, I need to make him an ally.</i>

264
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,387
-The reverence...
-Sir.

265
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,057
-May I use the restroom?
-Sure thing.

266
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,853
<i>Taebaek Mountains</i> taught him

267
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:06,688
the beauty of the Jeolla dialect.

268
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,273
Reading the series four times...

269
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,450
Tae-seok.

270
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:21,202
Can you beat Jin-sang in a fight?

271
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,331
What the hell are you on about?

272
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:27,208
Have you lost it?

273
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:31,087
What I'm saying is I was beaten
by both you and Jin-sang recently.

274
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,965
And I noticed that you were
much stronger than Jin-sang.

275
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,426
Are you some expert
at getting beaten up now?

276
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:38,887
What a lunatic.

277
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,388
<i>Why you...</i>

278
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,390
<i>Should I try taunting him a little?</i>

279
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,809
I don't get why he's the boss around here.

280
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:46,728
I don't get why you're scared of him

281
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,229
and let him slap you around like that.

282
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:49,564
What?

283
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,274
Have you really gone nuts?

284
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,443
Who says I'm scared of him?

285
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:55,862
<i>He's still a teenager after all.</i>

286
00:19:57,989 --> 00:19:59,449
My point is,

287
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:02,368
why aren't you the boss
when you're much stronger?

288
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,125
Are you that curious
about why I let him slap me around?

289
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,793
Why he bosses me around?

290
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:12,712
Yes.

291
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,255
I'm just as annoyed

292
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:17,508
being bossed around by someone
even a loser like you can beat up.

293
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:18,801
But that's because...

294
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:28,811
What are you two doing in here?

295
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:35,902
I asked you a question.

296
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:37,987
I was just

297
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:39,948
putting him in his place.

298
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,533
He was getting out of line.

299
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:47,205
Is that so?

300
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:49,499
Well done.

301
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:52,710
-And Tae-seok.
-Yeah?

302
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,756
It hurts where I hit you, doesn't it?

303
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,883
Yes.

304
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:01,135
You should've known better.

305
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,931
Got it?

306
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:09,852
And you'll get the beating
you missed out on yesterday.

307
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:14,899
I think I have indigestion.

308
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:33,793
Hey.

309
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,758
You asked me
if I could beat him in a fight, right?

310
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,969
I could beat him with just one hand.

311
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,929
But I can't ever fight him one-on-one.

312
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:47,515
Do you know why?

313
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,351
Because his friend will come running

314
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:52,270
the moment I touch him.

315
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,857
A really strong one at that.

316
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,109
It's Seong-hyeop, a senior.

317
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,905
<i>He's the strongest in this whole area.</i>

318
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:04,490
<i>All Jin-sang did</i>

319
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:07,618
<i>was take taekwondo with him
in elementary school.</i>

320
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:09,620
Those sons of bitches...

321
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,330
You punks.

322
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:13,833
<i>And now he's the boss here
for being in Seong-hyeop's clique</i>

323
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:16,252
when he's just a wimp.

324
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:23,176
Cliques are the problem,

325
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,887
whether it's in school
or out in the world.

326
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,682
I need to come up with a plan.

327
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,477
Something that would work
on a high school kid.

328
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,024
The cafeteria food these days is amazing.

329
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:45,698
Are you enjoying the food?

330
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:48,618
You must be, seeing as
you dunked your whole face in it.

331
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,454
You're so gross.

332
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,331
Finish your food, moron.

333
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:56,959
Hey!

334
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:58,669
"Hey"?

335
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:05,885
Are you enjoying the food?

336
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:08,888
You must be, seeing as
you're practically showering in it.

337
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:10,431
Finish your food, then.

338
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:11,474
I'm off.

339
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,188
Damn it.

340
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:18,606
Fuck!

341
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,360
Tae-seok.

342
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:25,363
Go and grab that bastard.

343
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:30,910
Go fucking grab him!

344
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:34,288
I just got here.
I'll miss lunch if I chase after him now.

345
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,374
You should sit and eat too.

346
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,126
-What?
-Sit down.

347
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:40,336
Okay.

348
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:43,089
Have you lost your mind?

349
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,715
You might want to wash up.

350
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:51,806
And get changed too.

351
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,365
Damn it.

352
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,162
Are you sure
you'll be all right, Tae-seok?

353
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,080
I'm a little confused right now.

354
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:18,749
-Same here.
-What?

355
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:22,336
<i>You want to get rid of Jin-sang,
don't you?</i>

356
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:26,966
No matter what I do to Jin-sang,
don't get involved.

357
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:30,511
Then that senior won't ever mess with you.

358
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,769
He really did that?

359
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:40,855
Yes.

360
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:43,649
Can you please teach him a lesson?

361
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:48,613
I'm begging you, Seong-hyeop.

362
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:52,825
Sure.

363
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:55,411
Let's go.

364
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:22,355
What are you doing?

365
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:26,901
-Reading a webtoon.
-Are you insane?

366
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,986
Did you do all that without a plan?

367
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:32,114
-If anything happens to me...
-I do have a plan.

368
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:44,877
This is my plan.

369
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:45,878
What?

370
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,135
Hey.

371
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:56,347
Hey!

372
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,062
Did you pour noodles on Jin-sang?

373
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:04,188
No, I didn't.

374
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:05,940
It really wasn't me.

375
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:07,650
It wasn't?

376
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:09,735
No. It wasn't me.

377
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:14,448
Then who was it?

378
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,159
There.

379
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:19,996
It was him.

380
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,339
Hey, you.

381
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,306
Yes?

382
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:40,057
What is it?

383
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:45,396
What the hell?

384
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,189
He's a total nobody.

385
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,442
You're right. Damn it.

386
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,068
Unbelievable.

387
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,779
Did we come all the way here
to beat up a wimp like him?

388
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:55,114
This is embarrassing.

389
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,741
Jin-sang.

390
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,453
Jin-sang!

391
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:02,538
Yes?

392
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:03,873
You...

393
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,376
Did you ask for my help
because of this wimp?

394
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,003
Well, it's just...

395
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:12,340
He suddenly rushed at me.

396
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:14,091
Exactly!

397
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:16,594
Can't you handle
a wimp like him on your own?

398
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,429
Wait, but...

399
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:19,347
Never mind.

400
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,389
Let's go.

401
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:25,853
Where are you going, Seong-hyeop?

402
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:30,900
Don't go around
acting like we're close ever again.

403
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:39,742
Hold on.

404
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:41,118
Wait.

405
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:43,704
<i>Looking cool is the only thing
that matters to guys like that.</i>

406
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:48,084
<i>They can't help but throw away
whatever cramps their style.</i>

407
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:51,295
Hey.

408
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:53,381
You can talk to me now
if you've got something to say.

409
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:56,092
Your friend is gone now.

410
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:57,343
Wait a minute.

411
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,553
He's not your friend anymore.

412
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,014
You bastard.

413
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:05,601
Let go of me!

414
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:10,022
Damn it.

415
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:11,232
Does it hurt where I hit you?

416
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:13,776
You should've known better.

417
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,113
I told you, didn't I?

418
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:19,031
I can beat him with just one hand.

419
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,744
<i>I've definitely made it now.</i>

420
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:27,081
<i>Jin-sang, who used to be the boss here,</i>

421
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:29,125
<i>was dethroned in the blink of an eye.</i>

422
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:30,876
<i>And since that day,</i>

423
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,337
<i>nobody ever dared to bully me again.</i>

424
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,302
Damn it.

425
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:42,513
What was that?

426
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,150
What a moron.

427
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,277
He's a loner now that we've ditched him.

428
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,155
He's been such a prick.
No wonder he has no friends left.

429
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:02,032
Look, he's acting like he can't hear us.

430
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:03,367
I know he can hear me.

431
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:21,802
What are you looking at, moron?

432
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:42,573
I'll get myself into shape

433
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,284
and build some muscles too.

434
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,378
But when will I ever find a job

435
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:58,422
and save up money?

436
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:01,884
I'm worrying about money again.

437
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:12,436
It's all your fault.

438
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,522
Have you been drinking?

439
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:20,528
It's all your fault.

440
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:22,613
Sure.

441
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:25,282
It's all my fault
that you've ended up that way.

442
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:28,160
But do you know why I did that?

443
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,873
It was all because of you.

444
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:36,377
Do you get it?

445
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,004
Do you?

446
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:42,174
I doubt you do.

447
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,134
Moron.

448
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:50,933
What a moron.

449
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,560
What are you looking at, moron?

450
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:13,080
I can't believe how persistent he is.

451
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:44,570
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

452
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:46,155
I'm sorry.

453
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,123
Hey!

454
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:16,644
Die.

455
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:21,357
Die!

456
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,693
Die!

457
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:28,072
It's all your fault!

458
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:29,698
Die!

459
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:53,222
What happened?

460
00:32:58,102 --> 00:32:59,103
Damn it.

461
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:02,564
Don't tell me
that lunatic actually killed me.

462
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,566
All because his life got a little hard

463
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,694
when he bullied someone
to the point of death?

464
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:08,278
Isn't that what you humans do?

465
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:10,364
You care more about
the thorn in your own finger

466
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,325
than the knife inside someone else's body.

467
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,994
He was the one
who went around stabbing people!

468
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:18,539
How could he murder me over that

469
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:20,040
when he did far worse to others?

470
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:22,209
I should've given him
a stronger punishment.

471
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:25,170
I can't stand hearing that
from someone who's being punished.

472
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:26,797
Wait!

473
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:29,842
Was Hyeok-su really going to kill himself?

474
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,593
Did you pull some strings

475
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:34,138
since I figured that out
and managed to avoid death?

476
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:36,473
I'm right, aren't I?

477
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:38,767
I'm already destined to go to hell,

478
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:41,061
so why would you tell me
about all those rules?

479
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:43,856
You lied to me and gave me false hope.

480
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,858
I struggled so hard,
but it was all for nothing!

481
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,341
I never lie.

482
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:14,470
It may be fun to watch you struggle,

483
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:17,055
but I do not intervene
in the game you play.

484
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:19,433
There is no need for me
to resort to such things.

485
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:33,322
If you forget your manners again,

486
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:35,908
I will crush your face.

487
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:41,747
And if you ever kill yourself
while you're being punished,

488
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:45,042
you will come to face a pain
worse than hell itself.

489
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:46,919
Got that?

490
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:48,587
Yes.

491
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:50,798
Don't!

492
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:00,766
Just as you guessed,

493
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,352
Kwon Hyeok-su
was supposed to kill himself.

494
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:06,647
But the reason you died this way

495
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,398
had nothing to do with me

496
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:10,651
and was solely
due to the choices you made.

497
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:13,695
It can't be true.

498
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,239
Why not?

499
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:17,699
I died even after trying so hard.

500
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,285
I failed again.

501
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:24,248
I just don't know

502
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:26,875
what it is that I can do anymore.

503
00:35:27,251 --> 00:35:30,504
It's no fun for me
if you end up giving up so easily.

504
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:35,551
Then

505
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:40,013
why don't you put me in a body
that isn't so difficult to survive in?

506
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:41,932
That would be even less fun.

507
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:43,642
What?

508
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,602
Just wait.

509
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:47,479
The pain that death brings you

510
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,023
will only get worse from now on.

511
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:51,358
What?

512
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:02,077
<i>What's going on?</i>

513
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:05,122
<i>Why can't I see anything?</i>

514
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:08,584
<i>What is that noise?</i>

515
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:18,385
<i>Why can't I move?</i>

516
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,601
<i>Damn it. What's going on right now?</i>

517
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:36,236
Hold him.

518
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,036
Talk.

519
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:28,830
What?

520
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:34,002
About what?

521
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:35,754
Where's the girl and the money?

522
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,925
Just pluck it out.

523
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:48,433
Hold still.

524
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:50,978
I'll do a clean job
since we used to be friends.

525
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,897
It's going to be messy if you struggle.

526
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:58,819
I'll talk!

527
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:01,822
I'll tell you! I swear!

528
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,327
But...

529
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,749
can you give me a moment?

530
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,126
What for?

531
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,005
I don't remember everything just yet.

532
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:20,716
-I'll tell you once I remember.
-Do you think this is a joke?

533
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:21,800
Enough.

534
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:31,935
Let me help you

535
00:38:32,394 --> 00:38:33,645
refresh your memory.

536
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,752
<i>My name is Lee Ju-hun.</i>

537
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,128
<i>I'm 35 years old.</i>

538
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:00,881
<i>I'm what you call a fixer.</i>

539
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:04,009
<i>The gang I'm a part of
has clients all across the globe.</i>

540
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:06,970
<i>It's quite a big secret organization
in the criminal world.</i>

541
00:39:11,892 --> 00:39:14,352
<i>We fix our clients' problems
by any means necessary.</i>

542
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:16,480
<i>And that, of course...</i>

543
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:18,607
-What the hell?
-Get him!

544
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,983
Who are you?

545
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:28,200
<i>...includes murder.</i>

546
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:04,486
I no longer want to live in this hell.

547
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,698
Let's leave together.

548
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:12,869
<i>I stole ten billion
from my boss's secret slush fund</i>

549
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,038
<i>and stored it in a safe place.</i>

550
00:40:15,122 --> 00:40:18,375
<i>However, as I was on my way
to meet up with her,</i>

551
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:22,045
<i>my boss ended up catching up to me.</i>

552
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:37,894
You punk!

553
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:46,528
Come here!

554
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:47,696
That punk.

555
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:50,198
You bastard.

556
00:41:18,185 --> 00:41:19,227
Take this!

557
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,146
-I'll teach you...
-Son of a bitch!

558
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:22,522
-Damn it!
-What the hell?

559
00:41:22,606 --> 00:41:25,025
-Damn you!
-Show yourself!

560
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,444
Come here, you punk!

561
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:57,891
This guy sure leads a dramatic life.

562
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:09,736
But he could end up dead any moment.

563
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:17,744
Wait.

564
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:20,538
Why should I go on living as this man?

565
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:23,625
And if you ever kill yourself
while you're being punished,

566
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:27,629
you will come to face a pain
worse than hell itself.

567
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:35,262
Hold on.

568
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:37,347
He has ten billion...

569
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:39,140
<i>That's right.</i>

570
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:41,893
<i>I'll end up dead no matter what I do.</i>

571
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:45,855
<i>And if I end up surviving,
I'll end up poor and miserable.</i>

572
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:51,611
<i>Let's find the ten billion he's hidden</i>

573
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:54,864
<i>so that I can retrieve it,
even if I end up as someone else.</i>

574
00:42:55,532 --> 00:42:59,369
<i>That's how I'll escape
this game rigged by Death.</i>

575
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,208
With this man's abilities,

576
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:07,836
I might have

577
00:43:09,379 --> 00:43:10,463
a pretty good chance.

578
00:43:20,724 --> 00:43:21,766
It's ten billion.

579
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:23,935
I'll put my life on the line.

580
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:19,616
Hot damn.

581
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:22,410
He's really good at riding motorcycles.

582
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:47,560
We lost Lee Ju-hun.

583
00:44:47,644 --> 00:44:48,603
<i>What?</i>

584
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:50,313
CONNECTING

585
00:44:50,397 --> 00:44:53,149
We'll now begin hunting down
the dog that bit his master.

586
00:44:58,113 --> 00:44:59,572
I've uploaded Lee Ju-hun's coordinates.

587
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:01,783
Two billion?

588
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:06,788
Where are you going? Hey!

589
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:52,041
Lee Ju-hun,

590
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:55,128
I'll make sure you're dead
before the night is over.

591
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:09,225
NO TWO-WHEELED VEHICLES PAST THIS POINT

592
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,093
I'll catch you myself.

593
00:48:50,887 --> 00:48:57,352
<i>Are you still standing there?</i>

594
00:48:57,894 --> 00:49:03,274
<i>Are you afraid to turn back?</i>

595
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:10,823
<i>The face I somberly remembered</i>

596
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,493
<i>The person I'm grateful for</i>

597
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:16,663
<i>The person I owe</i>

598
00:49:17,038 --> 00:49:24,003
<i>Although there's no miracle we hoped for</i>

599
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:31,219
<i>Nor the strength to get back on our feet</i>

600
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:37,850
<i>Listen to the voice that embraces you</i>

601
00:49:38,393 --> 00:49:45,233
<i>"I love you"</i>

602
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:50,571
<i>"I love you"</i>

603
00:50:11,092 --> 00:50:17,348
<i>If you're still hesitating</i>

604
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:21,269
<i>I hope you find the courage</i>

605
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:26,107
<i>To stand up again</i>

606
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:32,280
<i>And overcome it</i>

607
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:46,961
