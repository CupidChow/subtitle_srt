1
00:00:38,442 --> 00:00:39,568
Who are you?

2
00:00:46,616 --> 00:00:48,076
You look like you've been wronged.

3
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,953
There's no point in explaining.

4
00:00:50,036 --> 00:00:51,621
No one believes me anyway.

5
00:00:51,705 --> 00:00:52,789
I do.

6
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,960
I know you're serving time
in Park Tae-u's place.

7
00:00:56,877 --> 00:00:57,919
You do?

8
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,631
I saw it myself.

9
00:01:02,215 --> 00:01:03,215
What?

10
00:01:04,843 --> 00:01:05,927
Do you remember this?

11
00:01:07,053 --> 00:01:10,098
It's the dashcam memory card
you threw in the gutter that night.

12
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:12,809
<i>So why don't you take the fall for this?</i>

13
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:15,311
Sir.

14
00:01:16,271 --> 00:01:17,271
Here.

15
00:01:18,982 --> 00:01:19,982
That's…

16
00:01:20,484 --> 00:01:23,320
This is the only thing
that can prove your innocence.

17
00:01:23,403 --> 00:01:24,446
That's right.

18
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:30,452
I'm so relieved.

19
00:01:30,535 --> 00:01:33,538
Thank you so much.

20
00:01:34,581 --> 00:01:35,581
Here.

21
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:38,126
Thank you.

22
00:01:40,337 --> 00:01:41,337
What?

23
00:01:46,551 --> 00:01:47,677
It's gone now.

24
00:01:52,724 --> 00:01:54,059
What have you done?

25
00:01:55,811 --> 00:01:57,604
Do you know what this means to me?

26
00:01:57,687 --> 00:01:59,272
This was my lifeline!

27
00:01:59,356 --> 00:02:02,150
For someone
who values his own life so much,

28
00:02:03,902 --> 00:02:06,112
you don't seem to care much
about the lives of others.

29
00:02:07,572 --> 00:02:08,615
How could you do this

30
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,326
when you're a detective?

31
00:02:12,285 --> 00:02:13,745
You should abide by the law!

32
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:15,288
"All this big talk about the law,

33
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,334
and you could end up dead."

34
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,420
- What?
- That was what you told me.

35
00:02:24,422 --> 00:02:25,422
Right?

36
00:02:25,757 --> 00:02:27,300
<i>All this big talk about the law,</i>

37
00:02:27,634 --> 00:02:28,927
and you could end up dead.

38
00:02:31,137 --> 00:02:33,557
But you look for the law
as soon as you're in hot water.

39
00:02:33,932 --> 00:02:35,976
Just keep rotting away in prison.

40
00:02:37,018 --> 00:02:38,645
And after your release,

41
00:02:39,688 --> 00:02:42,691
live out the rest of your life
as an ex-con with a murder record

42
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:45,735
and die

43
00:02:46,152 --> 00:02:47,362
in utter misery.

44
00:02:52,534 --> 00:02:53,535
Excuse me, Detective.

45
00:02:53,618 --> 00:02:55,078
Wait!

46
00:02:55,453 --> 00:02:56,621
Get back here, you bastard!

47
00:03:01,418 --> 00:03:02,544
Get back here!

48
00:03:08,383 --> 00:03:11,136
EPISODE 7
OPPORTUNITY

49
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:14,681
All the videos were confirmed to be true.

50
00:03:14,973 --> 00:03:17,726
We've requested
an arrest warrant for Park Tae-u

51
00:03:17,809 --> 00:03:20,049
for the charges of murder
and the concealment of corpses.

52
00:03:20,103 --> 00:03:22,188
<i>High-ranking government officials</i>

53
00:03:22,272 --> 00:03:24,792
<i>who aided in covering up
Park Tae-u's crimes have been arrested.</i>

54
00:03:24,858 --> 00:03:27,444
Park Tae-u hasn't regained consciousness

55
00:03:27,527 --> 00:03:29,529
after receiving another emergency surgery.

56
00:03:29,613 --> 00:03:31,281
He is said to be in critical condition.

57
00:03:31,364 --> 00:03:35,410
<i>Taekang's Chairman, Park Jin-seop,
has stepped down from his position,</i>

58
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:39,080
{\an8}<i>leaving Taekang in the hands
of professional managers.</i>

59
00:03:39,164 --> 00:03:42,417
{\an8}<i>While Park Tae-u's condition
post-surgery is still unknown,</i>

60
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:44,753
<i>the police announced
that they will question him</i>

61
00:03:44,836 --> 00:03:48,715
<i>about the driver who was stabbed to death
a month ago by a fountain pen</i>

62
00:03:48,798 --> 00:03:52,218
<i>as soon as he regains consciousness.</i>

63
00:04:18,787 --> 00:04:20,330
God kept you alive…

64
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,876
so you could experience hell on earth.

65
00:04:37,222 --> 00:04:40,141
You'll live the rest of your life
in a half-vegetative state.

66
00:04:51,903 --> 00:04:54,280
Killing, your favorite pastime,
is beyond you now.

67
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:57,200
You won't even be able to hurt a fly.

68
00:05:01,371 --> 00:05:02,747
It was fun talking to you.

69
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:04,081
I'll get going.

70
00:05:04,499 --> 00:05:05,750
Don't see me out.

71
00:05:44,873 --> 00:05:50,086
THE LATE LEE JI-SU

72
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,298
You…

73
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:58,136
held me back that night, didn't you?

74
00:06:03,475 --> 00:06:04,476
Ji-su…

75
00:06:50,897 --> 00:06:55,110
AUTHOR LEE JI-SU

76
00:06:58,071 --> 00:06:59,239
<i>I kept running</i>

77
00:06:59,823 --> 00:07:02,075
<i>until I ran out of breath
to get my revenge.</i>

78
00:07:03,618 --> 00:07:05,203
<i>All that was left for me</i>

79
00:07:06,162 --> 00:07:07,705
<i>was the fact</i>

80
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:09,999
<i>that I had to die again.</i>

81
00:07:19,676 --> 00:07:21,010
I've got it!

82
00:07:31,813 --> 00:07:32,813
Gil-su.

83
00:07:33,773 --> 00:07:35,358
You've gained a lot of weight.

84
00:07:35,441 --> 00:07:36,818
You bastard!

85
00:07:37,068 --> 00:07:38,068
Damn it.

86
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:42,240
Those bastards.

87
00:07:46,452 --> 00:07:47,662
Let me go, you bastard.

88
00:07:47,745 --> 00:07:50,290
<i>I carried on living as An Ji-hyeong,</i>

89
00:07:50,373 --> 00:07:53,042
<i>waiting for Death
to come knocking at any minute.</i>

90
00:07:53,793 --> 00:07:56,921
<i>I started to get used to
living as An Ji-hyeong,</i>

91
00:07:57,297 --> 00:08:00,008
<i>as if I had been him all along.</i>

92
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,509
- Great job, sir.
- You too.

93
00:08:21,946 --> 00:08:23,281
Any last words?

94
00:08:30,288 --> 00:08:31,414
I guess not.

95
00:08:42,926 --> 00:08:43,926
What about you?

96
00:08:43,968 --> 00:08:45,678
Any last words?

97
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,691
Are you all right?

98
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:20,338
How are you doing?

99
00:09:22,048 --> 00:09:23,258
It's just a scratch.

100
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:25,551
Thank you for saving me.

101
00:09:25,635 --> 00:09:27,220
Don't mention it. It was nothing.

102
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:29,179
Gosh.

103
00:09:29,931 --> 00:09:31,683
They'll worry when they see me here.

104
00:09:31,766 --> 00:09:32,767
Who will?

105
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,103
- Dad!
- Honey!

106
00:09:37,897 --> 00:09:40,858
Does it hurt a lot, Dad?

107
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:42,360
Honey.

108
00:09:42,694 --> 00:09:43,945
There you go again.

109
00:09:44,237 --> 00:09:45,154
Stop crying.

110
00:09:45,238 --> 00:09:46,572
Not while Seul-gi is here.

111
00:09:46,656 --> 00:09:47,824
Mom.

112
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:50,118
Don't cry.

113
00:09:50,368 --> 00:09:51,368
Honey.

114
00:09:55,415 --> 00:09:56,416
Seul-gi.

115
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,710
Want to go get some snacks?

116
00:09:59,085 --> 00:10:01,254
Who are you, mister?

117
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:02,462
Seul-gi.

118
00:10:03,464 --> 00:10:05,341
He's my friend from work.

119
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:07,093
You can call him Uncle.

120
00:10:08,428 --> 00:10:09,721
Uncle?

121
00:10:10,138 --> 00:10:11,180
Yes. Uncle.

122
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:22,984
Why aren't you eating?

123
00:10:24,193 --> 00:10:25,987
- Uncle.
- Yes?

124
00:10:26,863 --> 00:10:29,324
You're a police officer too.

125
00:10:29,407 --> 00:10:31,576
Do you also get hurt

126
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:33,369
every time you work?

127
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,958
Whenever my dad goes to work,

128
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:41,210
he always comes home hurt.

129
00:10:44,964 --> 00:10:46,591
To be honest,

130
00:10:46,674 --> 00:10:49,594
I worry about him
every time he goes to work.

131
00:10:50,386 --> 00:10:53,723
I wish my dad would stop getting hurt.

132
00:10:56,768 --> 00:10:57,768
Seul-gi.

133
00:10:59,562 --> 00:11:00,855
I'll do my best

134
00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:03,733
to make sure he doesn't get hurt
while working.

135
00:11:04,067 --> 00:11:05,109
Really?

136
00:11:05,568 --> 00:11:06,568
Yes.

137
00:11:06,736 --> 00:11:08,071
Pinky promise.

138
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:12,115
There.

139
00:11:26,964 --> 00:11:29,675
You should stop getting hurt as well.

140
00:11:45,775 --> 00:11:47,026
Thank you, Seul-gi.

141
00:11:50,363 --> 00:11:52,198
- Are you curious?
- Yes.

142
00:11:52,448 --> 00:11:54,033
Do you like what I got you?

143
00:11:58,246 --> 00:12:00,581
Mom! Dad!

144
00:12:01,207 --> 00:12:02,375
- You're back.
- Goodness.

145
00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:05,545
Are you all right now, Dad?

146
00:12:05,628 --> 00:12:06,671
I'm fine now.

147
00:12:06,754 --> 00:12:08,434
Let's visit a theme park
when Dad gets out.

148
00:12:08,506 --> 00:12:09,924
- I'd love that!
- Goodness.

149
00:12:13,344 --> 00:12:14,929
<i>If I hadn't died,</i>

150
00:12:16,347 --> 00:12:19,225
<i>would I have been able to
start a family of my own?</i>

151
00:12:48,087 --> 00:12:49,505
Fucking hell!

152
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:51,507
Why would you come all the way up here?

153
00:12:52,592 --> 00:12:55,303
Where else did you think it would lead?

154
00:12:57,054 --> 00:12:58,931
We know you have drugs,
so turn yourself in.

155
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:02,435
Drugs aren't the only thing I have.

156
00:13:04,645 --> 00:13:06,355
Die, you pigs!

157
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,908
That's what you get
for chasing me here, you bastards!

158
00:13:18,951 --> 00:13:20,786
Who wants to go first?

159
00:13:22,121 --> 00:13:23,206
Damn it.

160
00:13:27,293 --> 00:13:30,129
You should stop getting hurt as well.

161
00:13:34,217 --> 00:13:37,553
<i>I wish my dad would stop getting hurt.</i>

162
00:13:38,387 --> 00:13:39,514
- You're back.
- Goodness.

163
00:13:44,227 --> 00:13:46,145
I might have failed to save Ji-su…

164
00:13:48,564 --> 00:13:50,024
but not this time.

165
00:13:53,444 --> 00:13:54,987
I'll make sure that doesn't happen.

166
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,071
Put your hands up!

167
00:14:06,123 --> 00:14:07,123
Let me go!

168
00:14:08,543 --> 00:14:11,045
Can people stop shooting me for once?

169
00:14:14,006 --> 00:14:15,006
Ji-hyeong!

170
00:14:29,063 --> 00:14:31,023
Ji-hyeong!

171
00:15:07,476 --> 00:15:09,645
I thought I warned you.

172
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:11,772
Right.

173
00:15:12,315 --> 00:15:14,191
Are you upset that I killed myself?

174
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,069
I had a good reason to.

175
00:15:17,153 --> 00:15:18,153
Reason?

176
00:15:18,362 --> 00:15:20,656
It was to save Detective Woo Ji-hun.

177
00:15:21,574 --> 00:15:24,368
I did it to save someone else's life.

178
00:15:24,785 --> 00:15:25,785
And?

179
00:15:27,163 --> 00:15:28,247
What do you mean?

180
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:35,421
I sacrificed myself
to save someone else's life.

181
00:15:38,132 --> 00:15:39,634
- You?
- That's right.

182
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:43,429
And who are you, exactly?

183
00:15:45,014 --> 00:15:45,848
What?

184
00:15:45,931 --> 00:15:47,141
I asked who you were.

185
00:15:48,476 --> 00:15:49,894
What kind of a question is that?

186
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:02,114
You seem to be very proud of yourself.

187
00:16:03,824 --> 00:16:05,076
Why don't you leave for now?

188
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:14,084
What?

189
00:16:15,044 --> 00:16:16,337
Why am I so disheveled?

190
00:16:19,048 --> 00:16:20,091
Gosh, I stink.

191
00:16:21,842 --> 00:16:22,927
Am I a homeless man?

192
00:16:25,846 --> 00:16:29,100
Knowing my next form
must've been why Death was laughing.

193
00:16:34,188 --> 00:16:36,607
I've been through so much until now.

194
00:16:36,857 --> 00:16:38,234
This is nothing.

195
00:16:51,914 --> 00:16:53,624
<i>Do you remember Detective An Ji-hyeong,</i>

196
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,710
<i>the man who shed light on
the brutal crimes</i>

197
00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:58,379
<i>of Taekang's ex-CEO, Park Tae-u,</i>

198
00:16:58,462 --> 00:17:00,506

199
00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:02,299
<i>bringing them to justice?</i>

200
00:17:02,383 --> 00:17:03,426
Hey.

201
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:07,430
{\an8}<i>We have sad news that Detective An
died while he was out on duty.</i>

202

is currently being held</i>

203
00:17:10,975 --> 00:17:14,019
{\an8}<i>-at Taekang Hospital's funeral hall.</i>
- Gosh, he died.

204
00:17:14,353 --> 00:17:16,647
People like him
deserve to live long lives.

205
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:18,023
I know.

206
00:17:18,107 --> 00:17:20,443
<i>The chief of Seoul Metropolitan Police</i>

207
00:17:20,526 --> 00:17:22,153
<i>visited the funeral home this afternoon,</i>

208
00:17:22,236 --> 00:17:23,880
- I should pay a visit…
<i>- Awarding him a medal</i>

209
00:17:23,904 --> 00:17:25,114
<i>and a certificate of merit.</i>

210
00:17:25,197 --> 00:17:27,357
- To my own funeral.
<i>- He was also promoted posthumously.</i>

211
00:17:27,408 --> 00:17:29,243
<i>Detective An will be buried</i>

212
00:17:29,326 --> 00:17:31,620
<i>in the police section

213
00:17:31,996 --> 00:17:34,123
<i>With the passing
of Detective An Ji-hyeong,</i>

214
00:17:34,206 --> 00:17:36,709
<i>who showed us
that justice always prevails,</i>

215
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:40,546
<i>various groups are continuing

216
00:17:40,629 --> 00:17:42,214
<i>and express their condolences.</i>

217
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:45,217
<i>After it was revealed
that Detective An's father</i>

218
00:17:45,301 --> 00:17:48,345
<i>was also a policeman
who died on duty many years ago</i>

219
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:50,639
<i>while chasing a violent offender,</i>

220
00:17:50,723 --> 00:17:52,558
<i>many have expressed their deep respect</i>

221
00:17:52,641 --> 00:17:55,853
<i>for the service
of both the father and the son.</i>

222
00:17:56,437 --> 00:17:58,272
TAEKANG HOSPITAL FUNERAL HALL

223
00:18:13,454 --> 00:18:15,289
Wow, from an assemblyman?

224
00:18:16,165 --> 00:18:18,042
That's impressive.

225
00:18:20,753 --> 00:18:21,753
What?

226
00:18:22,546 --> 00:18:23,672
"Actor Song Ji-seop"?

227
00:18:25,132 --> 00:18:27,051
Man, I'm a huge fan of his.

228
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:44,860
Uncle.

229
00:18:46,946 --> 00:18:49,740
Are you really watching over us
from above?

230
00:18:51,325 --> 00:18:53,035
Thank you, Uncle.

231
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:57,581
You kept the promise you made me.

232
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,544
I miss you, Uncle.

233
00:19:11,887 --> 00:19:14,223
Hey, wait…

234
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:29,738
Mom.

235
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:35,870
Let's go.

236
00:19:37,955 --> 00:19:38,955
I just…

237
00:19:44,753 --> 00:19:46,630
He should've stuck to his old ways.

238
00:19:46,714 --> 00:19:48,591
Acting out of character
brought on early death.

239
00:19:50,092 --> 00:19:52,803
These past few months,
it was as if he was a different person.

240
00:19:53,554 --> 00:19:56,348
They say people suddenly change
when it's their time to go.

241
00:19:58,851 --> 00:19:59,852
Sir.

242
00:20:02,021 --> 00:20:03,439
Are you here for a free meal?

243
00:20:03,689 --> 00:20:05,733
What? No.

244
00:20:05,816 --> 00:20:07,860
- Then leave.
- What?

245
00:20:07,943 --> 00:20:10,029
- I said leave.
- I was just…

246
00:20:10,112 --> 00:20:11,739
I told you to get out!

247
00:20:11,822 --> 00:20:13,449
- Come on.
- Excuse me.

248
00:20:14,408 --> 00:20:15,743
Let him be.

249
00:20:16,035 --> 00:20:19,496
We should be grateful that one more person
wants to pay their condolences.

250
00:20:20,331 --> 00:20:21,373
Hold on.

251
00:20:27,504 --> 00:20:28,504
Here.

252
00:20:29,423 --> 00:20:30,423
Take this.

253
00:20:35,512 --> 00:20:36,639
Enjoy.

254
00:20:38,098 --> 00:20:39,183
Let's go for a smoke.

255
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,564
Hurry and get going.

256
00:21:03,832 --> 00:21:05,501
The prime minister is here!

257
00:21:14,218 --> 00:21:16,762
What did you think of the late detective?

258
00:21:24,311 --> 00:21:25,604
THE LATE AN JI-HYEONG, AGE 42

259
00:21:25,688 --> 00:21:27,314
<i>Due to my actions,</i>

260
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:30,609
<i>many people ended up
cherishing his memory.</i>

261
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:34,738
<i>But the deeds I accomplished
as An Ji-hyeong</i>

262
00:21:35,948 --> 00:21:40,160
<i>had nothing to do with me in the end.</i>

263
00:21:45,207 --> 00:21:50,796
WE WILL NEVER FORGET
THE PRECIOUS MEMORIES WE SHARED TOGETHER

264
00:22:01,056 --> 00:22:04,643
I won't ask you to sacrifice yourself
for your partner.

265
00:22:04,727 --> 00:22:07,396
But at the very least,
let's not embarrass ourselves.

266
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,230
Come on!

267
00:22:13,902 --> 00:22:15,029
It's all my fault.

268
00:22:19,825 --> 00:22:21,785
I'm sorry, Ji-hyeong.

269
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:35,883
It's not your fault.

270
00:22:37,509 --> 00:22:41,138
So you should stop blaming yourself.

271
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:48,312
I'm sure Detective An

272
00:22:49,605 --> 00:22:51,607
wouldn't feel that way.

273
00:22:53,901 --> 00:22:55,569
And I'm sure he feels glad

274
00:22:56,779 --> 00:22:58,739
that he was the one…

275
00:23:00,866 --> 00:23:03,410
to jump in that day.

276
00:23:06,246 --> 00:23:07,247
Who the hell are you?

277
00:23:08,832 --> 00:23:10,918
What gives you the right
to say such things?

278
00:23:12,127 --> 00:23:14,254
- What?
- Who do you think you are?

279
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:18,550
I…

280
00:23:19,593 --> 00:23:20,803
<i>And who are you, exactly?</i>

281
00:23:22,054 --> 00:23:23,263
I asked who you were.

282
00:23:43,325 --> 00:23:44,325
I'm…

283
00:24:05,597 --> 00:24:06,807
I don't know

284
00:24:08,183 --> 00:24:10,185
who I am anymore.

285
00:24:14,398 --> 00:24:15,398
What?

286
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:37,004
<i>People are happiest</i>

287
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:39,339
when they can truly be themselves.

288
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,091
In the end,

289
00:24:42,634 --> 00:24:44,011
life would be meaningless

290
00:24:45,012 --> 00:24:47,055
if you can never really be yourself.

291
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,018
Ji-su…

292
00:24:52,895 --> 00:24:54,771
<i>I finally came to understand</i>

293
00:24:55,522 --> 00:24:57,983
<i>that being reborn time and again
as different people</i>

294
00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:00,277
<i>was all pointless</i>

295
00:25:01,111 --> 00:25:02,529
<i>if I could no longer live</i>

296
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,823
<i>as my true self.</i>

297
00:25:12,664 --> 00:25:14,208
Can't we stop now?

298
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:16,585
I don't need any of this anymore.

299
00:26:07,469 --> 00:26:09,930
You must've had fun
watching me being proud of deeds

300
00:26:10,597 --> 00:26:11,723
that weren't even mine.

301
00:26:11,807 --> 00:26:14,810
Seeing how much more of a fool
you could make out of yourself

302
00:26:14,893 --> 00:26:16,395
was rather entertaining.

303
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:21,775
Did I even save Detective Woo Ji-hun?

304
00:26:22,025 --> 00:26:25,487
Was he actually destined to die there?

305
00:26:25,737 --> 00:26:27,114
I'm sure you now know…

306
00:26:29,241 --> 00:26:30,909
that none of that matters.

307
00:26:34,204 --> 00:26:35,372
Hurry up and shoot.

308
00:26:35,872 --> 00:26:38,709
I just need to die two more times
for this to end.

309
00:26:38,792 --> 00:26:41,295
Do you remember how I said
the pain of death would get worse

310
00:26:42,045 --> 00:26:43,045
with each round?

311
00:26:43,088 --> 00:26:44,965
What lies waiting for you at the end

312
00:26:45,507 --> 00:26:48,093
is pain beyond your wildest imagination.

313
00:26:48,427 --> 00:26:49,678
Whatever that is,

314
00:26:50,053 --> 00:26:52,055
I can just kill myself
and be done with it.

315
00:26:55,434 --> 00:26:56,685
You fool.

316
00:27:14,995 --> 00:27:16,538
<i>Who's this supposed to be?</i>

317
00:27:20,417 --> 00:27:21,626
<i>Who cares?</i>

318
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,631
<i>Let's just get it over with.</i>

319
00:27:48,612 --> 00:27:50,405
<i>This man was living the life</i>

320
00:27:50,947 --> 00:27:53,450
<i>that I wanted so badly before I died.</i>

321
00:27:54,785 --> 00:27:56,036
<i>He was employed,</i>

322
00:27:57,162 --> 00:27:58,330
<i>married,</i>

323
00:27:59,498 --> 00:28:00,874
<i>and had a family of his own.</i>

324
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:05,587
<i>He was living an ordinary life
that seemed so far from my reach.</i>

325
00:28:07,214 --> 00:28:10,384
<i>But it all ended so easily…</i>

<i>They were saying,
"You are no longer useful to us."</i>

334
00:28:51,925 --> 00:28:54,553
<i>The empty void left in his heart</i>

335
00:28:56,346 --> 00:28:57,514
<i>was desperately</i>

336
00:28:58,515 --> 00:29:00,225
<i>wishing for death.</i>

337
00:29:03,103 --> 00:29:04,312
<i>Just like…</i>

338
00:29:10,068 --> 00:29:11,194
<i>how I had felt then.</i>

339
00:29:18,577 --> 00:29:19,953
<i>Once again…</i>

340
00:29:21,872 --> 00:29:24,082
<i>I had to make a choice.</i>

341
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:28,503
Thanks, Ji-su.

342
00:29:28,879 --> 00:29:30,797
I'll call you after the interview is over.

343
00:29:30,881 --> 00:29:32,632
<i>Okay. You can do it!</i>

344
00:29:32,716 --> 00:29:33,716
Thanks.

345
00:29:43,727 --> 00:29:46,813
I need to get a job before I graduate.

346
00:29:47,147 --> 00:29:48,148
I can do this.

347
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:49,398
No.

348
00:29:51,151 --> 00:29:52,235
I have to do this.

349
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,473
Sir, are you all right?

350
00:30:21,806 --> 00:30:22,806
Sir!

351
00:30:24,392 --> 00:30:25,393
Are you all right?

352
00:30:25,477 --> 00:30:27,646
Sir. Are you okay?

353
00:30:33,235 --> 00:30:34,236
What do I do?

354
00:30:37,739 --> 00:30:38,657
Is this 911?

355
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,116
Someone's been hit by a car.

356
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:44,079
I'm at the intersection outside Taekang.

357
00:31:32,419 --> 00:31:36,047
Help me.

358
00:31:38,383 --> 00:31:41,886
Please help me.

359
00:31:45,223 --> 00:31:46,224
Please.

360
00:31:54,691 --> 00:31:56,776
<i>He looked up at me as if I were a god.</i>

361
00:31:58,111 --> 00:32:00,488
He was begging me with his eyes.

362
00:32:00,905 --> 00:32:02,365
To this very day…

363
00:32:05,035 --> 00:32:06,953
I remember how electrifying it was.

364
00:32:29,851 --> 00:32:31,061
Sir…

365
00:33:05,345 --> 00:33:06,513
Someone should call 911.

366
00:33:06,596 --> 00:33:07,722
My goodness.

367
00:33:38,837 --> 00:33:40,338
You truly are a lost cause.

368
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,593
Wasn't the thing you wanted most

369
00:33:46,594 --> 00:33:48,346
a chance to turn everything back?

370
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,181
What makes you so sure?

371
00:33:50,682 --> 00:33:52,559
Because all the humans I've punished

372
00:33:53,476 --> 00:33:55,854
ended up wanting the same thing.

373
00:33:59,566 --> 00:34:01,484
Humans don't recognize an opportunity

374
00:34:01,901 --> 00:34:03,820
even when it's handed to them.

375
00:34:04,988 --> 00:34:06,781
Didn't you claim you could beat me

376
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:10,285
playing by the rules I have created?

377
00:34:13,246 --> 00:34:14,831
We're down to the final shot.

378
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:28,636
Death is merely
a means of ending the pain I'm in.

379
00:34:39,939 --> 00:34:42,609
If I'm ending up in hell anyway,
let's not waste time.

380
00:34:43,943 --> 00:34:46,654
I'll end it quickly,
no matter whose body you put me in.

381
00:34:50,033 --> 00:34:51,785
I doubt you will.

382
00:34:51,868 --> 00:34:53,536
We'll have to see about that.

383
00:35:22,315 --> 00:35:23,441
<i>What?</i>

384
00:35:52,303 --> 00:35:53,388
Mom?

385
00:36:29,048 --> 00:36:35,305
<i>Are you still standing there?</i>

386
00:36:35,805 --> 00:36:41,436
<i>Are you afraid to turn back?</i>

387
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:48,902
<i>The face I somberly remembered</i>

388
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:51,404
<i>The person I'm grateful for</i>

389
00:36:52,655 --> 00:36:54,699
<i>The person I owe</i>

390
00:36:55,199 --> 00:37:02,165
<i>Although there's no miracle we hoped for</i>

391
00:37:02,415 --> 00:37:09,297
<i>Nor the strength to get back on our feet</i>

392
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:16,304
<i>Listen to the voice that embraces you</i>

393
00:37:16,387 --> 00:37:23,311
<i>"I love you"</i>

394
00:37:23,394 --> 00:37:28,983
<i>"I love you"</i>

395
00:37:49,212 --> 00:37:55,677
<i>If you're still hesitating</i>

396
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,222
<i>I hope you find the courage</i>

397
00:38:00,056 --> 00:38:04,143
<i>To stand up again</i>

398
00:38:04,227 --> 00:38:10,817
<i>And overcome it</i>

399
