THE MOST PAINFUL DEATH TO A MORTAL
IS ONE THAT IS FORESEEN

2
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:08,551
BACCHYLIDES

3
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:40,624
What did I ever do?

4
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:44,837
Why do I have to go there
when I haven't done anything wrong?

5
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,051
You are guilty of coming to find me

6
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:54,597
before I came to find you.

7
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,563
Damn it!

8
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,497
Wait.

9
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:41,143
<i>I wanted a clean death.</i>

10
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:43,479
<i>That was</i>

11
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,024
<i>the only thing I ever wanted.</i>

12
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,151
<i>To be able to do that,</i>

13
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:51,362
<i>I can't</i>

14
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:53,489
<i>let myself die like this.</i>

EPISODE 1
DEATH

16
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,044
<i>The train will depart soon.</i>

17
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,755
<i>Please step behind the safety line.</i>

18
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,177
7 YEARS AGO

19
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,609
Hey, Ji-su.

20
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:32,486
Are you there?

21
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,864
Not yet. I'm almost there.

22
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:38,576
I can't believe
how awesome my boyfriend is.

23
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:39,702
<i>What do you mean?</i>

24
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:40,828
You know what I mean.

25
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,414
You're a finalist at Taekang,
and you haven't even graduated yet.

26
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,000
It's not like they've hired me yet.

27
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,295
I'm so nervous.

28
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,796
<i>Don't worry.</i>

29
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,673
<i>If Taekang knows what they're doing,</i>

30
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:53,966
they'll definitely hire you.

31
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:57,261
Just show them your natural self.

32
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,804
That'll be more than enough.

33
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,514
Thanks, Ji-su.

34
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:02,892
I'll call you after the interview is over.

35
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:04,894
Okay. You can do it!

36
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:06,020
Thanks.

37
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:19,074
I need to get a job before I graduate.

38
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:20,409
I can do this.

39
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:21,493
No.

40
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:24,538
I have to do this.

41
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:50,189
Are you all right? Sir.

42
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:51,440
Are you okay?

43
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:31,230
{\an8}APPLICANT ID
NAME: CHOI YEE-JAE

44
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:35,526
Mr. Choi Yee-jae.

45
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:38,779
Mr. Choi Yee-jae?

46
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,365
Mr. Choi Yee-jae!

47
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,659
Yes, sir.

48
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:45,452
Why don't you answer this one?

49
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,665
I'm sorry, but I didn't hear the question.

50
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,585
Could you repeat the question
one more time?

51
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:55,713
Next.

52
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,798
-But...
-Mr. Jeong Jae-han, you may answer.

53
00:04:58,424 --> 00:04:59,883
An opportunity to work at Taekang...

54
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,386
<i>I was given a chance ahead of my peers,</i>

55
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,055
<i>but I blew it in the blink of an eye.</i>

56
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:09,059
<i>What I hadn't realized then</i>

57
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:13,397
<i>was that I'd spend the next seven years</i>

58
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,482
<i>hunting for a job.</i>

59
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,820
<i>Having failed to secure employment,</i>

60
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:23,490
<i>I started off with debt
due to my student loans.</i>

61
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,495
<i>And with COVID-19
sweeping the entire world,</i>

62
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,457
<i>it only became harder to find a job.</i>

63
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,791
Yes, sir.

64
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,668
I'm on my way.
It'll be about five minutes.

65
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:35,794
Sure. I'll be there soon.

66
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,714
I'm almost there, sir.

67
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,675
Why can't you find a job
when you're still so young?

68
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,843
There are plenty of jobs...

69
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,262
<i>While others gained more work experience,</i>

70
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:48,474
<i>I had to work part-time jobs
so that I could pay off my debt</i>

71
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:49,975
<i>and finally get a proper job.</i>

72
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,478
<i>Here's what I learned
while caught in this vicious cycle.</i>

73
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,605
-Did you call for a designated driver?
-There he is. Thanks.

74
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:56,523
-Good job today.
-Thank you, sir.

75
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,609
-Get going.
-Get home safely, sir.

76
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,861
-Have a safe trip home, sir.
-See you tomorrow.

77
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,447
<i>The most difficult thing to achieve...</i>

78
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,745
<i>I'm getting married.</i>

79
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,706
<i>...is an ordinary life</i>

80
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,291
<i>where you get a job and get married</i>

81
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,252
<i>just like everyone else.</i>

82
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,882
<i>While I stood in place,
unable to move forward,</i>

83
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,095
<i>and the days kept repeating,</i>

84
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:29,807
<i>what scared me the most
was my uncertain future.</i>

85
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,810
<i>While I wrote hundreds
and thousands of cover letters,</i>

86
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:36,063
<i>went to job interviews,
and repeatedly failed to get a job,</i>

87
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,774
<i>I consoled myself by saying
that everything would work out.</i>

88
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:44,404
<i>And after spending seven years like that,</i>

89
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:47,157
<i>I managed to become a finalist
at Taekang again.</i>

90
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,617
2023 TAEKANG NEW EMPLOYEE FINAL INTERVIEW

91
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,786
Mr. Choi Yee-jae,
you have a high TOEIC score

92
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,579
and even have an HSK,

93
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,248
but you've never once studied abroad.

94
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,333
That's right, sir. I haven't.

95
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,002
Experience is important
when it comes to language,

96
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:02,172
but all you ever did
was work part-time jobs.

97
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,466
He must've been really desperate

98
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,885
to have listed his part-time jobs
on his résumé.

99
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:11,223
The reason I listed
my part-time jobs on my résumé is...

100
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,058
I think I may know why.

101
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,778
You wanted to show us
your tenacity and persistence, didn't you?

102
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,322
Yes. That is correct.

103
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,536
You lost your father at a young age.

104
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:37,875
Yes. He passed away when I was five.

105
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:47,259
I think that explains
why you had to work so hard.

106
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,595
Even while continuing to work,

107
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,930
you managed to get
all these certificates and licenses.

108
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,849
You know how to work on yourself.

109
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:55,392
Mr. Choi Yee-jae.

110
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:58,270
You're admirable.

111
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:01,815
Thank you, sir.

112
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,534
INTERVIEW ROOM

113
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,543
Hey, Tae-sik.

114
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:24,504
<i>Hey, Yee-jae.
Did you invest in Hyeon-su's deal too?</i>

115
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,757
What? Why do you ask?

116
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:32,679
<i>He got involved in a scam
to manipulate the market,</i>

117
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,806
<i>lost all our money, and took off.</i>

118
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,225
Hyeon-su.

119
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,559
It's me, Yee-jae. Open up.

120
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:39,728
I know you're in there, Hyeon-su!

121
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:41,730
Open the damn door!

122
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:43,565
You bastard!

123
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:49,947
You bastard!

124
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,949
How could you do this to me?

125
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,368
Open the door right now!

126
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,370
Open up!

127
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:02,459
Please open the door.

128
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,878
Please.

129
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:13,345
Please.

130
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,692
You should've known better.

131
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,820
Destroying a door and screaming
would naturally get you reported.

132
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,571
I thought you were a crazy person.

133
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,073
How could I not go crazy?

134
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,783
I lost all the money I had.

135
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,494
Please catch him.

136
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:38,870
You said it was an investment.

137
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:40,956
Since the investment was made
with profit in mind,

138
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,916
you won't be able to sue him for fraud

139
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,167
just because there was a loss.

140
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:49,464
How does that make any sense?

141
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:51,133
That's just the law in Korea.

142
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,778
<i>There's this company
that'll be listed on the KOSDAQ next year.</i>

143
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,572
Invest in that company.

144
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,033
You're guaranteed to make money.

145
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:17,826
-But still...
-Dude.

146
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,494
How long will you keep living like this?

147
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,414
And aren't you going to marry Ji-su?

148
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:35,844
Damn it.

149
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,069
Ji-su.

150
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:54,905
Thanks.

151
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,742
-Take care.
-Okay. Bye.

152
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,288
-Drive safely.
-All right. See you.

153
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:27,562
Yee-jae.

154
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,481
What are you doing here?

155
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,149
I had business nearby.

156
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:37,322
Have you been drinking again?

157
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,243
What's wrong?

158
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,662
Am I not even allowed to drink
on a day like this?

159
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,455
What do you mean by "a day like this"?

160
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,207
A day where nothing goes right.

161
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,125
No.

162
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,130
Things never really worked out for me.

163
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,094
I'll get going then. Bye.

164
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:01,138
Wait.

165
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,185
I know you skipped
your part-time jobs this month

166
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,521
because of the job interviews.

167
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,659
Did you find a new boyfriend?

168
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,412
-No.
-Then what?

169
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,372
Were you on a blind date or something?

170
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:28,707
I told you that's not it.

171
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,791
Ji-su.

172
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,004
Should I just let you go now?

173
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:35,380
What?

174
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:40,010
I feel bad that you're wasting your time
on a loser like me.

175
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:44,556
It's too much pressure.

176
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,142
I've only ever been a burden to you.

177
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:50,187
Why don't you try to
work even harder instead?

178
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,981
How long are you going to keep this up?

179
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,107
"Work even harder"?

180
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,529
What do you think
I've been doing all this time?

181
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:02,949
No matter how hard I try,
nothing ever changes for me.

182
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,534
I'm sick and tired of this too.

183
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:08,163
Look at our relationship.

184
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,417
Are you really okay

185
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:15,545
with how things are?

186
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,221
Let's just end it here.

187
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,518
I've put you through so much.

188
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:32,979
Have a good life.

189
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:09,975
What's this?

190
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:12,269
Damn it.

191
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,278
<i>I'm keeping your deposit
to make up for the overdue rent.</i>

192
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,071
<i>A new tenant is moving in in two days,</i>

193
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,739
<i>so take your things by tomorrow.</i>

194
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:25,949
Seriously?

195
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,165
Damn it!

196
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:39,254
<i>The number you have reached...</i>

197
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,466
Damn it.

198
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:14,247
YOU HAVE FAILED
YOUR FINAL INTERVIEW WITH TAEKANG

199
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:15,999
THANK YOU FOR APPLYING

200
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,571
KYOHAK UNIVERSITY
NUMBER 1 EMPLOYMENT RATE!

201
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,323
"Number one employment rate."

202
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,163
I guess I won't be helping out
my alma mater with that.

203
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,924
Did Korea have the highest suicide rate
among all OECD countries?

204
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:50,510
Well...

205
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:54,180
I guess that's something
I can contribute to.

206
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,646
<i>Looking back,</i>

207
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,773
<i>the reason I'm standing here</i>

208
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,109
<i>is that man from seven years ago.</i>

209
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:10,321
<i>My life ended up this way
because of that bastard.</i>

210
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,784
<i>There's no further hope for me.</i>

211
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,912
<i>It's life that I'm afraid of.</i>

212
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,999
<i>I'm not afraid of death at all.</i>

213
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:27,422
<i>Death is merely
a means of ending the pain I'm in.</i>

214
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:33,887
<i>I refuse to struggle to survive anymore.</i>

215
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:48,443
MOM

216
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:52,864
<i>What's this?</i>

217
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,033
<i>Have I died?</i>

218
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,536
<i>Why is it so dark?</i>

219
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,665
<i>What's this over my eyes?</i>

220
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,253
<i>What's going on?</i>

221
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:08,338
<i>Am I on an airplane?</i>

222
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,260
<i>Do you travel to the afterlife on a plane?</i>

223
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:18,932
<i>I guess heaven really must be
someplace high up above.</i>

224
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:22,811
<i>What?</i>

225
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,234
Who is this?

226
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,404
This isn't my face.

227
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,090
"Death is merely

228
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:55,385
a means of ending the pain I'm in."

229
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,514
"I'm not afraid of death at all."

230
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,394
I enjoyed reading that, Choi Yee-jae.

231
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,857
How do you know my name?

232
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:10,567
You wrote this.

233
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:13,987
That's my will.

234
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:15,613
How did you get that?

235
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,326
You died.

236
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,203
I'm here as proof of that.

237
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:25,874
So you think I'm simply a means

238
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:28,459
for you to end the pain you're in?

239
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:29,502
What?

240
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:54,694
What happened?

241
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,302
Are we in hell?

242
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:20,929
No.

243
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,599
I brought you here
while you were on your way to hell

244
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,976
because I need to punish you.

245
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,229
Why?

246
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,774
Why should I be punished?

247
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,484
Because you sinned.

248
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,737
Since you have made a mockery of me,

249
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,781
your punishment won't be light.

250
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,116
Who are you to punish me?

251
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,118
I am the only being

252
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,704
that never dies.

253
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,459
"The only being

254
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,920
that never dies"?

255
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,117
What are you?

256
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:26,285
I am the thing you mocked.

257
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,123
Death.

258
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,126
Death?

259
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,046
You will be punished

260
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,632
for insulting me.

261
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:34,645
So?

262
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,024
What is this punishment?

263
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,735
God graced humans with a privilege.

264
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:44,030
And you will be stripped of that.

265
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,908
A God-given privilege?

266
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:48,785
What is that?

267
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,119
Humans

268
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:53,456
only have to die once in their long lives.

269
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,335
You call that a privilege?

270
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,672
I would love to see you say that

271
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:05,343
after you have received
your punishment in full.

272
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:10,264
You are now going to die 12 times.

273
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:16,354
Your soul will enter the bodies
of 12 people facing imminent death.

274
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:18,940
And you will end up dying

275
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:21,734
regardless of which body you wake up in.

276
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,737
Experience for yourself
how painful death can be.

277
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:31,244
But if you manage to avoid
the deaths they face,

278
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:33,913
you could carry on living.

279
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,040
"Carry on living"?

280
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:37,333
That's right.

281
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,002
If you avoid death in one of those bodies,

282
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:43,673
you will live the rest of your life
in that body.

283
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,142
But I don't want to live.

284
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:58,563
Life has been hell for me.

285
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,985
That's why I killed myself,
and you want me to live again?

286
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,240
I don't want to.

287
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,827
I'm already dead.

288
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:16,247
It's all over now.

289
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,209
Do you still think
death is the end of it all?

290
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:23,504
This is only the beginning.

291
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:28,885
I'd like to see you try

292
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:30,553
controlling death as you please,

293
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:33,306
just as you implied in your will.

294
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,576
Am I going to die now?

295
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:11,302
You will end up dying

296
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:13,804
regardless of which body you wake up in.

297
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:16,057
Damn it.

298
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,447
There's no need for that, sir.

299
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,367
The turbulence is only temporary.

300
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,285
-It will stop soon.
-No, it won't!

301
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,079
The plane will stabilize soon.

302
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:39,247
It's going to crash.

303
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,249
This plane is definitely going to crash!

304
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:45,253
Sir.

305
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,724
The seatbelt sign has turned off.

306
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:06,023
What?

307
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:11,946
I'm sorry. I get scared very easily.

308
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,241
You may take off your lifejacket.

309
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:16,158
I'll do it later.

310
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,327
Right. Okay, sir.

311
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:32,717
Did I survive?

312
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:56,657
What's all this?

313
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,071
What's that?

314
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:40,868
Am I the only one who can see this?

315
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,334
<i>My name is Park Jin-tae,
and I'm 33 years old.</i>

316
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,295
<i>I'm the second son of Taekang's CEO.</i>

317
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:54,548
<i>I grew up thinking that every family
had a pool and a garden</i>

318
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,386
<i>and that they all had
at least three private jets.</i>

319
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:00,388
-It's mine.
-Let go. It's mine.

320
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:03,057
<i>Even so, competition
has always been a part of my life</i>

321
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,517
<i>since the moment I was born.</i>

322
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:06,894
<i>It was always a race between two people.</i>

323
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:10,648
<i>I was competing against my older brother.</i>

324
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:12,650
<i>I always knew</i>

325
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,402
<i>-that the only person</i>
-Well done.

326
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,404
<i>I had to beat in life was my brother.</i>

327
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:20,241
<i>I just had to be smarter
and stand out more than him.</i>

328
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:23,411
<i>I just had to do things
better than he ever did.</i>

329
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:25,204
<i>Why don't you take over</i>

330
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,039
as the CEO of Taekang, Jin-tae?

331
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:29,667
<i>I was finally named Taekang's successor.</i>

332
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,709
Thank you, Father!

333
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:33,379
<i>I am now being trained
to become the new CEO.</i>

334
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:41,679
What just happened?

335
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:46,183
A lot of strange memories
flooded into my head.

336
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:56,569
Is this man...

337
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:00,406
the CEO of Taekang,

338
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,158
the company I desperately
tried to work for?

339
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:14,003
Does that mean

340
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:16,839
I can carry on living as him

341
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:18,966
with all of this in my possession?

342
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:39,862
Fine.

343
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:43,657
Since it's come to this,
I'll go on living.

344
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:48,496
It's not like I'll ever get
another chance to live like this.

345
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:51,332
This could actually be...

346
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:54,585
an opportunity.

347
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:32,748
No!

348
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:46,262
Sir!

349
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:47,763
Are you all right?

350
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,974
Over there! The engine's on fire!

351
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:16,709
Your hand! Give me your hand!

352
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:18,794
Grab my hand!

353
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:21,046
You're almost there! Come on!

354
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:04,923
I'm back.

355
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:06,842
Was it 12 times?

356
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,429
There's 11 to go now.

357
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,488
What is this place?

358
00:32:55,516 --> 00:32:57,935
How did it feel to die again?

359
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:03,399
It was bearable.

360
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:07,986
What's with those bullets?

361
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:11,782
The number of deaths you have left.

362
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:14,868
When I shoot one into your head,

363
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:16,787
it all starts again.

364
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:21,875
Doesn't a bullet to the head
usually kill the victim?

365
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,044
To me, death...

366
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:27,214
is the beginning.

367
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:31,844
What was that weird orb I saw earlier?

368
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,054
That orb transfers
the memories and abilities

369
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:38,016
of the body's original owner to you.

370
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,060
Their memories and abilities?

371
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:42,730
It's like a video game.

372
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:44,648
A video game?

373
00:33:46,275 --> 00:33:48,986
What happened to Park Jin-tae?

374
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,238
Don't tell me
I ended up stealing his body.

375
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,240
Since you likened this to a video game,

376
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,075
let me explain it to you in those terms.

377
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:57,077
<i>The original owner of the body</i>

378
00:33:57,161 --> 00:34:00,205
<i>played the game until the ending
without saving it once.</i>

379
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:01,665
<i>But you started that same game</i>

380
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,752
<i>from the save that was made
right before the ending.</i>

381
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,172
Depending on your efforts,

382
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,424
you may have a different ending.

383
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:13,635
It really is like a game.

384
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:19,850
Is it even possible for me
to reach an ending where I survive?

385
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,103
What could I have done to survive
on an exploding plane?

386
00:34:23,187 --> 00:34:24,897
That is for you to think about.

387
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,693
What comes next, then?

388
00:34:29,777 --> 00:34:30,861
"What comes next"?

389
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,113
What do you mean?

390
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:36,575
What if I fail to survive until the end?

391
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:46,168
Then you'll go to hell.

392
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:49,213
Hell? Why would I?

393
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:50,756
Consider it your lucky day.

394
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,928
Hell's right behind that door.

395
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:58,972
I'll give you a tour.

396
00:34:59,056 --> 00:34:59,973
What?

397
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:11,860
Wait, I...

398
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,260
What did I ever do?

399
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:22,556
Why do I have to go there
when I haven't done anything wrong?

400
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,604
You are guilty of coming to find me

401
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:32,482
before I came to find you.

402
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,325
Damn it!

403
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:48,290
Each day felt like hell while I was alive.

404
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,003
Now I have to go to hell even after I die.

405
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,548
Humans really are amazing.

406
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,968
They say their life is like hell,

407
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,012
but they bear with it

408
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:05,015
and carry on living
in their so-called hell.

409
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:08,060
What's your impression of the real hell?

410
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:11,813
Do you think you can
even last a minute in there?

411
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:23,700
I guess you'll have to survive, then.

412
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:26,078
What good will that do?

413
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,956
I'll just end up back in hell!

414
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:30,248
Who knows?

415
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,086
Depending on your actions

416
00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:37,047
after surviving in someone else's body...

417
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:41,218
you might avoid going to hell.

418
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:45,514
Is that possible?

419
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:48,475
Is that really possible?

420
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:49,893
Yes.

421
00:37:49,977 --> 00:37:52,104
At that point,
your judgment will be handled

422
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:54,231
by the softhearted God, not me.

423
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,775
<i>I can't end up in hell.</i>

424
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:58,694
<i>I have to survive.</i>

425
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:01,113
<i>That's right. This is an opportunity.</i>

426
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:03,949
<i>I need to grab onto it, no matter what.</i>

427
00:38:06,827 --> 00:38:10,372
But these aren't bonus rounds.

428
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:13,125
This is a punishment

429
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:16,044
that will teach you
how scary and painful death can be

430
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,714
before you go to hell.

431
00:38:19,256 --> 00:38:21,466
-But...
-Sure.

432
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,885
You may end up surviving.

433
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:26,179
-Do you mean it?
-Yes.

434
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,099
Then,

435
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,560
how about we start the second round?

436
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,145
Wait!

437
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,219
What? Why don't I have a parachute?

438
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:12,476
You said I could survive!

439
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:36,333
Help me!

440
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:38,585
Help me!

441
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:44,800
A PARACHUTE IS THE ONLY LIFELINE IN A FALL

442
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:55,894
<i>My name is Song Jae-seop.</i>

443
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:57,354
<i>I'm 38 years old.</i>

444
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,776
<i>Having been a fan
of extreme sports since my youth,</i>

445
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,238
<i>I've constantly lived a life of danger.</i>

446
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:10,033
<i>My challenges have secured me
a whopping four Guinness World Records.</i>

447
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:11,618
<i>The record I'm going for today</i>

448
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:14,371
<i>is diving without a parachute
from 8,000 m above ground</i>

449
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:17,249
<i>and landing right onto
a safety net installed below.</i>

450
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:21,837
<i>This never-before-seen challenge
is being aired live on national TV</i>

451
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:24,965
<i>with the help of my powerhouse sponsor.</i>

452
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:26,967
<i>It is also being live streamed globally</i>

453
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,718
<i>on my personal streaming platform.</i>

454
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:32,305
<i>If I am to succeed in today's challenge,</i>

455
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:35,433
<i>my sponsor will hand me
three billion in cash.</i>

456
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:42,774
<i>Why do I feel so confident?</i>

457
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:44,776
<i>I'm not scared anymore.</i>

458
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:46,695
<i>Three billion?</i>

459
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,489
<i>Fine. Let's give it a go.</i>

460
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:57,622
<i>I've managed to regain my balance.</i>

461
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:00,083
<i>Great.</i>

462
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,796
<i>I must've absorbed this man's abilities.</i>

463
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:13,013
Gosh, he almost gave me a heart attack.

464
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,058
The ratings have just reached 17%.

465
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:18,059
That's good.

466
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:19,936
Keep your eye on the ratings,

467
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,564
-and let me know if it rises any further.
-Yes, sir.

468
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:26,943
Everyone will get a paid vacation
if our ratings surpass 25%.

469
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:31,156
<i>Let's look for the net first.</i>

470
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:39,831
<i>Found it.</i>

471
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,501
<i>All right. Here I go!</i>

472
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:58,892
Let's go!

473
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:04,189
We're at 19%!

474
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:05,982
Great!

475
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:07,609
I think he's okay now.

476
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:11,613
We've reached 20%!

477
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:12,656
That's it.

478
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,449
<i>I'm almost there!</i>

479
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:16,826
<i>I'm going to succeed</i>

480
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,954
<i>and start over with my three billion!</i>

481
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:21,831
I'm going to make it!

482
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:56,908
We've reached 30%!

483
00:42:56,992 --> 00:43:00,578
<i>Yes! We're getting a paid vacation!</i>

484
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:39,576
<i>Are you still standing there?</i>

485
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:45,332
<i>Are you afraid to turn back?</i>

486
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:52,922
<i>The face I somberly remembered</i>

487
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,759
<i>The person I'm grateful for</i>

488
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:58,970
<i>The person I owe</i>

489
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:06,269
<i>Although there's no miracle we hoped for</i>

490
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:13,443
<i>Nor the strength to get back on our feet</i>

491
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:20,116
<i>Listen to the voice that embraces you</i>

492
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:27,540
<i>"I love you"</i>

493
00:44:27,624 --> 00:44:32,879
<i>"I love you"</i>

494
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:59,656
<i>If you're still hesitating</i>

495
00:44:59,948 --> 00:45:03,326
<i>I hope you find the courage</i>

496
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:08,415
<i>To stand up again</i>

497
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:14,587
<i>And overcome it</i>
