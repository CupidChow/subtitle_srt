1
00:00:16,386 --> 00:00:18,722
Since we've hit our goal,

2
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,975
I'll soon proceed
with the mission as pledged.

3
00:00:22,058 --> 00:00:23,310
WHAT'S UP FOR TODAY?

4
00:00:23,393 --> 00:00:24,603
FINALLY!

5
00:00:24,686 --> 00:00:27,355
I'll beat up Yu Gil-hak the murderer
live on this stream.

6
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,774
IS THAT REALLY YU GIL-HAK?

7
00:00:28,857 --> 00:00:30,066
HE'S COMPLETELY NUTS

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,443
I'M SURE THIS IS FAKE

9
00:00:31,526 --> 00:00:32,944
WHAT A LIAR

10
00:00:33,028 --> 00:00:34,196
Come on, everyone.

11
00:00:34,654 --> 00:00:37,073
Have I ever lied to you on a stream?

12
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:40,202
Be prepared to make donations.

13
00:00:40,285 --> 00:00:41,453
I'll see you soon.

14
00:00:42,662 --> 00:00:45,415
Have those idiots
been lied to all their lives?

15
00:00:45,499 --> 00:00:47,667
- Hey, get a thumbnail for the video ready.
- Okay.

16
00:00:51,296 --> 00:00:52,631
You're dead.

17
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,346
Who the hell are you bastards?

18
00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:03,349
Did that scare you?

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,644
How scared do you think your victims were

20
00:01:05,727 --> 00:01:08,104
as you sexually assaulted
and murdered them?

21
00:01:29,084 --> 00:01:30,084
Hey!

22
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,045
Let's get this stream started.

23
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:45,349
Who the hell are you?

24
00:01:51,147 --> 00:01:52,941
Do you want to die?

25
00:02:03,368 --> 00:02:04,368
Do I want to die?

26
00:02:08,248 --> 00:02:10,208
Do you even have the guts to kill me?

27
00:02:22,095 --> 00:02:23,638
Who are you?

28
00:02:24,472 --> 00:02:25,472
Me?

29
00:02:27,392 --> 00:02:30,729
Someone who isn't a nobody like you.

30
00:02:47,495 --> 00:02:48,580
Thank you.

31
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,875
But may I ask

32
00:02:53,335 --> 00:02:55,378
what you were doing there?

33
00:02:55,503 --> 00:02:57,714
I was looking for materials
for my next piece.

34
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:02,552
So you're a painter.

35
00:03:02,802 --> 00:03:03,802
I am.

36
00:03:06,181 --> 00:03:07,307
By any chance,

37
00:03:09,142 --> 00:03:10,435
do you know who I am?

38
00:03:13,647 --> 00:03:15,649
Yes, I do.

39
00:03:18,568 --> 00:03:19,569
Then why?

40
00:03:20,654 --> 00:03:21,821
Why did you save me?

41
00:03:24,157 --> 00:03:25,951
I don't like my materials

42
00:03:26,785 --> 00:03:28,286
getting damaged.

43
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:31,830
What?

44
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,212
We're here.

45
00:03:37,295 --> 00:03:38,588
That's my house over there.

46
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,800
No, it isn't.

47
00:03:43,843 --> 00:03:44,843
Mister.

48
00:03:48,014 --> 00:03:49,182
Why would you lie?

49
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
What?

50
00:03:52,644 --> 00:03:54,604
Who the hell are you?

51
00:04:40,525 --> 00:04:41,526
What's this?

52
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,028
Hey!

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,001
Are you up?

54
00:04:59,627 --> 00:05:00,627
What's going on?

55
00:05:02,088 --> 00:05:04,174
Are you trying to get back at me
for something I did?

56
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:06,593
You seem to be mistaken,

57
00:05:08,011 --> 00:05:09,596
but I just kill people.

58
00:05:12,724 --> 00:05:14,726
I'm killing you because that's what I do.

59
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,022
Who you are has nothing to do with this.

60
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:23,359
Do you get it?

61
00:05:24,486 --> 00:05:25,487
What?

62
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:32,744
Please spare me.

63
00:05:34,704 --> 00:05:35,914
Please don't.

64
00:05:36,414 --> 00:05:38,625
Don't!

65
00:06:12,492 --> 00:06:13,493
EPISODE 5

66
00:06:13,576 --> 00:06:17,247
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BREAK FREE
AND FIGHT AGAINST DEATH.

67
00:06:29,134 --> 00:06:31,052
I'll kill that bastard.

68
00:06:35,098 --> 00:06:36,224
But first…

69
00:06:50,738 --> 00:06:52,073
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

70
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:55,285
Try it for yourself.

71
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,740
What's going on?

72
00:07:33,823 --> 00:07:34,823
It's not working.

73
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:36,242
Is there a problem?

74
00:07:53,968 --> 00:07:55,136
What happened?

75
00:07:56,596 --> 00:07:58,723
Did you die and come back here?

76
00:07:58,806 --> 00:08:01,059
A simpleton like you
always ruins everything

77
00:08:01,142 --> 00:08:02,477
by overthinking it.

78
00:08:06,105 --> 00:08:08,733
Fire does not get burned.

79
00:08:09,234 --> 00:08:11,986
Water does not get wet.

80
00:08:13,112 --> 00:08:15,073
It's blatantly obvious, isn't it?

81
00:08:16,532 --> 00:08:17,575
Well then,

82
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,079
why don't you complete
this next sentence for me?

83
00:08:21,162 --> 00:08:22,288
Death…

84
00:08:23,248 --> 00:08:24,499
Does not die.

85
00:08:32,257 --> 00:08:34,050
You planned all of this, didn't you?

86
00:08:35,051 --> 00:08:37,428
- What do you mean?
- All the deaths related to Park Tae-u.

87
00:08:39,013 --> 00:08:40,013
And…

88
00:08:41,683 --> 00:08:42,809
Ji-su's death.

89
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:46,729
I saw you reading her book.

90
00:08:48,273 --> 00:08:49,983
Why did you have her die as well?

91
00:08:50,942 --> 00:08:53,778
This is just too cruel,
even if you're a god!

92
00:08:57,365 --> 00:08:58,366
Did you just laugh?

93
00:08:58,449 --> 00:08:59,909
I told you this before,

94
00:09:00,994 --> 00:09:02,578
but I'm not a god.

95
00:09:02,662 --> 00:09:05,915
I've simply taken on this form
to communicate with humans.

96
00:09:06,874 --> 00:09:08,835
I can change myself into anything I want.

97
00:09:18,469 --> 00:09:20,138
Do you like what you see?

98
00:09:20,471 --> 00:09:21,848
Is that your true form?

99
00:09:22,515 --> 00:09:23,558
No.

100
00:09:38,197 --> 00:09:39,198
Yee-jae.

101
00:09:45,288 --> 00:09:46,331
Ji-su.

102
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,343
Stop it.

103
00:10:04,057 --> 00:10:06,142
You were just glaring and yelling at me.

104
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:08,144
Why turn away now?

105
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,772
Please stop.

106
00:10:10,855 --> 00:10:11,856
What's wrong?

107
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,609
Do you feel guilty for this woman's death?

108
00:10:20,365 --> 00:10:23,242
All I did was read the writing
of a woman doomed to die soon.

109
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,829
I checked to see
whether she deserved to be punished,

110
00:10:26,913 --> 00:10:27,914
just like you.

111
00:10:28,581 --> 00:10:29,581
Then,

112
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:32,377
am I to blame for Ji-su's...

113
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,421
She was destined to die there
at that hour.

114
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:39,675
She just ended up getting to know
the person she was to die with.

115
00:10:40,343 --> 00:10:41,511
That's all that changed.

116
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,598
Are you saying that Ji-su was destined
to be killed by Park Tae-u?

117
00:10:49,185 --> 00:10:50,478
Why would he, though?

118
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,860
Now,

119
00:10:58,903 --> 00:11:00,905
shall we start
the second half of our game?

120
00:11:02,782 --> 00:11:03,782
Sure.

121
00:11:04,534 --> 00:11:05,535
That's what I wanted.

122
00:11:05,618 --> 00:11:07,995
- Do you still wish for a quick death?
- No.

123
00:11:08,746 --> 00:11:10,832
I can't wait to kill that son of a bitch.

124
00:11:10,915 --> 00:11:12,083
Didn't I tell you

125
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,168
that I would intervene

126
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:16,921
if you tried to take someone's life?

127
00:11:17,004 --> 00:11:19,757
Sure. I'd love to see you try.

128
00:11:20,216 --> 00:11:22,051
Do you think you can break my rules

129
00:11:22,635 --> 00:11:24,512
and beat me at my own game?

130
00:11:24,595 --> 00:11:27,890
Humans sometimes
have to fight the losing battle.

131
00:11:27,974 --> 00:11:31,144
Humans never listen,
no matter how much you warn them.

132
00:11:32,061 --> 00:11:33,312
What a bunch of idiots.

133
00:11:40,194 --> 00:11:42,363
I can't waste a precious bullet.

134
00:11:42,697 --> 00:11:44,740
All of this is suffering
that you must experience.

135
00:12:10,808 --> 00:12:12,977
<i>What's all this blood?</i>

136
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,480
<i>Am I bleeding right now?</i>

137
00:12:18,816 --> 00:12:20,902
<i>Who is this man supposed to be?</i>

138
00:12:37,543 --> 00:12:40,004
Is someone there?

139
00:13:12,995 --> 00:13:14,205
Jeez. That startled me.

140
00:13:44,277 --> 00:13:45,570
What's this guy's deal?

141
00:14:16,183 --> 00:14:17,183
No way.

142
00:14:19,228 --> 00:14:20,813
Is all of this blood?

143
00:14:31,324 --> 00:14:32,658
That's disgusting.

144
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:37,872
<i>My name is Jeong Gyu-cheol.</i>

145
00:14:38,497 --> 00:14:39,707
<i>I'm 34 years old.</i>

146
00:14:42,752 --> 00:14:45,421
<i>I was born into an ordinary family,</i>

147
00:14:45,504 --> 00:14:48,966
<i>but I realized at an early age
that I was born with a special gift.</i>

148
00:14:49,592 --> 00:14:54,430
YOUNG ARTISTS AWARDS CEREMONY

149
00:14:57,642 --> 00:15:00,019
GRAND PRIZE

150
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,104
<i>But the world</i>

151
00:15:02,813 --> 00:15:04,607
<i>failed to recognize my gift.</i>

152
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:50,736
<i>Then one day,</i>

153
00:15:51,654 --> 00:15:54,365
<i>I happened to come across
an electrifying sight</i>

154
00:15:56,283 --> 00:15:57,910
<i>that filled me with inspiration.</i>

155
00:16:06,168 --> 00:16:07,837
<i>I painted what I saw that day,</i>

156
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,425
<i>and it ended up
selling at a high price overseas</i>

157
00:16:13,175 --> 00:16:16,887
<i>with critical acclaim,
saying that it captured human depravity.</i>

158
00:16:18,013 --> 00:16:19,682
<i>After that,</i>

159
00:16:19,765 --> 00:16:21,684
<i>I became serious about my art.</i>

160
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:49,211
Severed body parts were found
in Sangwon Lake Park.

161
00:16:49,295 --> 00:16:51,714
<i>The prints taken from
the limbs that were recovered</i>

162
00:16:51,797 --> 00:16:54,300
revealed that the victim
was reported missing a week ago…

163
00:16:54,383 --> 00:16:56,719
Seven dismembered bodies were found

164
00:16:56,802 --> 00:16:58,637
on a hill in Pyeongjae-dong.

165
00:16:58,763 --> 00:17:00,598
<i>The police found that the mutilations…</i>

166
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:02,433
These are Mr. Jeong Gyu-cheol's paintings.

167
00:17:02,516 --> 00:17:03,809
The starting bid is 120 million…

168
00:17:03,893 --> 00:17:05,186
130 million. 140 million.

169
00:17:05,269 --> 00:17:09,732
<i>This case is also presumed to be linked
to the serial killer at large.</i>

170
00:17:09,982 --> 00:17:12,860
We'll now begin the bidding
for the second painting, <i>Scratch.</i>

171
00:17:12,943 --> 00:17:14,195
120 million. 170 million.

172
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:26,415
<i>The fifteen people
who gave their lives to inspire me…</i>

173
00:17:30,377 --> 00:17:33,047
<i>were born again
as the works of art I created.</i>

174
00:18:05,704 --> 00:18:06,914
You demonic sicko.

175
00:18:20,427 --> 00:18:21,971
<i>"Author Lee Ji-su"?</i>

176
00:18:23,055 --> 00:18:24,473
Her dead body…

177
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,645
looks like a marionette.

178
00:18:53,335 --> 00:18:54,420
I'll use this demon…

179
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,257
to kill another demon.

180
00:19:03,762 --> 00:19:04,847
Park Tae-u…

181
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,520
I'll make sure you die
the most painful death there is.

182
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,160
Nice.

183
00:19:27,786 --> 00:19:30,331
Your shooting skills are unparalleled.

184
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,209
One moment, please.

185
00:20:06,116 --> 00:20:07,576
Let's go a bit more classic.

186
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,744
You got it, sir.

187
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:20,421
Go!

188
00:20:49,576 --> 00:20:51,161
Just like the story I told you,

189
00:20:51,495 --> 00:20:53,038
I've experienced seven deaths.

190
00:20:53,122 --> 00:20:55,416
Now I'm living as this man
who works as a model.

191
00:20:55,874 --> 00:20:57,876
The name I had before my first death

192
00:20:58,377 --> 00:20:59,670
was Choi Yee-jae.

193
00:21:00,921 --> 00:21:01,922
Ji-su.

194
00:21:03,007 --> 00:21:04,383
I know it's hard to believe,

195
00:21:04,466 --> 00:21:05,884
but I really am Choi Yee-jae.

196
00:21:57,686 --> 00:22:02,066
AUTHOR LEE JI-SU

197
00:22:03,734 --> 00:22:06,653
Father will remove me from my position
if he finds out, right?

198
00:22:07,321 --> 00:22:08,655
That can't happen.

199
00:22:09,698 --> 00:22:11,784
So why don't you take the fall for this?

200
00:22:12,242 --> 00:22:14,286
- I'm sorry?
- You haven't been drinking.

201
00:22:14,953 --> 00:22:17,456
But neither have you.

202
00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:19,583
I did drugs, though.

203
00:22:21,376 --> 00:22:22,376
What?

204
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:25,130
If you do end up in prison,

205
00:22:26,131 --> 00:22:29,009
I'll make it up to you
by paying you for the time you served.

206
00:22:32,096 --> 00:22:34,223
I'll even make you the CEO
of one of our subsidiaries.

207
00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:49,529
Sir.

208
00:22:50,739 --> 00:22:51,739
Here.

209
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:04,253
I'll go turn myself in.

210
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:09,466
Is this 911?

211
00:23:09,967 --> 00:23:11,969
I got into an accident.

212
00:23:19,685 --> 00:23:21,270
"Author Lee Ji-su"?

213
00:23:24,398 --> 00:23:25,691
Her dead body

214
00:23:26,692 --> 00:23:27,985
looks like a marionette.

215
00:24:06,315 --> 00:24:07,441
Yes, sir.

216
00:24:09,943 --> 00:24:13,071
Mr. Park is out of the office right now
on personal business.

217
00:24:14,907 --> 00:24:17,993
Then, when will he be back?

218
00:24:18,076 --> 00:24:20,829
I'm afraid I can't share
his personal schedule.

219
00:24:21,413 --> 00:24:24,625
Which station did you say
you were a reporter for?

220
00:24:27,502 --> 00:24:28,879
I'll come back another time.

221
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:41,599
Sir.

222
00:24:45,437 --> 00:24:47,439
There will be a seminar
for our employees today.

223
00:24:47,522 --> 00:24:49,733
Make sure to be there
to get their spirits up.

224
00:24:49,816 --> 00:24:51,485
Yes, sir. I'll be sure to do that.

225
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:10,545
Why don't you hop in?

226
00:25:11,672 --> 00:25:13,674
It's fine. We'll take the next one.

227
00:25:13,757 --> 00:25:15,509
Please, I insist.

228
00:25:15,592 --> 00:25:17,427
We're all family, aren't we?

229
00:25:18,345 --> 00:25:19,346
Thank you, sir.

230
00:25:19,763 --> 00:25:20,847
Excuse me.

231
00:25:27,688 --> 00:25:28,772
<i>Psychopaths.</i>

232
00:25:28,855 --> 00:25:31,233
There might be one among us right now.

233
00:25:31,316 --> 00:25:34,069
An analysis of roughly
1 000 successful American CEOs

234
00:25:34,152 --> 00:25:38,573
revealed that 21% of them
showed psychopathic traits.

235
00:25:39,533 --> 00:25:42,035
The study concludes that psychopaths

236
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:44,288
are more likely to end up successful.

237
00:25:44,371 --> 00:25:47,165
If they don't have
an impulse to kill, that is.

238
00:25:49,751 --> 00:25:53,422
They are able to succeed because
they push forward to fulfill their desires

239
00:25:53,505 --> 00:25:55,841
without any empathy.

240
00:25:55,924 --> 00:25:58,719
Stephen Lee, the CEO of Kane,
Taekang's rival company,

241
00:25:58,802 --> 00:26:00,262
is said to be a psychopath as well.

242
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,680
We can't let them win, can we?

243
00:26:02,014 --> 00:26:04,850
How about we invite
Mr. Park onto the stage for a test?

244
00:26:09,021 --> 00:26:11,148
You're good-looking enough
to be a celebrity.

245
00:26:11,231 --> 00:26:12,899
And since you're a man who has it all,

246
00:26:12,983 --> 00:26:15,103
let's see if you also have
the traits of a psychopath.

247
00:26:20,574 --> 00:26:23,994
How many smiling faces
do you see here, Mr. Park?

248
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,928
There are three.

249
00:26:43,096 --> 00:26:44,890
You seem to have had
trouble with that one.

250
00:26:44,973 --> 00:26:46,808
We'll move on to the next slide.

251
00:26:48,685 --> 00:26:51,104
Which of these photos
is different from the others?

252
00:26:51,688 --> 00:26:52,898
It's the third one.

253
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,942
I'm sorry to tell you this,

254
00:26:56,026 --> 00:26:57,786
but Mr. Park doesn't seem
to be a psychopath.

255
00:26:58,153 --> 00:26:59,153
That's a shame.

256
00:27:08,372 --> 00:27:12,584
CEO PARK TAE-U, THE RISING
NEW NOBILITY OF THE 21ST CENTURY

257
00:27:42,906 --> 00:27:44,741
You have a brain tumor.

258
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:46,952
To tell you the truth,

259
00:27:47,661 --> 00:27:49,538
it's too late for treatment.

260
00:27:52,374 --> 00:27:54,751
<i>Then, that blood must have been…</i>

261
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,806
Mr. Jeong. I know it's hard to accept…

262
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:11,059
How much time do I have left?

263
00:28:11,143 --> 00:28:13,603
I'd say a month at most.

264
00:28:13,687 --> 00:28:16,064
- That's more than enough.
- I'm sorry?

265
00:28:18,567 --> 00:28:19,568
Mr. Jeong.

266
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:22,278
Mr. Jeong!

267
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:30,829
<i>I should figure out
where Park Tae-u lives first.</i>

268
00:28:38,128 --> 00:28:38,962
Yes?

269
00:28:39,045 --> 00:28:40,045
<i>Mr. Jeong.</i>

270
00:28:40,088 --> 00:28:42,591
Someone contacted us saying that
they wanted to buy <i>Red Cloud</i>.

271
00:28:43,008 --> 00:28:46,595
I told them that
the piece wasn't up for sale,

272
00:28:46,678 --> 00:28:49,389
but they kept insisting
on talking to you in person.

273
00:28:49,473 --> 00:28:52,267
What sort of lunatic
would want to buy crap like that?

274
00:28:52,601 --> 00:28:53,601
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

275
00:28:53,643 --> 00:28:56,146
It was CEO Park Tae-u of Taekang.

276
00:28:59,024 --> 00:29:00,066
Park Tae-u?

277
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:03,153
<i>Yes. He said that he was
on his way to the gallery right now.</i>

278
00:29:04,362 --> 00:29:05,447
I'll be right there.

279
00:29:29,012 --> 00:29:30,847
I hear this piece is to your liking.

280
00:29:32,891 --> 00:29:34,017
And you are?

281
00:29:36,853 --> 00:29:38,104
I'm Jeong Gyu-cheol.

282
00:29:39,189 --> 00:29:41,107
Right. Mr. Jeong.

283
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,777
It's an honor to finally meet you.

284
00:29:55,914 --> 00:29:57,624
If it isn't too much trouble,

285
00:29:57,707 --> 00:30:00,043
could you share
your interpretation of this work?

286
00:30:05,215 --> 00:30:06,299
This piece

287
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:10,428
was created by connecting
the blood of five people.

288
00:30:11,304 --> 00:30:12,305
Do you mean…

289
00:30:13,431 --> 00:30:14,307
real blood?

290
00:30:14,391 --> 00:30:15,600
That's right.

291
00:30:15,684 --> 00:30:17,060
These lines

292
00:30:17,143 --> 00:30:20,939
depict how their deaths
were all connected by the hand of a god.

293
00:30:21,523 --> 00:30:23,400
The "god" you're referring to…

294
00:30:25,652 --> 00:30:27,362
must be yourself.

295
00:30:29,864 --> 00:30:30,864
That's right.

296
00:30:31,908 --> 00:30:35,829
I knew that you'd understand my work.

297
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:45,338
Why do you think it is
that I'm so drawn to your work?

298
00:30:45,422 --> 00:30:47,757
It must be because we're alike.

299
00:30:49,134 --> 00:30:51,886
Like tends to attract like.

300
00:30:52,512 --> 00:30:55,348
And what kind of people are we?

301
00:30:57,851 --> 00:31:01,271
Lunatics who consider themselves gods.

302
00:31:01,354 --> 00:31:02,606
What was that?

303
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,989
I kill people,

304
00:31:11,906 --> 00:31:13,033
just like you.

305
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:23,543
I'm just kidding.

306
00:31:24,836 --> 00:31:26,796
I didn't expect you to get so serious.

307
00:31:32,594 --> 00:31:34,721
That joke was quite uncalled for,

308
00:31:35,847 --> 00:31:37,140
especially from a stranger.

309
00:31:39,809 --> 00:31:42,729
I apologize if I offended you.

310
00:32:07,545 --> 00:32:09,714
If you ever try to kill someone,

311
00:32:11,466 --> 00:32:13,259
I will intervene.

312
00:32:19,808 --> 00:32:20,808
Mr. Park.

313
00:32:24,688 --> 00:32:26,898
The chairman is looking for you.

314
00:32:30,151 --> 00:32:33,196
I was told that you were
never going to sell this piece.

315
00:32:35,615 --> 00:32:36,616
That's unfortunate.

316
00:32:37,117 --> 00:32:38,117
Goodbye.

317
00:32:44,624 --> 00:32:45,625
Mr. Park.

318
00:32:49,963 --> 00:32:51,548
If I were to sell you this piece,

319
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:53,633
where would you put it?

320
00:32:53,883 --> 00:32:54,968
My home.

321
00:32:57,429 --> 00:32:58,930
Your home…

322
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:02,809
That would give this painting value.

323
00:33:02,892 --> 00:33:04,018
I'll sell it.

324
00:33:04,102 --> 00:33:05,645
If you give me your address,

325
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:07,188
I'll deliver it to you myself.

326
00:33:07,939 --> 00:33:09,399
If you would,

327
00:33:11,693 --> 00:33:12,986
I'd be very grateful.

328
00:33:13,069 --> 00:33:14,070
After that,

329
00:33:14,612 --> 00:33:16,948
I would like to
invite you over to my studio.

330
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,743
There, I'll paint a special piece

331
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:22,245
just for you.

332
00:33:22,328 --> 00:33:24,372
I'll be looking forward to it, then.

333
00:33:33,131 --> 00:33:34,131
That's right.

334
00:33:34,591 --> 00:33:35,675
Look forward to it.

335
00:33:36,968 --> 00:33:39,429
I'll make you die a painful death.

336
00:33:47,437 --> 00:33:50,607
<i>Death said it'd intervene
if I tried to kill anyone.</i>

337
00:33:51,107 --> 00:33:53,985
<i>Does that mean
that it's keeping an eye on me?</i>

338
00:33:55,069 --> 00:33:59,324
I pray in the name of Our Lord,
Jesus Christ.

339
00:33:59,407 --> 00:34:00,492
Amen.

340
00:34:01,743 --> 00:34:03,953
Before we end the mass,

341
00:34:04,037 --> 00:34:07,749
the father of the late Park Jin-tae John,
the former CEO of Taekang,

342
00:34:07,832 --> 00:34:11,628
Mr. Park Jin-seop Peter,
the chairman of Taekang,

343
00:34:11,711 --> 00:34:13,379
will offer a eulogy.

344
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:24,808
Remember how our housekeeper
would sometimes bring her baby over?

345
00:34:25,517 --> 00:34:28,895
That baby had a unique name.

346
00:34:29,312 --> 00:34:30,146
Bo-ri, was it?

347
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:34,150
How the hell would I remember
the name of some housekeeper's baby?

348
00:34:34,609 --> 00:34:36,069
I saw it all, you know.

349
00:34:44,536 --> 00:34:45,745
You're so noisy.

350
00:34:47,372 --> 00:34:48,790
<i>You covered his mouth shut.</i>

351
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:52,043
I'm being serious.

352
00:34:52,126 --> 00:34:54,379
- Really?
- <i>He survived, but he underwent surgery.</i>

353
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,465
<i>He almost lost his life.</i>

354
00:34:58,466 --> 00:34:59,592
Did you ever…

355
00:35:02,136 --> 00:35:03,513
tell anyone else about this?

356
00:35:03,596 --> 00:35:05,723
I told Father.

357
00:35:08,601 --> 00:35:10,770
So he knew all along.

358
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,901
So?

359
00:35:16,985 --> 00:35:18,361
You used to take pills daily

360
00:35:18,444 --> 00:35:21,406
because you kept hearing a baby crying.

361
00:35:21,531 --> 00:35:22,824
- Do you still take them?
- What?

362
00:35:22,907 --> 00:35:24,284
The pills in your fountain pen.

363
00:35:24,367 --> 00:35:25,469
You thought I wouldn't know?

364
00:35:25,493 --> 00:35:27,412
You son of a bitch!

365
00:35:27,495 --> 00:35:29,038
Have you been digging up dirt on me?

366
00:35:30,874 --> 00:35:32,125
Why don't you get clean?

367
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,376
Oh, that's right.

368
00:35:34,878 --> 00:35:37,005
Maybe you can't
because you're weak-willed.

369
00:35:48,266 --> 00:35:51,352
My will is much stronger

370
00:35:52,061 --> 00:35:53,855
than you can ever imagine.

371
00:35:58,818 --> 00:36:00,945
That's why I've kept you alive
all this time.

372
00:36:02,238 --> 00:36:03,281
And another thing.

373
00:36:04,115 --> 00:36:06,618
I didn't take them
because I could hear a baby crying.

374
00:36:06,701 --> 00:36:10,121
It was because I kept hearing voices
telling me to kill.

375
00:36:26,346 --> 00:36:27,847
Jin-tae

376
00:36:28,514 --> 00:36:31,184
was like a precious gift

377
00:36:31,267 --> 00:36:33,937
to my wife and I.

378
00:36:34,437 --> 00:36:35,730
Even now,

379
00:36:35,813 --> 00:36:37,732
I miss him very much.

380
00:37:07,887 --> 00:37:10,890
How long will he keep going on
about that dead bastard?

381
00:37:18,398 --> 00:37:19,774
I'm listening.

382
00:37:19,857 --> 00:37:21,526
You were right.

383
00:37:22,402 --> 00:37:26,072
<i>Today's seminar was held
under Mr. Park's orders.</i>

384
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:21,669
Let's eat.
This is the reason we do this, isn't it?

385
00:38:24,589 --> 00:38:26,299
How can you be so uncaring?

386
00:38:26,382 --> 00:38:28,092
You couldn't have heated this up?

387
00:38:28,176 --> 00:38:30,136
It'll get heated up
in your intestines anyway.

388
00:38:30,219 --> 00:38:33,473
Why would you bring up my intestines
when I'm eating pig intestines?

389
00:38:33,556 --> 00:38:35,808
You lack empathy as well.

390
00:38:39,937 --> 00:38:42,315
Man, V8 engines sure are different.

391
00:38:43,274 --> 00:38:45,985
Let's just leave this
to the traffic officers.

392
00:38:52,742 --> 00:38:55,578
Slow down, will you?

393
00:38:59,457 --> 00:39:00,708
Just let them go.

394
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:02,335
Hey!

395
00:39:10,927 --> 00:39:11,927
That bastard!

396
00:39:18,101 --> 00:39:19,352
I've got you now.

397
00:39:47,755 --> 00:39:50,258
Sir. You were speeding excessively.

398
00:39:50,341 --> 00:39:52,009
Please show me your ID

399
00:39:52,552 --> 00:39:53,553
and blow on this.

400
00:39:56,139 --> 00:39:59,016
Why would he give out speeding tickets
when we're detectives?

401
00:40:02,687 --> 00:40:04,772
You were driving like that
without even drinking?

402
00:40:04,856 --> 00:40:05,982
I'm giving you a ticket.

403
00:40:10,278 --> 00:40:11,863
Please be more careful next time.

404
00:40:19,328 --> 00:40:20,788
Please step outside for a bit.

405
00:40:20,872 --> 00:40:22,331
I'll perform a simple inspection.

406
00:40:26,919 --> 00:40:27,920
Damn it.

407
00:40:31,215 --> 00:40:32,466
That was rude.

408
00:40:33,342 --> 00:40:34,510
Why don't you take it easy?

409
00:40:34,594 --> 00:40:35,595
Please cooperate.

410
00:40:38,764 --> 00:40:40,433
What did you say your name was?

411
00:40:43,102 --> 00:40:44,902
Detective Woo Ji-hun
of Jungbu Police Station.

412
00:40:51,485 --> 00:40:52,695
Hey, what's the matter?

413
00:40:53,112 --> 00:40:54,947
Look at his pupils. I think he's high.

414
00:40:55,031 --> 00:40:56,782
Just let it go.

415
00:40:56,866 --> 00:40:58,910
He's Park Tae-u, the CEO of Taekang.

416
00:40:58,993 --> 00:41:00,745
What's that got to do with anything?

417
00:41:01,078 --> 00:41:02,955
Hello, Commissioner General Kim Nam-il.

418
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,585
You see, I was caught speeding a little.

419
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:10,129
All they have to do is give me a ticket,

420
00:41:11,297 --> 00:41:13,591
but Detective Woo Ji-hun
of Jungbu Police Station

421
00:41:13,674 --> 00:41:16,219
keeps insisting
that I accompany him to the station.

422
00:41:18,554 --> 00:41:19,554
Hold on.

423
00:41:23,768 --> 00:41:25,811
- Yes, sir.
<i>- Do you want to lose your badge?</i>

424
00:41:26,187 --> 00:41:28,272
<i>He's a busy man,
so just apologize and let him go!</i>

425
00:41:32,235 --> 00:41:33,277
Yes, sir.

426
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:40,618
I'll be seeing you around then.

427
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:48,918
I'm sorry, sir.

428
00:41:50,002 --> 00:41:51,002
You may go.

429
00:41:51,504 --> 00:41:52,504
Let's go.

430
00:41:53,422 --> 00:41:54,422
I don't want to.

431
00:41:57,677 --> 00:41:58,677
Excuse me.

432
00:41:59,428 --> 00:42:01,597
Stay right there
if you want to keep your job.

433
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:23,661
That'll cover the damages.

434
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,839
Bootlickers like you know your place
and suck up to the powerful.

435
00:42:35,798 --> 00:42:36,799
I like you.

436
00:42:37,383 --> 00:42:40,594
You feed off the dead skin cells
of other people's feet.

437
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:39,779
This is my home.

438
00:43:41,405 --> 00:43:42,990
What brings you by?

439
00:43:44,825 --> 00:43:46,369
What else?

440
00:43:47,161 --> 00:43:48,662
I came to see you, Mr. Park.

441
00:43:50,081 --> 00:43:51,081
What for?

442
00:43:58,589 --> 00:44:00,383
Can't you tell what brought me by

443
00:44:00,925 --> 00:44:02,218
even after seeing my work?

444
00:44:03,052 --> 00:44:04,637
Why don't you take your foot off?

445
00:44:17,858 --> 00:44:18,858
Hey.

446
00:44:19,902 --> 00:44:21,779
There aren't any security cameras here.

447
00:44:25,741 --> 00:44:26,742
I know.

448
00:44:28,285 --> 00:44:30,371
Don't you think
I would've looked into that?

449
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,581
Why you little…

450
00:44:38,212 --> 00:44:39,212
Hey.

451
00:44:40,339 --> 00:44:41,507
Get lost.

452
00:45:02,027 --> 00:45:03,529
What do you think you're doing?

453
00:45:03,904 --> 00:45:06,031
If you hear
what I'm about to do to you now,

454
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:08,850
you'll come off that high a little.

455
00:45:17,751 --> 00:45:18,751
Hey.

456
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:21,005
Have you ever been hit before?

457
00:45:21,297 --> 00:45:23,007
You son of a bitch.

458
00:46:12,181 --> 00:46:15,684
Why did he come all the way here
and cause such a commotion?

459
00:46:21,148 --> 00:46:22,548
This will be a hassle to deal with.

460
00:46:27,821 --> 00:46:28,822
What the…

461
00:46:35,538 --> 00:46:36,789
Get out of my car!

462
00:47:17,997 --> 00:47:18,998
Who the hell are you?

463
00:47:20,082 --> 00:47:21,625
I shot you just now.

464
00:47:22,918 --> 00:47:25,254
I anticipated that much.

465
00:47:26,005 --> 00:47:27,006
What?

466
00:47:27,089 --> 00:47:29,300
I know a lot of things about you.

467
00:47:31,594 --> 00:47:32,636
Just wait.

468
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:36,223
I've made many special plans
for you tonight.

469
00:47:48,694 --> 00:47:51,405
I've killed 15 people at this studio.

470
00:47:52,448 --> 00:47:53,448
What?

471
00:47:56,368 --> 00:47:59,121
Do you want to know
how I'm going to kill you?

472
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,082
First, I'll slowly sever off

473
00:48:02,166 --> 00:48:03,876
each of your fingers and toes

474
00:48:04,418 --> 00:48:05,669
one by one.

475
00:48:05,753 --> 00:48:09,214
Then, I'll take a chainsaw

476
00:48:09,923 --> 00:48:12,134
to make my way up
from your heels to your head.

477
00:48:13,469 --> 00:48:14,928
Do you know at what point

478
00:48:16,013 --> 00:48:18,515
the person loses consciousness
and dies in this process?

479
00:48:19,933 --> 00:48:21,226
When is it?

480
00:48:21,769 --> 00:48:23,020
See for yourself.

481
00:48:24,813 --> 00:48:27,399
It happens much later than you'd expect.

482
00:49:03,686 --> 00:49:04,770
What's wrong with him?

483
00:49:24,331 --> 00:49:25,331
You're up.

484
00:49:47,646 --> 00:49:50,524
At first, I thought you were bluffing.

485
00:49:55,654 --> 00:49:58,240
It turns out you truly had a playground.

486
00:50:00,242 --> 00:50:01,242
A playground?

487
00:50:02,745 --> 00:50:05,247
You said you killed 15 people here, right?

488
00:50:15,382 --> 00:50:18,051
You told me about your murders,

489
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:20,846
so I'll tell you about mine.

490
00:50:24,558 --> 00:50:25,768
My first kill…

491
00:50:28,604 --> 00:50:29,688
was by accident.

492
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:42,701
Is this 911?

493
00:50:44,244 --> 00:50:45,621
Someone's been hit by a car.

494
00:50:48,499 --> 00:50:50,751
I'm at the intersection outside Taekang.

495
00:50:54,129 --> 00:50:55,839
Help me.

496
00:50:58,133 --> 00:51:01,470
Please help me.

497
00:51:04,014 --> 00:51:06,183
<i>He looked up at me as if I were a god.</i>

498
00:51:07,309 --> 00:51:09,728
<i>He was begging me with his eyes.</i>

499
00:51:10,062 --> 00:51:11,480
To this very day…

500
00:51:14,149 --> 00:51:16,193
I remember how electrifying it was.

501
00:51:16,819 --> 00:51:19,404
But no matter how many people
I ran over after that,

502
00:51:19,488 --> 00:51:22,282
I couldn't experience
the sensation I had felt then.

503
00:51:24,243 --> 00:51:25,452
But today,

504
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:28,956
hearing your story in the car

505
00:51:29,581 --> 00:51:31,542
began to excite me.

506
00:51:32,417 --> 00:51:34,253
I couldn't stop trembling.

507
00:51:38,382 --> 00:51:40,175
<i>Why didn't I think of that?</i>

508
00:51:40,384 --> 00:51:41,677
<i>I want to give it a go too.</i>

509
00:51:41,969 --> 00:51:43,470
<i>I want to experience it myself.</i>

510
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,933
You crazy bastard.

511
00:51:49,893 --> 00:51:52,020
You'll never be able to beat me.

512
00:51:52,729 --> 00:51:54,314
Winning and losing

513
00:51:55,482 --> 00:51:58,151
depends on whether you're alive or not.

514
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:01,697
That's why I keep winning.

515
00:52:08,036 --> 00:52:09,037
Because…

516
00:52:12,916 --> 00:52:15,002
I always give back as much as I receive.

517
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:23,176
Now, I can either save you or kill you.

518
00:52:29,182 --> 00:52:30,684
Why don't you start begging me…

519
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,895
to spare you?

520
00:52:54,249 --> 00:52:57,169
Kill me, you psychopath.

521
00:52:59,379 --> 00:53:01,173
You fucking bastard!

522
00:53:37,501 --> 00:53:38,710
Hang in there.

523
00:53:39,419 --> 00:53:40,837
We're only getting started.

524
00:54:31,179 --> 00:54:33,223
That was the most painful death

525
00:54:34,141 --> 00:54:36,101
you've experienced until now.

526
00:54:36,643 --> 00:54:38,895
You were cut, severed,

527
00:54:39,396 --> 00:54:40,897
crushed, and burned.

528
00:54:43,025 --> 00:54:44,665
You should still consider yourself lucky.

529
00:54:45,193 --> 00:54:46,903
If you had tried to kill him,

530
00:54:47,821 --> 00:54:50,240
I would have intervened
and thrown you into hell.

531
00:55:12,929 --> 00:55:13,930
Did you

532
00:55:15,015 --> 00:55:16,975
get yourself killed on purpose?

533
00:57:09,045 --> 00:57:15,093
<i>Are you still standing there?</i>

534
00:57:15,844 --> 00:57:21,433
<i>Are you afraid to turn back?</i>

535
00:57:22,726 --> 00:57:28,773
<i>The face I somberly remembered</i>

536
00:57:29,316 --> 00:57:31,693
<i>The person I'm grateful for</i>

537
00:57:32,736 --> 00:57:34,779
<i>The person I owe</i>

538
00:57:35,238 --> 00:57:42,120
<i>Although there's no miracle we hoped for</i>

539
00:57:42,495 --> 00:57:49,252
<i>Nor the strength to get back on our feet</i>

540
00:57:49,336 --> 00:57:56,176
<i>Listen to the voice that embraces you</i>

541
00:57:56,468 --> 00:58:03,391
<i>"I love you"</i>

542
00:58:03,475 --> 00:58:09,022
<i>"I love you"</i>

543
00:58:29,167 --> 00:58:35,715
<i>If you're still hesitating</i>

544
00:58:35,799 --> 00:58:39,427
