1
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:36,857
Didn't I tell you?

2
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,775
You can never beat me.

3
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:40,068
But then again,

4
00:00:40,152 --> 00:00:43,280
you never would've guessed
that you'd end up like this.

5
00:00:46,825 --> 00:00:47,951
But I did.

6
00:00:51,538 --> 00:00:52,622
You did?

7
00:00:53,373 --> 00:00:54,875
I remembered…

8
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,005
Bo-ri.

9
00:01:00,756 --> 00:01:01,840
Bo-ri?

10
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:04,926
Through the memory…

11
00:01:07,179 --> 00:01:09,514
of Park Jin-tae, who you killed.

12
00:01:19,357 --> 00:01:21,485
How did you know
that I killed Park Jin-tae?

13
00:01:24,613 --> 00:01:25,655
Because…

14
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:30,535
I was once your brother,

15
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:34,080
Park Jin-tae.

16
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:22,212
EPISODE 6
MEMORY

17
00:02:36,476 --> 00:02:37,519
Did you

18
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:39,938
get yourself killed on purpose?

19
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,915
Let's move on to the next life.

20
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:01,084
So you're getting your revenge
in your next life?

21
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:03,420
My mom once told me,

22
00:03:04,504 --> 00:03:07,048
"Your sins will end up
finding their way back to you,

23
00:03:07,132 --> 00:03:08,592
so don't ever commit them."

24
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:12,512
But I learned

25
00:03:13,471 --> 00:03:15,348
that the sins of the rich

26
00:03:16,558 --> 00:03:18,310
never seem to come back to them.

27
00:03:18,727 --> 00:03:21,605
I'll make Park Tae-u pay for what he did.

28
00:03:21,688 --> 00:03:23,565
The punished becomes the punisher?

29
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:26,484
That will only make you
pay a greater price.

30
00:03:26,568 --> 00:03:28,862
I have to do something since God won't.

31
00:03:30,113 --> 00:03:33,450
I'll show you that I can win
playing by the rules you've created.

32
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:35,118
When will you realize…

33
00:03:36,745 --> 00:03:37,746
that death

34
00:03:38,163 --> 00:03:39,789
never goes as planned?

35
00:03:52,177 --> 00:03:53,094
<i>What's this?</i>

36
00:03:53,178 --> 00:03:54,346
<i>Why am I running?</i>

37
00:03:55,055 --> 00:03:56,640
<i>Am I chasing that man?</i>

38
00:04:00,685 --> 00:04:03,021
Stop chasing me, pig!

39
00:04:04,814 --> 00:04:06,149
What? Pig?

40
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,736
Am I a cop, then?

41
00:04:12,113 --> 00:04:13,198
Good.

42
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:14,866
What?

43
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:18,119
I'm going to kill you.

44
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,121
Wait.

45
00:04:21,164 --> 00:04:23,458
Hold on.

46
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:24,918
Die!

47
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:26,002
Move out of the way!

48
00:04:36,429 --> 00:04:37,472
Ji-hyeong.

49
00:04:37,555 --> 00:04:39,015
Were you running away just now?

50
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:40,934
Well, you see…

51
00:04:41,017 --> 00:04:43,979
I won't ask you to sacrifice yourself
for your partner.

52
00:04:44,062 --> 00:04:46,648
But at the very least,
let's not embarrass ourselves.

53
00:04:47,649 --> 00:04:48,650
Come on!

54
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:02,330
<i>My name is An Ji-hyeong.</i>

55
00:05:02,414 --> 00:05:03,498
<i>I'm 42 years old.</i>

56
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:05,017
POLICE HOSPITAL FUNERAL HALL

57
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,626
<i>My father, who was a policeman,</i>

58
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,629
<i>died on duty while trying
to apprehend violent offenders,</i>

59
00:05:10,088 --> 00:05:12,924
<i>and I wanted to be a great cop
just like my father.</i>

60
00:05:13,008 --> 00:05:15,552
Mom! I passed the test.

61
00:05:15,635 --> 00:05:17,762
I'm a policeman, just like Father.

62
00:05:17,846 --> 00:05:18,847
What?

63
00:05:20,682 --> 00:05:22,767
- Mom!
<i>- My mother fell sick with worry,</i>

64
00:05:22,851 --> 00:05:26,104
<i>afraid that I might end up
dying like my father,</i>

65
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:29,149
<i>so I made a promise to her</i>

66
00:05:29,232 --> 00:05:30,692
<i>that no matter what happened,</i>

67
00:05:31,443 --> 00:05:33,528
<i>I would look after myself above all else.</i>

68
00:05:37,532 --> 00:05:39,701
That punk always bails at crucial moments.

69
00:05:39,826 --> 00:05:42,787
Consider yourself one officer short
when you're out with him.

70
00:05:43,288 --> 00:05:45,623
<i>Keeping my promise to my mother</i>

71
00:05:45,707 --> 00:05:47,959
- Jeez.
<i>- Turned me into a pathetic detective</i>

72
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:49,794
<i>who was looked down on by his peers.</i>

73
00:05:50,587 --> 00:05:51,755
<i>And recently…</i>

74
00:05:54,132 --> 00:05:55,675
<i>my mother passed away.</i>

75
00:05:57,177 --> 00:05:58,470
<i>All that was left for me</i>

76
00:05:58,845 --> 00:06:02,140
<i>was the cold disdain of my colleagues,
who saw me as a selfish wimp.</i>

77
00:06:04,684 --> 00:06:05,684
Excuse me.

78
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:08,480
Stay right there
if you want to keep your job.

79
00:06:09,022 --> 00:06:12,984
<i>Even I began to believe
that was my true nature.</i>

80
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:16,279
<i>I belatedly realized
that a person's character is determined</i>

81
00:06:16,362 --> 00:06:18,364
<i>not by the beliefs they hold,</i>

82
00:06:18,448 --> 00:06:21,701
<i>but by the actions
over the course of their lifetime.</i>

83
00:06:27,123 --> 00:06:29,626
I guess this man deserves some pity.

84
00:06:31,961 --> 00:06:33,630
So that's why his junior detective

85
00:06:34,422 --> 00:06:35,840
looked down on him like that.

86
00:06:43,014 --> 00:06:44,224
Give me my money!

87
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:45,767
- Where's my money?
- Huh?

88
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:46,935
My money!

89
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:50,730
They promised me
100 million won if I kill you.

90
00:06:50,814 --> 00:06:52,816
Just die, you bastard.

91
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:54,692
Give me my money!

92
00:06:54,776 --> 00:06:56,653
- That bastard.
- Where is it?

93
00:06:56,736 --> 00:06:58,905
Give me my 100 million won, you bastard!

94
00:06:59,697 --> 00:07:00,865
Kim Ji-yeong.

95
00:07:01,783 --> 00:07:02,992
Long time no see.

96
00:07:03,493 --> 00:07:04,494
Who the hell are you?

97
00:07:04,577 --> 00:07:06,454
You must love playing with knives.

98
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:08,790
Now you're just
pulling that thing out wherever.

99
00:07:08,873 --> 00:07:10,083
Do you want to die too?

100
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,251
Technically,

101
00:07:12,293 --> 00:07:13,878
you did get me once already.

102
00:07:14,337 --> 00:07:16,256
What is this crazy bastard saying?

103
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:17,257
Who the hell are you?

104
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,340
Me?

105
00:07:20,135 --> 00:07:22,095
My face may have changed a little,

106
00:07:23,221 --> 00:07:25,682
but I'm Cho Tae-sang,
who you used to serve.

107
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:27,851
What?

108
00:07:27,934 --> 00:07:29,894
What a load of bullshit.

109
00:07:29,978 --> 00:07:32,814
I stabbed that bastard to death myself!

110
00:07:34,482 --> 00:07:35,482
Wow.

111
00:07:35,775 --> 00:07:38,069
That's a great way
of confessing to murder.

112
00:07:41,531 --> 00:07:43,158
Fuck. Stop filming.

113
00:07:44,117 --> 00:07:45,952
- I said, stop filming!
- Hey.

114
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:49,205
How many more people are you going to kill

115
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:51,416
for that 100 million won
Park Tae-u gave you?

116
00:07:52,292 --> 00:07:53,334
Why you…

117
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:02,510
This man was just looking out for himself.

118
00:08:02,594 --> 00:08:04,429
He wasn't weak at all.

119
00:08:07,307 --> 00:08:08,349
That's enough.

120
00:08:09,684 --> 00:08:10,685
Are you all right?

121
00:08:12,437 --> 00:08:13,605
I'm a detective.

122
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:16,399
- Damn it.
- Cuff him.

123
00:08:18,818 --> 00:08:20,153
Stop glaring at me.

124
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,071
Take him to the station.

125
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,117
That was cool! You're the best!

126
00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:34,167
KNIFE-WIELDING MAN IN MOKSU-DONG
SUBDUED WITH BARE HANDS

127
00:08:41,174 --> 00:08:42,217
What the…

128
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,551
Can you believe this?

129
00:08:46,763 --> 00:08:48,973
Why aren't you working on your cases?

130
00:08:49,474 --> 00:08:50,600
What's with the huddle?

131
00:08:51,142 --> 00:08:52,560
Sir, you should see this.

132
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:54,311
What is it?

133
00:08:57,607 --> 00:08:59,651
That guy looks a lot like Ji-hyeong.

134
00:09:00,401 --> 00:09:02,779
You may find this hard to believe,
but it <i>is</i> him.

135
00:09:02,862 --> 00:09:05,198
Do you think I'm stupid?

136
00:09:05,281 --> 00:09:07,041
Do you expect me to believe
that's Ji-hyeong?

137
00:09:07,116 --> 00:09:08,660
Sir, it really is Detective An.

138
00:09:08,743 --> 00:09:11,287
He's all the rage online right now.
They're calling him a hero.

139
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:12,372
What?

140
00:09:12,455 --> 00:09:14,332
Hey, he's on the news as well.

141
00:09:14,874 --> 00:09:16,234
JUNGBU POLICEMAN ARRESTS ARMED MAN

142
00:09:17,794 --> 00:09:20,421
Check to see
if he recently got life insurance.

143
00:09:20,505 --> 00:09:22,090
- Do it.
- Do it.

144
00:09:22,173 --> 00:09:23,174
Do it.

145
00:09:23,883 --> 00:09:24,759
Yes, sir.

146
00:09:24,842 --> 00:09:26,469
You morons!

147
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,681
But where is he?

148
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:35,769
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

149
00:09:37,772 --> 00:09:40,525
He said he wanted to visit
a serial murder suspect's home,

150
00:09:40,608 --> 00:09:41,776
so I'm accompanying him.

151
00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:44,946
We don't know for sure yet.

152
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:46,614
Yes, sir.

153
00:09:47,031 --> 00:09:48,116
<i>Park Tae-u.</i>

154
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,994
<i>My revenge begins now.</i>

155
00:10:03,423 --> 00:10:06,217
Sir, I got you the documents
you requested.

156
00:10:24,569 --> 00:10:26,279
Why don't you join me for dinner tonight?

157
00:10:26,612 --> 00:10:27,612
I'm sorry?

158
00:10:31,534 --> 00:10:34,996
I've come across a great spot recently.

159
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,292
Why don't we go there?

160
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:42,669
Yes, sir.

161
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:47,050
I'm looking forward to
going to a place you like.

162
00:10:50,511 --> 00:10:51,971
I feel the same way.

163
00:10:52,722 --> 00:10:54,849
I've never gone there with a woman before.

164
00:11:15,787 --> 00:11:16,996
Let's take my car.

165
00:11:18,414 --> 00:11:19,414
Get ready.

166
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,375
Yes, sir.

167
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,428
I'll use that place as my playground.

168
00:11:36,474 --> 00:11:37,474
Ji-hyeong.

169
00:11:37,517 --> 00:11:40,103
Trespassing without a warrant
can get us into trouble!

170
00:11:40,603 --> 00:11:43,064
It's fine. This house
doesn't have an owner anymore.

171
00:11:43,147 --> 00:11:44,147
What?

172
00:11:47,026 --> 00:11:49,026
Making creepy art
doesn't make you a serial killer.

AUTHOR LEE JI-SU

174
00:12:41,247 --> 00:12:44,292
Ji-hyeong,
this place does seem a bit fishy.

175
00:12:46,252 --> 00:12:47,252
What's that?

176
00:12:54,051 --> 00:12:54,969
This is…

177
00:12:55,052 --> 00:12:59,515
Jeong Gyu-cheol had a habit
of recording the murders he committed.

178
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:02,852
I'll get the forensics team.

179
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:10,860
<i>Now,</i>

180
00:13:10,943 --> 00:13:12,445
<i>why don't you start begging me…</i>

181
00:13:14,906 --> 00:13:15,906
<i>to spare you?</i>

00:13:42,099 --> 00:13:43,726
Spray the paintings as well.

185
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,773
Jeong Gyu-cheol used
the blood of his victims as paint.

186
00:13:53,361 --> 00:13:54,570
Let's turn the lights off.

187
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,941
Hey.

188
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:34,067
An Ji-hyeong!

189
00:14:37,905 --> 00:14:39,407
My detective instinct tells me…

190
00:14:42,076 --> 00:14:43,494
that you're not An Ji-hyeong.

191
00:14:43,995 --> 00:14:44,995
<i>What?</i>

192
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:46,330
<i>How did he know?</i>

193
00:14:48,374 --> 00:14:49,667
Look me in the eyes!

194
00:14:52,295 --> 00:14:53,504
You little shit…

195
00:14:53,588 --> 00:14:54,588
Are you possessed?

196
00:14:55,381 --> 00:14:56,924
Can you do magic tricks too?

197
00:14:57,008 --> 00:14:58,426
Well done!

198
00:14:58,509 --> 00:14:59,760
See?

199
00:14:59,844 --> 00:15:01,846
I knew you had it in you.

200
00:15:04,181 --> 00:15:05,600
<i>What's with him?</i>

201
00:15:05,683 --> 00:15:06,684
Goodness.

202
00:15:12,189 --> 00:15:14,567
Something must have happened here.

203
00:15:27,663 --> 00:15:29,874
You're Mr. Park Tae-u of Taekang, correct?

204
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,500
That's right.

205
00:15:32,376 --> 00:15:34,211
What's going on here?

206
00:15:34,295 --> 00:15:36,672
I'm Detective An Ji-hyeong.

207
00:15:40,384 --> 00:15:41,384
I like you.

208
00:15:41,427 --> 00:15:44,305
You feed off the dead skin cells
of other people's feet.

209
00:15:49,018 --> 00:15:50,144
You remember me, don't you?

210
00:15:52,104 --> 00:15:55,816
We've blocked off the area
because of a murder that occurred nearby.

211
00:15:56,275 --> 00:15:57,860
Have you ever heard this saying?

212
00:16:00,112 --> 00:16:01,197
"Criminals…

213
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,034
always return to the scene of the crime."

214
00:16:09,705 --> 00:16:10,915
I don't get

215
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:15,086
why you would say that to me.

216
00:16:16,796 --> 00:16:20,341
I'm just warning you to stay away
so you're not mistaken as the culprit.

217
00:16:20,883 --> 00:16:24,053
I'm only telling you this
because it's you.

218
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:25,805
May I ask

219
00:16:26,347 --> 00:16:27,932
the name of your companion?

220
00:16:29,934 --> 00:16:31,602
It's Lee Hui-u.

221
00:16:32,353 --> 00:16:33,521
Why do you need my name?

222
00:16:33,604 --> 00:16:36,982
We need to keep a record
of anyone who passes by the area.

223
00:16:37,066 --> 00:16:38,192
Who knows?

224
00:16:39,735 --> 00:16:41,237
You might end up going missing.

225
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:44,865
Killers don't walk around
wearing name tags, you see.

226
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,784
An ordinary-looking person

227
00:16:46,867 --> 00:16:49,995
may be a hideous demon on the inside.

228
00:16:51,414 --> 00:16:52,415
Isn't that right?

229
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,128
Am I free to go?

230
00:16:57,461 --> 00:16:58,504
Of course.

231
00:17:14,562 --> 00:17:15,730
I'll see you soon,

232
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:17,773
Park Tae-u.

233
00:17:24,488 --> 00:17:25,488
Get out.

234
00:17:25,906 --> 00:17:26,906
Sir.

235
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:28,951
I've lost my appetite, so get out.

236
00:17:38,627 --> 00:17:40,004
An Ji-hyeong…

237
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:46,010
Detective An. Let us take a photo.

238
00:17:49,972 --> 00:17:53,184
<i>The armed man arrested
by Detective An Ji-hyeong in Moksu-dong</i>

239
00:17:53,267 --> 00:17:55,311
<i>shockingly turned out to be
the culprit of a murder</i>

240
00:17:55,394 --> 00:17:57,271
<i>that happened a few days ago.</i>

241
00:17:57,354 --> 00:17:58,189
<i>On top of that,</i>

242
00:17:58,272 --> 00:18:00,553
<i>Detective An is finding himself
in the limelight once more</i>

243
00:18:00,608 --> 00:18:02,902
<i>for uncovering the identity
of the elusive serial killer,</i>

244
00:18:02,985 --> 00:18:04,528
<i>Jeong Gyu-cheol, the painter.</i>

245
00:18:04,612 --> 00:18:06,947
<i>It was Detective An who discovered</i>

246
00:18:07,031 --> 00:18:09,700
<i>that Jeong Gyu-cheol was the serial killer</i>

247
00:18:09,784 --> 00:18:11,535
<i>behind 15 murders.</i>

248
00:18:11,619 --> 00:18:13,871
<i>Saying that there is no perfect crime,</i>

249
00:18:13,954 --> 00:18:16,707
<i>he expressed his will
to bring all criminals to justice</i>

250
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,751
<i>before the world.</i>

251
00:18:20,294 --> 00:18:21,128
Yes.

252
00:18:21,212 --> 00:18:22,296
Sir.

253
00:18:22,379 --> 00:18:24,924
We've taken care of
Jeong Gyu-cheol's body.

254
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:26,008
Well done.

255
00:18:27,676 --> 00:18:29,678
About Detective An Ji-hyeong…

256
00:18:32,223 --> 00:18:34,517
It felt like he knew something.

257
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,186
DISARMING SOMEONE WITH A SHOULDER THROW

258
00:18:38,395 --> 00:18:40,189
This guy is getting on my nerves.

259
00:18:40,272 --> 00:18:42,107
I'll take care of him.

260
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,658
Thank you, Detective An.

261
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,078
We'll run it as an exclusive
on tonight's news.

262
00:18:55,037 --> 00:18:56,288
I appreciate it.

263
00:18:56,747 --> 00:18:57,747
Of course.

264
00:18:57,957 --> 00:18:59,637
Your team was last
in terms of performance,

265
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:01,293
but you've done a good job as of late.

266
00:19:01,377 --> 00:19:02,920
It's all thanks to you, sir.

267
00:19:03,003 --> 00:19:03,838
Keep it up.

268
00:19:03,921 --> 00:19:06,423
I'll give you a special promotion
if all of this ends well.

269
00:19:07,383 --> 00:19:08,968
Thank you, sir!

270
00:19:11,387 --> 00:19:12,930
JUNGBU POLICE STATION

271
00:19:15,432 --> 00:19:17,101
Ji-hyeong, come here.

272
00:19:17,184 --> 00:19:18,561
My baby.

273
00:19:20,855 --> 00:19:23,148
Ji-hyeong. Can we talk?

274
00:19:23,732 --> 00:19:24,775
Sure.

275
00:19:29,446 --> 00:19:31,574
Keep up the good work!

276
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:39,582
I saw you

277
00:19:39,665 --> 00:19:42,626
making copies of and deleting videos
in Jeong Gyu-cheol's room.

278
00:19:43,002 --> 00:19:43,836
What?

279
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,212
What were those videos of?

280
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:53,637
They show who killed Jeong Gyu-cheol.

281
00:19:53,721 --> 00:19:55,055
Was Jeong Gyu-cheol murdered?

282
00:19:55,139 --> 00:19:56,140
Yes.

283
00:19:56,223 --> 00:19:57,223
Then why would you…

284
00:19:57,266 --> 00:19:58,350
Because the culprit…

285
00:20:00,352 --> 00:20:01,604
was Park Tae-u.

286
00:20:02,354 --> 00:20:03,981
As in Park Tae-u, the CEO of Taekang?

287
00:20:04,064 --> 00:20:04,899
That's right.

288
00:20:04,982 --> 00:20:05,983
So why…

289
00:20:07,026 --> 00:20:08,777
Do you think they'd ever air those videos?

290
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:12,281
They'd be destroyed
the moment we brought them to the station.

291
00:20:12,364 --> 00:20:13,449
I'll make sure

292
00:20:14,825 --> 00:20:16,076
that bastard Park Tae-u

293
00:20:17,953 --> 00:20:19,455
is brought to justice.

294
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:22,917
Ji-hyeong.

295
00:20:34,428 --> 00:20:35,596
She's back again.

296
00:20:37,056 --> 00:20:38,849
Is that investigation still going on?

297
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,315
What's she being investigated for?

298
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,250
Don't you know about the money bag case?

299
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,196
It even made the news
and caused quite a stir.

300
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:54,073
<i>That bag was found in her house.</i>

301
00:20:54,156 --> 00:20:56,283
<i>They went through
all the security cameras in the area</i>

302
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:58,160
<i>and found out who put the bag in her home,</i>

303
00:20:58,243 --> 00:20:59,536
<i>but he was found dead</i>

304
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,038
<i>from a traffic accident.</i>

305
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,666
It only ended up
putting her in a difficult spot.

306
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,043
I heard she even lost her son
not long ago.

307
00:21:09,254 --> 00:21:10,089
Ma'am.

308
00:21:10,172 --> 00:21:11,840
I can only let you go if you cooperate.

309
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:14,718
I really don't know.

310
00:21:16,053 --> 00:21:17,221
Do you not remember?

311
00:21:18,514 --> 00:21:20,224
I know nothing about this.

312
00:21:22,351 --> 00:21:23,351
Jeez.

313
00:21:25,646 --> 00:21:28,190
I can't do anything right,
even after I die.

314
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:50,211
Mom.

315
00:22:02,266 --> 00:22:03,434
I'm sorry.

316
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,770
I was thinking of how to address you best

317
00:22:07,354 --> 00:22:08,689
and ended up making a mistake.

318
00:22:09,231 --> 00:22:11,191
I apologize, ma'am.

319
00:22:12,484 --> 00:22:13,610
It's fine.

320
00:22:17,114 --> 00:22:19,283
It was nice to hear someone call me that.

321
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:28,667
One moment.

322
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:31,170
Gosh.

323
00:22:31,253 --> 00:22:32,171
It's fine.

324
00:22:32,254 --> 00:22:33,505
I'll do it myself.

325
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:36,717
You could get hurt
if you trip on your shoelaces.

326
00:22:37,718 --> 00:22:38,802
You should wear

327
00:22:39,303 --> 00:22:40,971
shoes without laces from now on.

328
00:22:43,557 --> 00:22:46,351
This is the first pair of shoes
my son bought me.

329
00:22:52,566 --> 00:22:53,567
Gosh.

330
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,903
You didn't have to prepare a gift.

331
00:22:55,986 --> 00:22:56,986
Open it.

332
00:23:00,532 --> 00:23:02,159
My goodness.

333
00:23:02,993 --> 00:23:04,369
They're beautiful.

334
00:23:04,828 --> 00:23:06,246
Thank you, son.

335
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:11,794
When I'm wearing these,

336
00:23:13,045 --> 00:23:15,798
it feels like my son is still with me.

337
00:23:28,977 --> 00:23:30,145
I'm sure your son…

338
00:23:32,898 --> 00:23:36,026
wishes for your health and well-being.

339
00:23:38,195 --> 00:23:40,531
Right. Thank you.

340
00:23:41,907 --> 00:23:43,075
If I may,

341
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,454
why did you report that bag of money?

342
00:23:48,413 --> 00:23:49,706
You should've just kept it.

343
00:23:54,837 --> 00:23:57,589
Because it felt like
a punishment from the heavens.

344
00:23:59,925 --> 00:24:00,926
A punishment?

345
00:24:01,635 --> 00:24:05,472
A punishment for having failed
to save my own son.

346
00:24:10,561 --> 00:24:13,730
It felt like I was being paid
in exchange for my son's life,

347
00:24:15,357 --> 00:24:16,400
so I didn't want it.

348
00:24:19,361 --> 00:24:23,115
He meant so much more
than all the money in the world.

349
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,121
Well, then.

350
00:25:11,413 --> 00:25:14,666

What is this?

355
00:26:42,504 --> 00:26:44,006
Have you been digging up dirt on me?

356
00:26:45,382 --> 00:26:48,510
All the pets we raised in this house

357
00:26:48,593 --> 00:26:50,387
died very quickly.

358
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,680
And I know the reason why

359
00:26:53,223 --> 00:26:56,143
because I'm your parent.

360

And now you're going after people...

361
00:26:59,396 --> 00:27:01,690
Is that why you sent me abroad
when I was a child

362
00:27:01,773 --> 00:27:03,191
and kept tabs on me?

363
00:27:03,275 --> 00:27:04,484
Were you ashamed of me?

364
00:27:07,154 --> 00:27:08,196
Or…

365
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,576
did I scare you?

366
00:27:14,953 --> 00:27:16,371
When I was young,

367
00:27:16,872 --> 00:27:19,291
I used to love
reading books about royalty.

368
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,879
I could relate to them.

369
00:27:27,716 --> 00:27:29,092
In a royal family,

370
00:27:30,177 --> 00:27:31,720
blood-related siblings

371
00:27:32,012 --> 00:27:34,639
were adversaries
who had to fight to the death.

372
00:27:39,978 --> 00:27:41,438
Their fathers were no exception.

373
00:28:28,026 --> 00:28:30,404
Are you out of your mind,
you crazy bastard?

374
00:28:59,808 --> 00:29:01,643
Once again,

375
00:29:01,726 --> 00:29:04,354
I was the one who decided
whether someone lives or dies.

376
00:29:08,567 --> 00:29:11,278
They call you the judge and the savior,

377
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,572
but you're nothing but an illusion.

378
00:29:14,781 --> 00:29:16,867
Both judgment and salvation

379
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,410
are mine to give,

380
00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:19,953
not you.

381
00:29:38,805 --> 00:29:40,807
- Yes, Director?
<i>- Mr. Park.</i>

382
00:29:41,266 --> 00:29:42,726
Our station received a tip-off

383
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,603
from Detective An Ji-hyeong

384
00:29:44,686 --> 00:29:47,689
<i>that he had a video
of Jeong Gyu-cheol being murdered.</i>

385
00:29:47,772 --> 00:29:48,772
And?

386
00:29:48,815 --> 00:29:51,693
<i>He claims that the person who murdered him</i>

387
00:29:51,776 --> 00:29:53,820
is you, Mr. Park.

388
00:29:56,114 --> 00:29:58,575
<i>It looks like that video
will be aired on tonight's broadcast.</i>

389
00:29:58,658 --> 00:30:00,035
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

390
00:30:00,118 --> 00:30:01,745
<i>I tried to stop it.</i>

391
00:30:01,828 --> 00:30:02,828
All right.

392
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:05,290
Thank you for telling me.

393
00:30:18,011 --> 00:30:20,055
MR. PARK TAE-U

394
00:30:25,393 --> 00:30:26,978
<i>Have you dealt with An Ji-hyeong?</i>

395
00:30:27,062 --> 00:30:28,688
Are you looking for me? How sweet.

396
00:30:31,107 --> 00:30:32,859
- Who are you?
<i>- Me?</i>

397
00:30:35,987 --> 00:30:37,405
An Ji-hyeong.

398
00:30:55,048 --> 00:30:55,882
No way.

399
00:30:55,966 --> 00:30:57,133
Gosh.

400
00:30:57,676 --> 00:30:59,844
You seem to be on the slow side, Mr. Park.

401
00:31:02,681 --> 00:31:04,224
Why don't we meet?

402
00:31:04,683 --> 00:31:05,976
<i>I'll text you a location.</i>

403
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:07,852
That's not how it works.

404
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,564
You suggested it.
Shouldn't you come to me?

405
00:31:14,985 --> 00:31:16,653
Then where should I go?

406
00:31:17,487 --> 00:31:18,738
Come down to the station.

407
00:31:18,822 --> 00:31:19,906
<i>The police station.</i>

408
00:31:21,616 --> 00:31:22,617
Right.

409
00:31:23,577 --> 00:31:26,204
All your wrongdoings
must make you scared to come here.

410
00:31:31,251 --> 00:31:33,253
<i>Let's see, then.</i>

411
00:31:33,587 --> 00:31:36,214
I'll go to where you are
after the evening news is over.

412
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:38,049
I couldn't help but notice

413
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,760
that you only wore luxury brands.

414
00:31:41,261 --> 00:31:42,512
I'll specially prepare

415
00:31:42,971 --> 00:31:44,931
a pair of German handcuffs for you.

416
00:31:45,015 --> 00:31:48,393
- You son of a bitch...
- What a dirty mouth.

417
00:31:49,811 --> 00:31:50,811
Name.

418
00:31:51,187 --> 00:31:52,981
- You caught me.
- Answer me.

419
00:31:55,358 --> 00:31:56,401
You go catch them.

420
00:32:02,073 --> 00:32:04,784
He's doing all the work he hasn't done
for the last 12 years,

421
00:32:04,868 --> 00:32:05,869
all in this week.

422
00:32:06,244 --> 00:32:07,370
But what's this?

423
00:32:08,872 --> 00:32:11,875
Why do I get the feeling
that something's about to go wrong?

424
00:32:13,084 --> 00:32:14,502
It doesn't feel right.

425
00:32:19,716 --> 00:32:20,716
Hello?

426
00:32:21,468 --> 00:32:22,719
Yes, Commissioner General.

427
00:32:24,387 --> 00:32:25,430
An Ji-hyeong?

428
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,644
THE PEOPLE'S POLICE

429
00:32:40,403 --> 00:32:42,155
- It was so tough in there.
- Are you okay?

430
00:32:42,238 --> 00:32:43,448
Goodness.

431
00:33:01,466 --> 00:33:02,467
Well then,

432
00:33:03,259 --> 00:33:04,928
I'll leave you to it, Mr. Park.

433
00:33:06,846 --> 00:33:08,390
Thank you, Commissioner General.

434
00:33:14,896 --> 00:33:16,773
I didn't expect you
to come all the way here.

435
00:33:19,192 --> 00:33:21,986
We truly have a special bond.

436
00:33:22,779 --> 00:33:24,364
It's more like a curse.

437
00:33:28,952 --> 00:33:31,621
My guess is that
you aren't here to turn yourself in.

438
00:33:31,705 --> 00:33:32,789
So why are you here?

439
00:33:36,459 --> 00:33:38,420
I want to negotiate a deal with you.

440
00:33:38,503 --> 00:33:39,587
What?

441
00:33:40,088 --> 00:33:41,715
What is it that you want?

442
00:33:41,798 --> 00:33:42,841
Money?

443
00:33:43,466 --> 00:33:44,509
Prestige?

444
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:45,759
Connections?

445
00:33:47,846 --> 00:33:50,515
Why don't you read through this
and sign it?

446
00:33:52,851 --> 00:33:54,144
If you just look the other way,

447
00:33:54,227 --> 00:33:56,896
you'll get many more benefits
in the years to come.

448
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,566
You could even end up
sitting in this office

449
00:33:59,649 --> 00:34:02,026
if you swallow your pride
and cozy up to me.

450
00:34:19,961 --> 00:34:23,214
I don't need things
like money or prestige.

451
00:34:28,344 --> 00:34:30,597
Then what is it that you want?

452
00:34:32,098 --> 00:34:33,099
You.

453
00:34:36,561 --> 00:34:38,146
This is all I have.

454
00:34:40,648 --> 00:34:42,328
I want you to bet everything you have too.

455
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,572
What do you get out of doing all this?

456
00:34:47,697 --> 00:34:50,825
The satisfaction of teaching
a maniac who thinks he's a god

457
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:54,913
that he's nothing more
than a crazed lunatic.

458
00:34:56,122 --> 00:34:58,374
This entire country is my playground.

459
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:01,002
You're just a stray dog
running about in it,

460
00:35:01,085 --> 00:35:02,545
having forgotten your place.

461
00:35:02,629 --> 00:35:04,631
I'll shit all over your playground then.

462
00:35:04,714 --> 00:35:07,926
Putting down a stray dog like you
isn't a big deal for me.

463
00:35:08,968 --> 00:35:10,261
If you keep this up...

464
00:35:10,345 --> 00:35:11,888
The worst that happens is I die.

465
00:35:15,558 --> 00:35:17,227
You must think you have nine lives.

466
00:35:18,978 --> 00:35:20,063
Nice.

467
00:35:20,146 --> 00:35:22,690
I see that you're not completely clueless.

468
00:35:24,567 --> 00:35:25,693
Let's put an end…

469
00:35:27,987 --> 00:35:30,031
to our cursed bond in this life.

470
00:35:30,114 --> 00:35:31,324
It'll happen…

471
00:35:34,035 --> 00:35:35,245
whether you want it to or not.

472
00:35:35,662 --> 00:35:37,302
Meet me on the first floor in 30 minutes.

473
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:39,374
I'll cuff you then.

474
00:35:49,008 --> 00:35:51,678
I'll have Detective Lee take care of this.

475
00:35:59,727 --> 00:36:00,728
Yes, sir.

476
00:36:13,491 --> 00:36:14,534
Understood.

477
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:42,270
<i>A man was found dead
after having bled to death</i>

478
00:36:42,353 --> 00:36:43,938
<i>on a deserted road.</i>

479
00:36:44,355 --> 00:36:48,359
<i>The driver was found
with a stab wound on his neck.</i>

480
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:52,071
<i>He was found to have been drunk
at the time of his passing.</i>

481
00:36:52,155 --> 00:36:53,239
I've heated it up.

482
00:36:53,323 --> 00:36:55,301
- Caring, aren't I?
- <i>There were no security cameras.</i>

483
00:36:55,325 --> 00:36:57,785
- Right. Enjoy it.
<i>- Furthermore, the car's dashcam</i>

484
00:36:57,869 --> 00:36:59,787
<i>was missing its memory card.</i>

485
00:37:00,246 --> 00:37:02,123
<i>To help solve the case,</i>

486
00:37:02,206 --> 00:37:04,292
- It's about to begin.
<i>- Police are waiting for</i>

487
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:06,878
- That's right.
<i>- Possible witnesses to come forward.</i>

488
00:37:06,961 --> 00:37:09,714
MAN IN HIS FORTIES
FOUND DEAD ON A DESERTED ROAD

489
00:37:09,797 --> 00:37:10,797
<i>This just in.</i>

490
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,592
<i>Park Tae-u, Taekang's CEO,</i>

491
00:37:12,675 --> 00:37:15,070
<i>will be turning himself in
for the murder of Jeong Gyu-cheol,</i>

492
00:37:15,094 --> 00:37:16,387
<i>the serial killer.</i>

493
00:37:16,471 --> 00:37:18,765
- What the…
<i>- More from our reporter at the scene.</i>

494
00:37:20,642 --> 00:37:22,018
- There he is.
- Here he comes.

495
00:37:34,155 --> 00:37:37,408
I murdered Jeong Gyu-cheol…

496
00:37:39,827 --> 00:37:41,747
a serial killer
who took the lives of 15 victims.

497
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:46,376
<i>A few days ago…</i>

498
00:37:46,459 --> 00:37:48,139
TAEKANG CEO PARK'S URGENT PRESS CONFERENCE

499
00:37:48,169 --> 00:37:49,212
<i>…I was kidnapped.</i>

500
00:37:49,295 --> 00:37:51,839
<i>I was taken somewhere,
not knowing what was going on.</i>

501
00:37:51,923 --> 00:37:54,008
<i>I only found out after I got there</i>

502
00:37:54,092 --> 00:37:56,636
<i>that the man who kidnapped me
was Jeong Gyu-cheol,</i>

503
00:37:58,346 --> 00:38:00,598
<i>the serial killer
who took 15 people's lives.</i>

504
00:38:01,432 --> 00:38:02,892
<i>That's when I realized</i>

505
00:38:03,393 --> 00:38:06,020
that I was given

506
00:38:06,688 --> 00:38:08,439
the first and final chance

507
00:38:08,815 --> 00:38:10,483
to bring that serial killer to justice.

508
00:38:10,566 --> 00:38:13,194
Are you saying you killed him
to punish him for his crimes?

509
00:38:13,903 --> 00:38:15,571
I was left with two options.

510
00:38:15,655 --> 00:38:18,783
Kill him or be killed by him.

511
00:38:18,866 --> 00:38:20,368
That was it.

512
00:38:21,077 --> 00:38:22,412
And I felt

513
00:38:24,038 --> 00:38:26,249
that it was my responsibility

514
00:38:27,834 --> 00:38:29,794
to put a stop to his senseless killings.

515
00:38:29,877 --> 00:38:32,171
Then where is Jeong Gyu-cheol's body?

516
00:38:33,256 --> 00:38:34,298
That's the one thing

517
00:38:34,924 --> 00:38:36,384
I'm unsure of.

518
00:38:36,843 --> 00:38:38,720
I thought I had killed him

519
00:38:38,803 --> 00:38:41,931
while I was struggling against him.

520
00:38:42,015 --> 00:38:45,018
I was deeply confused when I saw the news

521
00:38:45,643 --> 00:38:47,562
that his body hadn't been found.

522
00:38:47,645 --> 00:38:50,648
<i>I offer my sincerest apologies</i>

523
00:38:51,024 --> 00:38:53,151
<i>for letting down
the people of this country.</i>

524
00:38:59,657 --> 00:39:01,451
And I don't know when it will be,

525
00:39:01,534 --> 00:39:04,245
but if I ever get another chance,

526
00:39:04,662 --> 00:39:07,165
<i>I will follow my life motto</i>

527
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:10,293
<i>and give back</i>

528
00:39:11,836 --> 00:39:13,421
<i>as much as I have received.</i>

529
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,095
<i>Are you saying
your actions were justified?</i>

530
00:39:23,056 --> 00:39:24,724
<i>That was the report from the scene.</i>

531
00:39:24,807 --> 00:39:26,893
We will now show you exclusive footage

532
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:30,897
that allegedly shows Mr. Park
murdering Jeong Gyu-cheol.

533
00:39:34,692 --> 00:39:37,820
EXCLUSIVE FOOTAGE
OF PARK TAE-U KILLING JEONG GYU-CHEOL

534
00:39:42,617 --> 00:39:46,120
<i>As you can see,
that's all there is to the footage.</i>

535
00:39:46,204 --> 00:39:47,121
What?

536
00:39:47,205 --> 00:39:49,791
<i>This footage isn't enough
to be put forward as evidence</i>

537
00:39:49,874 --> 00:39:52,001
<i>that Mr. Park murdered Jeong Gyu-cheol.</i>

538
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:55,379
<i>We are only left with suspicions
that he may still be alive.</i>

539
00:39:55,838 --> 00:39:59,342
<i>The footage only proves
that Mr. Park had been kidnapped,</i>

540
00:39:59,425 --> 00:40:01,052
<i>as he has previously stated…</i>

541
00:40:01,135 --> 00:40:03,846
We've already decided
to dismiss all your charges.

542
00:40:04,597 --> 00:40:06,724
I'm sorry to have troubled you today.

543
00:40:06,808 --> 00:40:09,852
Oh, not at all. Please don't say that.

544
00:40:09,936 --> 00:40:12,688
You've done so much for us over the years.

545
00:40:13,189 --> 00:40:14,899
We are forever in your debt.

546
00:40:14,982 --> 00:40:15,982
That's right.

547
00:40:19,612 --> 00:40:20,738
MEDIA MANAGEMENT MANUAL

548
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,284
Tell every media outlet
that we'll pull all our ads

549
00:40:25,368 --> 00:40:28,162
if they write
a single negative thing about us!

550
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:30,581
Park Tae-u is innocent!

551
00:40:30,665 --> 00:40:32,583
- He's innocent!
- He's innocent!

552
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:34,168
All members of our party

553
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:38,381
- believe that Mr. Park Tae-u is innocent!
- Believe that Mr. Park Tae-u is innocent!

554
00:40:38,464 --> 00:40:40,341
Many civic groups and politicians

555
00:40:40,424 --> 00:40:42,385
have expressed
their support for Mr. Park Tae-u.

556
00:40:42,468 --> 00:40:44,846
You fabricated evidence
and leaked it to the press.

557
00:40:44,929 --> 00:40:46,639
Ruin your life all you want.

558
00:40:46,722 --> 00:40:49,016
But why drag me into this?

559
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,394
I didn't fabricate evidence.

560
00:40:51,477 --> 00:40:52,979
Why do the press and the police

561
00:40:53,646 --> 00:40:56,399
keep saying that all the evidence
against Park Tae-u is fabricated?

562
00:40:56,482 --> 00:40:59,652
That's why people like Park Tae-u
think the entire world is a joke.

563
00:40:59,735 --> 00:41:00,735
What did you say?

564
00:41:01,112 --> 00:41:03,072
Please calm down, sir.
He was only trying to…

565
00:41:03,781 --> 00:41:05,741
You'll both be fired!

566
00:41:06,951 --> 00:41:08,202
Chief!

567
00:41:11,497 --> 00:41:14,217
<i>Reports of Jeong Gyu-cheol sightings
have continued to flow in today.</i>

568
00:41:14,292 --> 00:41:15,793
<i>Was he truly murdered?</i>

569
00:41:15,877 --> 00:41:17,670
<i>With Jeong Gyu-cheol's body missing,</i>

570
00:41:17,753 --> 00:41:20,256
<i>Mr. Park Tae-u is scheduled
to be released today</i>

571
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:23,759
<i>due to a lack of circumstantial evidence
backing his admission of guilt.</i>

572
00:41:31,684 --> 00:41:33,269
It was a great story.

573
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,520
But

574
00:41:36,272 --> 00:41:37,857
I decide how it ends.

575
00:41:41,777 --> 00:41:44,155
There's even a greater ending
waiting for you.

576
00:41:44,655 --> 00:41:46,866
I always give back as much as I receive.

577
00:42:03,466 --> 00:42:05,968
- Park Tae-u!
- Park Tae-u!

578
00:42:06,469 --> 00:42:09,347
- Park Tae-u!
- Park Tae-u!

579
00:42:09,764 --> 00:42:15,853
- Park Tae-u!
- Park Tae-u!

580
00:42:17,772 --> 00:42:20,858
Sir. Should I delay
your flight to the States?

581
00:42:22,193 --> 00:42:24,028
No. Proceed as planned.

582
00:42:24,403 --> 00:42:25,403
Yes, sir.

583
00:42:44,966 --> 00:42:45,967
Go ahead.

584
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:46,884
<i>Mr. Park.</i>

585
00:42:47,009 --> 00:42:49,409
There weren't any copies of the video
in An Ji-hyeong's home.

586
00:42:50,429 --> 00:42:52,515
And I've managed to capture him.

587
00:42:54,433 --> 00:42:55,851
Keep him alive.

588
00:42:55,935 --> 00:42:58,020
I'm going to deal with him myself.

589
00:42:58,104 --> 00:42:59,104
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

590
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:45,359
What's going on?

591
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,617
<i>Park Tae-u.</i>

592
00:43:53,701 --> 00:43:55,995
<i>I know you killed
more than just Jeong Gyu-cheol.</i>

593
00:43:56,078 --> 00:43:58,831
<i>You also killed Park Jin-tae,
Song Jae-seop, Cho Tae-sang,</i>

594
00:43:58,914 --> 00:44:02,251
<i>Jang Geon-u, Lee Ji-su, and Lee Su-yeon.</i>

595
00:44:04,128 --> 00:44:06,422
<i>You will pay for your sins.</i>

596
00:44:06,505 --> 00:44:07,590
Who are you?

597
00:44:16,015 --> 00:44:17,558
What the hell?

598
00:44:17,641 --> 00:44:18,641
What's going on?

599
00:44:21,645 --> 00:44:24,732
<i>You killed your brother Park Jin-tae
and disguised it as an accident.</i>

600
00:44:24,815 --> 00:44:27,026
<i>And then,
to distract the press and the public</i>

601
00:44:27,109 --> 00:44:29,111
<i>from taking an interest in his death,</i>

602
00:44:29,195 --> 00:44:31,614
<i>you offered Song Jae-seop
three billion won,</i>

603
00:44:31,697 --> 00:44:33,057
<i>which you knew he couldn't refuse.</i>

604
00:44:33,115 --> 00:44:35,785
<i>You had him jump from 8 000 m up
without a parachute</i>

605
00:44:35,868 --> 00:44:37,620
<i>to his death.</i>

606
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:41,624
<i>This plane will explode in 30 seconds,</i>

607
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:43,793
<i>just like when Park Jin-tae died.</i>

608
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,460
What?

609
00:44:45,503 --> 00:44:49,215
<i>Song Jae-seop jumped without a parachute,
but I'll give you a chance.</i>

610
00:44:49,298 --> 00:44:52,843
<i>Jump off this plane with a parachute
if you wish to live.</i>

611
00:44:52,968 --> 00:44:53,969
A parachute?

612
00:45:16,867 --> 00:45:17,867
Damn it.

613
00:45:20,996 --> 00:45:22,415
Where's the parachute?

614
00:45:23,707 --> 00:45:24,707
Shit!

615
00:47:31,627 --> 00:47:32,627
What the hell?

616
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:35,548
What are you doing here?

617
00:47:46,141 --> 00:47:48,185
<i>But if I ever get another chance…</i>

618
00:47:48,269 --> 00:47:49,103
ONE WEEK AGO

619
00:47:49,186 --> 00:47:51,855
<i>…I will follow my life motto</i>

620
00:47:51,939 --> 00:47:52,982
<i>and give back…</i>

621
00:47:53,065 --> 00:47:55,192
TAEKANG CEO PARK'S URGENT PRESS CONFERENCE

622
00:47:55,276 --> 00:47:56,694
<i>…as much as I have received.</i>

623
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,492
<i>He's acting exactly
the way I expected him to.</i>

624
00:48:04,326 --> 00:48:05,869
<i>Thank you, Park Tae-u.</i>

625
00:48:05,953 --> 00:48:08,706
<i>You've raised the stakes for this round.</i>

626
00:48:09,623 --> 00:48:11,375
<i>Since the world
won't bring you to justice,</i>

627
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:14,837
<i>I'll use their memories
to bring you to justice myself.</i>

628
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:18,007
The only thing we can trust
in our line of work is this.

629
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:22,469
This hard drive contains
all the dirt we collected on our clients.

630
00:48:33,856 --> 00:48:36,275
All of your sins

631
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:38,360
will find their way back to you.

632
00:48:43,991 --> 00:48:45,492
<i>Through Park Jin-tae's memory,</i>

633
00:48:45,576 --> 00:48:49,079
<i>I learned that Park Tae-u
stored narcotics in his fountain pen.</i>

634
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:52,499
<i>I swapped them out with sleeping pills.</i>

635
00:48:52,583 --> 00:48:54,710
And I've managed to capture him.

636
00:48:54,793 --> 00:48:56,253
<i>Keep him alive.</i>

637
00:48:56,337 --> 00:48:58,297
<i>I'm going to deal with him myself.</i>

638
00:48:59,298 --> 00:49:00,298
Yes, sir.

639
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:12,227
<i>Using Lee Ju-hun's memory,</i>

640
00:49:12,311 --> 00:49:14,229
<i>I installed a bomb in the plane's engine</i>

641
00:49:14,313 --> 00:49:15,689
<i>and made the plane take off.</i>

642
00:49:22,237 --> 00:49:24,406
<i>After that, I used Song Jae-seop's memory</i>

643
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:26,617
<i>to throw a counterpunch.</i>

644
00:49:27,242 --> 00:49:29,370
<i>This will make a bigger impact</i>

645
00:49:29,453 --> 00:49:31,580
<i>after Park Tae-u
raised the stakes himself.</i>

646
00:49:31,664 --> 00:49:34,792
We'll now show you the videos
related to Mr. Park Tae-u.

EVIDENCE OF PARK TAE-U'S MURDERS SECURED

648
00:49:39,421 --> 00:49:40,714
<i>Isn't this your brother?</i>

649
00:49:44,259 --> 00:49:45,427
<i>Brother, my ass.</i>

650
00:49:47,262 --> 00:49:49,056
<i>Make his death look like an accident.</i>

651
00:49:51,517 --> 00:49:52,685
Along with the video

652
00:49:52,768 --> 00:49:56,063
of Mr. Park Tae-u ordering a hit
on his brother Park Jin-tae,

653
00:49:56,146 --> 00:49:59,608
a video of him confessing to murder
was also uploaded.

654
00:49:59,692 --> 00:50:02,528
<i>But no matter how many people
I ran over after that,</i>

655
00:50:02,611 --> 00:50:04,738
<i>I couldn't experience
the sensation I had felt then.</i>

656
00:50:04,822 --> 00:50:06,949
<i>How did you know
that I killed Park Jin-tae?</i>

657
00:50:07,032 --> 00:50:07,908
<i>Along with the videos,</i>

658
00:50:07,991 --> 00:50:09,493
<i>there was a release of evidence</i>

659
00:50:09,576 --> 00:50:12,913
<i>proving that the Commissioner General
and high-ranking police officers</i>

660
00:50:12,996 --> 00:50:16,041
<i>covered up Mr. Park Tae-u's crimes
in exchange for bribes.</i>

661
00:51:19,188 --> 00:51:20,272
What the hell?

662
00:51:21,982 --> 00:51:23,275
What are you doing here?

663
00:51:31,992 --> 00:51:33,786
You're not the one who gets to decide

664
00:51:34,536 --> 00:51:35,621
how this story ends.

665
00:51:38,081 --> 00:51:39,750
Every good story

666
00:51:41,001 --> 00:51:42,461
always has a twist.

667
00:52:16,453 --> 00:52:18,914
You acted as if you were a god.

668
00:52:19,832 --> 00:52:21,124
How do you feel now?

669
00:52:26,755 --> 00:52:28,298
You killed Ji-su.

670
00:52:28,382 --> 00:52:29,716
You murdered her!

671
00:52:36,974 --> 00:52:38,141
Park Tae-u,

672
00:52:38,225 --> 00:52:39,643
let's go to hell together.

673
00:53:12,801 --> 00:53:13,886
Whatever.

674
00:53:14,678 --> 00:53:16,722
Screw Death's rules!

675
00:53:17,389 --> 00:53:18,389
I don't give a fuck.

676
00:53:18,432 --> 00:53:20,267
