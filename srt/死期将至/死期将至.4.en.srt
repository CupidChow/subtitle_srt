EPISODE 4
THE REASON YOU'RE AFRAID OF DEATH

2
00:00:53,765 --> 00:00:54,850
Where's the baby's mother?

3
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:07,195
My baby.

4
00:01:08,446 --> 00:01:09,447
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,367
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:12,742 --> 00:01:13,952
I'm so sorry.

7
00:01:14,452 --> 00:01:16,162
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:16,663 --> 00:01:18,540
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:18,623 --> 00:01:19,666
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:21,293 --> 00:01:22,294
<i>My money.</i>

11
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:24,254
<i>My ten billion won.</i>

12
00:01:35,557 --> 00:01:37,809
<i>This woman must be the baby's mother.</i>

13
00:01:38,643 --> 00:01:42,814
<i>The answer was "November 19, World Day</i>
<i>for the Prevention of Child Abuse."</i>

14
00:01:42,898 --> 00:01:45,400
<i>Did you know that every five minutes,</i>

15
00:01:45,483 --> 00:01:48,862
<i>a child somewhere in the world</i>
<i>dies due to abuse?</i>

16
00:01:49,362 --> 00:01:51,364
Why won't you shut up and sleep?

17
00:01:51,698 --> 00:01:54,618
I can't even have a fucking cup of coffee
because of you!

18
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,792
<i>What's wrong with her?</i>

19
00:02:17,682 --> 00:02:19,309
-You're home.
-Feed him.

20
00:02:24,397 --> 00:02:25,899
Why are you lying down?

21
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:27,484
It's time for your meal.

22
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,362
<i>The dad seems nice, thankfully.</i>

23
00:02:30,737 --> 00:02:33,323
<i>Hey, your wife is insane.</i>

24
00:02:33,406 --> 00:02:34,824
<i>-Did you know that?</i>
-What theâ€¦

25
00:02:35,825 --> 00:02:37,577
This expired four months ago.

26
00:02:37,661 --> 00:02:38,828
It's fine. He won't die.

27
00:02:45,043 --> 00:02:46,044
I guess you're right.

28
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:49,214
It's not like you can taste it.

29
00:02:49,297 --> 00:02:50,799
<i>What's wrong with these people?</i>

30
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:54,260
Here comes a tasty meal.

31
00:02:54,594 --> 00:02:55,887
-So yummy.
<i>-I won't eat it.</i>

32
00:02:56,262 --> 00:02:57,347
<i>I won't!</i>

33
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,016
Are you kidding me?

34
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:03,436
Stop spitting it out, damn it.

35
00:03:03,853 --> 00:03:06,481
Why can't I rest when I'm home, you brat?

36
00:03:07,065 --> 00:03:08,775
You're pissing me off!

37
00:03:16,324 --> 00:03:18,076
What's the police doing here again?

38
00:03:18,868 --> 00:03:20,286
<i>What? The police?</i>

39
00:03:20,662 --> 00:03:21,705
The police are here?

40
00:03:22,414 --> 00:03:23,623
Let's get this off you.

41
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,636
I'm here with child protective services

42
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,388
due to a report of child abuse.

43
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:40,557
Excuse me? Did you just say child abuse?

44
00:03:41,224 --> 00:03:42,183
What report?

45
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:43,727
The pediatric hospital

46
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,312
reported that they saw
signs of abuse on the child's body.

47
00:03:46,396 --> 00:03:47,230
What?

48
00:03:47,313 --> 00:03:48,565
We'll need to take a look.

49
00:03:49,566 --> 00:03:50,692
Excuse me.

50
00:03:54,404 --> 00:03:55,363
Here.

51
00:03:57,032 --> 00:03:58,283
Why would they say that?

52
00:03:58,366 --> 00:03:59,659
I'll take a look at your child.

53
00:03:59,743 --> 00:04:01,870
<i>I think my rib is broken.</i>

54
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,205
<i>My heart also hurts very much.</i>

55
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:05,165
Honey.

56
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,792
How could they suspect us
of something like this?

57
00:04:07,876 --> 00:04:09,961
Does it look like we'd beat our own child?

58
00:04:16,634 --> 00:04:17,761
KIM SEOK-JAE
NATIONAL CENTER FOR CHILD WELFARE

59
00:04:17,844 --> 00:04:19,471
I also work in child welfare.

60
00:04:32,442 --> 00:04:34,360
There must have been a misunderstanding.

61
00:04:35,904 --> 00:04:38,573
We were just following procedure here.

62
00:04:38,948 --> 00:04:40,992
Yes. Please don't be upset.

63
00:04:41,076 --> 00:04:41,910
Right.

64
00:04:42,494 --> 00:04:43,536
Let's go to the next house.

65
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:45,038
<i>No, you can't leave!</i>

66
00:04:47,665 --> 00:04:50,627
Gosh, he sure has a loud voice.

67
00:04:51,044 --> 00:04:52,462
You'll give your mom so much trouble.

68
00:04:53,213 --> 00:04:54,506
<i>Please help me.</i>

69
00:04:55,298 --> 00:04:56,674
<i>Help!</i>

70
00:05:03,306 --> 00:05:04,557
We're sorry for the intrusion.

71
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,706
What did I ever do
to have the cops called on us?

72
00:05:28,957 --> 00:05:32,043
Who the hell do you think you are?

73
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,140
You know what?

74
00:05:45,974 --> 00:05:48,351
Nothing has worked out for me
ever since you were born.

75
00:05:49,561 --> 00:05:51,146
It's all your fault.

76
00:06:40,028 --> 00:06:42,405
Why wasn't there
a memory orb for that baby?

77
00:06:42,864 --> 00:06:44,032
Since he never had

78
00:06:44,365 --> 00:06:45,700
any memories or abilities.

79
00:06:47,368 --> 00:06:49,370
I don't even know that baby's name

80
00:06:49,621 --> 00:06:51,456
since nobody called him by his name!

81
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,543
How can such parents exist?

82
00:06:56,753 --> 00:06:59,088
-If they're parents, they should--
-They should what?

83
00:06:59,172 --> 00:07:00,715
No one is guaranteed anything in life.

84
00:07:00,798 --> 00:07:03,343
You've just been taking
everything for granted.

85
00:07:03,676 --> 00:07:06,638
You didn't care for life
and chose death so flippantly,

86
00:07:06,721 --> 00:07:07,805
but that baby

87
00:07:08,723 --> 00:07:10,308
didn't even get to make a choice.

88
00:07:10,642 --> 00:07:12,352
There are many others like that
in the world.

89
00:07:12,852 --> 00:07:14,020
Damn it!

90
00:07:17,023 --> 00:07:18,107
Shit.

91
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,569
All right.

92
00:07:22,612 --> 00:07:23,655
Hurry and shoot me.

93
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,198
I wonder why you're in such a hurry.

94
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:26,282
Shoot me!

95
00:07:28,493 --> 00:07:31,746
Humans always struggle to live
only after they die,

96
00:07:32,247 --> 00:07:34,165
not while they are still alive.

97
00:07:34,707 --> 00:07:36,292
<i>Just shoot me already.</i>

98
00:07:36,376 --> 00:07:37,502
<i>You can hear me, right?</i>

99
00:07:37,585 --> 00:07:40,922
<i>You don't care at all</i>
<i>what I end up doing anyway.</i>

100
00:07:41,297 --> 00:07:42,382
<i>You're right. </i>

101
00:07:42,465 --> 00:07:44,092
<i>I don't care what you do.</i>

102
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,510
What?

103
00:07:46,094 --> 00:07:46,928
Why not?

104
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:48,721
Seeing your actions thus far,

105
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:51,349
you will end up dying
no matter how much you struggle.

106
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:54,602
But if you ever try to kill someone,

107
00:07:55,812 --> 00:07:57,480
I will intervene.

108
00:07:58,064 --> 00:07:59,482
What do you take me for?

109
00:07:59,816 --> 00:08:01,109
Why would I kill someone?

110
00:08:01,776 --> 00:08:03,528
That won't ever happen,

111
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:05,446
so let's move on to my next life.

112
00:08:06,447 --> 00:08:09,158
Sure. If you want to die that badly.

113
00:08:19,252 --> 00:08:20,795
<i>I need to find the money first.</i>

114
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,089
<i>What's the date today?</i>

115
00:08:24,924 --> 00:08:26,342
<i>Where's my phone?</i>

116
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:29,595
<i>Here it is.</i>

117
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:32,682
<i>"April 6, 8:45 p.m."?</i>

118
00:08:33,224 --> 00:08:35,226
<i>Then the money will be gone in 15 minutes.</i>

119
00:08:35,935 --> 00:08:38,396
<i>And where the hell am I?</i>

120
00:08:55,121 --> 00:08:56,831
I'm sorry!

121
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,338
I'm sorry.

122
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:04,922
No, it's fine.

123
00:09:08,176 --> 00:09:09,135
Damn it.

124
00:09:16,601 --> 00:09:18,603
Wait!

125
00:09:18,686 --> 00:09:20,021
Could you hold on?

126
00:09:20,104 --> 00:09:21,898
Please wait. I need to get my things.

127
00:09:21,981 --> 00:09:23,941
One, two, zero, one.

128
00:09:28,237 --> 00:09:29,322
It's mine.

129
00:09:29,614 --> 00:09:30,907
Keep up the good work.

130
00:09:38,706 --> 00:09:40,083
That was close.

131
00:09:44,128 --> 00:09:45,963
You're one handsome devil.

132
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:47,340
Wait.

133
00:09:47,757 --> 00:09:49,217
Why is my voice so soothing?

134
00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:03,940
This guy

135
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,608
must be a model.

136
00:10:14,742 --> 00:10:15,910
Come on.

137
00:10:20,706 --> 00:10:22,959
<i>My name is Jang Geon-u. I'm 24 years old.</i>

138
00:10:23,334 --> 00:10:25,670
-Happy birthday, Geon-u!
-<i>Since my childhood,</i>

139
00:10:25,753 --> 00:10:28,005
<i>I was loved by everyone</i>
<i>because of my looks.</i>

140
00:10:28,673 --> 00:10:30,758
<i>I was often the first crush of girls</i>

141
00:10:30,842 --> 00:10:32,677
<i>that many boys had crushes on.</i>

142
00:10:33,302 --> 00:10:36,472
<i>Money came easily thanks to my good looks,</i>

143
00:10:36,556 --> 00:10:40,268
<i>and I've been living aimlessly</i>
<i>while modeling to make a living.</i>

144
00:10:46,441 --> 00:10:49,652
He has money as well as good looks.

145
00:10:55,366 --> 00:10:56,492
No way!

146
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:06,836
It's gold.

147
00:11:09,338 --> 00:11:11,299
The young guy sure has a lot of money.

148
00:11:13,551 --> 00:11:15,052
Look at that.

149
00:11:17,096 --> 00:11:18,598
FIVE-MONTH INFANT FOUND DEAD!
PARENTS ARRESTED FOR ABUSE

150
00:11:21,142 --> 00:11:23,311
So the abuse and murder
came to light in the end.

151
00:11:23,644 --> 00:11:25,688
I wonder how many years they'll serve.

152
00:11:26,522 --> 00:11:28,608
I wish I could go to the police
and testify against them.

153
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,985
Those rotten bastards.

154
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:39,202
"Serial killer at large."

155
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,078
"Arson."

156
00:11:41,162 --> 00:11:42,413
"Traffic accident."

157
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:48,669
I wonder how this man is going to die.

158
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:50,463
Arson?

159
00:11:50,713 --> 00:11:52,006
A traffic accident?

160
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:53,883
Maybe he's terminally ill.

161
00:11:55,885 --> 00:11:57,637
Man, it's such a headache.

162
00:12:05,436 --> 00:12:06,521
"Seok-jin."

163
00:12:08,481 --> 00:12:10,024
Who the heck are you?

164
00:12:11,192 --> 00:12:12,652
-Hello?
<i>-You're coming, right?</i>

165
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:15,821
Where?

166
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:19,158
Where else? The VIP party
we're supposed to attend tonight.

167
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,327
-"The VIP party"?
<i>-That's right.</i>

168
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,703
Hurry up.

169
00:12:22,787 --> 00:12:25,414
All the prettiest girls in Korea
must be gathered here tonight.

170
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,832
Pretty girls?

171
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,086
<i>Right. It would be better to be at a party</i>

172
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:32,171
<i>than to worry about dying.</i>

173
00:12:32,463 --> 00:12:34,090
Sure. I'll be there right away.

174
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:36,759
They say you only live once.

175
00:12:46,894 --> 00:12:48,646
-Bottoms up!
-Cheers!

176
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:57,488
I can usually drink much more than this.

177
00:12:59,156 --> 00:13:00,074
Hey.

178
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,578
Why'd you drink so much
when you're a total lightweight?

179
00:13:03,661 --> 00:13:04,912
I am?

180
00:13:05,705 --> 00:13:06,956
No wonder.

181
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:07,999
Damn it.

182
00:13:08,082 --> 00:13:10,084
The host of tonight's party is here.

183
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:12,003
If you get on his good side,

184
00:13:12,086 --> 00:13:14,630
you could end up modeling for Taekang.

185
00:13:15,298 --> 00:13:16,465
-Taekang?
-Yeah.

186
00:13:17,842 --> 00:13:20,011
<i>Presenting the host of tonight's party,</i>

187
00:13:20,094 --> 00:13:22,305
<i>CEO Park Tae-u.</i>

188
00:13:41,073 --> 00:13:42,033
Sir.

189
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,451
Nice to meet you.

190
00:13:43,534 --> 00:13:44,910
-Long time, no see.
-This is my friend.

191
00:13:45,202 --> 00:13:46,120
He's a model.

192
00:13:46,203 --> 00:13:47,288
-Is that so?
-Yes, sir.

193
00:13:47,622 --> 00:13:48,956
He sure is handsome.

194
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,124
Hey, wait.

195
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,544
Haven't we met before?

196
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:56,213
Well,

197
00:13:57,173 --> 00:13:58,174
I'm not sure.

198
00:13:58,716 --> 00:14:00,009
-I'm sure we've met--
-Gosh.

199
00:14:00,092 --> 00:14:01,636
We've met before.

200
00:14:02,553 --> 00:14:04,055
He seems drunk already.

201
00:14:06,223 --> 00:14:07,558
Enjoy yourself.

202
00:14:08,476 --> 00:14:09,477
Waitâ€¦

203
00:14:16,359 --> 00:14:17,693
Whatever.

204
00:14:18,235 --> 00:14:19,987
Let's forget everythingâ€¦

205
00:14:22,156 --> 00:14:24,116
and party hard!

206
00:14:43,761 --> 00:14:44,595
Hey.

207
00:14:45,137 --> 00:14:45,971
Get up.

208
00:14:46,055 --> 00:14:47,056
Jeez. Hey.

209
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:49,058
What are you doing?
You didn't answer my calls.

210
00:14:53,896 --> 00:14:55,231
<i>This man</i>

211
00:14:56,065 --> 00:14:57,817
<i>must be Jang Geon-u's older brother.</i>

212
00:15:00,986 --> 00:15:02,446
Have you been drinking?

213
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,281
What? Yes. Why do you ask?

214
00:15:05,157 --> 00:15:07,076
Seriously? Hey.

215
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:09,704
You promised to man the cafÃ©
while I went to the States for a week.

216
00:15:10,037 --> 00:15:11,539
-What?
-Pull yourself together.

217
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:13,332
-Wait.
-Get up.

218
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,000
Get up and get washed up.

219
00:15:15,084 --> 00:15:16,419
-Hurry.
-Okay.

220
00:15:21,132 --> 00:15:22,883
What a bother.

221
00:15:34,645 --> 00:15:35,813
Here you go.

222
00:15:37,064 --> 00:15:38,107
Look at you.

223
00:15:38,482 --> 00:15:40,735
Why'd you drink so much
when you're a lightweight?

224
00:15:41,026 --> 00:15:42,486
I'm sorry.

225
00:15:43,446 --> 00:15:45,072
<i>I'll just work today</i>

226
00:15:45,156 --> 00:15:47,992
<i>and leave first thing</i>
<i>when he goes abroad tomorrow.</i>

227
00:15:49,493 --> 00:15:51,662
Let's do some cleaning.

228
00:15:51,746 --> 00:15:52,997
Hey, we've got a customer.

229
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:55,291
Welcome.

230
00:16:23,778 --> 00:16:25,571
<i>You're the only one I love.</i>

231
00:16:25,654 --> 00:16:26,489
<i>I love you.</i>

232
00:16:26,572 --> 00:16:28,991
<i>Right here. This is my boyfriend.</i>

233
00:17:15,204 --> 00:17:16,288
"<i>First Love</i>."

234
00:17:16,914 --> 00:17:19,250
"Written by Lee Ji-su."

235
00:17:21,252 --> 00:17:22,253
Excuse me.

236
00:17:37,852 --> 00:17:39,270
I'll come get it.

237
00:17:43,357 --> 00:17:44,400
Okay.

238
00:18:06,171 --> 00:18:07,298
<i>Let's just end it here.</i>

239
00:18:08,424 --> 00:18:09,925
<i>I've put you through so much.</i>

240
00:18:10,426 --> 00:18:11,427
<i>Have a good life.</i>

241
00:18:24,398 --> 00:18:25,399
What can I get you?

242
00:18:25,482 --> 00:18:27,318
-One hot citron tea, please.
-Sure thing.

243
00:19:10,361 --> 00:19:11,487
Just act natural.

244
00:19:12,446 --> 00:19:13,405
"Enjoy your drink."

245
00:19:14,323 --> 00:19:15,407
Enjoyâ€¦

246
00:19:23,332 --> 00:19:24,500
Enjoy your drink.

247
00:19:29,296 --> 00:19:31,423
I'm so sorry.

248
00:19:34,385 --> 00:19:35,344
There.

249
00:19:38,013 --> 00:19:38,889
Hey.

250
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,183
Do you have a thing for her?

251
00:19:41,517 --> 00:19:42,518
What?

252
00:19:43,644 --> 00:19:44,645
No.

253
00:19:45,646 --> 00:19:46,605
Wait.

254
00:19:48,107 --> 00:19:49,400
Does she come here often?

255
00:19:50,526 --> 00:19:51,527
Almost every day.

256
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,362
She comes around this time
and stays until closing.

257
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,572
Every day?

258
00:19:56,156 --> 00:19:59,118
<i>If she comes here every day,</i>
<i>what about her work?</i>

259
00:19:59,201 --> 00:20:01,036
Right, I hear she's a writer.

260
00:20:02,454 --> 00:20:03,580
-She's a writer?
-Yes.

261
00:20:03,956 --> 00:20:04,832
A novelist.

262
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:06,709
A novelist?

263
00:20:11,547 --> 00:20:13,173
AUTHOR LEE JI-SU

264
00:20:15,426 --> 00:20:18,637
LEE JI-SU'S <i>TO YOU IN THE FUTURE</i>
WINS THE 15TH <i>YEJU DAILY</i> WRITER'S CONTEST

265
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:22,558
"The winning piece, <i>To You in the Future</i>,

266
00:20:22,641 --> 00:20:24,768
was published as a novel."

267
00:20:25,227 --> 00:20:28,605
"When asked who came to mind first
when she won the contest,

268
00:20:28,689 --> 00:20:29,940
Ms. Lee Ji-su answeredâ€¦"

269
00:20:30,691 --> 00:20:32,443
<i>The person who comes to mind?</i>

270
00:20:34,403 --> 00:20:38,741
The only person
who rooted for me and my dream

271
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,410
is my boyfriend.

272
00:20:43,746 --> 00:20:46,999
That's why I thought of him first.

273
00:20:47,624 --> 00:20:49,418
How did your boyfriend react?

274
00:20:52,004 --> 00:20:54,256
He's been going through a lot these days.

275
00:20:54,965 --> 00:20:57,551
I haven't told him I won just yet,

276
00:20:58,719 --> 00:21:01,263
but I'm sure he'll be happy for me
when he hears the news.

277
00:21:03,223 --> 00:21:04,224
<i>Ji-su.</i>

278
00:21:05,225 --> 00:21:06,643
Should I just let you go now?

279
00:21:07,728 --> 00:21:08,937
Look at our relationship.

280
00:21:09,396 --> 00:21:10,481
Are you really okay

281
00:21:12,524 --> 00:21:13,567
with how things are?

282
00:21:14,234 --> 00:21:18,238
<i>Then that envelope must have been</i>
<i>her prize money.</i>

283
00:21:33,629 --> 00:21:34,880
I need to step outside for a bit.

284
00:21:36,423 --> 00:21:38,175
Hey. Where are you going?

00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,018
NEW RELEASES

<i>TO YOU IN THE FUTURE</i>

287
00:22:07,704 --> 00:22:09,623
Here. It's hot citron tea.

288
00:22:12,209 --> 00:22:13,377
Thanks.

289
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:18,090
You're working hard.

290
00:22:19,258 --> 00:22:20,968
The contest deadline is coming up.

291
00:22:24,555 --> 00:22:25,889
By the way, Ji-su,

292
00:22:25,973 --> 00:22:27,891
what's it like to be writing a novel?

293
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:31,436
It feels as if
I'm standing completely naked

294
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,939
in front of the people who read my novel.

295
00:22:34,022 --> 00:22:34,857
What?

296
00:22:36,108 --> 00:22:37,025
Why is that?

297
00:22:37,317 --> 00:22:39,862
Even if what I write is fictitious,

298
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,409
I can't help but write
using my thoughts and experiences.

299
00:22:47,494 --> 00:22:49,454
<i>I finally got to understand</i>

300
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,665
<i>why Ji-su said that</i>

301
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:53,584
<i>as I was reading her novel.</i>

302
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:56,170
<i>It was because</i>
<i>a few of the scenes in her novel</i>

303
00:22:56,545 --> 00:23:00,799
<i>were based on</i>
<i>actual experiences Ji-su and I had.</i>

BH COMMUNICATION NEW EMPLOYEE INTERVIEW

305
00:23:05,888 --> 00:23:06,847
Ms. Lee!

306
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,599
Here's your coffee.

307
00:23:08,682 --> 00:23:09,766
Thank you.

308
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,185
What are you doing this weekend?

309
00:23:11,268 --> 00:23:14,062
I've got two tickets
to the play you wanted to see.

310
00:23:14,521 --> 00:23:15,772
Do you want to go with me?

311
00:23:15,856 --> 00:23:17,149
I have plans this weekend.

312
00:23:17,441 --> 00:23:18,901
What about tonight, then?

313
00:23:21,695 --> 00:23:23,071
Tae-sik tells me

314
00:23:23,655 --> 00:23:26,074
that you're popular
with the men at your workplace.

315
00:23:27,868 --> 00:23:29,161
Why would he tell you that?

316
00:23:30,704 --> 00:23:31,788
Leave me if you want.

317
00:23:33,832 --> 00:23:34,750
What?

318
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,503
But if you do, you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

319
00:23:39,296 --> 00:23:40,422
Because I'll end up

320
00:23:40,964 --> 00:23:44,551
even more successful than anyone
who's hitting on you right now.

321
00:23:45,844 --> 00:23:47,054
And also because

322
00:23:47,804 --> 00:23:50,849
no other guy will love
and cherish you more than I do.

323
00:23:52,017 --> 00:23:53,101
Do you

324
00:23:54,853 --> 00:23:56,063
still love me?

325
00:23:57,356 --> 00:23:58,482
Of course, I do.

326
00:23:59,691 --> 00:24:01,276
-And?
-"And"?

327
00:24:01,443 --> 00:24:03,403
What if I really decide to leave you?

328
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:05,322
I won't let you.

329
00:24:05,822 --> 00:24:07,241
Why would I let go of someone I love?

330
00:24:07,866 --> 00:24:08,909
But the saying goes,

331
00:24:09,326 --> 00:24:11,870
"If you love someone, let them go."

332
00:24:13,247 --> 00:24:14,373
You can do that.

333
00:24:15,082 --> 00:24:15,958
What?

334
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:20,587
When a man says
something like that, he's lying.

335
00:24:20,671 --> 00:24:24,091
A man may give up his life
for the woman he loves,

336
00:24:24,174 --> 00:24:26,301
but he would never give up the woman.

337
00:24:27,427 --> 00:24:31,306
I'm going to stick with you forever
and never let go.

338
00:24:31,848 --> 00:24:32,891
That's so scary.

339
00:24:35,185 --> 00:24:36,186
Come here.

340
00:24:38,355 --> 00:24:39,398
Come on.

341
00:24:48,657 --> 00:24:49,616
You'reâ€¦

342
00:24:51,118 --> 00:24:52,577
the only one I love.

343
00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:53,745
Me too.

344
00:24:55,247 --> 00:24:56,290
You too, what?

345
00:24:57,124 --> 00:24:58,166
I love you.

346
00:25:02,004 --> 00:25:03,005
<i>When he told me</i>

347
00:25:04,214 --> 00:25:07,050
<i>that a man would give up his life</i>
<i>for a woman</i>

348
00:25:07,926 --> 00:25:10,012
<i>but never give her up</i>

349
00:25:11,388 --> 00:25:13,682
<i>and that he'd stick with me forever,</i>

350
00:25:15,142 --> 00:25:16,143
<i>I believed him.</i>

351
00:25:55,057 --> 00:25:56,224
What are you looking at?

352
00:25:58,727 --> 00:25:59,728
Fountain pens.

353
00:26:00,854 --> 00:26:01,688
What for?

354
00:26:02,814 --> 00:26:04,274
They say it's good to have one

355
00:26:04,816 --> 00:26:06,568
when you become a writer.

356
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:08,028
Really?

357
00:26:10,489 --> 00:26:12,866
Then I'll buy you one when that happens.

358
00:26:14,326 --> 00:26:15,619
-Really?
-Sure.

359
00:26:15,744 --> 00:26:17,537
-You mean it, right?
-Of course.

360
00:26:19,664 --> 00:26:20,916
Do you like this one the most?

361
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:27,798
Can you inscribe "Author Lee Ji-su" here?

362
00:26:27,881 --> 00:26:28,715
Sure thing.

363
00:26:29,841 --> 00:26:31,218
<i>That night,</i>

364
00:26:31,301 --> 00:26:34,763
<i>I secretly purchased the fountain pen</i>
<i>that Ji-su had been looking atâ€¦</i>

365
00:26:35,806 --> 00:26:38,266
Thank you. "Author Lee Ji-su."

366
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:41,478
<i>â€¦because I believed</i>
<i>that Ji-su would achieve her dream.</i>

367
00:26:46,608 --> 00:26:49,945
<i>Although I never got to give it to her.</i>

368
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:00,414
Auntie!

369
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,792
What are you doing here, Hui-su?

370
00:27:04,543 --> 00:27:07,295
The two of them were craving bread
at this time of night.

371
00:27:07,379 --> 00:27:08,380
I'm sorry, honey.

372
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,215
Ji-su, you should join us.

373
00:27:10,298 --> 00:27:11,842
It's okay. I'm going to write some more.

374
00:27:11,925 --> 00:27:13,135
Come home before it gets too late.

375
00:27:13,218 --> 00:27:14,136
-Take care.
-Bye.

376
00:27:14,219 --> 00:27:15,178
Let's go.

377
00:27:17,681 --> 00:27:19,933
<i>So he was Ji-su's older brother.</i>

378
00:27:21,435 --> 00:27:24,104
<i>I suspected her</i>
<i>because of my inferiority complex.</i>

379
00:27:24,688 --> 00:27:26,481
I'm an idiot.

380
00:27:29,734 --> 00:27:30,694
Geon-u.

381
00:27:32,154 --> 00:27:33,447
Take good care of the place for me.

382
00:27:33,905 --> 00:27:34,906
Sure.

383
00:27:41,538 --> 00:27:45,250
I guess I'll have to keep the cafÃ© open
for Ji-su's sake.

384
00:27:55,552 --> 00:27:58,680
-Could I have--
-One hot citron tea, right?

385
00:28:00,056 --> 00:28:01,141
That's right.

386
00:28:11,109 --> 00:28:12,569
Here's your citron tea.

387
00:28:14,821 --> 00:28:16,698
I didn't order the cake.

388
00:28:16,823 --> 00:28:17,991
It's on the house.

389
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,784
I'm a fan of your book.

390
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,579
How did you know?

391
00:28:23,497 --> 00:28:25,749
{\an8}<i>TO YOU IN THE FUTURE</i>

392
00:28:25,832 --> 00:28:27,709
{\an8}I really enjoyed <i>To You in the Future,</i>

393
00:28:27,792 --> 00:28:29,419
so I looked up who the author was.

394
00:28:29,503 --> 00:28:30,462
I see.

395
00:28:31,296 --> 00:28:32,255
Thank you.

396
00:28:36,218 --> 00:28:37,093
Actually,

397
00:28:37,761 --> 00:28:40,347
I have an idea
I want to develop into a novel.

398
00:28:42,807 --> 00:28:43,808
Is that so?

399
00:28:46,102 --> 00:28:47,437
What is it about?

400
00:28:49,105 --> 00:28:50,607
May I sit down?

401
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:53,485
Sure.

402
00:28:59,783 --> 00:29:00,617
So my story

403
00:29:00,742 --> 00:29:04,246
is about a man
who experiences a series of deaths.

404
00:29:05,413 --> 00:29:07,582
The man ends up dying.

405
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:11,503
-He goes to the afterlifeâ€¦
<i>-I began to tell her</i>

406
00:29:11,586 --> 00:29:13,630
<i>what I experienced after death</i>

407
00:29:13,713 --> 00:29:15,382
<i>as if it were fictional,</i>

408
00:29:15,465 --> 00:29:17,050
<i>skipping the part about Ji-su and I.</i>

409
00:29:17,133 --> 00:29:18,343
â€¦he gets reincarnatedâ€¦

410
00:29:18,426 --> 00:29:21,846
<i>About how I met Death after I died.</i>

411
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,974
Then, the main characterâ€¦

412
00:29:24,057 --> 00:29:24,891
Hold on.

413
00:29:24,975 --> 00:29:27,102
What did you say your name was?

414
00:29:27,352 --> 00:29:28,478
It's Choiâ€¦

415
00:29:32,357 --> 00:29:33,400
It's Jang Geon-u.

416
00:29:33,483 --> 00:29:34,568
Geon-u.

417
00:29:34,901 --> 00:29:37,112
-That's right.
-You tell your story

418
00:29:37,487 --> 00:29:40,615
so realistically,
as if you've experienced it yourself.

419
00:29:41,157 --> 00:29:43,702
You describe
the protagonist's emotions in detail

420
00:29:43,785 --> 00:29:45,245
as if they're your own.

421
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,499
Is that so?

422
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:52,460
<i>I guess that makes sense.</i>

423
00:29:52,836 --> 00:29:54,379
<i>I</i> did <i>experience it myself.</i>

424
00:29:54,462 --> 00:29:56,298
But this character called "Death"

425
00:29:57,257 --> 00:29:58,258
really is cruel.

426
00:29:58,341 --> 00:29:59,259
Right?

427
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:01,845
Death is completely nuts.

428
00:30:01,928 --> 00:30:03,847
How could it do such an awful thing to him

429
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:05,599
just because he mocked it?

430
00:30:05,682 --> 00:30:08,018
And it keeps saying
that's just how death is.

431
00:30:08,101 --> 00:30:09,894
It's complete nonsense!

432
00:30:15,859 --> 00:30:17,777
-What's wrong?
-It's funny.

433
00:30:18,612 --> 00:30:20,363
It's a character you came up with,

434
00:30:20,447 --> 00:30:22,949
but you're so immersed,
as if you've actually met it.

435
00:30:26,494 --> 00:30:28,413
I must seem pretty weird to you.

436
00:30:29,122 --> 00:30:30,957
No. I like it.

437
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:33,918
Do you have any more of this story?

438
00:30:34,586 --> 00:30:35,420
Yes.

439
00:30:35,545 --> 00:30:37,881
Tell me how it goes later.
I'd love to hear more.

440
00:30:39,257 --> 00:30:40,091
Sure thing.

441
00:30:40,842 --> 00:30:41,885
But wait.

442
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:45,138
What's the protagonist's name?

443
00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:50,018
It'sâ€¦

444
00:30:54,606 --> 00:30:55,607
I stillâ€¦

445
00:30:59,235 --> 00:31:00,737
need to come up with a name.

446
00:31:02,405 --> 00:31:03,406
I don't have one yet.

447
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:13,792
I see.

448
00:31:18,046 --> 00:31:19,089
Ms. Lee.

449
00:31:19,589 --> 00:31:20,840
Could I get an autograph?

450
00:31:22,509 --> 00:31:23,468
Sure.

451
00:31:33,895 --> 00:31:35,188
That fountain penâ€¦

452
00:31:36,272 --> 00:31:37,273
What about it?

453
00:31:38,817 --> 00:31:40,402
It's pretty.

454
00:31:42,445 --> 00:31:43,780
It was a gift from someone.

455
00:31:48,118 --> 00:31:52,080
AUTHOR LEE JI-SU

456
00:31:52,163 --> 00:31:56,459
THE LATE CHOI YEE-JAE

457
00:32:00,714 --> 00:32:01,715
Ji-su.

458
00:32:05,135 --> 00:32:09,055
I think Yee-jae bought this
to give to you as a gift.

459
00:32:34,664 --> 00:32:36,916
AUTHOR LEE JI-SU

460
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,035
<i>From that day onward,</i>

461
00:33:12,535 --> 00:33:15,497
<i>I kept talking to Ji-su</i>
<i>whenever she'd visit the cafÃ©.</i>

462
00:33:15,872 --> 00:33:19,250
<i>I kept telling her</i>
<i>about the deaths I experienced</i>

463
00:33:19,334 --> 00:33:22,170
<i>as if I were writing a novel</i>
<i>just for one person.</i>

464
00:33:22,587 --> 00:33:26,132
But why did the protagonist of your story

465
00:33:26,216 --> 00:33:28,718
never once visit his mother?

466
00:33:30,887 --> 00:33:32,680
I'd visit her every day if it were me.

467
00:33:33,389 --> 00:33:34,557
It's becauseâ€¦

468
00:33:38,394 --> 00:33:40,146
he doesn't think he could stand it.

469
00:33:41,731 --> 00:33:42,982
He thinks it would beâ€¦

470
00:33:45,443 --> 00:33:47,070
too painful to see her again.

471
00:33:52,158 --> 00:33:53,076
What's wrong?

472
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:54,118
You said that

473
00:33:55,328 --> 00:33:57,455
as if it were your own experience again.

474
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,582
Right.

475
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:01,835
I want to hear what happens next,

476
00:34:02,293 --> 00:34:04,045
but it's gotten late already.

477
00:34:06,756 --> 00:34:08,716
I'll get going, then.

478
00:34:43,042 --> 00:34:44,043
Ji-su!

479
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:57,307
Geon-u.

480
00:34:58,308 --> 00:34:59,893
It suddenly started raining.

481
00:35:00,226 --> 00:35:01,352
Take this umbrella.

482
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,605
I'm fine.

483
00:35:03,688 --> 00:35:04,814
You'll catch a cold.

484
00:35:08,443 --> 00:35:09,485
Just take it.

485
00:35:11,487 --> 00:35:12,614
Thank you.

486
00:35:12,989 --> 00:35:14,198
We shouldâ€¦

487
00:35:18,411 --> 00:35:19,537
do this again tomorrow.

488
00:35:20,955 --> 00:35:21,915
Okay.

489
00:35:59,285 --> 00:36:00,828
-I'm so sorry.
-Don't worry about it.

490
00:36:00,912 --> 00:36:01,955
I'll take care of it.

491
00:36:24,769 --> 00:36:25,895
How unfortunate.

492
00:36:25,979 --> 00:36:27,814
I hope she didn't die in the accident.

493
00:36:27,897 --> 00:36:31,109
I know. I think she came here often.

494
00:36:32,694 --> 00:36:33,736
Ji-suâ€¦

495
00:36:42,203 --> 00:36:43,204
<i>TO YOU IN THE FUTURE</i>

496
00:36:43,287 --> 00:36:44,122
<i>Just wait.</i>

497
00:36:44,205 --> 00:36:45,999
The pain that death brings you

498
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:48,251
will only get worse from now on.

499
00:37:09,647 --> 00:37:10,690
It can't be.

500
00:37:11,566 --> 00:37:12,692
You can't come any closer.

501
00:37:13,151 --> 00:37:14,694
How is she doing? Did she survive?

502
00:37:14,777 --> 00:37:16,404
-Step back.
-Tell me if she's okay!

503
00:37:16,487 --> 00:37:17,947
-Is she alive or not?
-Please calm down.

504
00:37:18,031 --> 00:37:19,991
-Move!
-Stop.

505
00:37:20,074 --> 00:37:22,118
-Stay back!
-I asked you if she survived or not!

506
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:24,120
Let go of me! Come on!

507
00:37:24,203 --> 00:37:25,621
Just let me go!

508
00:37:52,982 --> 00:37:56,360
TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS TODAY
DEATHS 2, INJURIES 0

509
00:38:04,118 --> 00:38:05,244
Are you all right?

510
00:38:09,457 --> 00:38:11,167
Yes. It wasn't a deep cut.

511
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:13,044
Not your hand.

512
00:38:19,592 --> 00:38:21,344
You came running over earlier.

513
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,554
I saw you.

514
00:38:26,224 --> 00:38:28,893
I thought it was someone I knew.

515
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:30,603
It must be someone

516
00:38:32,105 --> 00:38:34,816
who means a lot to you.

517
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,611
Yes.

518
00:38:39,487 --> 00:38:40,905
You must have been startled.

519
00:38:48,287 --> 00:38:49,330
It's fine.

520
00:38:49,831 --> 00:38:51,207
I know what that feels like.

521
00:38:53,501 --> 00:38:55,086
Watching you earlierâ€¦

522
00:38:57,797 --> 00:38:58,840
made me thinkâ€¦

523
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:03,594
that I might've looked like you did todayâ€¦

524
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,181
on that day.

525
00:39:09,183 --> 00:39:10,226
"That day"?

526
00:39:18,442 --> 00:39:19,569
Where's Choi Yee-jae?

527
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:21,737
Where's Choi Yee-jae?

528
00:39:21,821 --> 00:39:23,781
Please tell me where he is.

529
00:39:24,991 --> 00:39:26,409
This can't be true!

530
00:39:26,492 --> 00:39:28,369
How could this happen?

531
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:35,293
Yee-jae!

532
00:39:36,836 --> 00:39:40,173
Yee-jae!

533
00:39:59,108 --> 00:40:00,193
Do you feel

534
00:40:01,402 --> 00:40:02,445
better now?

535
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,948
No, not yet.

536
00:40:12,872 --> 00:40:13,998
I should get going.

537
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:16,584
The wound may not be deep,

538
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:18,878
but you should see a doctor.

539
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:25,009
Ji-su.

540
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:34,977
I'll see you tomorrow.

541
00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:38,105
I'll tell you more of my story.

542
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,399
I don't think

543
00:40:41,317 --> 00:40:43,027
I can visit the cafÃ© tomorrow.

544
00:40:43,903 --> 00:40:45,488
Did something come up?

545
00:40:48,282 --> 00:40:49,742
Listening to all your storiesâ€¦

546
00:40:52,453 --> 00:40:53,955
reminded me of someone I know

547
00:40:54,997 --> 00:40:56,123
and made me miss him.

548
00:41:19,981 --> 00:41:22,108
THE LATE CHOI YEE-JAE

549
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:23,526
Are you doing all right?

550
00:41:27,113 --> 00:41:28,114
I, for oneâ€¦

551
00:41:30,992 --> 00:41:32,285
have been doing just fine.

552
00:41:35,037 --> 00:41:36,706
It's as if nothing's ever happened.

553
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:39,333
I sleep, eat,

554
00:41:41,544 --> 00:41:42,962
laugh, and talk.

555
00:41:46,632 --> 00:41:47,675
Butâ€¦

556
00:41:59,395 --> 00:42:00,855
I miss you so much.

557
00:42:17,038 --> 00:42:18,331
If only I hadâ€¦

558
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:22,460
kept you from leaving that nightâ€¦

559
00:42:24,962 --> 00:42:25,963
If I hadn'tâ€¦

560
00:42:28,632 --> 00:42:30,009
said those thingsâ€¦

561
00:42:34,221 --> 00:42:36,098
would you have made a different choice?

562
00:42:45,316 --> 00:42:46,317
I'm sorry.

563
00:42:53,741 --> 00:42:54,909
I'm sorry.

564
00:43:46,961 --> 00:43:48,087
Who are you?

565
00:44:08,983 --> 00:44:09,900
Mom.

566
00:44:11,026 --> 00:44:11,861
I'm sorry?

567
00:44:20,411 --> 00:44:21,954
I'm here to see my mother.

568
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:26,792
I see.

569
00:45:27,978 --> 00:45:29,021
Yee-jaeâ€¦

570
00:45:29,647 --> 00:45:30,856
Yee-jaeâ€¦

571
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:37,238
Yee-jaeâ€¦

572
00:46:11,021 --> 00:46:11,981
I'm sorry.

573
00:46:14,483 --> 00:46:15,526
I'm so sorry.

574
00:46:16,652 --> 00:46:18,654
I'm so sorry, Mom.

575
00:46:38,424 --> 00:46:40,759
<i>I wrote my mom a letter</i>

576
00:46:40,843 --> 00:46:42,803
<i>pretending to be an acquaintance of mine.</i>

577
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:47,766
<i>It said that Yee-jae made the money</i>
<i>through an investment in cryptocurrency,</i>

578
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:50,185
<i>so she should spend it freely.</i>

579
00:48:26,573 --> 00:48:27,741
I've died so many timesâ€¦

580
00:48:31,578 --> 00:48:33,247
that now I even die in my dreams.

581
00:48:39,628 --> 00:48:40,671
<i>That's fascinating.</i>

582
00:48:41,255 --> 00:48:42,756
Please tell me more next time.

583
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:45,384
Ji-su.

584
00:48:45,467 --> 00:48:47,052
It's late.

585
00:48:47,136 --> 00:48:49,221
Would you mind if I walked you home?

586
00:48:49,304 --> 00:48:50,806
-It's fine.
-Wait.

587
00:48:51,181 --> 00:48:52,725
I need to get going soon anyway.

588
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:56,019
Okay, then.

589
00:49:16,331 --> 00:49:19,543
<i>The uneventful days</i>
<i>when we walked together hand in hand.</i>

590
00:49:20,461 --> 00:49:24,339
<i>Those moments alone</i>
<i>were more than enough reason to go on.</i>

591
00:49:25,007 --> 00:49:27,217
<i>Why hadn't I realized it sooner?</i>

592
00:49:28,594 --> 00:49:30,262
<i>The reason we're afraid of death</i>

593
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:32,806
<i>is because there will be no tomorrow.</i>

594
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,310
<i>That's why I'm afraid</i>

595
00:49:37,144 --> 00:49:40,314
<i>that death might come knocking</i>
<i>at this very moment.</i>

596
00:49:42,149 --> 00:49:44,276
Does that story of yours

597
00:49:46,153 --> 00:49:47,404
have a happy ending?

598
00:49:49,198 --> 00:49:50,282
Do you think

599
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:53,535
that a happy ending is possible?

600
00:49:56,622 --> 00:49:58,290
I sincerely hopeâ€¦

601
00:50:00,918 --> 00:50:03,253
that your story ends happily.

602
00:50:05,005 --> 00:50:06,006
Why?

603
00:50:08,759 --> 00:50:10,636
Because I feel bad for the protagonist.

604
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,430
He had a difficult life

605
00:50:14,264 --> 00:50:16,350
and didn't have anyone to rely on.

606
00:50:16,975 --> 00:50:18,310
That's why he died.

607
00:50:19,853 --> 00:50:22,356
But he needs to keep worrying
about his next death.

608
00:50:23,899 --> 00:50:26,318
Even when he comes back to life
as someone else,

609
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,654
he constantly has to live in fear.

610
00:50:32,324 --> 00:50:33,867
You can't really say you're livingâ€¦

611
00:50:36,161 --> 00:50:37,663
when you live in constant fear.

612
00:50:41,124 --> 00:50:42,918
"You're not really living

613
00:50:43,418 --> 00:50:45,212
when you live in constant fear"?

614
00:50:47,089 --> 00:50:48,924
People are happiest

615
00:50:50,092 --> 00:50:51,802
when they can truly be themselves.

616
00:50:52,928 --> 00:50:53,804
In the end,

617
00:50:55,013 --> 00:50:56,473
life would be meaningless

618
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:00,227
if you can never really be yourself.

619
00:51:06,817 --> 00:51:07,818
I'm sorry.

620
00:51:08,277 --> 00:51:09,820
I rambled on too much.

621
00:51:11,029 --> 00:51:13,156
Wait, Ji-su.

622
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:17,786
I have to tell you this today.

623
00:51:18,745 --> 00:51:19,788
Becauseâ€¦

624
00:51:23,292 --> 00:51:25,794
today could be my last day alive.

625
00:51:26,712 --> 00:51:27,629
I'm sorry?

626
00:51:29,131 --> 00:51:31,258
Could you hear me out for a second?

627
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:34,678
Okay.

628
00:51:37,681 --> 00:51:41,435
I used to have a girlfriend
whom I dated for seven years.

629
00:51:45,147 --> 00:51:47,065
While I was with herâ€¦

630
00:51:49,943 --> 00:51:51,945
I was never able to show her my best self.

631
00:51:53,363 --> 00:51:54,656
Take a seat.

632
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:57,451
Gosh, this place is nice.

633
00:51:57,910 --> 00:51:59,286
Don't think about leaving.

634
00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:01,371
We're going hard tonight.

635
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,374
I'm not going home tonight.

636
00:52:06,293 --> 00:52:07,252
Ms. Lee.

637
00:52:07,669 --> 00:52:10,422
Have you ever considered Mr. Lee
as a potential boyfriend?

638
00:52:11,214 --> 00:52:12,758
Sir, I already have a boyfriend.

639
00:52:12,841 --> 00:52:14,760
Come on. You're lying.

640
00:52:15,427 --> 00:52:17,137
What do you think of Ms. Lee?

641
00:52:17,638 --> 00:52:20,015
Gosh, I'd love to date someone like her.

642
00:52:22,726 --> 00:52:24,811
Then you'll be
our team's first-ever couple.

643
00:52:24,895 --> 00:52:25,729
Over here.

644
00:52:27,481 --> 00:52:29,441
Come on. That's nonsense.

645
00:52:31,735 --> 00:52:32,903
Would you like to order?

646
00:52:32,986 --> 00:52:34,905
You must care about men's looks.

647
00:52:35,697 --> 00:52:37,199
Good looks won't put food on the table.

648
00:52:37,282 --> 00:52:38,909
You'll end up starving to death.

649
00:52:38,992 --> 00:52:40,827
I really do have a boyfriend, Mr. Kim.

650
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:41,745
Where is he then?

651
00:52:44,873 --> 00:52:45,707
Right here.

652
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:47,167
This is my boyfriend.

653
00:52:48,335 --> 00:52:49,753
What are you doing?

654
00:52:50,462 --> 00:52:51,505
Say hello, Yee-jae.

655
00:52:51,588 --> 00:52:52,756
These are my colleagues.

656
00:52:55,509 --> 00:52:56,343
Hello.

657
00:52:56,426 --> 00:52:57,928
-Hello.
-Hello.

658
00:52:58,053 --> 00:53:00,180
See? He's handsome.

659
00:53:00,263 --> 00:53:01,807
He also works very hard.

660
00:53:02,391 --> 00:53:04,059
He'll never let me starve to death.

661
00:53:11,817 --> 00:53:14,736
<i>Even during the times</i>
<i>I felt ashamed of myself,</i>

662
00:53:16,196 --> 00:53:18,073
<i>she would confidently introduce me</i>
<i>as her boyfriend,</i>

663
00:53:18,532 --> 00:53:20,325
<i>no matter who she was with.</i>

664
00:53:21,785 --> 00:53:24,788
She proudly told them
that I was the man she loved.

665
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:31,545
She was cynical
when it came to romance movies,

666
00:53:32,796 --> 00:53:35,632
but she would call me in tears

667
00:53:36,967 --> 00:53:38,927
when she saw starving children
in the ads on TV.

668
00:53:42,055 --> 00:53:43,557
She preferred citron tea

669
00:53:44,474 --> 00:53:45,934
over bitter coffee.

670
00:53:50,522 --> 00:53:51,481
She was someone

671
00:53:52,774 --> 00:53:55,610
who made the most effort
when those around her felt down.

672
00:53:58,864 --> 00:54:00,365
That's why I foolishly thoughtâ€¦

673
00:54:03,118 --> 00:54:05,203
that she'd be doing just fine.

674
00:54:08,206 --> 00:54:09,833
I want to tell herâ€¦

675
00:54:15,047 --> 00:54:16,965
that I'm sorry for misunderstanding her.

676
00:54:19,342 --> 00:54:20,385
Andâ€¦

677
00:54:22,012 --> 00:54:24,681
that she should stop being so sad
over someone like me.

678
00:54:25,265 --> 00:54:26,349
And also

679
00:54:31,563 --> 00:54:33,148
that she's still the only one I love.

680
00:54:35,275 --> 00:54:36,234
You'reâ€¦

681
00:54:37,736 --> 00:54:38,987
the only one I love.

682
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:25,450
Why didn't I realize thenâ€¦

683
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:30,247
that I had people in my life

684
00:55:31,623 --> 00:55:33,583
who would cry with me
during difficult times?

685
00:55:37,754 --> 00:55:40,715
I know very well
that it's too late to ask for forgiveness.

686
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,883
I know thatâ€¦

687
00:55:45,846 --> 00:55:47,514
because I'm already dead.

688
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:52,727
What do you mean?

689
00:55:53,854 --> 00:55:56,731
The story I told you
about that man who had to keep dyingâ€¦

690
00:55:56,815 --> 00:55:58,233
I didn't make that up.

691
00:55:58,567 --> 00:56:00,110
I know it sounds crazy,

692
00:56:01,361 --> 00:56:03,446
but it's what I'm going through right now.

693
00:56:04,072 --> 00:56:05,615
Just like the story I told you,

694
00:56:05,949 --> 00:56:07,617
I've experienced seven deaths.

695
00:56:07,701 --> 00:56:09,953
Now I'm living as this man
who works as a model.

696
00:56:11,705 --> 00:56:13,623
The name I had before my first deathâ€¦

697
00:56:17,002 --> 00:56:18,420
was Choi Yee-jae.

698
00:56:20,964 --> 00:56:22,048
What are you saying?

699
00:56:22,841 --> 00:56:23,925
Ji-su.

700
00:56:24,259 --> 00:56:25,468
I know it's hard to believe,

701
00:56:26,136 --> 00:56:27,721
but I really am Choi Yee-jae.

702
00:56:31,183 --> 00:56:32,225
Choi Yee-jae?

703
00:56:34,269 --> 00:56:35,353
Iâ€¦

704
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:15,644
Ji-suâ€¦

705
00:57:19,898 --> 00:57:20,899
Jiâ€¦

706
00:58:33,596 --> 00:58:35,390
Make his death look like an accident.

707
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,816
I'm so fucked.

708
00:58:49,738 --> 00:58:51,531
Sir. Are you all right?

709
00:58:52,365 --> 00:58:53,283
What should we do?

710
00:58:55,035 --> 00:58:55,994
That womanâ€¦

711
00:58:56,244 --> 00:58:58,079
Her neck's been completely twisted.

712
00:59:08,089 --> 00:59:09,424
Her dead bodyâ€¦

713
00:59:15,055 --> 00:59:16,306
looks like a marionette.

714
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:38,078
So you're not dead yet.

715
00:59:51,424 --> 00:59:52,759
I'll help you.

716
00:59:58,056 --> 00:59:59,015
You see,

717
01:00:00,809 --> 01:00:02,560
whether it's people or corporations,

718
01:00:06,147 --> 01:00:07,732
I specialize in euthanasia.

719
01:00:47,522 --> 01:00:50,316
{\an8}EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES

720
01:01:54,297 --> 01:01:56,299
I'll kill that bastard.

721
01:02:00,386 --> 01:02:01,387
But firstâ€¦

722
01:02:16,903 --> 01:02:18,488
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

723
01:02:20,281 --> 01:02:21,449
Try it for yourself.

724
01:02:59,904 --> 01:03:06,160
<i>Are you still standing there?</i>

725
01:03:06,703 --> 01:03:12,458
<i>Are you afraid to turn back?</i>

726
01:03:13,751 --> 01:03:19,632
<i>The face I somberly remembered</i>

727
01:03:20,258 --> 01:03:22,635
<i>The person I'm grateful for</i>

728
01:03:23,761 --> 01:03:25,930
<i>The person I owe</i>

729
01:03:26,306 --> 01:03:33,021
<i>Although there's no miracle we hoped for</i>

730
01:03:33,521 --> 01:03:40,278
<i>Nor the strength to get back on our feet</i>

731
01:03:40,361 --> 01:03:46,993
<i>Listen to the voice that embraces you</i>

732
01:03:47,535 --> 01:03:54,250
<i>"I love you"</i>

733
01:03:54,334 --> 01:03:59,756
<i>"I love you"</i>

734
01:04:20,151 --> 01:04:26,741
<i>If you're still hesitating</i>

735
01:04:26,824 --> 01:04:30,328
<i>I hope you find the courage</i>

736
01:04:30,953 --> 01:04:35,124
<i>To stand up again</i>

737
01:04:35,208 --> 01:04:41,589
<i>And overcome it</i>
