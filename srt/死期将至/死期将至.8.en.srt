DON'T GO LOOKING FOR DEATH.
DEATH WILL COME FIND YOU.

00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:30,448
Mom?

4
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:48,257
This is too cruel.

5
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:04,315
No.

6
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:06,317
No.

11
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:30,883
<i>Mom used to be a girl with big dreams.</i>

12
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:33,928
<i>That girl full of dreams</i>

13
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:34,970

<i>a wife,</i>

15

<i>and then a mother.</i>

16
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,482
<i>She even had a child
with the man she loved.</i>

17
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:50,277
<i>Her happiness,
which she thought would last forever...</i>

18
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,282
<i>was but fleeting.</i>

<i>that the reason my mom didn't break down</i>

22
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:11,799
<i>was because of me.</i>

23
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,304
Hello?

24
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,098
I'm sorry?

25
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:24,186
Hang in there, Yee-jae.

26
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,813
Stay with me, Yee-jae.

28
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,283
I'm so sorry.

29
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:41,579
I wish I could be sick in your place.

30
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:46,625
<i>Mom's heart was torn to pieces</i>

31
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,295
<i>because she couldn't be sick in my place.</i>

32
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:51,338
Sir.

33
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:54,008
How could you just fire me overnight?

34
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,926
The company's going through tough times.

35
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,637
-Sir.
-Let go of me.

<i>My mom</i>

40
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,941

<i>than I had ever walked.</i>

42
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:15,863
<i>And yet,</i>

43
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,240
<i>she never gave up</i>

44
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,368
<i>or looked back.</i>

45
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,747
<i>She simply kept trudging onward.</i>

46
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:28,459
<i>I was blessed to have a mom like that.</i>

47
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:34,965
<i>But foolishly...</i>

48
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:40,554
<i>I never counted my blessings.</i>

49
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,783

<i>Are you Mr. Choi Yee-jae's mother?</i>

55
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:41,323
Yes.

56

What is this regarding?

57
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:56,880
My goodness.

58
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,269
Please confirm his identity.

60
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:49,933
Mom is here.

61
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:54,772
Let's go home.

62
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,484
Wake up.

63
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,279
Yee-jae.

64
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,157
Yee-jae.

65
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:08,243
My poor baby shouldn't be lying here.

66
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,663
Mom's here to take you home.

67
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:14,374
Hurry and wake up. Come on.

68
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:15,959
Yee-jae.

69
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:17,544
It's your mom.

70
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:18,796
Open your eyes for me.

71
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:22,591

When did you last see your son?

80
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:02,506
A week ago.

81
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,300
Did he not show any signs of suicide?

82
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:09,596
I don't know.

83
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:12,850
Why do you think your son died?

84
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:15,185
I killed him.

85
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,731
It's due to my many faults.

86
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:29,158
Had he been born to a smarter woman,

87
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,411
this wouldn't have happened.

88
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,668
Such a smart kid.

89
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,171
-Your grandson's a year old already?
-Goodness.

90
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,131
-This rice cake is excellent.
-Congrats.

91
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,717
-I'll enjoy it.
-It looks delicious.

92
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,178
-Isn't your grandkid almost a year old?
-Here, Seon-hui.

93
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,512
-Yes.
-Gosh.

94
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:52,014
Thank you.

95
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,724
-I know, right?
-This looks great.

96
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,017
Totally.

97
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,810
-She's right.
-Already?

98
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:59,062
Seriously. They grow up so fast.

99
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,814
I've already become a grandma.

100
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:03,525
You're too young to be a grandma.

101
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,235
You can say that again.

102
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,070
-What?
-Here.

103
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,823
Buy some clothes for your grandson.

104
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:12,075
Gosh, there's no need for this.

105
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,285
It's fine, really.

106
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,953
Take this with you!

107
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,289
Wait...

108
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,958
Why would she give me this?

109
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:21,585
It's bad luck.

110
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,046
That's right.
You don't want it to rub off on you.

111
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,174
Don't get clothes for your grandson
with that money.

112
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,093
I'm not even going to invite her
to my daughter's wedding,

113
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,179
so you better keep quiet.

Is that so wrong?

118
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,103
It's not like I did harm to anyone.

119
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,562
Think carefully

120
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,023
if you really didn't harm anyone.

121
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:28,443
I forgot about the dead girl's family
when it should have been obvious.

122
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,070
Of course you did.

123
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:34,157
You are a selfish brat
who fails to think about the sadness

124
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:36,410
the bereaved have to go through.

125
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,453
He thought I'd killed his daughter.

126
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,665
Of course, he'd want to kill me.

127
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,750
Then who would your mother want to kill?

128
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:46,753
<i>Death had always known</i>

<i>I experienced 12 painful deaths

131
00:09:56,847 --> 00:10:00,726
<i>The death that caused me the most pain</i>

132
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,353
<i>wasn't when I burned to death</i>

133
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,273
<i>or when my limbs were severed.</i>

<i>had come right back to me.</i>

139
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:02,579
<i>I decided to continue living as my mom.</i>

140
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,001
<i>It was a punishment
that I decided to give myself.</i>

141
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:15,092
<i>The first subway train of the day</i>

142
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,968
<i>was full of people's parents</i>

143
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:19,096
<i>who were doing their best to get by.</i>

144
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,099
<i>Could I ever say</i>

145
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:27,312

I take that back.

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,779
<i>and that I wanted</i>

186
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,782
<i>to be born as her son once more</i>

187
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:56,826
<i>in my next life.</i>

188
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,541
<i>But none of my words</i>

189
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,794
<i>nor any of my feelings</i>

190
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:07,962
<i>could reach her.</i>

191
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,090
<i>That's just</i>

192
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:14,135
<i>how death is.</i>

193
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:30,276
<i>Mom, is there anywhere
you'd like to go with me?</i>

194
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,196
I want to go to Mount Obong.

195
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,531
Mount Obong?

196
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:37,867
I used to go there often with your dad
when we were young.

197
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,868
Once I get a job,

198
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,246
I'll take you to Mount Obong.

199
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:42,705
Goodness.

200
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,791
My son is the best.

201
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,377
But you know what?

202
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,088
I can't go because of my weak knee.

203
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,005
Nonsense.

204
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:53,007
I'll carry you on my back if need be,

205
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:54,968
so hold on a little.

206
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,919
<i>Even though it was late,</i>

207
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,463
<i>I wanted to show Mom</i>

208
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,716
<i>the place she used to visit with Dad</i>

209
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:38,094
<i>when they were young and loved to hike.</i>

210
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,142
How beautiful.

211
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:24,784
Mom.

212
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,293
I'm sorry that I forgot.

213
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,799
I'm so sorry

214
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:42,885
I didn't keep my promise.

215
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:48,594
Is anyone out there?

216
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,307
Help me.

217
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:54,600
Please...

218
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:35,224
You can't die like this.

219
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,855
Please don't die, Mom.

220
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,613
Please don't die.

221
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:57,932
Thank you for still being alive, Mom.

222
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:12,822
<i>Yee-jae.</i>

223
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,324
Hurry and wake up.

224
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,201
Let's go home.

225
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:20,955
Please don't die, Yee-jae.

226
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:24,500
Mom.

227
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,128
You can't die like this.

228
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:29,422
Please don't die, Mom.

229
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,051
<i>As I desperately wished
for my mom's survival,</i>

230
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:37,972
<i>I felt the same desperation she had felt</i>

231
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:43,102
<i>when she sobbed
upon seeing my cold body in the morgue.</i>

232
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,604
I'm sorry.

233
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:50,192
I made a grave mistake.

234
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:01,746
<i>To fulfill my mom's wish</i>

235
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:04,665
<i>for me to live on until the end,</i>

236
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,376
<i>I had to...</i>

237
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:12,173
<i>go on living.</i>

238
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:30,024
<i>I lived for 32 years...</i>

239
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,321
<i>which was longer
than the time I lived as Choi Yee-jae...</i>

240
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:40,076
<i>in remembrance...</i>

241
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,121
<i>of the people</i>

242
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,041
<i>to whom I've said goodbye.</i>

243
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:02,390
<i>You can't really say you're living</i>

244
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:05,059
<i>when you live in constant fear.</i>

245
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,647
<i>But since I was a coward,</i>

246
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:14,235
<i>I always lived in constant fear.</i>

247
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:18,864
<i>Afraid that the world
wouldn't recognize my worth,</i>

248
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:21,700
<i>that I would fall behind my peers,</i>

249
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:26,997
<i>and that I would be rejected,</i>

250
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:31,377
<i>I ended up taking my own life</i>

251
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,380
<i>due to this fear</i>

252
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,383
<i>before my life could even blossom.</i>

253
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:41,345
<i>I only realized after dying</i>

254
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:44,140
<i>that life in itself</i>

255
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:47,143
<i>was an opportunity.</i>

256
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:53,149
<i>And the pain
that I thought engulfed my whole life</i>

257
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:56,652
<i>was only a small part of it.</i>

258
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,116
<i>A clear day.</i>

259
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,121
<i>A rainy day.</i>

260
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:11,917
<i>A windy day.</i>

261
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:15,421
<i>I learned that life</i>

262
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:18,382
<i>was made up of these different days.</i>

263
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:22,970
<i>And that it was okay to fail</i>

264
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,140
<i>as long as I kept going.</i>

265
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:32,813
<i>It was only after
I ended up inside my mom's body</i>

266
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:35,232
<i>that I finally</i>

267
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:38,152
<i>realized this.</i>

268
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:36,729
I never thought I'd say this...

269
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:41,191
but I missed you so much.

270
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,028
It's just that I didn't realize

271
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:46,447
it'd take this long to see you again.

272
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:50,200
Did it?

273
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,537
I have trouble
sensing the passage of time.

274
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,333
I did think
it took longer than usual, though.

275
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:01,003
It was plenty long enough for me.

276
00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:03,422
And

277
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:06,842
I spent all that time
thinking about what I should do

278
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:09,595
when I met you again.

279
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:27,154
I'm begging you.

280
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,116
Can you please

281
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:33,911
shoot me again

282
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,664
just once more?

283
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:43,587
I already used up all the bullets
allocated to you.

284
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:47,758
I know.

285
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,135
I do,

286
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:53,514
but please give me a chance

287
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,893
to live as myself just once more.

288
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:12,866
Let me have another go at life
as Choi Yee-jae.

289
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,035
I'm begging you.

290
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,161
Please.

291
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:19,915
Why?

292
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:41,186
I want to give my mom a hug one last time.

293
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:58,287
You said that you would beat me

294
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,415
playing by the rules I have created.

295
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:05,252
You won.

296
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:07,087
What?

297
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:09,256
You managed to avoid death and survive.

298
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,675
You received
your punishment from me in full.

299
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:14,011
All that is left for you now
is God's judgment.

300
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,939
And before that happens,

301
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:29,485
I'll give you one more bullet.

302
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,615
Really?

303
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,705
You will be given the chance you asked for

304
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:43,749
if this gun ends up firing.

305
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:47,503
What if it doesn't?

306
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,296
Then you will be in God's hands.

307
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:09,585
MOM

308
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:17,134
Mom.

309
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:50,334
<i>Are you standing at the edge of the world?</i>

310
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:54,463
THERE IS ONLY ONE YOU IN THIS WORLD

311
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:59,843
<i>Unable to cry out loud</i>

312
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:06,975
<i>You struggle to call out the name</i>

313
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:10,145
<i>Of the person you loved</i>

314
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,315
<i>The only one you loved</i>

315
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:20,197
<i>It's okay to cry out loud</i>

316
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:27,663
<i>Until your cries are heard
In the distant future</i>

317
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:34,419
<i>If you happen to encounter today</i>

318
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:41,927
<i>I hope there's no pain</i>

319
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:47,224
<i>Or despair left</i>

320
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:16,586
<i>Are you still standing there?</i>

321
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:22,926
<i>Are you afraid to turn back?</i>

322
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:30,267
<i>The face I somberly remembered</i>

323
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:33,186
<i>The person I'm grateful for</i>

324
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,523
<i>The person I owe</i>

325
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:43,739
<i>Although there's no miracle we hoped for</i>

326
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:50,954
<i>Nor the strength to get back on our feet</i>

327
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:57,753
<i>Listen to the voice that embraces you</i>

328
00:38:58,295 --> 00:39:05,135
<i>"I love you"</i>

329
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:10,307
<i>"I love you"</i>

330
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:37,375
<i>If you're still hesitating</i>

331
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:41,171
<i>I hope you find the courage</i>

332
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:45,842
<i>To stand up again</i>

333
00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:52,432
<i>And overcome it</i>
