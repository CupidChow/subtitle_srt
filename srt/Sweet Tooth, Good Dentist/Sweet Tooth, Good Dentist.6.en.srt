1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,270
I'm back to continue the dream
the two of us shared.

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:03,450
You can’t run a shop on your own.

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,160
Just don’t.

4
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,030
Thanks a lot for the warning.

5
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,700
That’s why I made a post looking for help.

6
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:08,420
Hello.

7
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:09,810
I see.

8
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,390
Since I restricted you from
doing the live stream,

9
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,980
you came to apply for a job here?

10
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:13,690
Sant.

11
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:14,880
I did it!

12
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,000
Here’s the Sweet Fish Sauce Croissant.

13
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:17,950
Is that even going to work?

14
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:18,700
Delicious!

15
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,200
Hey, you’re trying to please him this much.

16
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,560
You two are way past
the boss-and-employee stage now, huh?

17
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,170
Well, since this employee's this adorable,

18
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,210
if you were me, could you resist?

19
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,070
Sant.

20
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,130
I’ll take you home tonight.

21
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,970
It’s probably easier if he goes with me.

22
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,040
You guys go ahead.

23
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,120
I’ll go upstairs to work first.

24
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,120
Hey, Sant, this is heavy.

25
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:35,980
Come on, I’ll help you carry it.

26
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,550
You can put it here.

27
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:57,910
Thank you.

28
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:01,730
Whoa.

29
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,849
Your room is really a mess.

30
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,410
Do you want me to help clean up?

31
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,140
What kind of mood are you in, huh?

32
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:11,700
I’m free.

33
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,430
Also, I want to help.

34
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:15,930
Isn’t there anything I can help you with?

35
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,400
If you’re going to help,

36
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,020
you might as well go get Gugg.

37
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,830
He’s the only one who knows

38
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,120
how to refill the ink in this printer.

39
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,640
Ugh, there’s no need to go look for him.

40
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,620
I can refill it myself.

41
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,460
It’s super easy.

42
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,500
It’s done.

43
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:49,430
Try printing.

44
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,210
Is this the list of movies to choose from?

45
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,289
Do you want me to help pick?

46
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,250
At least I picked the movie on our first date.

47
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,440
Are you talking about the one
where you yelled at people in the cinema

48
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,870
until we couldn’t understand
what was going on in the movie?

49
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,410
Alright, that’s enough.

50
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,300
You can go back now.

51
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:25,500
Right.

52
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,180
Once you’re done using me to refill the ink,

53
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,300
you just toss me aside.

54
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,100
I guess I’m no good anymore.

55
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,390
Fine.

56
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,200
At least it’s nice to have someone to help.

57
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,570
I’ll open the door for you.

58
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,150
What are you doing here?

59
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,510
I’m afraid Sant will feel hungry,

60
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,140
so I bought him some snacks.

61
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,160
Sant.

62
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,430
I’ve heard you’d let Jay pick the movies, right?

63
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,670
Yeah.

64
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,220
Can I join you guys?

65
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,860
Huh?

66
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,770
Here you are. I bought tons of snacks.

67
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,970
Cheers!

68
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,120
Excuse me,

69
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,250
with all due respect,

70
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,990
when are you two heading back?

71
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,170
Well, once this can is finished, I’ll head out.

72
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,800
You have said that three times already.

73
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,380
You were just clinking glasses,

74
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,760
but no one’s actually drinking.

75
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,770
Alright, let’s play this game.

76
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,840
If we get snapped when we press, we drink.

77
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,500
Okay?

78
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:50,650
Deal.

79
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:52,810
If we can’t handle it,

80
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,420
just head back to our room.

81
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:58,920
Drink.

82
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:05,900
Drink.

83
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:12,620
Drink.

84
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,250
Drink.

85
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:15,390
Drink.

86
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,209
Drink.

87
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:16,839
Drink.

88
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,709
Drink.

89
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,440
We're out of beer.

90
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,310
Should I go buy more?

91
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,370
It’s a waste of time.

92
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,400
Let’s settle this once and for all.

93
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,580
Whoever loses has to get the hell out.

94
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,250
I’m in.

95
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,880
No cheating, got it?

96
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:05,720
Hey.

97
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,130
This feels familiar,

98
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,520
like I’ve seen this happen somewhere before.

99
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,490
This is just like that time

100
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,600
we fought over the last bowl of bingsu.

101
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,450
How can you not remember that?

102
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,230
Ohhh!

103
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,560
What are we fighting over now?

104
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,820
It feels like we’re fighting over Sant.

105
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,110
What? You're drunk.

106
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,330
You’re talking nonsense.

107
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,250
Let’s start.

108
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,150
Hey, Jay, seriously,

109
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,810
every time I’m with Sant,

110
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,650
you always show up,

111
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,500
at my café,

112
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,620
on campus,

113
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:50,830
and now here.

114
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:53,480
It’s just a coincidence.

115
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,040
Hey!

116
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,870
Don’t tell me you like Sant.

117
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,470
What’s the deal, Jay?

118
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,790
How do you really feel about him?

119
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,970
I’m back, my bestie!

120
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,400
What are you guys doing here?

121
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:06,650
Oh.

122
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,960
I’m just helping him pick movies.

123
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,920
We’re done now.

124
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:16,620
Yeah.

125
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,970
I think I’ll head out too.

126
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,160
Are you okay?

127
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,110
Sure?

128
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:27,650
Whoa. Look at them.

129
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:31,980
Safe trip home.

130
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,310
Gugg, where is Sant?

131
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,570
Sant is working on some paperwork.

132
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,380
Do you guys need anything?

133
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,880
I bought some pastries for Sant!

134
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,610
Mine is a croissant, his favorite.

135
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,270
Mine is the same, but more than his.

136
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,300
Well then,

137
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,010
I’ll make sure he gets them from both of you.

138
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,830
Thanks on Sant’s behalf.

139
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,500
So what now?

140
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,409
We’ll know once he chooses
whose croissant to eat.

141
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,230
No, I’m talking about last night.

142
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,640
Even though I was drunk,

143
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,100
I still remember that you never answered me.

144
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,910
How do you really feel about him?

145
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,890
It’s that obvious. How can you not tell, huh?

146
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,410
So do you like him or not?

147
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:16,400
Yeah.

148
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
I like Sant.

149
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,200
Give me your hands.

150
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,920
What are you doing?

151
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,300
I was just checking
if you’d been to Captain’s café.

152
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,060
I really can’t stand the smell there.

153
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,600
You can’t stand the smell,

154
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,600
or are you jealous?

155
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,440
Be honest.

156
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,450
Jealous? Nonsense!

157
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,640
It’s just Captain’s been acting weird lately.

158
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,690
He’s picking me up, dropping me off,

159
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,430
and bringing me food.

160
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,660
Do you think he’s hitting on me?

161
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,560
You’re my friend, no matter what.

162
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,840
From now on, let's compete fair and square.

163
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,280
No cheap shots, alright?

164
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,690
So do you think Captain’s hitting on me?

165
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,470
No.

166
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,530
I mean, I don’t know.

167
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,410
If you want to know, ask him yourself.

168
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:29,660
Go on.

169
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,400
Go sit down.

170
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,460
Can you even reach that from here?

171
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,750
All set.

172
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,010
We’ve got enough behind-the-scenes footage.

173
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,300
Can you organize them for me?

174
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,480
I’ll wrap it up.

175
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:52,910
Sure.

176
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,700
I’ll take care of it.

177
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,850
That’s it for today.

178
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,690
You guys pack up.

179
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,080
I’ll handle things here.

180
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,580
We’ve all been drained for many nights already.

181
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,440
Okay.

182
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,020
Bye.

183
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,560
- See you.
- See you.

184
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,320
Get home safe.

185
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,500
Hey, Captain?

186
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,200
You came to check out the booth?

187
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:16,810
Yeah.

188
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,090
All good.

189
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,130
Are you heading home?

190
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,230
Do you want a ride?

191
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,370
Uh...Captain.

192
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:33,530
Yeah?

193
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:35,550
Thank you,

194
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,700
but I think I’ll head back with my friends today.

195
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,140
I don’t want to trouble you.

196
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,510
Anyway, thank you.

197
00:11:59,060 --> 00:11:59,950
Dude, I’m drained.

198
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,780
I can’t go on anymore.

199
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,410
Filming was fun, though.

200
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,020
But now we’ve finally got a break.

201
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,860
I’m off.

202
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,020
See you tomorrow.

203
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,870
- Bye.
- Bye!

204
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:13,960
Text me when you get home.

205
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,030
Got it.

206
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,040
Un really worked the hardest.

207
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,510
Un!

208
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:23,880
Un!

209
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,110
Someone snatched my bag!

210
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,650
All the cameras are inside!

211
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:28,840
Hand it to me!

212
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:29,900
Hand it to me!

213
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,270
Hey, Sant!

214
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,170
Sant!

215
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,560
Are you hurt?

216
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,130
Sant!

217
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,300
Sant!

218
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,370
Sant!

219
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,450
I said I’m fine.

220
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,440
Has anyone caught the thief yet?

221
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,110
Gugg’s taking Un to file a report with the police.

222
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:58,560
Okay.

223
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:03,060
Then rest your legs for the next couple of days.

224
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,950
You need to recover before the event.

225
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,340
It’s done.

226
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:17,740
Thank you.

227
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,040
Where are you going now?

228
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,440
I literally just said you should rest.

229
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,850
I’m just going to wash my face
and brush my teeth.

230
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,220
Ouch!

231
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,150
Ugh, come here.

232
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,280
Why are you so stubborn?

233
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,580
I’m fine!

234
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,100
Go inside.

235
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,820
Why are you smiling?

236
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:01,920
Nothing.

237
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,380
Then hurry up and brush your teeth.

238
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,910
I’ll check if you’re doing it right.

239
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:13,970
Hey,

240
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,070
since when did you start
using this toothpaste?

241
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,770
Someone recommended it to me.

242
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,330
Who?

243
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,980
One dentist recommended it.

244
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,210
I saw him using it,

245
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,490
so I followed his lead.

246
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,870
Now I don’t really get sensitive teeth anymore.

247
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,530
You’ve got a problem with that?

248
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,350
I'm fine.

249
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,170
I’m just walking to my bed.

250
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,860
Ouch!

251
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,210
Sant!

252
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,230
I’ve heard you got hurt.

253
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,250
Oh,

254
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,990
it's just a sprained ankle.

255
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:43,970
I'm fine.

256
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,670
That's a relief.

257
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,270
What did the thief take?

258
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,750
He took the wallet

259
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,400
and some small stuff,

260
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,190
but the worst part is
the camera and the memory card.

261
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,510
It has...

262
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,310
all the behind-the-scenes footage

263
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,710
we shot while preparing for
the event these past few months.

264
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,640
Everything’s gone.

265
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,610
FACULTY OF DENTISTRY

266
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:36,740
I’m here.

267
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,700
Have you been waiting long?

268
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,520
No.

269
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,370
Sant, the police arrested the thief already.

270
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,660
We’ve also got the camera back with us now.

271
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,650
Check the file and see if anything is damaged.

272
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,520
So do you like him or not?

273
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,510
It’s that obvious. How can you not tell, huh?

274
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:25,470
Yeah.

275
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,730
I like Sant.

276
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,980
I've had a crush on him for a long time already

277
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,300
since the first time we met.

278
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,780
He finally agreed to let me treat his teeth.

279
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,630
Everything had been going great

280
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,630
until you showed up.

281
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:40,730
Let me tell you now.

282
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,660
Even if it’s you,

283
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,280
I won’t back down.

284
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,610
I’m not thinking of backing down either.

285
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,390
How about this?

286
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,750
Should we let him pick?

287
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,170
What’s wrong?

288
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,040
Well…

289
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,170
Sit down.

290
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:30,800
We’re done for today.

291
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:34,340
Hey.

292
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,990
I’m sorry I came late today.

293
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,630
Well, I…

294
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:40,820
You went to Captain’s cafe, right?

295
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,110
How could you know that?

296
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,960
I can smell the croissants so strongly.

297
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:46,840
How could I not know, huh?

298
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,330
By the way,

299
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,190
next time will be the last time.

300
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,850
Last time?

301
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,000
Yeah.

302
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,470
Don’t be late again, okay?

303
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,720
Dudes, I need your advice

304
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,450
to make my romantic film.

305
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,500
But we’ve just filmed one and
submitted it to the professor, haven’t we?

306
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,860
Right. Come on.

307
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,620
Here’s the story.

308
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,280
The main character has
two people crushing on him.

309
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,360
Who should he choose?

310
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:40,700
A weird doctor

311
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,260
or a hot nerd cafe owner?

312
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,840
I think, no matter what,

313
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,890
the coffee shop owner is the better option.

314
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,780
But that doctor’s weirdness

315
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:01,200
makes the character feel something in his heart.

316
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,550
Then, I’d vote for the doctor.

317
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,240
But the cafe owner is a good boss

318
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,330
who supports him with everything.

319
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:13,670
Hold on.

320
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:14,930
This sounds similar.

321
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,390
It’s as if I’ve seen this situation somewhere.

322
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,620
Hey, have you ever heard

323
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,650
'You complete me' from Jerry Maguire?

324
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,610
In the end, the one who ends up
with the main character

325
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,880
is the one who comes in
and makes their life better.

326
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,100
You complete me?

327
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:41,790
Yeah.

328
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:43,770
Sant.

329
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,620
Is the filling I gave you okay?

330
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,970
Whoa, you came all the way here
just to check on that?

331
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,140
Oh, I’m actually here to set up my booth.

332
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:00,750
Sant.

333
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,090
I brought you some snacks.

334
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,050
Thank you.

335
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:10,820
Eh?

336
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,800
You didn’t answer me just now.

337
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,340
Where are we starting the live?

338
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,770
Huh? What live?

339
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,090
We’re about to start.

340
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,220
I’ll take you there.

341
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,200
Come on, let’s go.

342
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,930
See you, dude.

343
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,370
See you.

344
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,850
Hey! You didn’t even look at your friends!

345
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,730
I don’t know anything about the live,

346
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,730
but one thing for sure is I’m invisible.

347
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,060
This is the spot.

348
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,800
I already had them set it all up.

349
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,490
What’s going on?

350
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,080
Is this some kind of ritual?

351
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,500
Oh, it's not that.

352
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,730
I'm going to promote the event

353
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,880
by doing a live while eating the food here.

354
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,690
And you're going to use a channel with only
a few thousand subscribers to attract customers?

355
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,200
I know,

356
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,900
so I invited another person.

357
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,540
He's got a million subscribers.

358
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,810
Captain?

359
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,520
No. He’s taking a break from his channel.

360
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:09,600
I got the #1 big-eater influencer in Thailand

361
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,180
—Uu Soi Laek!

362
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,240
Well, Uu is tied up with some errands today,

363
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,210
so I’m filling in for him.

364
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,610
Anyone who’s here,

365
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,370
feel free to drop a comment and say hi.

366
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,600
Who the heck are you?

367
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,310
Go somewhere else.

368
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,270
I’m here for Uu!

369
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:32,860
Shit!

370
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,430
The comments are ripping him apart.

371
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,610
Uu’s fans are savage.

372
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:40,630
For this year’s movie screening,

373
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:47,570
we’ve only picked the… best spots.

374
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,520
So, which one should we start with?

375
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,110
How about donuts?

376
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,080
Here you go!

377
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,470
Looks tasty, right?

378
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,050
The fans haven’t stopped.

379
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,100
I think he can’t handle it anymore.

380
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,160
Let’s end the live.

381
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,170
Right. I agree.

382
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,620
Captain.

383
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,050
Huh, this is a dubai chocolate donut, everyone.

384
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,290
The richness of pistachio nuts,

385
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,320
chocolate, and the donut itself!

386
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,660
Let me tell you, it’s perfectly balanced!

387
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,600
Mmm, I almost forgot to introduce myself.

388
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,390
Hey everyone,

389
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:42,980
I’m Captain from the Gin Kap Tain channel!

390
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,800
If you’ve missed me, hit that 9 key and spam it!

391
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,230
Whoa, the 9s are flooding in.

392
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,020
I guess they’ve already forgotten about Uu, huh?

393
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,080
Let’s switch it up to something savory.

394
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,900
This is a famous dim sum from Bang Rak.

395
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,300
Oh, I’m sorry.

396
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:09,940
Hey!

397
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,310
Wait a second.

398
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,700
Whoa, the candy’s stuck in your hair.

399
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,530
I’ll grab some scissors and cut it out for you.

400
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:18,260
No!

401
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,800
Or should I just burn it?

402
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,140
That way, it’ll melt off.

403
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,200
Before it melts,

404
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,460
my head will probably burn off first.

405
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:24,550
Hey, relax.

406
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,190
Let me try pulling it out first.

407
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,440
Yes.

408
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,070
Okay.

409
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:32,490
Ouch!

410
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:33,930
Ouch!

411
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,000
Can you do it gently, please?

412
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:37,550
Ouch!

413
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:38,700
Ouch!

414
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,850
#EATWITHCAPANDSANT TRENDING NO.1

415
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,670
To celebrate reaching 50,000 subscribers,

416
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,060
today I have a special guest

417
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,120
that our tooth cavity peeps
have been begging for non-stop.

418
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,570
Welcome Captain!

419
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,210
Yay!

420
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,950
Hello, tooth cavity peeps.

421
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:03,980
I’m Captain from Gin Kap Tain channel!

422
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,400
It’s such a pleasure to be here.

423
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,550
And there's one more thing.

424
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,320
I came back

425
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:11,210
because it means I get to eat with you, Sant.

426
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:16,980
Well, let’s eat.

427
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,350
What do we have today, Captain?

428
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,720
Tooth cavity peeps, today we have…

429
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,370
Where are you rushing off to?

430
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:28,450
There’s still plenty of time.

431
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,770
I’m in a hurry to get my stuff ready.

432
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,130
Today’s the last day.

433
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,310
Oh, then you don’t need to rush.

434
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,590
Your patient’s probably going to take a while.

435
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:43,860
Hey, Sant, with your appetite,

436
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,840
have you ever had any issues with cleanliness?

437
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,940
Nope, I’ve got help.

438
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,220
With “Keep It Clean Alcohol”,

439
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,980
it feels so fresh when I use it.

440
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:55,650
Let me try.

441
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:57,730
Whoa, it’s really cold.

442
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,210
Your hands feel soft too.

443
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,310
Is it really soft? Let me see.

444
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,840
Wow, it’s softer than mine!

445
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,730
It smells nice, feels soft

446
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:04,640
but doesn’t taste good.

447
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,720
Now that the subs hit 100k,

448
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,030
the collaboration opportunities are pouring in.

449
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,770
I don’t think he’ll have time

450
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,600
to get his teeth done with you anymore.

451
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,920
He promised me already that he’d come.

452
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,210
Raise your hand if it feels hurt, okay?

453
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:32,690
Okay.

454
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,440
You say that every time,

455
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,900
but I’ve never once had the chance to raise mine.

456
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:42,550
I can’t believe it.

457
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,610
You look all tough on the outside,

458
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,670
but once you switch into treatment mode,

459
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,370
you’re so damn soft.

460
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,200
Every time I come here,

461
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,250
it’s like my whole body gets healed.

462
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,660
It makes me want to stay like this forever.

463
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,790
We’re done for today.

464
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,440
You can rinse now.

465
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,050
See you next week.

466
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,090
Are you free this Friday?

467
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,950
Eh? Why?

468
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:33,240
My short film’s getting screened.

469
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,900
I’d love for you to come watch it.

470
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,750
I’ll be waiting for you.

471
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,770
Doc, the patient’s still not here?

472
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,700
He’s already half an hour late.

473
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:54,900
Umm…

474
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,410
I’m sorry.

475
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,760
I’m sorry I’m late.

476
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,960
Don’t get too glad just yet.

477
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,250
This is a root canal case.

478
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,690
It’s not going to be an easy one.

479
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:25,830
It’s a pass.

480
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,740
Why is it so easy?

481
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:34,110
Doc, treatment isn’t some game you have to win.

482
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,550
If the patient meets the criteria,

483
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,010
just let them go live their life.

484
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,600
I’m sorry.

485
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,770
I ended up being late
right up until the very last day.

486
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,510
It’s okay.

487
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,140
I know you’ve been busy with work lately.

488
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:11,580
Thanks for coming.

489
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,980
Why are you thanking me?

490
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,750
I should be thanking you.

491
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,460
You helped treat my teeth.

492
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,680
See you next week.

493
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,110
Wait,

494
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,370
there’s no more.

495
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,970
Alright, I’ll take off now.

496
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:39,660
Hey.

497
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,860
How about we go get some desserts?

498
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,100
What’s wrong?

499
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:03,800
Are you excited?

500
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,900
Of course, I am.

501
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,200
This is going to be the first time in months

502
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,600
that I can chew on both sides.

503
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,500
You’re making it sound like you’ve never been
able to chew on both sides your entire life.

504
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,110
You’re right, just like you said.

505
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,090
If you’ve never had a toothache,

506
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,180
you wouldn’t know how special it is

507
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,910
to be able to chew normally.

508
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,000
That’s a good point.

509
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,590
Just remember this.

510
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,050
Don’t fall back into your old habits

511
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,500
unless you want to meet me again.

512
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:41,670
Excuse me.

513
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,200
Are you Sant who runs the snack review channel?

514
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:49,990
Yes.

515
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,970
And Captain isn’t here with you today?

516
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:53,940
He’s not here.

517
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,460
Oh, that person won’t be coming.

518
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,080
They’re just a ship partner, not the real couple.

519
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,700
Not the real couple?

520
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:05,620
Eat already.

521
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:15,760
I’ve got to go live, bro.

522
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,050
This is for the client.

523
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,080
What should we do?

524
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,720
Hey, it’s okay.

525
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,300
I’ll wrap up the rest for my friend.

526
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,750
Go ahead.

527
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,330
I’m sorry about that.

528
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,120
We’ll talk later.

529
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,850
I need to rush there now.

530
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:52,450
I like Sant.

531
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,500
I've had a crush on him
since the first time we met.

532
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,390
He finally agreed to let me treat his teeth.

533
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,290
Everything had been going great

534
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,450
until you showed up.

535
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,570
Let me tell you now.

536
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,500
Even if it’s you,

537
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,070
I won’t back down.

538
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,070
Sant!

539
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,010
Yeah?

540
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,600
Have you picked the movie
for the closing event yet?

541
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,200
Oh,

542
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,870
it’s the movie we watched together,

543
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,100
My Precious.

544
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,400
Oh, I remember now.

545
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,110
That day was pretty hectic.

546
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,570
How about we watch it again?

547
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,570
Not as a doctor and a patient, though.

548
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:52,210
But because I’d like to ask you out.

549
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,460
Oh, go take care of your stuff first.

550
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:04,110
Call me later with your answer.

551
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,840
Hello, Captain?

552
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:08,790
I’m on my way there.

553
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,450
I’ve been running the channel for 3 years,

554
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,800
but this week feels more tiring
than all of those combined.

555
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:04,010
I should’ve just stuck a candy
on my head a long time ago.

556
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:05,790
Hey,

557
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,420
you asked me to remind you...

558
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,040
to confirm the appointment with someone.

559
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,250
Did you call yet?

560
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:15,770
What appointment?

561
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:19,780
How would I know?

562
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:20,810
Is it a client?

563
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,110
Ah, I started to recall it a bit.

564
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,020
Shit,

565
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:31,199
I just remembered!

566
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,210
Did he call to scold me or what?

567
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,040
Hello, Captain?

568
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,840
Hello, Sant?

569
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:41,940
Have you gone to bed yet?

570
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:43,010
Not yet.

571
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,350
Oh, nice!

572
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,969
Do you know Weng from Thep Lee Ror channel?

573
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,389
Who doesn't know him, right?

574
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,409
I watch every single clip of
his Forbidden Word Game.

575
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,290
Ah, that’s great.

576
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:58,210
So, I know him.

577
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,370
I actually went on a big bike ride with him before.

578
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,810
Since he’s hosting a party for top influencers,

579
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:07,770
he wants to invite us both to go live

580
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,900
and show off some snacks at the event.

581
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,550
Interested?

582
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:12,690
Of course!

583
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,120
This is every creator's ultimate
dream in this country!

584
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:19,680
But there’s just one small problem, Sant.

585
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,980
You can brush your teeth here.

586
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,380
Feel free to ask me anything.

587
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,280
Come brush your teeth with me.

588
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,870
Come brush your teeth with me.

589
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,980
Or you can come to talk with me.

590
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:00,650
I’m sorry

591
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,610
I didn’t pick up your call.

592
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,850
I haven’t been on my phone at all.

593
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,600
I’ve been working so much
my brain’s all fogged up.

594
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,800
It’s fine.

595
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,800
I’ve been busy recently too.

596
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,400
I was checking stocks just now

597
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,140
when I was on my phone.

598
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,880
I have to tell you that

599
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,030
I won’t be able to watch
the movie with you today.

600
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,670
Captain invited me to an influencer party.

601
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,920
All the top creators
in the industry will be there.

602
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:45,900
I don’t know when I’ll get
a chance like this again.

603
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:53,040
Wait, so who’s going to watch his booth then?

604
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,180
Gugg will help out.

605
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,550
But I'm really sorry.

606
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,760
I seriously can’t miss this event.

607
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,560
It’s fine.

608
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,390
I understand.

609
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,880
What time does the event end?

610
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,790
I’m going on stage around 7 PM.

611
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:18,670
It should be done by 7.30 PM at the latest.

612
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,520
Hey, that’s perfect then.

613
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,260
The movie starts at 8.

614
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,010
We already watched
the first half last time, right?

615
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,840
So today we’ll just watch the second half.

616
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:29,980
If you want to watch it, I’ll wait for you.

617
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:36,800
I promise I'll come back as soon as possible.

618
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,720
Can you play my movie?

619
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,140
I haven't checked yet.

620
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,320
Well, just check it yourself

621
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,570
People may say that you look tough,

622
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,700
but when you smile,

623
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,500
you're super cute.

624
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,620
Be my girlfriend, Da.

625
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,210
Wow, you're good at acting too.

626
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,800
Previously, you weren’t into it, huh?

627
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,370
So, after watching,

628
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,600
do you think she’ll agree to be my girlfriend?

629
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:45,900
You mean, in the story, right?

630
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,270
Of course, she will.

631
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,540
You’re the one who wrote the script.

632
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,700
Don’t you remember?

633
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,300
If everything goes according to
the script, then it’s perfect.

634
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:11,530
Gugg.

635
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,430
Yeah?

636
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,240
Will we get to the final slot soon?

637
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,080
We’re almost there, bro.

638
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,770
After this, it’s my movie.

639
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,340
Hey, perfect timing.

640
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,320
In that case,

641
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,810
could you help watch the booth for me?

642
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,750
Hey, Gugg!

643
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:27,830
Hey!

644
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,250
Wow, I've never seen you look like this before.

645
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:48,890
You’re not used to it, huh?

646
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,530
I’m not used to it,

647
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,360
but that doesn't mean I don't like it.

648
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,630
So, I can just pick my seat, right?

649
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,500
Oh, I reserved two seats,

650
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:05,180
but I didn’t know you were bringing your friend.

651
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,510
Let me check the seating for you.

652
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,800
Oh, that's my girlfriend.

653
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:16,690
Thanks.

654
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,300
We’ll just pick the seats ourselves.

655
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,720
Once this show ends,

656
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:44,700
you've got 5 minutes to get ready for your show.

657
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,500
Sure.

658
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:53,860
Sant.

659
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:55,380
Yes?

660
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:58,270
Tonight, you’re meeting up with Jay, right?

661
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:02,160
How did you know?

662
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,300
Well, you keep checking your watch.

663
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:09,340
If there's anyone
who could get you to leave here,

664
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,310
it has to be Jay.

665
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:16,350
He invited me to watch the last movie with him,

666
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,450
but now the event is running really late.

667
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,210
Please standby.

668
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,170
What are you doing?

669
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,170
I borrowed this from Weng already.

670
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:58,660
From here, it'll take no more than
15 minutes to get to the university.

671
00:41:58,870 --> 00:41:59,560
I'll give you a ride.

672
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,280
How about our show?

673
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,110
Missing one show won’t mess up the whole event.

674
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,410
But… I really can’t do this.

675
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,070
I've already committed to this job.

676
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,420
How can I just leave you and the audience?

677
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:22,800
Sant,

678
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:24,670
listen to me carefully.

679
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,300
I used to quit doing my channel

680
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,030
because I cared too much
about what others said.

681
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:34,970
But now,

682
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,480
getting to do a channel and go live with you,

683
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,490
it’s made me realize that

684
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:44,910
being in front of the camera
is my true happiness.

685
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,080
Sometimes, it’s okay to care about others,

686
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,500
but we shouldn’t forget to care
about ourselves too.

687
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,840
I don’t want you to make the same
wrong decision I once made.

688
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,250
MY PRECIOUS

689
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,670
Hey, the shop is closing soon.

690
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:08,550
We’re closed tomorrow.

691
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:10,800
Well,

692
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:12,580
can I stay here a little longer, please?

693
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,310
Please.

694
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,000
No, you can’t.

695
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:15,800
Head back already.

696
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:16,620
Head back.

697
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,980
He’ll be back soon.

698
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,200
Hey, get over him, okay?

699
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:27,900
He won’t come back, no matter what.

700
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:56,600
Hey,

701
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:00,330
I’m secretly rooting for him to head back first.

702
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:06,120
Good luck.

703
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:23,980
Hey,

704
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,230
I couldn't find it,

705
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:29,440
so I bought this one instead.

706
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:44,240
I’m sorry for keeping you waiting.

707
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:47,620
Have you been waiting long?

708
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:58,440
Yes,

709
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:01,670

'You complete me' from Jerry Maguire?

716
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,590
In the end, the one who ends up
with the main character

717
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:28,160

Huh?

722
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:56,830
Move on already.

723
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,810
Grandma, I’m back!

724
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:02,920
Today, we’re expecting
two guests to stay with us.

725
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:04,220
Hey?!

726
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:07,340
How could you get here?

727
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,130
I’m here to organize a dental care project,

728
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:13,200
just surveying to see if anyone
around here is looking for a dentist.

729
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:14,630
Wait.

730
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,450
Actually, the project I’m working on

731
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:21,520
isn’t the only thing I want to do here.
