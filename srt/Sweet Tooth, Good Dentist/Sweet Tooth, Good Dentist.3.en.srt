Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,070
Shit!

6
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,280
Now, open it again.

7
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,620
It can only scare me once, buddy.

8
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,330
Yeah. That’s my secret, Captain.

9
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,700
Once you know something,

10
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:04,650
you won’t be afraid of it anymore.

11
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,700
Try listening to it again.

12
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:07,630
Yes.

13
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,760
Every time I sit on the dentist's chair,

14
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,680
it makes me think back to that day.

15
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:14,650
Don’t be scared.

16
00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:16,280
I’m here.

17
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,660
I’m not going anywhere.

18
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:19,820
Is it funny that I'm obsessed with sweets?

19
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,270
If that's what I thought,

20
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,700
I wouldn’t have said that to you that day.

21
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,310
Most people think that

22
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,100
brushing their teeth hard
will make them cleaner,

23
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,550
but in reality, it damages the enamel.

24
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,009
The correct way to brush your teeth is

25
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,350
to gently move the brush along the gumline

26
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,940
and then softly sweep downward.

27
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,340
For the lower teeth, do the same.

28
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,350
Oh, come on!

29
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:43,530
I came to get my teeth done,

30
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,500
not to take a kindergarten brushing lesson.

31
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:52,250
Cavities are a sign that
something in your lifestyle isn’t right.

32
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,030
If you keep doing the same things,

33
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,250
you’ll be back here again soon.

34
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:56,380
Eh?

35
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,259
Or do you want to see me again?

36
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,610
If you’re talking nonsense like this,

37
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,390
I’m going to leave.

38
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:01,870
Hold on.

39
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,300
Repeat the homework for me first.

40
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,210
Number 1: Brush my teeth properly.

41
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,660
There will be a test too.

42
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:12,520
Number 2?

43
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,150
Be careful not to dislodge the filling.

44
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,870
Avoid hard and sticky foods for now.

45
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:17,740
Number 3?

46
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:18,960
Number 3?

47
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,470
Eh? You only gave me two.

48
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,010
Oh, really?

49
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,200
I thought I gave you three.

50
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,550
Why did you buy so many?

51
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,930
Oh, today, I met an old lady

52
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,960
who was selling snacks
to support her disabled grandchild.

53
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,010
I felt bad for her,

54
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,310
so I bought everything for you
for your live stream.

55
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:45,490
Wow, my friend is such a kind-hearted one.

56
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,890
What do we have here?

57
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,070
There’s sticky rice cake,

58
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,140
sugar-coated rice,

59
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,950
crispy rice cake,

60
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,340
and chewy toffee.

61
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,530
Are you trying to joke with me or what?

62
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,770
I just got a filling,

63
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,950
and you’re giving me
all the hard and sticky stuff!

64
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,570
Eh? How could I know, huh?

65
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,410
Don’t worry.

66
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,210
I’ll eat them myself.

67
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,110
Whoa.

68
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,100
You're such a generous spender, buddy.

69
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,420
Do you think we'll have enough
money left to pay the rent?

70
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,110
Relax.

71
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,420
We've got weeks left, right?

72
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,140
How on earth?!

73
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,410
It’s the day after tomorrow.

74
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,530
Nonsense!

75
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,740
I bet you got that wrong.

76
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,800
Let me check.

77
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,810
It’s not the day after tomorrow,

78
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,900
but it’s tomorrow!

79
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,400
Tomorrow!!!

80
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,579
Tomorrow!!!

81
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,230
What should we do, Gugg?

82
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,530
Asshole, return all of these to the old lady!

83
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,540
Surprise!

84
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,280
It's not the viewers who are surprised,

85
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,100
but it's us!

86
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,370
We bought all the sweets to help the old lady,

87
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,640
so if anyone wants to chip in,

88
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,270
feel free to spam the hearts.

89
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,810
Hungry Bird’s comment says

90
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,850
“If Sant eats the sugar-coated rice,
I'll donate 100!”

91
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,820
Haha, wow, you picked a tough one!

92
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,620
Hey!

93
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,000
E-Wen is challenging us!

94
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,900
"If you finish it in 30 seconds,

95
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,040
I’ll donate 500!"

96
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,270
500?!!

97
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,340
500!

98
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,050
Gugg!

99
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,900
Start the timer!

100
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,300
One.

101
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,130
Slow it down, okay?

102
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:18,480
I just counted one.

103
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,700
Two, three.

104
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:22,550
Four.

105
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,670
Did you finish it in time?

106
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,410
I did.

107
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,400
And what did you lose?

108
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,070
Everything you just got filled for me

109
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,440
was stuck to the sugar-coated rice.

110
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,180
Come on!

111
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,480
Can you help me with filling this time?

112
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:42,870
No!

113
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,900
I’ve already warned you to be careful, right?

114
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,150
This time, I’ll be careful.

115
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,230
No mischief, I promise!

116
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,300
Ouch!

117
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,530
My tooth hurts so bad.

118
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,530
What should I do?

119
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,290
Ouch. Can you help me?

120
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,750
It hurts so much I feel like I'm dying!

121
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,840
Please.

122
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,690
Ouch!

123
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,220
Ouch!

124
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,250
Help me, please.

125
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,960
My tooth hurts so much
I feel like I'm dying.

126
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,620
So in the end, did you help him?

127
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,200
Well, yeah.

128
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,659
And what did you lose?

129
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,790
I didn't lose my words, okay?

130
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,740
The patient was in pain,
so what was I supposed to do?

131
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,400
I haven’t blamed you or anything yet.

132
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,409
You know me,

133
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,800
I can't stand patients who don't
take care of themselves the most.

134
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,820
He promised he wouldn’t go live anymore.

135
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,060
That’s why I agreed to help.

136
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,320
Be honest with me.

137
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,850
Are you mad because
he didn't care about himself,

138
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,810
or because he didn’t care about
what you warned him about?

139
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,530
Five, six,

140
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,850
seven, eight,

141
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,100
nine, ten.

142
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,460
So, even with the donations from last night,

143
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,840
we're still short by 2,000.

144
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:33,860
If we don’t pay by today,

145
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,110
they’ll definitely get our
water and power cut off.

146
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,610
Or is it time for you

147
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,830
to use the gold you've been saving?

148
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:45,810
What gold?

149
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,530
When you were drunk,

150
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,000
you told me you had gold saved.

151
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,560
I was just rambling!

152
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,020
What do you expect from a drunk person?

153
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,450
What should we do then?

154
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,150
Or should we just owe them 2,000

155
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,830
and let them cut the water?

156
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,540
I’m fine with peeing in a bottle.

157
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,130
Come on, my bestie.

158
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,650
Wait here.

159
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,330
I’ll try talking to him.

160
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:24,720
Talk?

161
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:29,700
Hey.

162
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,510
Have you seen the uncle who is
the owner of this dorm around?

163
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,250
I went to find him in his room,
but he wasn’t there.

164
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:34,970
I haven't seen him.

165
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,260
Why are you looking for him, by the way?

166
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,020
I’d like to ask for a delay
in paying for the rent.

167
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,100
We’re a bit short on cash right now.

168
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,870
But can I complain for a moment?

169
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,620
I've been living in this dorm for three years.

170
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,370
Rent is never allowed to be late!

171
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,830
But the elevator’s been broken forever

172
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,220
and they still haven’t fixed it.

173
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,350
I can’t do anything.

174
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,220
All I can do is curse

175
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,100
and hope the consequences fall on
their children and grandchildren!

176
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,740
May they have to use the stairs
for the rest of their lives!

177
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,730
Amen!

178
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,300
Uncle, we have been broke recently.

179
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,000
Can I postpone paying the rent, please?

180
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,520
Come on. I’m just a manager here.

181
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,300
If you need anything, go ask the owner.

182
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,180
My mom owns this dorm.

183
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,630
And what are you doing here at the minimart?

184
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,690
My mom is stingy.

185
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,159
The moment someone quits,

186
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,929
the burden falls on her son right away.

187
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,100
Why didn’t you tell me that?

188
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,210
Handsome bro,

189
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,950
can you lower the rent for me, please?

190
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,770
I really don't have any money right now.

191
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,130
Please.

192
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,250
Please.

193
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:58,640
Please.

194
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,320
No.

195
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,250
It’s because of you!

196
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,100
You didn’t allow me to do the live streaming.

197
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,600
How could I earn the money to pay the rent?

198
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,040
Just talking makes my teeth hurt again.

199
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,680
Ouch.

200
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,400
Ouch!

201
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,320
I don’t know if I can even eat anything.

202
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,230
Ouch!

203
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:26,660
Fine.

204
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:27,700
Alright.

205
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,190
You’re being this kind

206
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,300
because you’re going to say ‘but’, right?

207
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,130
But you must be my secretary for one week, Sant.

208
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,380
Deal?

209
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:50,600
What do you say?

210
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,510
Well…

211
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,060
I'm sorry, man.

212
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,470
Because of me,

213
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,580
you have to be his boyfriend for a whole week.

214
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,920
I'm his lackey, not his boyfriend!

215
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:07,970
But don't worry!

216
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,310
I'll find a way to earn money
to buy your freedom back!

217
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,170
What are you doing?

218
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,060
I'm folding banana fritter bags—
100 bags for 12 baht.

219
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,550
12 baht?

220
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,690
How many bags do you have to fold to earn 2,000?

221
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,360
I don’t know,

222
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,430
but I can do it for you!

223
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:36,890
Hello?

224
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,600
Our deal starts tomorrow, doesn’t it?

225
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,170
Yes.

226
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:40,820
Hurry up and get some sleep then.

227
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,150
See you at the university park at 6 AM tomorrow.

228
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,010
6 AM?

229
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,750
Are you going to do alms round, huh?

230
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,480
Secretary, don’t be late.

231
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,730
Seriously,

232
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,730
if you have to run alone, are you going to die?

233
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,150
I won’t die,

234
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,330
but I’ll be lonely.

235
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,310
I want to run with you.

236
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:15,470
Can I?

237
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,130
Fine.

238
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:22,960
Let’s hurry up and finish this,

239
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,500
so I can go back to sleep.

240
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,640
Let’s go.

241
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,400
Hold on.

242
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,190
I like to listen to
something chill while running.

243
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,010
Welcome to Mission to the Sun,

244
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,710
the podcast that will ignite your passion

245
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,480
and make you burn bright like the sun.

246
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,090
Hey.

247
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,310
Can't we listen to
something more fun than this?

248
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,310
Try listening to something useful.

249
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,630
Maybe your life will get better.

250
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:05,910
Let’s go.

251
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,570
Today, we're going to talk about five signs

252
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,470
that show we're living a good life.

253
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,600
Let's start with the first one.

254
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,770
A good life is one where you exercise regularly.

255
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,710
Here’s your salad.

256
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,400
Here’s the second one.
- Thanks.

257
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,940
A good life is one where you eat healthy food.

258
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,300
Wait.

259
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,650
I ordered sesame oil, not this one.

260
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,500
It's all the same anyway.

261
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:47,670
Just eat it.

262
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:49,700
It's not the same.

263
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,260
Go change it.

264
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,670
It’s the same.

265
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:53,720
It’s not the same.

266
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,350
It’s the same.

267
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,330
It’s not the same.

268
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,130
It’s the same.

269
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:58,860
No!

270
00:12:59,050 --> 00:12:59,750
It’s the same.

271
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:00,910
It’s not.

272
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,630
It’s the same.

273
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,610
- It’s not the same.
- It’s the same.

274
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:05,860
- It’s not the same.
- It’s the same.

275
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,140
- It’s not the same.
- It’s the same.

276
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,310
No!

277
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,170
It’s the same.

278
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,570
Fine. It’s the same.

279
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,150
Today, we need to go see someone.

280
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,740
Their house is all the way over there.

281
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,760
Who?

282
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,130
Why do we have to come all the way here?

283
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,530
Your debtor?

284
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,120
Why did you give me this?

285
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,160
It’s not raining.

286
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,090
This alley has some aggressive dogs.

287
00:13:58,970 --> 00:13:59,640
I'll drive.

288
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,830
You just watch my back.

289
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:03,540
Get on.

290
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,110
Hold me tightly, or you will fall.

291
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,340
What?

292
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,800
Let’s go already.

293
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:19,990
Stop playing around, okay?

294
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:50,620
Hey!

295
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,160
There hasn’t been a single dog barking today.

296
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,050
You’re really a lucky charm!

297
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,910
Huh? When did you fall?

298
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,190
Why didn’t you tell me?!

299
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,330
How could I?

300
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,760
If I did, the dogs would wake up.

301
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,500
Huh?!

302
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,270
The dogs would wake up!

303
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,040
What did you say? I couldn’t hear you!

304
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,150
The dogs would wake up!

305
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,120
Hey!

306
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,780
Come here quickly!

307
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,110
Hurry up!

308
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,000
Hurry up and run! Get on now!

309
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,600
You risked your life this much.

310
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,490
I bet this friend of yours must be
really important to you, huh?

311
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,680
Grandma, hello.

312
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,250
You’re sleeping soundly.

313
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,510
Hello.

314
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,960
I happened to be around here,

315
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,160
so I thought I’d check if the dentures
I made for you are still working well.

316
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,540
They’re still working well, dear.

317
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,100
I don't believe you.

318
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:03,230
Look, I bought some desserts to test it.

319
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,800
Let me open them and put them on a plate for you.

320
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,550
Thank you so much, dear.

321
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,320
No worries.

322
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,650
Being a dentist is tough work, huh?

323
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,020
Yeah.

324
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,560
Even with all this hard work,

325
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,180
there is still a patient
whose fillings came off.

326
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:38,600
I’m sorry, okay?

327
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,040
Usually, I call the patients,

328
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,710
but this grandma doesn’t have a phone,

329
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,180
so this is a special case.

330
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,430
Do you take care of all
your patients well like this?

331
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,360
Uh-huh.

332
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,420
Why?

333
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,300
If I finish my root canal treatment with you,

334
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,840
will you still take care of me?

335
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,700
It depends on whether

336
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,339
you want me to take care of you or not.

337
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:16,690
Grandma, here you are.

338
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,940
Oh, wait.

339
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,530
Let me check your teeth first.

340
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:21,430
Okay?

341
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,079
Alright.

342
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,440
Open your mouth.

343
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,840
They’re still working just fine.

344
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,060
Now, let’s eat this dessert.

345
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,800
Here we go. I’ll open it for you.

346
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,230
This shop is really popular.

347
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,000
It must be delicious.

348
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,490
Then let me give you a massage.

349
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:53,780
Sure, dear.

350
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,730
Excuse me.

351
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,130
You remind me of my grandma at home.

352
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,860
I often give her a massage.

353
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:08,990
Number 3.

354
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,650
A good life is one where you do meaningful work.

355
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,740
You’re good at massaging.

356
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:17,900
Are you ready?

357
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,940
Let’s eat.

358
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,320
We’re done for today, right?

359
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,950
I can finally go back to sleep.

360
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,460
We’re not yet done.

361
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,860
There’s one more left.

362
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,130
It’s an easy task.

363
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,540
Secretary, you have to
sleep over at my place tonight.

364
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,630
Number 4.

365
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:51,000
A good life is one where you have
a regular sleep routine.

366
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,400
What’s wrong?

367
00:18:59,020 --> 00:18:59,980
Are you afraid I’m going to do
something to you or what?

368
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,810
No!

369
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,000
Here's the thing.

370
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,490
My mom rent out this room,

371
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,440
and the tenant hasn't paid rent for 3 months.

372
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,470
Every time I come, they're never here.

373
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,920
If they knew you were coming to collect the debt,

374
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,250
they'd be stupid to stick around.

375
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,710
My spy said

376
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,850
they'll sneak in tonight to collect their stuff.

377
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,720
We'll hide in the room next door.

378
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,910
As soon as they come in,

379
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,770
we'll step out and catch them.

380
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,670
So this room is your mom's too?

381
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:37,450
Yeah.

382
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:38,710
All these rooms around here…

383
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:39,810
I mean,

384
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,450
this whole building belongs to my mom.

385
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,000
Come in.

386
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,950
How much is the rent for this room per month?

387
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,400
It's just a little over ten thousand.

388
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,100
Whoa.

389
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:15,900
That’s not “just”.

390
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,530
Make yourself at home.

391
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,300
You can eat everything in the fridge.

392
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,010
Is it just ice cream in there?

393
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:31,600
Yeah.

394
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:32,800
Why?

395
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,130
Don’t you like it? It’s yummy.

396
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,410
Ouch!

397
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:03,620
What’s wrong?

398
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,110
Does it give you tooth sensitivity?

399
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:07,940
Since it’s this cold,

400
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,200
anyone would get tooth sensitivity
after eating it, right?

401
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,400
That’s not really the point.

402
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,910
It’s more about how well
you take care of your teeth.

403
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,300
Here’s the thing. Listen up.

404
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:30,910
Tooth sensitivity can develop from
gum recession and enamel erosion,

405
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:34,010
which exposes the tubules in the tooth,
triggering the nerves inside.

406
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,090
Doctor, I don’t need to
remember this for an exam.

407
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,710
Can you just suggest a solution?

408
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,200
Now, show me how you brush your teeth.

409
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,400
Are you my mom or what?

410
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,450
You know, most oral problems,

411
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,270
especially tooth sensitivity,

412
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,900
are caused by brushing
your teeth the wrong way.

413
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,750
But I’ve been brushing the way you told me to.

414
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,480
Can I borrow your toothpaste?

415
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,700
I forgot to bring it with me.

416
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,500
Hey, stop.

417
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:28,970
Give it to me.

418
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,050
You’re already doing it wrong from the start.

419
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,430
Come.

420
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:39,530
Brush gently.

421
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,540
Don't be rough on your gums and teeth.

422
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,880
Make sure to clean carefully and thoroughly.

423
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,420
Think of it like brushing a cat's fur.

424
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:16,870
Rinse your mouth.

425
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,950
Satisfied already, right?

426
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,340
Here’s the last one.

427
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,860
A good life is one where we get to love someone.

428
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:47,300
Jay!

429
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,610
There's some vegetable stuck in your teeth.

430
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,500
Where?

431
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,290
There’s none.

432
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,150
It probably came out when you
flipped your head just now.

433
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,710
Let’s take turns watching, two hours each.

434
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,660
I start first.

435
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,020
Whoa.

436
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,420
But can I not sleep yet?

437
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,400
It’s rare to get a chance to stay
in such a fancy room like this.

438
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,840
Well, then,

439
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,570
let’s find something to do, shall we?

440
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,440
What is it?

441
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:26,700
Well,

442
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,700
let’s talk and so on.

443
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:30,680
Why?

444
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:31,950
What are you thinking?

445
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,940
We still haven’t talked enough
the whole day today?

446
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:38,820
We haven’t.

447
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,420
There's still one thing
we left unfinished last time

448
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,620
while I was getting your dental work done.

449
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:43,840
Really?

450
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:44,610
Yeah.

451
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,380
It’s about our first date.

452
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,580
Back then,

453
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,470
when I asked you to be my boyfriend,

454
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,000
what did you say?

455
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,770
I couldn’t remember.

456
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,240
Seriously?

457
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:06,630
Don’t forget that

458
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:10,630
you’re now my secretary.

459
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,620
After you asked me to be your boyfriend…

460
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,830
Stop messing with me already.

461
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,000
What if I’m being serious?

462
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,480
Here’s the thing.

463
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,370
We’ve only known each other
for less than a day.

464
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,250
Do you dislike me?

465
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,300
That’s right!

466
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,000
That’s not what I mean.

467
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,040
To be in a relationship,

468
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,010
don't you think we should at least
get to know each other a bit more?

469
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,000
What you said is right.

470
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,190
Let’s continue hanging out

471
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,220
to learn more about each other.

472
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:41,590
But before we go,

473
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,950
let me get changed first.

474
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:43,590
Well,

475
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:48,550
my “Little Bro” might get sick, you know.

476
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,600
Okay?

477
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:52,930
Let’s go now.

478
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:56,790
Wait.

479
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:00,650
Does this tee look nice?

480
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:01,410
Kind of.

481
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,050
I bought it.

482
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,080
It was a buy one, get one free deal.

483
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:05,940
Here you go.

484
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:08,930
Thank you.

485
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,400
In case you ever want to wear
matching outfits someday.

486
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,830
We’ve been hanging out for a long time today.

487
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,660
Don’t you feel tired?

488
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,000
This is our last spot already.

489
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,980
Order whatever you want to eat.

490
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,200
It’s on me.

491
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,010
You think bringing food to tempt me
will make me fall for you, huh?

492
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,590
Cheers!

493
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:43,970
Whoa.

494
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,030
Little bro, you’re quite good at drinking.

495
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,520
Little bro? Nonsense.

496
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,100
Call me Sant!

497
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,010
Got it, Little Sant.

498
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,700
Sant!

499
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,700
Got it, Sant.

500
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,960
Do you hang out like this often?

501
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,400
Whoa, bro.

502
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,710
For me,

503
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,600
having beer in front of the dorm
is already fancy enough.

504
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,810
Since we're here,

505
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,200
how about we go dance?

506
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,320
Nope.

507
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,720
I can’t dance.

508
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,690
Come on.

509
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,040
I can’t either.

510
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,390
Let’s give it a try.

511
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,290
Hurry up.

512
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,310
Hey, you drank it up already.

513
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,290
Come.

514
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,400
Let’s just blend in and dance along first.

515
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,170
Is this place running on
high voltage or something?

516
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,300
Why does it keep killing the vibe?

517
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,480
Shit.

518
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,650
I’m sorry, bro!

519
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,090
I want to dance!

520
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,400
And after that, you started complaining,

521
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,100
asking the DJ to play mor lam music.

522
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,000
In the end, I had to drag you to karaoke.

523
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,500
That’s why you agreed to leave the place.

524
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,800
I can't remember at all.

525
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,210
The next thing I knew,

526
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,070
I was waking up in the morning.

527
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,060
That wasn’t surprising, though,

528
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,700
since you drank that much.

529
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,900
Did I cause any more trouble while I was at it?

530
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:09,790
Actually, that night,

531
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,460
I didn’t drink much less than you either.

532
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,300
I vaguely remember

533
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,520
you forcing me to sing a duet with you.

534
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,590
♪ You think too much, Doctor ♪

535
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,140

536
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,830

538
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,200
I’ve just realized…

539
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,650
That I can sing well?

540
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,890
That life could be this much fun.

541
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,090
You’re making me really curious now

542
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,490
about how you grew up.

543
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,030
Who with a good life would take on a job
to hang out with someone like you?

544
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,130
That's true.

545
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,260
Why couldn’t I figure out this simple thing…?

546
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,730
People can't choose how they're born,

547
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,020
but if we could,

548
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,740
I'd choose to live the way
high-society people do.

549
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,030
What's life like in high society?

550
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,820
Like waking up at 5 AM to go for a run.

551
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:16,800
And while running,

552
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,200
you have to listen to an inspiring podcast too.

553
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,390
When it comes to eating,

554
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,190
it must be organic food,

555
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,430
even though I don't really know
what it even means.

556
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:48,000
It means doing the work you love,

557
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,930
at the time you want to do it.

558
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,610
If you don't feel like it, just don't do it.

559
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:58,880
But in the end, no matter what happens,

560
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,610
as long as I can lie in a soft bed,

561
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,520
with the cool air,

562
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:08,670
hugging the person I love instead of a bolster,

563
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,590
I don't ask for anything more.

564
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,730
Today, I've made your dreams come true,

565
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,150
Little Sant.

566
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:11,310
I don't know what you're carrying,

567
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,200
but it must be really heavy, right?

568
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,010
Yeah.

569
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,900
But it might get lighter

570
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,500
if someone helps carry them.

571
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,580
Are you referring to yourself, huh?

572
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:39,300
Yeah.

573
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,800
Someone like me isn’t worthy enough
to be anyone's boyfriend.

574
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,050
You should meet a good person,

575
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,030
who can take care of you.

576
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,620
Don’t waste your time on someone like me.

577
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,360
It’s already morning?

578
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,160
It’s 9 AM already.

579
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,440
I’m sorry.

580
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,980
I fell asleep so soundly.

581
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,670
Why didn't you wake me up?

582
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,230
Oh, well…

583
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,210
I've caught the debtor already.

584
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:57,400
You handled that all by yourself?

585
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,790
Yeah. That’s right.

586
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,250
When I opened the door,

587
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:06,490
I saw him right away.

588
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:09,330
As soon as he saw me, he ran off,

589
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,850
heading up to the rooftop,

590
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:13,120
so I chased after him to the rooftop.

591
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,230
I kept running

592
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:14,929
until I managed to catch up.

593
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:15,860
Thankfully, I was fast.

594
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,010
Once he was cornered,

595
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,010
- he pulled out a sword, about this long…
- Stop it.

596
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,870
It’s good you’ve caught him.

597
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:29,290
I’m hungry already.

598
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:32,020
Go wash your face, brush your teeth,
and let's find something to eat.

599
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:32,900
Wait.

600
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,630
I can go by myself.

601
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,250
You don't need to follow and watch over me.

602
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,199
Eh?

603
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:44,800
Who told you I’d follow and watch over you?

604
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:48,159
Someone my level will have
an assistant do it for me.

605
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,520
Oh?

606
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,390
Sant, when you first sent me the location,

607
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,740
I thought it was some rundown condo,

608
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,840
but turns out it's super fancy!

609
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,510
What’s going on?

610
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:09,780
Doctor,

611
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,400
I'm here to get my friend’s freedom back!

612
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,900
Here's the 2,000 baht for the overdue rent.

613
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,340
Where did you get the money from?

614
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:30,050
I folded 17,000 banana fritter bags.

615
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:30,880
Huh?

616
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,380
But since it was for you, I could do it.

617
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,210
Hey.

618
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,880
Don’t stare at him like that.

619
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,910
I understand that you're really angry with him.

620
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,210
He worked you so hard, didn't he?

621
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,040
But everything is alright now.

622
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:54,830
Go get your stuff packed.

623
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,130
Your freedom is back.

624
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:57,960
Your freedom is back.

625
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,090
Have you lost weight?

626
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,510
Did the doctor give you anything to eat?

627
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,810
I ate some clean food,

628
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,140
milk,

629
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,380
and fruits.

630
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,720
Damn it.

631
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,340
Your blood sugar must have dropped, huh?

632
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,430
Are you alright?

633
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:31,710
What’s with you?

634
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,380
Thank you.

635
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:39,530
Here you are.

636
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,440
Add these to your body.

637
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:42,720
It’s on me, your sugar daddy.

638
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:54,700
Yummy.

639
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,330
Can I try it?

640
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,330
But it’s cold.

641
00:36:58,810 --> 00:36:59,960
You might end up with tooth sensitivity again.

642
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,340
Shit!

643
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:10,820
It hurts like crazy, right?

644
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:11,810
It’s damn delicious!

645
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,410
What did you do?

646
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:18,770
You no longer suffer from tooth sensitivity?

647
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:29,350
Oh, the dentist gave me a little advice.

648
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,230
Bestie.

649
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:36,610
Yeah?

650
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,310
Why do we still have to fold these bags?

651
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,970
Well, it pays well, you know.

652
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,710
I’ll sleep now.

653
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,800
It’s just 10 PM.

654
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,870
Why do you feel sleepy early these days?

655
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:08,970
Hello?

656
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,370
You’re calling me this late at night.

657
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,210
Don't you think I might be asleep?

658
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:14,300
I don’t.

659
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:17,090
Normally, at midnight, I still see you going live.

660
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,300
So why are you calling me?

661
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,670
I’m confirming that

662
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,920
you have a dental appointment tomorrow,

663
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,400
followed by a teeth-brushing exam too.

664
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,080
Don’t be late.

665
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:28,220
Got it.

666
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:29,460
Do you call

667
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,300
to confirm appointments
like this with everyone?

668
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,210
Yes.

669
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,520
I do this with every patient.

670
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,650
If there's nothing else, I'm heading to bed.

671
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,390
Yeah.

672
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:42,700
Sweet dreams.

673
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,650
And do you also say this to everyone?

674
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:47,630
Nope.

675
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:49,290
I only say it to some people.

676
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,300
Jay.

677
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:14,950
So does he like it?

678
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,660
What?

679
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:17,700
That thing.

680
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,600
That one.

681
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,260
I haven’t given it to him yet.

682
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,110
His friend picked him up
before I got to do so.

683
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,620
I see.

684
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,850
So you'll soon find out if,

685
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,160
after being apart,

686
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,570
he can remember
what you’ve taught him or not.

687
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,500
I calculated, and his teeth
are about 15% stained.

688
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,260
Okay. You passed.

689
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,390
Don't forget to polish
the patient's teeth as well.

690
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,380
I thought that, after being apart,
you'd forget what I've taught you.

691
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,840
How could I forget?

692
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,100
If my teeth decay again,

693
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,390
I'll have to come back and see you.

694
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:30,500
Uh-huh,

695
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,120
but anyway,

696
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,800
thank you for helping me pass the exam.

697
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,620
It’s I who should thank you

698
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,000
for paying for me.

699
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,000
I’m not paying for you.

700
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:48,820
It’s 30 baht.

701
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,200
Since I passed,

702
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,460
don't you think I deserve a reward?

703
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,230
I’m not giving one

704
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,400
because I already have
a reward prepared for you.

705
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,610
It’s a toothbrush holder.

706
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:08,900
When you use it, you'll feel like
I'm always watching over you.

707
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,990
So this is the assistant you mentioned?

708
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:18,340
Well, I tried to find one that
looks the most similar.

709
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,400
Does it look like me?

710
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,040
It does.

711
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:22,830
Thank you.

712
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:30,710
Hey,

713
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,790
seaweed stuck on your face.

714
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:33,620
Come on.

715
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:35,770
Are you trying to get back at me?

716
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:37,310
Get back at you for what?

717
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:38,610
I’ll remove it for you.

718
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:53,330
Don’t waste your time on someone like me.

719
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:02,850
Sant,

720
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:06,910
you’re worthy enough

721
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:10,080
to be someone’s partner,

722
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,570
at least to me.

723
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:46,390
♪ Since you came into my life,
it’s been so bright ♪

724
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:52,040
♪ With you right here,
it feels so warm, so right ♪

725
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:58,080
♪ So stay with me, don’t ever leave my side ♪

726
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:04,930
♪ ‘Cause every day, you make me smile ♪

727
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:06,780
Shit.

728
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,370
What’s wrong?

729
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:15,100
When we went to karaoke together that day,

730
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,750
did I do anything crazy?

731
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:24,310
Well,

732
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,850
I don't remember either.

733
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,600
I only snapped back to reality
the next morning, just like you.

734
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:34,940
Why?

735
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:35,830
Did something come to mind?

736
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:41,470
Nothing.

737
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:45,370
Let’s continue eating.

738
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,470
Onew passed the exam to study in Bangkok

739
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,140
and will be staying here!

740
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,700
I didn't want my family to worry,

741
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:41,310
so I told them that I'm in Bangkok

742
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,610
living and eating comfortably and luxuriously.

743
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:44,980
In this building,

744
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,320
I can think of one room.

745
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,570
That day, I asked you to be my boyfriend

746
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:48,320
You’re talking about my room?

747
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:49,870
because I really like you.

748
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:50,310
We only have one spot left.
