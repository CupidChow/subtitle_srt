Hello, all my fellow cavity crew!

6
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,450
This is “Hungry while sleeping,
Yawning when waking up!”

7
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,700
This adorable Sant is here to snack for you!

8
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,180
And the snack Sant will be eating today is…

9
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,610
Gugg!

10
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,150
I haven’t told you to join yet.

11
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,270

12
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,900
please subscribe to the “Gugg The Wa” channel.

13

14
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:24,460
What?

15
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,430

16

17
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,490
Since it’s our channel’s 3rd anniversary today,

18
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,090
I’ll be holding a Q&A session,

19
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,380
answering some questions sent to my inbox.

20
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,990
The first question is from Hungry Bird.

21
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,860
Sant, where are you from?

22
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,660
I'm a person everywhere...
except when I'm drunk.

23
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,320
I’m kidding.

24
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,720
I’m an out-of-town kid,

25
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:48,940
but not an overseas one.

26
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,100
Here’s the second question.

27
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,729
Which faculty are you studying at?

28
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,040
From what i checked

29
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,780
you’re fine.

30
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,930
You can go home today.

31
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,660
Cut! Wrap it up!

32
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:09,620
Great job.

33
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:10,919
Since I’m an influencer,

34
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,800
of course, I study at
the Faculty of Communication Arts.

35
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,560
In one day, apart from running this channel,

36
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,980
do you do anything else?

37
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,510
I start my morning with a light exercise.

38
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,570
Thank you, kiddo.

39
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:28,329
Thank you.

40
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,020
After that, I attend classes as usual.

41
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,460
Then after class, I do some extra jobs

42
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,780
to build new connections.

43
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,190
Big sister, it’s done.

44
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,500
Little boy,

45
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,550
do you accept an extra job?

46
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,130
Hey?!

47
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,430
So, show me how to solve this question.

48
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,020
Solve that in the blacket first.

49
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,720
Great job!

50
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,290
Soda, I’m off to work.

51
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,330
I’ll hurry back.

52
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,020
Don’t be stubborn with him, alright?

53
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,680
Please take care of her for me.

54
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,420
Noted.

55
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,170
Don’t worry at all.

56
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,500
And at night,

57
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,550
I’m seeing all my fellow cavity crew like this.

58
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:14,870
Awww.

59
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,190
E-Wen, the leader of the cavity crew fandom
sent you 1,000 hearts.

60
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,570
Alright. I’ll let her ask me one more question then.

61
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,090
This is her question.

62
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,340
I’ve seen you take on all sorts of jobs.

63
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,140
What’s the weirdest one you’ve ever done?

64
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,079
The weirdest one I’ve ever done?

65
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,060
Looking back about a year ago…

66
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,400
Huh?
ONE YEAR AGO

67
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:36,980
ONE YEAR AGO

68
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,660
You want me to ask for a breakup
with your boyfriend for you?
ONE YEAR AGO

69
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,150
ONE YEAR AGO

70
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,120
He’s not my boyfriend yet.
ONE YEAR AGO

71
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,170
ONE YEAR AGO

72
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,170
We’re just in the talking stage.

73
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,430
I’m supposed to meet him
for the first time tomorrow,

74
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,150
but last night,

75
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,840
I swiped right on someone else
and we just clicked.

76
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,340
Then just call the first one and cancel!

77
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,230
Then he’s going to call me and chew me out.

78
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,990
So you’re making him yell at me instead?

79
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,980
I’ll give you 5,000 baht.

80
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,000
His name is Jay,

81
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,800
and he said he’ll be bringing
a white flower with him.

82
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,720
Dude, I’m not ready for a relationship now.

83
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,750
Meeting her will just waste her time.

84
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,690
His name is Jay,

85
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,500
and he said he’ll be bringing
a white flower with him.

86
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,659
He’s strange but good-looking.

87
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,400
Hello?

88
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,500
How could you just hang up on me like that?! Hello?

89
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:21,830
Are you Queen?

90
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,400
Jay!

91
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,200
Jway.

92
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,510
Jay.

93
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:47,940
Jway.

94
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:50,750
Jay.

95
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:52,909
Jway.

96
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:55,700
Whatever it is!

97
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,409
Queen asked me to tell you that

98
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,270
she’s sorry she couldn’t make it today.

99
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,370
If there's nothing else, I’ll leave now.

100
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,320
Hold on, little bro.

101
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,210
I was so stunned back then.

102
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,850
Do you guys know what he told me?

103
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,090
He said…

104
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,150
Ouch!

105
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:38,790
Ouch!

106
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:39,820
Hey, what was wrong with him?!

107
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,480
Nothing was wrong with him,

108
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,650
but something is wrong with me now!

109
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,300
Everyone, I have to end my live stream for today.

110
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,780
See you later.

111
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,960
Thank you for watching.

112
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,320
Turn it off.

113
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:51,110
Turn it off!

114
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:57,659
Ouch!

115
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,450
What’s wrong?

116
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,550
I don’t know.

117
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,480
I suddenly got a sharp toothache out of nowhere.

118
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,790
That’s not a surprise to me, though,

119
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,320
since you’re eating sweets everyday.

120
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,440
Go see the dentist.

121
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,600
No, I’m fine.

122
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,040
I’ll take some painkillers, and it’ll be fine.

123
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,470
Painkillers?

124
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,200
Let me see your face.

125
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,540
Oh, it’s swollen, isn’t it?

126
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,720
See the dentist.

127
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,960
Dude, I heard moaning sounds all night.

128
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,980
Do you think we’re being haunted or something?

129
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,360
It’s not a ghost.

130
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,030
It’s my voice!

131
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:59,540
Ouch!

132
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,330
Shit.

133
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,030
Your condition is even worse than last night.

134
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,620
This is not right.

135
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,220
Go see the dentist.

136
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,900
Do you think I don’t want to go?

137
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,740
Will you pay for me, huh?

138
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,110
Come on. I don’t have money.

139
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,660
But I think there’s one place that can help you.

140
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,010
FACULTY OF DENTISTRY

141
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:28,970
At the Faculty of Dentistry,
FACULTY OF DENTISTRY

142
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,920
they offer special prices for dental work.

143
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,860
It's for cases where dental students
are just starting out.

144
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,870
If you're interested, just go through the system,

145
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:36,960
and they'll handle everything for you.

146
00:08:58,810 --> 00:08:59,970
I’m here for dental registration.

147
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,480
Please register right here.

148
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,940
After you’re done, please head inside.

149
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,430
Even with half his face showing,
he’s still this good-looking.

150
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,440
Imagine how amazing he'd look fully revealed!

151
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,600
Oh wow, with a dentist this handsome,

152
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,160
I’d let him pull all my teeth out!

153
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:36,210
I’m sorry I just finished treating a kid’s teeth.

154
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,000
Jay!

155
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,140
Jway.

156
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,580
You want me to ask for a breakup
with your boyfriend for you?

157
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,760
I’ll give you 5,000 baht.

158
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,430
Hold on, little bro.

159
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,230
She’s already dating someone else.

160
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,360
She doesn’t want to waste your time.

161
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,920
How about you?

162
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,500
Are you taken?

163
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:06,870
I’m not.

164
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,200
Your smile is lovely.

165
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,540
Do you want to hang out with me?

166
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,330
Huh?!

167
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,770
What a small world, Sweet Smile Boy.

168
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,000
Whoa.

169
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,210
Look at that.

170
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,810
Your tooth decay has reached the root already.

171
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,390
Perfect timing.

172
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,640
I’m looking for a root canal treatment case
to send to my professor.

173
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,510
Are you interested in being my case?

174
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:50,990
How long will it take?

175
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:51,630
Like, how many minutes?

176
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,360
We’d need to drill the decayed tooth,

177
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,770
expose the nerve, clean it,

178
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,590
and then fill it up and crown it.

179
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,370
The whole process should take about a semester.

180
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,230
A semester?

181
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,610
No, that can’t be.

182
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,060
You’re just trying to get back at me, aren’t you?

183
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,650
Get back at you?

184
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,540
For what?

185
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,130
If I have to get my teeth done by you,

186
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,310
I’d rather go to a normal dentist!

187
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,850
Hey, what’s not normal about me?

188
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,300
Do you really want me to be honest

189
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,100
about why you're not normal?

190
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,500
You’re hiring me to hang out with you?
I’m not an escort boy, you know.

191
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,580
How much do you want?

192
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,160
500? 1000?

193
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,230
Just here to tell you you’re dumped,
I’m already getting 5,000.

194
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,670
If we’re going further,

195
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,460
that should be at least 10,000, right?

196
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,220
Deal.

197
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,400
After the job, I’ll transfer it to you.

198
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,500
This is the deposit.

199
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,400
Seriously?

200
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:43,580
Are you hungry?

201
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,490
Have you eaten yet?

202
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,330
There’s a great coffee shop over there.

203
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:47,600
I’ll treat you.

204
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,200
Let’s go.

205
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:50,130
Come.

206
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,200
You already said you’ll treat me, okay?

207
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,650
Thank you.

208
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:28,730
What’s with that face?

209
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,470
It’s not delicious?

210
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,350
I can’t explain it in words.

211
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,870
It’s not like any other shops I’ve tried before.

212
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,110
How about some coffee instead?

213
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,740
I’ll order for you.

214
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,180
No.

215
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:43,980
I don’t drink coffee.

216
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,560
How can someone not drink coffee?

217
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:48,830
That’s kind of weird.

218
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,700
Do you want to taste it?

219
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:53,830
No, thanks.

220
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,210
I don’t like snacks.

221
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,440
And you’re calling me weird?

222
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,010
You’re the one who’s totally weird.

223
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,500
Well, snacks are for kids, you know.

224
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,110
Allow me to educate you.

225
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,110
I run a snack channel,

226
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,620
and even people from
your parents' generation watch it.

227
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:18,960
What’s the name?

228
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,600
“Hungry while sleeping, Yawning when waking up”

229
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,660
It’s just a small channel, though.

230
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,250
I mean, what’s your name?

231
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,730
Why do you want to know?

232
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,440
Once today’s over, we won’t see each other again.

233
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,200
I’ll call you Sweet Smile Boy then.

234
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,310
Okay?

235
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,940
Please enjoy the movie.

236
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,870
Thank you.

237
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:08,520
You said you don’t eat snacks, didn’t you?

238
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,810
I’m not eating this.

239
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,680
I bought it for you.

240
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,260
Who told you I’m going to eat it, huh?!

241
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,090
Awww, come on.

242
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,970
-You smell nice.
-I do?

243
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,740
Yeah.

244
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,940
Poking, poking, poking.

245
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,230
Oh, don’t.

246
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,250
Awww, stop it.

247
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,160
Are you crazy?

248
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,650
Let’s watch the movie, okay?

249
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,760
Can I get two kisses?

250
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,140
It’s ticklish!

251
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,000
Let me do it a bit.

252
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,180
Shhhh!

253
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,350
Just don’t care.

254
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,370
Let’s continue things between us.

255
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,180
Stop it.

256
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,390
Awww, no.

257
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:50,580
I smell good?

258
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,200
You do.

259
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,750
There are a lot of people here.

260
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,970
-Stop it already. I’ll watch the movie.
-Don’t be loud.

261
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,660
There are a lot of people here.

262
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,990
I’m shy.

263
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,780
Oh, come on.

264
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,930
It’s ticklish!

265
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,130
Poking, poking, poking.

266
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,070
Shhhh!

267
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:22,840
Why?!

268
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,450
Is your dad a gecko,

269
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,130
or is he the owner of the theater?

270
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,780
The staff hasn’t even said anything,

271
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,400
so if you’re not happy, go watch somewhere else!

272
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,400
Hey, that’s enough.

273
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,800
Don’t care about him.

274
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,580
Let’s continue.

275
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,310
I’m shy.

276
00:16:59,290 --> 00:16:59,900
Excuse me.

277
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,030
Do you need any help?

278
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,000
Hey,

279
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,859
if you’re going to be all over each other like that,
go do it somewhere else.

280
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,650
People are here to watch a movie.

281
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,180
Leave!

282
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:22,700
Get out!

283
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,849
Get out already.

284
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:24,480
Go!

285
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:25,760
Get out.

286
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,510
Get out!

287
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,760
Go somewhere else!

288
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,130
-Get out!
-Get out!

289
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,050
Get out.

290
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,050
Yay!

291
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,200
Woo-hoo!

292
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,020
Get out!

293
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,030
Woo-hoo!

294
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,270
And now you’re asking me why you’re weird?

295
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,410
And how am I weird?

296
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,240
You do you!

297
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,740
I’ll go find another dentist.

298
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,840
Hey! Hold on!

299
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,570
All the root canal cases
in the faculty are full right now.

300
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,900
If you’re going outside,

301
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,350
it’ll cost around 20,000 to 30,000.

302
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:19,520
Can you afford that?

303
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:22,770
20,000 to 30,000?

304
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,130
It looks like

305
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,230
you’ll have to get treated by me after all,

306
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,340
Sweet Smile Boy.

307
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,700
Thanks for your concern,

308
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,900
but before coming here,

309
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:47,880
I searched and found a kind dental clinic
near the university with a reasonable price.

310
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,690
Hey, that place!

311
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,020
I know it might be a little more expensive,

312
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,130
but I’m sure it’ll be more
comforting in the long run.

313
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,100
Bye.

314
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,480
Hey, but that clinic…

315
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,490
SHLAM DENTAL LAB

316
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,000
This is not as advertised!

317
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:19,930
SHLAM DENTAL LAB

318
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,100
Hey, bro?

319
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,420
Here for a dental treatment?

320
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,400
Well, hop on the bed.

321
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,600
Don’t I need to fill out my medical history first?

322
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,470
Whoa, your cheek is so puffed up.

323
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,790
Your tooth must have decayed
all the way to the root by now.

324
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:01,860
Hello.

325
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,370
By the way,

326
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,340
how much does a root canal treatment cost?

327
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,130
500 baht.

328
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,250
Huh? Why is it so cheap?

329
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,020
It’s just 500?

330
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,130
Who’s going to treat it?

331
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,200
I’ll just pull it out.

332
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,180
There’s no need to keep it.

333
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,960
Don’t be scared.

334
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,590
You've got plenty of other teeth to chew with!

335
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,690
Come!

336
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,090
Wait, I’m just asking.

337
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,780
-I won’t get it done today.
-Come!

338
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,510
Hold on!

339
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,450
Darling, where have you been?

340
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,790
I’ve been looking for you.

341
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:30,890
I’m sorry about that.

342
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,010
My boyfriend’s not all there right now.

343
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,950
He thought this was a coffee shop.

344
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,900
So are you going to get the treatment or not?!

345
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,900
He won’t dare to.

346
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,030
Nope, I mean, he won’t.

347
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,200
We’d better leave now.

348
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,500
Since when have I become your boyfriend, huh?

349
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,290
Hey.

350
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,260
I’m helping you, okay?

351
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,570
You really don’t know

352
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,960
that this clinic isn’t up to standard?

353
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,150
The faculty is already looking for
someone to handle it.

354
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,700
Why didn’t you tell me that

355
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,100
my case would just be an extraction and done?

356
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:12,930
Listen up.

357
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:16,460
Teeth are part of the body your parents gave you.

358
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,790
It's my job to take care of them,

359
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,450
even if the person doesn’t want to keep them.

360
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,450
You're not me, so you wouldn't know.

361
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,630
Someone like me isn't even sure if I’ll have
money to buy food to chew tomorrow.

362
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,200
If you want to earn some money,

363
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,310
I have an easy job with good pay.

364
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,780
It’ll take less than an hour. Interested?

365
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,020
No!

366
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,500
1,000?

367
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,600
What’s the job?

368
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,570
Confess my love to someone for me.

369
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,100
Alright.

370
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,640
Don’t tell me

371
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,130
the person you want me to confess to is you.

372
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,400
What if it’s me?

373
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,210
Then, 1,000 isn’t enough.

374
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:13,460
How much then?

375
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,090
I bet you can’t afford it.

376
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,230
What a relief that person isn’t me,

377
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,100
but it’s him.

378
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,030
Who?

379
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,720
It’s that person

380
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,420
with a sweet smile.

381
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,720
You’re asking me to tell myself
I love me in the mirror?

382
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,300
You’re smart.

383
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,200
Follow what I say.

384
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,700
Hey, I’m sorry…

385
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,170
Hey, I’m sorry…

386
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,200
for not taking care of you well enough,
causing your tooth to decay.

387
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,820
for not taking care of you well enough,

388
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,070
causing your tooth to decay.

389
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,500
I promise that from now on…

390
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,910
I promise that from now on

391
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,430
I’ll take good care of you,

392
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,490
starting by having him treat my teeth…

393
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,280
starting by having him treat my teeth…

394
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,300
even if I treated him badly before.

395
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:43,700
Say it now.

396
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:53,450
even if I’ve treated him badly many times.

397
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,680
If I apologize sincerely,

398
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,370
he’ll probably be willing to take care of my teeth.

399
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,020
You’ve said it,

400
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,000
so now show it with actions.

401
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:08,740
I’m waiting to hear it.

402
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,760
Are you shy?

403
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,000
It’s fine.

404
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,700
I’ll turn around.

405
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,740
Take your time, no rush.

406
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,290
I’m waiting to hear it.

407
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:23,360
Say it now.

408
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,600
I’m sorry!

409
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,620
Hey!

410
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,900
for making you wait for nothing,

411
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,860
but in this lifetime, I’ll never agree
to get my teeth treated by you!

412
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:38,950
Let’s go!

413
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,720
Eh!? Hey!

414
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:51,100
I wish you could’ve seen his face
when I rejected him.

415
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,320
He was totally in shock.

416
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:53,530
Ouch!

417
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,520
I think right now,

418
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,600
your situation isn't that different from his.

419
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,540
Now, you’re left with just two options.

420
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,780
Option 1 is to take the money he gave you

421
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:04,840
and go get your tooth extracted.

422
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,060
How about the other option?

423
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,170
Say sorry to him.

424
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:13,960
Scratch that option then.

425
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,110
Why so?

426
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,790
He might be a little weird,

427
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,150
but he didn’t really do you any harm.

428
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,630
That's in the case where I haven't
done anything to him before.

429
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,170
You have?

430
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,330
I haven’t finished the story.

431
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,900
After he went to confront
that couple at the cinema,

432
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,660
I…

433
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,100
Hey, did you see the faces of that couple?

434
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,840
When I walked in, they looked so shocked.

435
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:47,730
Their faces were like this.

436
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,110
It was so satisfying!

437
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,010
How dare they mess with someone like me?

438
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:56,430
Are you hungry?

439
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,460
Let’s eat something.

440
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:08,670
I’m hungry.

441
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:11,970
There's a noodle shop right across.

442
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,010
Just cross over, and we're there.

443
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,020
We can eat here. It's easier.

444
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,550
Come on!

445
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,810
Let’s go. It’s so delicious.

446
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:21,900
I guarantee it won’t disappoint you.

447
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,800
-Come.
-Huh?

448
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:24,600
Hey!

449
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:25,910
Hey!

450
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,000
Actually, taking the boat
like this feels pretty good.

451
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,960
It's a whole different vibe.

452
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,050
Eh? Hey!

453
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,820
How could you do that to me?!

454
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:54,610
What?!

455
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:01,490
Damn it!

456
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,560
You treated him that awfully.

457
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,520
Lucky enough he didn’t pull all your teeth out!

458
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,750
You’re right.

459
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,120
That's why I don't want him to treat my teeth.

460
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,480
Then, you’ve got one option left.

461
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,050
Just pull that tooth out already.

462
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,630
There’s one more option.

463
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,200
I invested my money in something.

464
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,000
If nothing goes wrong,

465
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,220
I can get all my teeth treated.

466
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,110
You did?

467
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,880
What did you invest in?

468
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,630
Crypto or stocks?

469
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:31,840
A lottery.

470
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,150
Come on.

471
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,570
Someone like me can only manage to do this much.

472
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,100
Even though I wanted to buy a lottery set,

473
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,170
I could only afford to buy one.

474
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:47,730
I can buy you one more.

475
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,450
I’m kidding.

476
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,490
FACULTY OF DENTISTRY

477
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,310
How is it going with your Sweet Smile Boy?

478
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:05,320
He’s still stubborn.

479
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,000
I guess I’ll have to keep pushing a little longer.

480
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:10,200
Seriously, what did you hold against him?

481
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,730
Why are you pestering him this much?

482
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,430
I'm just concerned about my patient as a dentist.

483
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,070
That's all.

484
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,990
You’re overthinking it.

485
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,470
I think you should worry about yourself first.

486
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,570
If you can’t find a case
for root canal treatment this semester,

487
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,150
you won’t graduate with your friends, you know.

488
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:25,900
Yeah, whatever.

489
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:29,990
He’ll come back for treatment
with me, trust me.

490
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:31,530
Hey.

491
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,770
Have you watched this?

492
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,470
It’s been shared in the university group chat.

493
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,540
Hello, welcome to… Gugg…channel.

494
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,460
Well, because my friend
has a terrible toothache

495
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,970
and quickly needs money for treatment,

496
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,310
tonight I’m doing a challenge.

497
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,420
I’ll dance non-stop

498
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,300
until the donation goal is reached.

499
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,020
Let’s do it!

500
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,650
He’s going all out.

501
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,200
Super.

502
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,690
Jimmy has five sunflowers.

503
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,980
Sea has four more than him.

504
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,100
How many sunflowers does Jimmy have?

505
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,410
How do we solve this question?

506
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,830
Soda, pay attention to your homework first.

507
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,730
Don’t play with your phone now.

508
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,870
Sant, look at Gugg.

509
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:24,790
He’s dancing non-stop.

510
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,260
Thank you for watching me.

511
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,890
Don’t forget to tap the screen

512
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,670
and donate to my friend,
so he can get his dental treatment.

513
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,110
He has a severe toothache, everyone.

514
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,710
Let me show you my dance step.

515
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,390
Gugg!!

516
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,540
Soda, continue with your homework.

517
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,200
I’ll be right back.

518
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,510
What are you doing?!

519
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,580
Why didn’t we discuss it first?!

520
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,800
If we discussed,

521
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,510
would I get to do it, huh?!

522
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,600
How many hours have you been dancing?

523
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,080
Three.

524
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,910
I’ve set the donation goal to 35K.

525
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:14,910
It’s almost reached.

526
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,660
Now, we’ve got…350.

527
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,010
How many days do you have to dance?!

528
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,000
Stop it already. Enough.

529
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,900
I’m…totally fine.

530
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:29,880
I’m doing this for you.

531
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,340
Gugg!

532
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,300
Gugg!

533
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:34,790
Fine.

534
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:37,640
If you don’t stop, I’ll dance!

535
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,230
I’ll dance while having a toothache!

536
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:46,850
Sant!

537
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,900
Sant, stop!

538
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,170
I won’t!

539
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,490
If you want me to stop,

540
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,690
you must stop first!

541
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,950
Wow, the viewers hit 5,000 already.

542
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,610
Donations are coming in fast too.

543
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,850
They’re getting viral.

544
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,480
Gugg, you did it!

545
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,660
Our donation goal has been reached!!

546
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,650
Thank you!

547
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,310
Thank you.

548
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:18,020
Thank you, all the sweet tooth crew!

549
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,130
We will never forget this kindness.

550
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:23,890
Thank you.

551
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:27,520
Gugg!

552
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:32,150
It looks like you’ll have to find
a new case for root canal treatment

553
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,750
instead of your Sweet Smile Boy.

554
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,110
Ouch!

555
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:45,880
Ouch, it hurts!

556
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:47,630
Ouch!

557
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,810
So, where did the skilled guy from earlier go?

558
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,130
I’m sorry.

559
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,510
That was the best idea I could come up with.

560
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,310
Why did you say sorry?

561
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:00,810
I should thank you.

562
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:02,750
Thanks, my bestie.

563
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,510
That gives me goosebumps.

564
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,160
You think it’s only you who feel that, huh?

565
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,170
It looks like you don’t need to get treated

566
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,650
by your strange dentist anymore.

567
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:17,410
-You’re getting on my nerves!
-Ouch! My back!

568
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,130
You!

569
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:22,980
Shit.

570
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,400
Why is my nephew calling me now?

571
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,850
He probably watched the live
and was worried about you.

572
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,200
What’s up, Onew?

573
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,320
Uncle, we’re screwed.

574
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,930
Our house is flooded.

575
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,800
This year, we couldn't harvest the rice at all.

576
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,900
Now they’re asking for the fertilizer payment.

577
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,750
I heard our grandma mention

578
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,600
she might borrow from a loan shark to pay first.

579
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,960
But we still haven’t finished
paying off the old debt.

580
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,700
Alright, tell grandma not to borrow yet.

581
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,610
I just got a lump sum of money.

582
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,700
I’ll transfer it to her soon.

583
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,400
Uncle, are you here for a root canal treatment?

584
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,010
Yes.

585
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:30,970
This way, please.

586
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:31,510
Alright.

587
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,750
-Please.
-Thank you.

588
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:49,200
All the root canal cases
in the faculty are full right now.

589
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:50,800
Listen up.

590
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:54,380
Teeth are part of the body your parents gave you.

591
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,630
It's my job to take care of them,

592
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,310
even if the person doesn’t want to keep them.

593
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,460
Hey, I’m sorry…

594
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,510
for not taking care of you well enough,
causing your tooth to decay.

595
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,100
for not taking care of you well enough,

596
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,270
causing your tooth to decay.

597
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:11,199
I promise that from now on

598
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,719
I’ll take good care of you,

599
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,480
starting by having him treat my teeth…

600
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:54,310
Next, we will announce the first prize

601
00:34:54,949 --> 00:35:00,190
for the draw on April 16, 2025.

602
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:13,360
The winning number is 48260…

603
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:42,680
482609.

604
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,440
Soon, you won’t feel hurt anymore!

605
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:57,490
Pull the tooth!

606
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,960
Ugh!!! No way!!

607
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,270
How did you end up here?

608
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,380
Don’t you have to go treat Uncle’s teeth?

609
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:28,150
He’s my friend’s patient.

610
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,400
I just walked him there. That’s all.

611
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,300
This way, please.

612
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,190
Alright.

613
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,200
Thanks.

614
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:36,700
-Uncle, please take a seat.
-Sure.

615
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,880
Ugh!!!

616
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:07,250
No way!!!!

617
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,630
Bro, I’m sorry.

618
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,910
Is it still not too late

619
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,200
to get a dental treatment with you now?

620
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:29,900
You know,

621
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,180
I’ve never left you behind, right?

622
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,640
Shit!

623
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,590
He hasn’t transferred me the money.

624
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:47,080
Damn it.

625
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,200
I should have collected the payment
before taking the job.

626
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,350
Hey, someone jumped into the river!

627
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:55,460
Someone fell into the river!

628
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:57,230
Someone fell into the river!

629
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,210
Are you okay?

630
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:01,110
Someone fell into the river!

631
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:01,850
Help!

632
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:03,010
Help!

633
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:03,870
Help!

634
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:04,970
Help!

635
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,730
I bet it’s not…

636
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,500
Look. You’re soaked.

637
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,000
You’re soaked.

638
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,650
But this time, you can't leave me again, okay?

639
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,050
I'll clean the root canal

640
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,330
and do a temporary filling for you today.

641
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,210
Hey!

642
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,110
Sant!

643
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,080
You’ve been making that moody face all day.

644
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:34,950
My tooth hurts!

645
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,840
Then you go sit over there.

646
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,760
I'll handle the directing instead.

647
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,160
It looks like someone’s free like me now.

648
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,500
Do you want to relax somewhere?

649
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,350
I’ll give you a ride.

650
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,010
After that day,

651
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,370
did anyone else ask you out to the movies?

652
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,550
Nope.

653
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,450
I’ve been working nonstop, super busy.

654
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,250
Who would want me as a boyfriend?

655
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,010
Back then, one person did, didn't he?
