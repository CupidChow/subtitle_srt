1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,010
You ever wonder why a kid like me,
obsessed with sweets, ended up in med school?

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:04,260
The truth is,

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:05,640
I had an older brother.

4
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:06,460
His name was Jeng.

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,800
Until one day,

6
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,750
a car ran a red light and hit Jeng.

7
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,250
So I promised myself

8
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,740
I’d do everything I could to protect that smile.

9
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,840
But today, I almost ruined it with my own hands.

10
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,250
You didn’t do anything wrong.

11
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,300
You just cared.

12
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,770
You were afraid he’d be the reason
your mom lost her smile.

13
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,700
Dude, Jay totally played it cool with me.

14
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,680
He acted like he didn’t care about his birthday,

15
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,340
so I planned a huge surprise.

16
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,670
Then while you’re out making merit,

17
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,720
I’ll clean up the room.

18
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,610
I didn’t say anything about
making merit just now.

19
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,600
Is there something you’re hiding?

20
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,160
I'm heading out.

21
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,360
I’ll be back in the afternoon.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,500
Yeah.

23
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:51,470
What?

24
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,940
Hope you have a great day today.

25
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:56,790
Mm-hmm.

26
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,700
Wait for me, okay? I’ll be back soon.

27
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:01,400
Bye-bye.

28
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,200
You're getting candles for Jay’s birthday cake?

29
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,460
Captain.

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,470
You’re here?

31
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,700
I kind of figured something was up

32
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,289
when you asked me to teach you how to bake,

33
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,260
so I snuck over to check,

34
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,700
and it’s just like I thought.

35
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,740
I’m sorry for lying,

36
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,660
but I didn’t know who else to turn to.

37
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,710
If I told you the truth,

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,900
I was afraid you’d feel bad.

39
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,370
The one who would feel bad isn’t me.

40
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,360
It’s the birthday boy.

41
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,200
Actually, I wanted Jay to tell you himself.

42
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,390
Go ahead.

43
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,390
I don’t want to be the one to hurt him.

44
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,290
Jay is not in the mood to
celebrate his birthday today.

45
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,560
He goes to the temple
with his mom every year,

46
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,870
not for his birthday,

47
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,010
but for his brother.

48
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:20,980
It’s because his birthday
was the day he lost him.

49
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,840
I'm so tired.

50
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,500
You just can’t get over him,

51
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,660
so maybe I should be the one to forget you.

52
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,110
Cut!

53
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,700
Okay, good.

54
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,010
Let’s move on to the next scene.

55
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,079
Bring them the chairs.

56
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,560
Nice weather today.

57
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,010
Are you Da’s new boyfriend?

58
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,470
That’s such a blunt question.

59
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,570
Uh... why do you think that?

60
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:23,080
She’s been posting stories with you a lot.

61
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,600
Am I right?

62
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,570
No. We’re not dating.

63
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,540
I’m just trying to win her over.

64
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,260
Oh, I see.

65
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,250
Thanks for being honest with me.

66
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,460
Then can I ask you something straight too?

67
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,840
You asked me directly

68
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,650
because you still have
feelings for Yada, right?

69
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,440
Yeah, I do.

70
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,670
Then here’s one last direct question.

71
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,280
Why did you leave her?

72
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,610
Who said I left her?

73
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,610
We broke up because of her.

74
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:25,800
Huh?

75
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,630
I mean, yeah, I said it first,

76
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,820
but it was because she changed.

77
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,159
She was always working,

78
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,750
so I walked away first,

79
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,090
so she wouldn’t feel burdened.

80
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,940
Can I ask?

81
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,010
What did you guys argue about?

82
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,620
She just went back to her ex, a guy.

83
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,520
That’s not how I understood it at all.

84
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,600
Then how did you see it?

85
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,700
Well…

86
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,200
Do you remember you asked me

87
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,460
why Jay stopped eating sweets?

88
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,740
It’s not because he switched to dental school.

89
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,440
It was because of his birthday that year.

90
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,700
Mom, let’s not wait for Jeng anymore.

91
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,170
Should I start eating already?

92
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,600
Hmm, he’ll be back soon.

93
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,860
The cake is not going anywhere.

94
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,720
Ugh, I want to eat it already.

95
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,730
JENG

96
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:57,700
See? Speak of the devil. He’s calling.

97
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:02,800
Where are you now, sweetie?

98
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,300
Mom, tell him if he's not here in 10 mins,

99
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,420
I’m not waiting!

100
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,180
What was that?

101
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,690
Mom, what’s wrong?

102
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,900
Mom!

103
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,400
Mom, what’s going on?

104
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:36,600
Mom!

105
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,100
Jeng…

106
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,560
Why are you crying, Mom?

107
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,060
Jeng…

108
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,800
What happened to him?!

109
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,500
What’s wrong with him?

110
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,640
He’s not with us anymore.

111
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,610
He’s not coming back to us.

112
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,450
HBD, JAY, MY MESSY BRO!

113
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,300
Mom, I don’t think we can eat
this cake anymore.

114
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:17,560
I’ll throw it out.

115
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:21,730
Uh-huh.

116
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,030
I’ll buy a new one for you.

117
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,570
Next year on my birthday,

118
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,540
don’t buy a cake, Mom.

119
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,210
Let’s make merit for Jeng instead.

120
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,900
Since that birthday,

121
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,920
he’s never celebrated his birthday again.

122
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:52,730
He probably wants today to be just about Jeng.

123
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,560
I came today to tell you this.

124
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,170
Whether to throw him a party or not,

125
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,060
that’s up to you.

126
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,340
What’s up, Jay?

127
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,100
I’m done with my errand.

128
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,350
I’m taking Mom home now.

129
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,960
I’ll head back to you right after.

130
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:36,830
Muah!

131
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,470
Alright.

132
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,890
Alright then, I’ll go now, Mom.

133
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,240
You’re not staying for a meal?

134
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,060
I can’t.

135
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,440
I’ve got more stuff to do.

136
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:56,850
Hey, wait.

137
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,900
Can I get the repair shop’s number?

138
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,860
Something’s wrong with my car.

139
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,090
It’s hard to start these days.

140
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,530
I’ll get it checked for you.

141
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,370
Use my car for now, okay?

142
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,300
I’m off.

143
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,340
Alright.

144
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,660
There I go again.

145
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:19,730
I forgot the key.

146
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:46,770
Jay!

147
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:47,900
Yeah?

148
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,980
Oh, well.

149
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,060
I’m hungry.

150
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,310
Can you grab me a snack from the fridge?

151
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,530
Don’t you usually get it yourself?

152
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,210
Well, can’t I be clingy with my boyfriend?

153
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,700
Go on, I’m hungry!

154
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,710
Mmm.

155
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:08,750
What do you want to eat?

156
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,550
Anything’s fine.

157
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,370
Anything?

158
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,090
Mmm...

159
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,230
Did you buy a cake too?

160
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,000
Shit!

161
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,020
I put everything away,

162
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,020
but not the cake!

163
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,400
Let me have a look.

164
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,250
HBD, DR.JAY, THE WEIRDO.

165
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,050
Is this cake for me?

166
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,970
I knew today is your birthday,

167
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,840
so I wanted to surprise you,

168
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,840
but I also just found out
you don’t like your birthday.

169
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,290
That’s why I had to change the plan last minute.

170
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,690
HBD, JAY, MY MESSY BRO!

171
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,770
HBD, DR.JAY, THE WEIRDO.

172
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:43,940
I’m sorry.

173
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,060
Sant.

174
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,700
I’m allowed to be happy with that, right?

175
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,270
I didn’t do anything wrong, did I?

176
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,530
You deserve this.

177
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,450
It’s your birthday today.

178
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,620
Thank you.

179
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:53,970
No worries.

180
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,100
Smile for me.

181
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,290
Cheers!

182
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,260
Cheers!

183
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,860
I’m heading back now.

184
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,290
I’ll walk you downstairs.

185
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,700
Just let me wrap things up.

186
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,020
I’ll help.

187
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,430
How are you getting home?

188
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,010
Do you want me to walk you down?
I’m heading to the minimart anyway.

189
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:19,820
Alright.

190
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:20,830
Okay.

191
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,100
Let me open the door for you.

192
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,200
Hey.

193
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,060
Thanks, man.

194
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,270
For what? I should be thanking you.

195
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,970
I got free food.

196
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,450
That’s not what I meant.

197
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,400
I meant thanks for helping him bake.

198
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,200
It was clearly your style.

199
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:02,710
Yeah.

200
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:06,860
You know what?

201
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:12,250
I was really happy to see you
eat cake again today.

202
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,410
When you lost your brother,

203
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,890
I lost my dessert buddy too.

204
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,630
Yeah.

205
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,530
I’m sorry.

206
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,640
Well, since you're celebrating
your birthday again,

207
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,560
maybe it’s time to take your life back already,

208
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,300
so I don’t have to worry anymore.

209
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,790
Who told you to worry about me, huh?

210
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,160
I’m not worried about you.

211
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,360
I’m worried about Sant.

212
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,800
The one Sant loves is you,

213
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,390
not Jeng you’re trying to become.

214
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:14,640
If you really love him, you need to choose.

215
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,330
You can’t be two people at once.

216
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,620
I’m heading back.

217
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,560
Yeah.

218
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:43,250
Hey, I already shot that movie.

219
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,330
How was it?

220
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,290
Was the lead actress really that cute?

221
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,600
See for yourself on your phone.

222
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,020
Where? You didn’t send me anything.

223
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,650
She’s right there on your screen.

224
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,900
Baipor told me she still misses you.

225
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,900
So? She still chose her ex anyway.

226
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,970
Did she ever say that to you?

227
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,470
She just felt slighted

228
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,270
you always picked work over her.

229
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,000
At this point, she can say whatever she wants.

230
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:33,700
Didn’t you once tell me

231
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,220
you hate it when people try to judge you

232
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,700
whether you like men or women?

233
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,260
Then maybe you shouldn't be
so quick to judge others either.

234
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,320
Come with me.

235
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:01,650
Yeah.

236
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:13,860
Yada,

237
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,300
do you know what today is?

238
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,600
It’s been 193 days since we met.

239
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,370
To be honest, I’m so tired.

240
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,440
No matter what I do,
you still can’t forget your ex.

241
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,900
Maybe it’s easier if I forget you instead.

242
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,090
Stop it! I’ll hit you!

243
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:51,890
Gugg, thanks for everything.

244
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,010
I understand everything now.

245
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,510
Hey, sweetie?

246
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:46,850
Hello, Mom.

247
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,240
Are you asleep?

248
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,940
Not yet. What’s up?
You’re calling this late at night.

249
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,900
Can I come see you?

250
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,100
Now? Is something wrong?

251
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,130
I just miss you.

252
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,800
It feels like we haven’t really talked in a while.

253
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,620
Didn’t we just see each other this morning?

254
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:10,490
Come on, Mom.

255
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,450
Please let me come over.

256
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,950
Fine, fine. If you’re coming, hurry up.

257
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,290
I’m about to go to bed.

258
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,110
Okay, I’ll be quick.

259
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,350
It took you long enough.

260
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,160
I’ve been waiting forever.

261
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,230
Eh?

262
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:34,780
Jeng?

263
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,320
Why have things turned out this way?!

264
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,410
Don’t leave me!

265
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:04,950
Eh?

266
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:06,930
Jeng?

267
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,400
What are you doing here?

268
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,430
What?

269
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,010
This is my house.

270
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,000
No, I mean

271
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,290
weren’t you hit by a car?

272
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,100
What are you talking about?

273
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,500
If you’re still alive,

274
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,840
then why did I try to get into
dental school for you?

275
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,800
Dental school? You? Seriously?

276
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:38,940
Eh?

277
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,630
Bad dream, huh?

278
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,900
I told you not to watch
horror movies before bed.

279
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,530
A dream?

280
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,660
Good. I’m glad it was just a dream.

281
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,860
Mom, the guest of honor is here.

282
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:13,650
What event?

283
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:14,470
Come on.

284
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,790
It’s your day, don’t you remember?

285
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,230
Why didn’t you go inside to see him?

286
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:14,710
I just wanted to know how Jay’s doing.

287
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:18,110
He’s out of danger now.

288
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,670
But as for when he’ll wake up,

289
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,930
the doctor said it depends on him.

290
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,860
Jay’s strong.

291
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,790
He’ll get through this.

292
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,750
He told me you were his patient.

293
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,020
Yes.

294
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:57,790
He did my dental work.

295
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,760
But it’s not just that, is it?

296
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,140
You’re right.

297
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,660
Back when it happened to
his dad and his brother,

298
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,330
none of them came back to me.

299
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,770
They must have thought I’d be fine on my own.

300
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,010
But now,

301
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,620
if someone can bring Jay back,

302
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,800
I’d be grateful.

303
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,520
If he knows you’re waiting,

304
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,660
I’m sure he’ll come back.

305
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,460
What did the doctor say?

306
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:35,180
They said it’s all up to him.

307
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,800
Jay, everyone’s waiting for you.

308
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,730
Jay.

309
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:00,920
Jay! Hurry up.

310
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,020
I’m recording already.

311
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,010
Ugh, just film already.

312
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,040
Our channel’s all about our good looks anyway.

313
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:06,850
Alright.

314
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,710
Go ahead.

315
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,810
Hello!

316
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,780
Welcome back to “Eat With Cap and Jay.”

317
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,370
Yay!

318
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,780
Today we’re reviewing this.

319
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,370
Tada!

320
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,240
Jay’s birthday cake!

321
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,200
It’s Jay’s birthday today,

322
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,070
so help us wish him a happy birthday.

323
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:28,020
Today’s cake is vanilla
with strawberry topping.

324
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,770
Dude, don’t talk too much.

325
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,760
Let’s eat already.

326
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,600
Here it is, everyone.

327
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,200
Hey!!

328
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:41,200
Cap, are you trying to hog the spotlight?!

329
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,960
Get back here!!

330
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:45,740
Oww! Stop it!

331
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,320
Come here, you!

332
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,040
I’m sorry.

333
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:22,800
It’s okay.

334
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:27,400
I know you two are close.

335
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,300
He’s like this because of me.

336
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,550
I’m sorry.

337
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,260
That night,

338
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,340
I told him to go talk to you.

339
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,830
I didn’t know it would turn out like this.

340
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:56,130
I...

341
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,640
I’m so sorry.

342
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,180
Captain,

343
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,170
it’s okay, really.

344
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,940
Tell me

345
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,570
what he was going to talk to me about.

346
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,610
Jay never wanted to be a dentist.

347
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,850
He never wanted this life.

348
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:41,980
But he tried so hard

349
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:45,159
just to become Jeng.

350
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,800
JENG

351
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,199
He did all of that for you

352
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,010
to bring your happiness back.

353
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:02,010
He lived his brother’s life

354
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,910
even if it meant losing his own.

355
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,370
Funny, right?

356
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,800
In a moment like this,

357
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,710
instead of thinking about
the good times we had,

358
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:37,440
I keep thinking about
all the things we never did.

359
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,090
We never even had croissants together.

360
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,130
I’ve not yet introduced you
to my family properly.

361
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,530
There’s still so much we haven’t done together.

362
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:57,850
You haven’t even used
the birthday gift I gave you.

363
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,030
You promised me...

364
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,680
you’d never leave me, didn’t you?

365
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,150
What’s the birthday boy doing hiding over here?

366
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:25,400
Wait. Is someone being dramatic here?

367
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,100
No!

368
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:32,600
I’m just happy you guys didn’t forget.

369
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:36,240
Honestly, I almost did.

370
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,640
That’s why I didn’t have time to buy a gift,

371
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,420
so take this.

372
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,290
These are giveaways from my faculty to kids.

373
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,440
It’s perfect for a candy-obsessed kid like you.

374
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:59,080
Jeng, can I ask you something?

375
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:00,560
Yeah?

376
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,070
Why did you decide to be a dentist?

377
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,220
I actually wanted to be a chef like you.

378
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,820
Come on, seriously?

379
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,810
I mean it.

380
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,400
But I didn’t have the talent like you do,

381
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,060
so I chose the path I was good at.

382
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,200
That’s good, though.

383
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:25,620
This house already has one messy kid—me.

384
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,010
Mom’s had enough headaches.

385
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:27,860
Who says that?

386
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,500
She’s so proud of you.

387
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:36,430
She often showed your
snack review videos to our relatives.

388
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,210
She forced them to subscribe too.

389
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,600
Half your views probably came from her.

390
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,670
Really?

391
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:50,950
All this time, I thought

392
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,360
if someone in our family had to go,

393
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:56,760
it should’ve been me.

394
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,070
Don’t say that.

395
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:01,900
No one can take anyone’s place.

396
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:17,110
Thanks…for coming back.

397
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,800
This is the best birthday I’ve ever had.

398
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:25,980
Really?

399
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,720
But don’t you feel like something’s missing?

400
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,220
What do you mean?

401
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,200
No matter how much you want to stay here,

402
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,730
you know this isn’t real.

403
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:48,540
Go back.

404
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,620
Someone’s waiting for you.

405
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,580
It’s someone you want to return to, too.

406
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:06,860
But you won’t be there.

407
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,630
It’s all my fault.

408
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:20,410
If you hadn’t rushed back to see me that night—

409
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:24,080
Hey, what are you saying?

410
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,460
If it weren’t your birthday,

411
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,510
I’d never have known
what it’s like to be a big brother.

412
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,570
Thanks for being born as my little bro.

413
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:40,500
Go.

414
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,060
It’s time to go back.

415
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,900
I missed you.

416
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,170
I don’t want to leave.

417
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,100
Just one more day will do.

418
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,480
We’ll see each other again.

419
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:03,480
My messy little bro.

420
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,320
I’m sorry for making you wait.

421
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,010
Jay!

422
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,430
Here you go.

423
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,300
I saw this shop on YouTube. It looked so good.

424
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:46,510
I already pinned the location.

425
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,800
A dubai chocolate donut place?

426
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,670
Then there’s an old-school Thai dessert spot?

427
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,290
A 100-year-old toddy palm cake shop?

428
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,900
Are you bookmarking dessert shops
all across the country or what?

429
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,820
What do you expect when I’ve got
a dessert-addicted boyfriend?

430
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:02,500
Huh?

431
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:07,100
"Sweet Smile Shop – never get bored
even after eating it every day”

432
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,800
What’s this?

433
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,480
Uh… I must have pinned that by mistake.

434
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:18,900
This is our dorm, isn’t it?

435
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,700
“Sweet Smile Shop” means me, doesn’t it?

436
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,970
Well, I could have you every day
and never get bored, right?

437
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,770
If you want to know, take a bite.

438
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,100
Then today I’m heading to
this Sweet Smile Boy instead.

439
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:34,980
You’re such a tease.

440
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,720
The best bites are always saved for last.

441
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:38,560
I want to eat.

442
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,260
- That’s enough!
- But I want it now!

443
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,270
I’m hungry.

444
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:42,750
Let’s go.

445
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:46,010
Fine.

446
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,300
Let’s go.

447
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,850
EXPECTED ARRIVAL TIME 10.28 AM.

448
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,810
You must be really
head over heels in love with me.

449
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,860
You chose to do your service in my hometown.

450
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:04,840
I was left alone by my boyfriend for years.

451
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,490
Well, I’ve graduated.

452
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,410
Once you finish your service,
we can move back to Bangkok together.

453
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:12,080
No more climbing up to fix this or that.

454
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:15,140
I know you love this place so much,

455
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:18,750
but there’s no way just the two of us
can take care of this alone.

456
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:20,530
I’m finishing my service next month.

457
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:21,490
That means we’re finally going back to Bangkok.

458
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,410
What if I don’t go back with you?

459
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:25,440
What do you say?

460
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:26,900
What do you mean?

461
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,040
Grandpa and Grandma have been talking.

462
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:30,600
They want me to stay and take care of this place.

463
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:32,300
I do want to go back with you,

464
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,900
but if it means leaving them behind,

465
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,450
I…just can’t.
