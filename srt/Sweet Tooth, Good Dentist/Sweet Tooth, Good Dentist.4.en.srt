1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,380
Handsome bro,

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,150
can you lower the rent for me, please?

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,160
Please.

4
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:04,850
Fine.

5
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,970
But you must be my secretary, Sant.

6
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:09,500
We’re done for today, right?

7
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:10,610
There’s one more left.

8
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:12,680
Today, I've made your dreams come true,

9
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:13,710
Little Sant.

10
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,870
You have a dental appointment tomorrow,

11
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,410
followed by a teeth-brushing exam too.

12
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,280
Got it.

13
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,230
Thank you for helping me pass the exam.

14
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,740
When you use it,
you'll feel like I'm always watching over you.

15
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:24,960
Shit.

16
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,100
What’s wrong?

17
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,280
Nothing.

18
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,570
Sant,

19
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,400
you’re worthy enough

20
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,510
to be someone’s partner,

21
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,200
at least to me.

22
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:27,789
Hey, hold on.

23
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,370
I just kissed him.

24
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,450
You’re imagining things too far, huh?

25
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,140
I’m sorry.

26
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,660
I was carried away.

27
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:35,800
What happened after that?

28
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,390
I fell asleep.

29
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,180
I only snapped back to reality the next morning.

30
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,800
Honestly, listening to your story,

31
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,710
I think it’s totally classic,
starting off rough but ending with love.

32
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,920
But when you met him again this time,

33
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,300
why have you been acting all cold toward him?

34
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,100
That’s because you haven’t listened
to the real ending, dude.

35
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,410
That morning…

36
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,560
Shit.

37
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,800
Eh? Where are you going?

38
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,410
Ouch.

39
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,960
Ouch.

40
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,200
Oh.

41
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,590
I’m going to get something for my hangover.

42
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,070
Do you want anything?

43
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,829
Get me one cup of coffee then.

44
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,810
Sure. One cup of coffee.

45
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,570
Wait here.

46
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:02,770
I’ll get it for you.

47
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,340
Hey, hold on.

48
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,610
Yes?

49
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,210
Get me some milk instead.

50
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,420
Sure.

51
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:25,900
Milk.

52
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,320
But sit here and rest.

53
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,400
I’ll buy it for you.

54
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,329
You kissed him and then dumped him!

55
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,050
What the hell is your heart made of?

56
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,510
I was drunk, okay?

57
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,390
Come on, think about it.

58
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,250
What kind of a decent person
would date someone like him?

59
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:44,829
Fine.

60
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,430
So why did you tell me this story then?

61
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,640
There’s something that’s been bugging me.

62
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,800
Do you think he really doesn’t remember the kiss,

63
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,940
or is he just pretending not to?

64
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,200
I think that doesn’t matter.

65
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,800
What matters more is his feelings for you now.

66
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,400
Who knows?

67
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,610
The reason he’s treating your teeth
is probably because he still likes you.

68
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,400
Nonsense!

69
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,920
He’s just doing his job.

70
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,390
Calling to check on you three times a day?

71
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,700
I don’t think he’s just doing his job.

72
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,600
He’s even adding a late-night call today.

73
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,360
It’s Onew, my nephew!

74
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,530
What’s up, my dear nephew?

75
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:30,660
Huh?

76
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,520
You passed the exam already!

77
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,100
Alright, I'll take you to see the school.

78
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:35,900
Don’t worry.

79
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,150
I’m screwed, dude!

80
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,090
Eh?

81
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,590
Onew passed the exam to study in Bangkok

82
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,060
and needs to confirm his spot,

83
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,850
so he will be staying here!

84
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,550
That sounds like good news, doesn’t it?

85
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,890
That’s not it.

86
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,760
I didn't want my family to worry,

87
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,300
so I told them I'm in Bangkok,

88
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,560
living comfortably, eating well,

89
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,430
and enjoying a glamorous lifestyle.

90
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,690
Glamorous?

91
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,630
Are we glammed or just scraping by, huh?!

92
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,250
We’re screwed!

93
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:54,610
Bestie,

94
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,100
our room isn’t that crappy, is it?

95
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,290
It looks great.

96
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,800
Our furniture is a Japandi style.

97
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,700
Look.

98
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:06,980
This is a Japanese-style table.

99
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,650
On top of that,

100
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,650
we have a portable smart TV

101
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,600
with a wireless system.

102
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,800
And we’ve got fashion lovers covered

103
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,400
with a walk-in closet zone,

104
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,610
a one-stop service

105
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,040
where everything’s taken care of in one place,

106
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,790
including clothes, bags, shoes, and jewelry.

107
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:34,830
Buddy,

108
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,360
I think we should stop lying to ourselves.

109
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:39,710
You’re right.

110
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,400
Since our room isn’t that luxurious,

111
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,100
don’t force it.

112
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,600
Just surrender already.

113
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:46,890
In this building,

114
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,159
I can think of one room.

115
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,080
Yeah?

116
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,530
You’re talking about my room?

117
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,720
If there’s one room that’s glamorous,

118
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,220
it’d probably be the owner’s son’s room, right?

119
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,840
I bet you’re kind enough

120
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,710
to lend this room to my nephew, right?

121
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,800
What can I expect from someone like you?

122
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,610
I just cleaned up the room.

123
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,880
And what do you mean by someone like me?

124
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,410
The handsome,

125
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,500
kind person who has a room to lend, of course.

126
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,880
Are we living in the same dorm, huh?

127
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,560
This is the real smart TV!

128
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:41,600
It’s so huge.

129
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,480
This is the real western style table!

130
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,760
Even the bed is the real deal,

131
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,470
and so is the closet.

132
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,500
Your room is as messy as mine.

133
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,060
But you’ve got only brand name stuff.

134
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,640
Though our rooms are both messy,

135
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,900
we’re different.

136
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,300
Does this tee look nice?

137
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:18,940
Kind of.

138
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,670
I bought it.
It was a buy one, get one free deal.

139
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,430
Here you go.

140
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,550
Thank you.

141
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,130
In case you ever want to wear
matching outfits someday.

142
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,750
But this one isn’t glamorous, though.

143
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:35,700
- You’re still keeping it?
- Hey!

144
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,260
It’s for wearing when sleeping.

145
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:42,860
So…

146
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,510
how long are you going to use my room?

147
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,180
About one week.

148
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,100
During that time,

149
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,570
you can stay in my room.

150
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,980
No.

151
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,700
I can stay at home.

152
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,010
Who knows?

153
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,100
The reason he’s treating your teeth
is probably because he still likes you.

154
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,190
Hey.

155
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,060
Why are you willing to help me

156
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,260
when it’s such childish stuff like this?

157
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,510
Who said I’m helping?

158
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,220
Eh?

159
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,740
Since you're asking to borrow my room,

160
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,520
let me check how your nephew behaves first.

161
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,700
If he's like you, I'll reconsider.

162
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,380
Why?

163
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,660
What if he’s like me, huh?

164
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,080
Uncle!

165
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,750
Onew!

166
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,400
Hello.

167
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,880
Uncle Chuen didn’t drop you off?

168
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,660
I noticed the alley is narrow,

169
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,930
so I had him drop me off at the entrance,

170
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,720
and then I walked in myself.

171
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,220
I didn’t want to bother him.

172
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,550
Wow.

173
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,270
Your nephew’s attitude
is nothing like yours, huh?

174
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,690
You’re ready to let us borrow your room, right?

175
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,860
Who is he?

176
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,550
- Well…
- Oh, I’m Jay.

177
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,410
I’m Jway.

178
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,550
Oh, you’re Uncle Jay?

179
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,790
Sant told me about you often.

180
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:18,700
It’s hot here.

181
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,580
Let’s head upstairs, okay?

182
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,370
Hey, hold on.

183
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,070
What did he tell you about?

184
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,280
He said you’re such a talented person.

185
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,620
Really?

186
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:33,540
What else?

187
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,330
And you’re super hard working.

188
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,860
Your dad is in debt,

189
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,620
and your mom has cancer.

190
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,590
Every day, you have to work to pay off the debt.

191
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,930
These bananas are from my farm at home.

192
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,130
Please take them to get by for now.

193
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,360
Thanks.

194
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,020
When I told them my life is all glam,

195
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,050
everyone else has to stick to the basics

196
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,200
just to make it sound believable.

197
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,670
So…are you still okay
with me borrowing your room?

198
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,900
Whoa, my dear nephew.

199
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,220
I’ve missed you so much!

200
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,200
Let me hug you.

201
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,230
Let me carry you.

202
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:20,600
Are you heavier?

203
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,360
Smile.

204
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,540
Wow.

205
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,300
The field is bigger than the picture we saw.

206
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,470
You know what?

207
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,640
This field has produced
several national team athletes.

208
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,900
I’m not really into sports, you know.

209
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,210
I only play chess.

210
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,980
Look at those buildings!

211
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,910
All are tall ones.

212
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,900
We don’t have anything
like this around our place.

213
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,020
Yeah, right?

214
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,530
At that height,

215
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,040
walking up there must be exhausting.

216
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,400
Let’s go.

217
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,210
Have you ever heard that

218
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:08,370
school isn’t just a place, but it’s the people?

219
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,750
You’ll get to have good friends

220
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,260
who’ll help each other out for a long time.

221
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,500
Isn’t that great?

222
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,600
Do you think

223
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:19,730
people here would want to be friends with me?

224
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:21,950
With so many students in one class,

225
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,970
there are going to be some
who’ll get along with you.

226
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:28,930
Uncle Jay?

227
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,210
Hey?

228
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,300
Were you secretly following me?

229
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,620
Hey,

230
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,920
relax.

231
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,310
Well, I’m an alumnus here.

232
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,450
The professor asked me to do a group project

233
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:41,800
to teach kids how to brush their teeth.

234
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,640
So where are your group members?

235
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,320
I got the time wrong.

236
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,450
We actually scheduled it for 1 PM.

237
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,740
Great, then!

238
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,140
How about you take
the two of us on a school tour?

239
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,280
I see.

240
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,210
You just want to spend time with me, right?

241
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,090
Nope!

242
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,270
So, the thing is, Onew keeps insisting
on not studying here.

243
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,050
Please help convince him that

244
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,500
if he graduates from here,

245
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,150
his future could be as bright as yours.

246
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,540
Alright. Got it.

247
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:17,920
Onew.

248
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,150
Yes?

249
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,130
You’re more of an academic type, right?

250
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:22,910
Yes.

251
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,980
I’m going to give you a nerdy school tour.

252
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:26,660
Yes!

253
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,100
Good boy.

254
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:28,910
Let’s go.

255
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,220
This is the academic olympiad club room.

256
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,820
Everyone’s fighting to get in here.

257
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,460
It's a great portfolio

258
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,400
for when you want to continue
your study somewhere, right?

259
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,360
No, it’s because the computer is powerful.

260
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,910
When you play games, it runs so smoothly,

261
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,410
no lag at all.

262
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,500
Back when I played, it was so awesome.

263
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,140
Wow, so many awards!

264
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,300
Which one is yours?

265
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:57,730
Mine are all over the place.

266
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,600
I can’t even remember which is which.

267
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,100
You can’t remember or just don’t have any?

268
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:02,610
I do have some!

269
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,480
Like this one right here.

270
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:11,220
This is the "Miss Politeness" award.

271
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,610
I don’t think it’s the right one.

272
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,190
Well, it’s a lot, so I mixed some up.
It’s no big deal, right?

273
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,660
Were you really a nerd, huh?

274
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,030
Hello?

275
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,100
Huh?

276
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,140
The tire’s flat?

277
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,680
What do we do now?

278
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:37,680
No way.

279
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,400
It’s almost time for the show.

280
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,490
Hello?

281
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,390
Hey?

282
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,490
So your friend can’t make it anymore?

283
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,440
Yeah.

284
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,660
What should I do?

285
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,650
The teacher’s already scheduled the kids.

286
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,900
I definitely need to find
someone to replace them.

287
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,230
But where can I find someone who’s free,

288
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,720
can dance,

289
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,430
and isn’t picky about the work?

290
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,090
Where can I find that person?

291
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,290
Why are you looking at me like that?

292
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,250
Thanks for helping me.

293
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,630
I don’t know who else to beg for help from.

294
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,330
I’m only doing this
because you let me borrow your room.

295
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,400
Uh-huh.

296
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,690
Brush every day, and your teeth
will be clean and strong!

297
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,330
Hey.

298
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,980
No wonder you’re called
“Perfect Waistline Gugg”!

299
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,280
That’s not surprising, you know.

300
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:33,850
Hold on.

301
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,100
If the three of us are going to perform,

302
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,200
who’s going to play the music?

303
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,910
My nephew isn’t great with computers.

304
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,220
You don’t have to worry about that.

305
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,210
I’ve already asked my friend to come help.

306
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,630
Here she is.

307
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,260
Thanks for coming to help, dude.

308
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,700
I’ll talk to her.

309
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,340
Sant!

310
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,400
Yeah?

311
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:07,940
Is she Jay’s friend?

312
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,510
Yes. Why?

313
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,340
Is she your type?

314
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,300
She’s looking for a case to scrape tartar.

315
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,460
Go talk to her.

316
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,760
My type? Nonsense!

317
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,850
She’s as fierce as a dog.

318
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,300
Let’s just go our separate ways.

319
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:25,580
Here’s the thing.

320
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,250
I have to do a show teaching kids
how to brush their teeth,

321
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,410
so I want to try out the show I’ve been planning

322
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,600
with the kids here first.

323
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,300
In case there are any issues,
I can fix them right away.

324
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,410
Your job is super easy.

325
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,160
Just play the sound for us.

326
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,970
I’ve already sorted the folder for you.

327
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,170
Hey, Da.

328
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,320
Are you listening?

329
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,310
Don’t scold the kids, okay?

330
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,360
If they talk to you, just smile.

331
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,770
Can I smile like this?

332
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,970
Next up, we have the play called

333
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,280
"The Troublemaker Tooth and Doctor Fluorite."

334
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,329
Please enjoy it.

335
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,520
Yay!

336
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,109
Once upon a time,

337
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:22,060
there was a little tooth who loved eating sweets.

338
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:23,800
Peek-a-boo!

339
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,980
Lalala, lalala!

340
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,810
Nom nom, so delicious!

341
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:33,500
But one day,

342
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,650
a mean tooth-eating bug appeared,

343
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,130
drawn by the scent of the sweets.

344
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,880
I’m the tooth-eating bug,

345
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,610
and I love munching on sweet teeth!

346
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:47,760
Help me!

347
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,550
Help me!

348
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,110
Anyone, help me!

349
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,240
Ouch!

350
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,620
I’m here!

351
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,980
I’m Doctor Fluorite,

352
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:11,140

I’ve just realized that
studying here could be this much fun!

365
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,540
Alright, everyone!

366
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,840
This is the toothbrush station.

367
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,600
I’m going to leave it with your teacher now.

368
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,220
If anyone can sing the song I taught you,

369
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,750
the teacher will give you a reward.

370
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,330
Who wants one?

371
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,750
- I do!
- Me!

372
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,820
Alright, let’s let them rest for now.

373
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,820
As for us, let’s go grab some food.

374
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,880
Anyway, thank you so much to everyone today.

375
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,190
Thank you!

376
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:48,910
Let’s go.

377
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:55,750
Uncle Jay,

378
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,040
if I study here,

379
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,540
will there be shows like this to watch regularly?

380
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,080
Sant.

381
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:06,920
Yeah?

382
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,610
If there's nothing else, I'm going to head out.

383
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,620
I've got work to edit.

384
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,800
Sure.

385
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,850
I’ll take care of it here.

386
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,980
Please drop Yada off.

387
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,660
She’s heading back too.

388
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,190
Eh?

389
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,060
Will she go with me?

390
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,390
Yeah.

391
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,800
I told her already.

392
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,340
She’s waiting for you in front of the building.

393
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,180
Why didn’t you tell me sooner?

394
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,440
I need to go get changed.

395
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,760
I bet she must be furious already.

396
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,820
I’ll get going.

397
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,100
See you later.

398
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:42,750
Sister,

399
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,590
can you teach me how to sing
that teeth-brushing song?

400
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,100
Of course.

401
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,100
Follow me.

402
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,160
Yes.

403
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,870
♪ Come on, come on, let’s all brush our teeth! ♪

404
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,000
When she smiles,

405
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,900
she’s my type.

406
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:11,450
♪ Brush, brush, brush,
we’re here to brush our teeth ♪

407
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,140
♪ Brush every day, and your teeth
will be clean and strong! ♪

408
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,910
This is for you.

409
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,550
Thank you.

410
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,430
Bye-bye.

411
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,580
Well…

412
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:44,580
Yeah?

413
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,810
I want to get my teeth scaling.

414
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:51,680
Do you have any dentist you would recommend?

415
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,030
I'm actually looking for a teeth scaling case now.

416
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,270
You can come do it with me.

417
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,250
That sounds good.

418
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,740
I promise I’ll do it gently.

419
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,520
Hey!

420
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,160
Why can't I zip it up?!

421
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,900
You said you don't like desserts.

422
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,900
How do you know this place is good?

423
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:22,580
Well,

424
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:24,510
I just asked my friend.

425
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,640
Excuse me, is there a restroom here?

426
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:28,850
It’s at the back.

427
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,620
I want to go to the restroom too.

428
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,340
I’ll accompany you.

429
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,250
Let’s go.

430
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:34,930
Come with me.

431
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,530
We didn’t order them.

432
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,450
I’m actually about to close the business,

433
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,730
so I’m giving some discounts
and freebies to my regular customers.

434
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,300
Uncle, you’re mistaken.

435
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,260
This is our first time here.

436
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,770
Oh, I’m talking about Jway.

437
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,790
That's an even bigger mistake.

438
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:10,980
Jway…

439
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,650
Jay doesn't eat desserts.

440
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,820
Who's the one getting it wrong?

441
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:21,600
Jay used to stop by every day.

442
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:24,050
If you don't believe me, just look at that.

443
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,700
As soon as classes ended,

444
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,790
he'd be at the table,

445
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,360
filming reviews for his channel.

446
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,100
Hi, everyone.

447
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:32,990
This is Jay.

448
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,600
Today, I'm here to review some desserts,

449
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,560
and of course, we're at Uncle Pan's shop again.

450
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,530
So, here's the new menu for today.
It’s the orange cake.

451
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,470
Let me taste it for you and see how it is.

452
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:48,870
Wow, it's so delicious.

453
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,060
The cake is so soft,

454
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,630
and the cream has a light sweetness.

455
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,220
What's more, the orange flavor is really strong.

456
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,400
If anyone watches this and wants to try it,

457
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,580
just tell him you came from our channel

458
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,410
and get a 50% discount!

459
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:01,810
Wait!

460
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,810
Did you even ask for my permission yet?!

461
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,560
He’s just kidding.

462
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,730
I hope a lot of you will come.

463
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,730
Who would have thought,

464
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,360
one day he just stopped running his channel

465
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,310
and became a dentist instead?

466
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,500
I guess he ate too much

467
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:17,970
and got worried about having a tooth cavity.

468
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,100
Enjoy!

469
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,600
Yeah.

470
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,910
What did you talk to him about?

471
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,400
Oh, nothing much.

472
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,420
Eat.

473
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,780
It looks yummy, right?

474
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,300
By the way,

475
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,540
when is the interview, Onew?

476
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,770
This Friday.

477
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,250
Do you have any advice for me?

478
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,320
Honestly, the interview is just a formality.

479
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,200
A good kid like you is bound to pass anyway.

480
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,010
Noted!

481
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:04,090
Take mine.

482
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,210
Eat it.

483
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,110
Awww.

484
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,110
Congratulations, Onew.

485
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,690
You got accepted into that school as you wished.

486
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,990
Yay!

487
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,980
Cheers!

488
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,050
Do you know Giant Miang?

489
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:27,060
Three, two, one, cheers!

490
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,760
Be a good kid.

491
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,100
Focus on your studies.

492
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,210
Got it?

493
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:38,940
Yes.

494
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,970
Where has all the food gone?

495
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,120
I STOLE SOME FOOD.

496
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,890
IN EXCHANGE, I'LL OFFER YOU SOME
DELICIOUS KOREAN FOOD THAT'S JUST AS GOOD.
(I MEAN, PUMPUI CLAMS.)

497
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,310
I stole some food.

498
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,670
In exchange, I'll offer you some delicious
korean food that's just as good.

499
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:46,740
Hey.

500
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,760
Can I sleep here tonight?

501
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:49,600
Huh?!

502
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,370
My nephew has already headed back.

503
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,840
Gugg is editing his work at his friend’s place.

504
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:57,970
Are you scared of ghosts?

505
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,620
No.

506
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,070
Actually, I’m used to being alone,

507
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,090
but today feels different.

508
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,700
I guess it’s because...

509
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,340
today is not as loud as other days.

510
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,260
When it’s quiet,

511
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,860
it’s quieter than other days.

512
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,500
Can I crash here for a night to clear my head?

513
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:20,980
I can sleep on the sofa.

514
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,170
The sofa is being cleaned.

515
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,880
If you're staying,

516
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,540
you'll have to share the bed.

517
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:43,880
I’ll sleep now.

518
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:49,820
Hold on.

519
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:03,890
Wait.

520
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:05,600
What are you doing?

521
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,050
Hey.

522
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:09,770
Hey.

523
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,300
Hey.

524
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,270
Take it back.

525
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,100
It’s the gold my mom gave me when I was born.

526
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,100
If it’s not really for something emergency,

527
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,590
I don’t want to rely on her.

528
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,800
You’ve done your best.

529
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,400
When I was drunk, I told Gugg that
I had some gold kept.

530
00:28:59,140 --> 00:28:59,900
After that,

531
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,560
whenever I ran out of money,

532
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,980
he'd always suggest I sell my gold.

533
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,280
That means you’ve been like this
for a long time, right?

534
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,700
The habit of getting drunk
and letting something slip?

535
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,570
Like when I kissed you, right?

536
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,700
You’ve remembered it all this time, right?

537
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,540
Yes.

538
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,260
I remember the whole thing.

539
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:51,930
Why did you lie to me then?

540
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,220
You were so drunk that day.

541
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,160
There’s no point in bringing it up.

542
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,040
Is there anything else you lied to me about?

543
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,100
What are you talking about?

544
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,630
You asked me to date you.

545
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,770
You treated my teeth.

546
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,170
You helped me with everything.

547
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,200
Why did you do all these things?

548
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,130
Is it because I’m your patient?

549
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,250
Is it because you just wanted to prank me?

550
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,650
Or is it because you really have feelings for me?

551
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:01,300
What’s up, Gugg?

552
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,250
Sant, my work wrapped up
quicker than I expected.

553
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,530
I’ll go back and sleep in our room.

554
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,630
Alright.

555
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:11,440
I’ll hang up.

556
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,100
Yes, I like you.

557
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,980
That day, I asked you to be my boyfriend

558
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,410
because I really like you.

559
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:00,840
Hey?

560
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:02,700
Where have you been?

561
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:07,970
I went for a walk.

562
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:09,760
By the way,

563
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,130
our professor told me

564
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,900
the next movie we have to make is a romantic one.

565
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,010
That’s my way.

566
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,200
That’s more like a way with a dead end, huh?

567
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,440
None of us have been in a relationship.

568
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,300
Even if I haven’t been in a relationship,

569
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,700
it doesn’t mean I’ve never fallen in love.

570
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,130
I think

571
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:31,980
I like…

572
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,940
Yada.

573
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,280
Huh?

574
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,720
You said she’s fierce, didn’t you?

575
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,860
You won’t get it.

576
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:47,260
When you get hooked,

577
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,510
you won’t look at that person
the same way anymore.

578
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,020
You asked me to date you.

579
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,920
You treated my teeth.

580
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:01,730
You helped me with everything.

581
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,300
Why did you do all these things?

582
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,020
Is it because I’m your patient?

583
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,510
Is it because you just wanted to prank me?

584
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,400
Or is it because you really have feelings for me?

585
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,580
That day, I asked you to be my boyfriend

586
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,570
because I really like you

587
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,300
until you dumped me.

588
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:34,410
Eh?!

589
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:35,710
Whoa.

590
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,600
Look at you crushing my tiny heart into pieces.

591
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,850
Do you think I’ll continue
having feelings for you?

592
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,270
Aren’t you too full of yourself?

593
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,700
So all this time,

594
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,700
why have you been helping me?

595
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,330
That’s because you’re my patient.

596
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,030
Eh?

597
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,300
Or am I going above and beyond my duties?

598
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:58,850
I’m sorry.

599
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,540
I feel guilty now.

600
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,740
I’m sorry.

601
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:12,199
It’s you who overthink it.

602
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:13,989
I’m just checking

603
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,040
because I’m worried you might be
imagining things too far.

604
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:21,600
That’s because I’ve never had
any feelings for you.

605
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,600
I’m heading back.

606
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,630
Why are you calling me?

607
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:43,870
I called just to let you know that

608
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:49,020
actually, I’m not treating others well
the way I’m treating you.

609
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:54,400
What do you mean?

610
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:56,600
I’m treating others...

611
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,860
even better!

612
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,420
Do you know why?

613
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,020
It’s because they never hurt me like you did!

614
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,190
I’ll hang up!

615
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:12,700
You dumped me, so I dumped you,
Sweet Smile Boy.

616
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,600
Ouch!

617
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,180
TRANSFER THE LEASE

618
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,400
I thought I’d have to close
this legendary shop for good.
TRANSFER THE LEASE

619
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,980
TRANSFER THE LEASE

620
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,500
But if it’s you taking over,
TRANSFER THE LEASE

621
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:28,730
TRANSFER THE LEASE

622
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:29,900
I can rest easy.
TRANSFER THE LEASE

623
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,730
TRANSFER THE LEASE

624
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,220
The cake is so soft,

625
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:33,740
and the cream has a light sweetness.

626
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,150
What's more, the orange flavor is really strong.

627
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:42,300
This shop is way too big for me to run by myself.

628
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,170
I’ll need some help.

629
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,680
I asked you to brainstorm a romantic movie plot.

630
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,620
How is it going?

631
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,580
How about this?

632
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:58,760
Let’s go with a story of an innocent boy

633
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:01,100
and his bold senior girl.

634
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,590
At first, he was scared of her.

635
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,060
And later on... he still is.

636
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:07,990
He’s just scared she won’t love him back.

637
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:10,300
But the conflict feels a bit weak, doesn’t it?

638
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,900
What if we make her a tomboy at the end?

639
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,490
But she’s not a tomboy.

640
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:15,600
Huh,

641
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,180
I’ve actually never thought about it that way.

642
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,320
I’ll go do some research first.

643
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,170
Huh?

644
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:24,960
What’s with him?

645
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,240
I’ve never seen him this hardworking before.

646
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,010
Un.

647
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:29,860
Yeah?

648
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,900
I watched one series,

649
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,280
and the main guy starts suspecting that

650
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,540
his doctor might have a thing for him.

651
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,420
That’s a classic plot, isn’t it?

652
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:42,170
Someone suddenly starts being nice to you,

653
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,700
so, of course, you’re going to catch feelings.

654
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,380
But then the doctor says
he doesn’t feel anything.

655
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,690
I’m just confused.
Why is the main guy so frustrated

656
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,310
when he doesn’t even like the doctor either?

657
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,530
Dude, he does.

658
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,140
He doesn’t!

659
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,250
Why are you being frustrated?

660
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,060
I’m not!

661
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,550
If the main guy’s pissed,

662
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,100
what’s his next move?

663
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,800
Maybe they should find something to do for now

664
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,200
so they don’t have to think about it.

665
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,560
They could bake something
or just eat whatever sweets.

666
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,160
Today isn’t your shift, is it?

667
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:31,300
You remember that?

668
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,550
It’s done now, Jay.

669
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,650
Thank you.

670
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:38,130
If that’s all,

671
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,700
I’m going to go organize the stuff now.

672
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:44,930
I see.

673
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,500
So now you’re watching over
the top employee, huh?

674
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:49,850
Hey,

675
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,250
she already has a boyfriend,

676
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,310
and I’m just covering for her.

677
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,860
If we didn't know each other before,

678
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,320
I’d probably think you’re jealous of me.

679
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,180
I’m not jealous!

680
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,540
Total up the amount already!

681
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,650
I need to jump on my live stream.

682
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,240
You’re only buying sweets.

683
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,650
Aren’t you afraid of getting a tooth cavity?

684
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,210
Don’t mess with my business.

685
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,520
I see.

686
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,300
Or do you want to recover slowly

687
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,300
so I can treat your teeth longer?

688
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,390
I won’t buy any then,

689
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,290
so we won’t meet again in this life.

690
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,040
Hello.

691
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:34,080
Welcome to “Hungry while sleeping,
Yawning when waking up.”

692
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,140
The name is super outdated.

693
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,850
After you join, don’t forget to say hi.

694
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:41,980
Sure thing.

695
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,140
I’ll drop a greeting message.

696
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,020
You badass kiddo!

697
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,700
I’ll eat croissants today.

698
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:54,090
How dare you dump me?!

699
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,800
Croissant is still number one in my heart.

700
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:16,820
This is from my go-to place.

701
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,450
I’ve been eating here a lot
since I moved to Bangkok.

702
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,110
One heart sent!

703
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,870
The tooth I filled for you last time…

704
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,340
Long time no see.

705
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,670
It’s just six years, five months,

706
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,760
and… twelve days.

707
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:59,780
Even if you got it wrong, I wouldn’t know.

708
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,540
I'm back to continue...

709
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,140
the dream the two of us shared.

710
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:36,420
Are you Captain

711
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,100
who used to run a dessert review channel?

712
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:40,120
I consider your channel
the number one in my heart.

713
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,550
You’re buttering up your boss too much!

714
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,350
You two are complete opposites!

715
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,620
How could you end up as besties?

716
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:45,620
I won’t tell you.

717
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,250
Or are you kicking me out

718
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,140
because you just want to be alone together?

719
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,870
Gotcha.

720
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,550
You’re imagining things too far, huh?

721
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,390
If we didn't know each other before,

722
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:57,670
I’d probably think you’re jealous of me.

723
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:58,900
Now what?

724
00:40:58,970 --> 00:40:59,880
You were playing hard to get,

725
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:01,080
and now your friend has taken him away.
