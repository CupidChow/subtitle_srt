This is “Hungry while sleeping,
Yawning when waking up!”

6
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,700
Sant is here to snack for you!

7
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:02,240
Ouch!

8
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,940
I suddenly got a sharp toothache out of nowhere.

9
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,000
At the Faculty of Dentistry,

10
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,300
they offer special prices for dental work.

11
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,900
It's for cases where dental students
are just starting out.

12
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,560
Jay!

13
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,970
I’m looking for a root canal treatment case
to send to my professor.

14
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,420
In this lifetime, I’ll never agree
to get my teeth treated by you!

15
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,250
Why so?

16
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,260
Do you want to hang out with me?

17
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,330
You’re hiring me to hang out with you?

18
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,340
I’m not an escort boy, you know.

19
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:17,620
You really don’t know

20
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,250
that this clinic isn’t up to standard?

21
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,890
Uncle, are you here for a root canal treatment?

22
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,270
I’m sorry.

23
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,000
Is it still not too late

24
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,360
to get a dental treatment with you now?

25
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,539
I’ve never left you behind, right?

26
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,630
Ouch.

27
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,479
It hurts.

28
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,900
I told you to brush your teeth properly,
but you didn’t believe me.

29
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,789
Mom, will the dentist hurt me?

30
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,070
Don’t be scared.

31
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,160
I won’t allow the dentist to hurt you, Sant.

32
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,100
The dentist is ready.

33
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,000
Alright.

34
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,000
Let’s go.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,450
Hey.

36
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,480
How are you feeling?

37
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,800
Is the painkiller I gave you okay?

38
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,310
It's okay.

39
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,700
Actually, I don’t need the treatment anymore.

40
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,750
Do you want me to carry you again or what?

41
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,590
Go sit over there.

42
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,190
I'll clean the root canal

43
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,450
and do a temporary filling for you today.

44
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,690
Let me adjust the seat a bit.

45
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:54,960
Lie down comfortably. Don’t tense up.

46
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,240
I'll give you a numbing injection first.

47
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:10,830
Hey!

48
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,230
Hey!

49
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:13,510
Hey!

50
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,220
Hey, can you hear me?

51
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:18,360
Hey!

52
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,530
I’m alright now.

53
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,300
Some patients who are extremely
scared of dental procedures

54
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,000
may experience panic attacks.

55
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,170
Who's scared?

56
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,170
Next time, if you're scared, just tell me first.

57
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,079
How would I know?

58
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,370
I can't even remember
the last time I went to the dentist.

59
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,560
I think you’re not ready today.

60
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,050
Let’s make an appointment later.

61
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,060
Today, just take the painkiller first.

62
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,770
And next time,

63
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,960
it won’t be like this, right?

64
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,850
Let me handle the stress on that.

65
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,720
You're the patient.

66
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,040
Finding the right treatment is my job.

67
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,350
If I can't handle something as simple as this,

68
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,250
then I won’t be able to graduate.

69
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,320
It’s a piece of cake.

70
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,020
Jway can do it.

71
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,850
FACULTY OF DENTISTRY

72
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:57,880
Da.

73
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,400
Have you ever met a patient
who's afraid of dental procedures?

74
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,400
Like, panic-level afraid?

75
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,470
Yeah.

76
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,150
But that doesn’t count, though,
since you scared them,

77
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,050
and they were afraid of you.

78
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,620
Stop, stop, stop!

79
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,020
Patients like me, okay?

80
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,810
This morning, I treated a kid,

81
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,400
and they even gave me a gift.

82
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,700
Fine. Just forget about it.

83
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,050
How did you manage to
make them not scared of you?

84
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,800
If you want to know, open it.

85
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:25,750
For what?

86
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,820
You’re curious, aren’t you?

87
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,150
Shit!

88
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,000
What the hell are you playing?

89
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,580
Now, open it again.

90
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,350
Why?

91
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,620
It can only scare me once, buddy.

92
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,770
Yeah. That’s my secret, Captain.

93
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,770
Once you know something,

94
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:54,880
you won’t be afraid of it anymore.

95
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,200
Cool.

96
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,730
You’re trying to convey…

97
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,610
what?

98
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,060
Hey?

99
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,830
Tell me.

100
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:12,570
Leave already.

101
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,750
Yeah, I guess I’m just being silly!

102
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,470
Then let's just break up.

103
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,570
Senior, I’m sorry.

104
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,200
Hold on.

105
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,470
Is this sentence included in your script?

106
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:39,900
I’m sorry.

107
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,470
I have tried my best,

108
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,840
but this is all I could do.

109
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,200
Hey!

110
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,890
Hey! Hey!

111
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,200
- Hey!
- Come back!

112
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:46,900
Hey!

113
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,200
Cut!

114
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,990
Sant! What on earth is wrong with you, huh?!

115
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,720
You’ve been making that moody face all day.

116
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,290
Who the hell would want to work with you?!

117
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,700
I don’t want to have a moody face.

118
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,700
My tooth hurts!

119
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,510
Eh? You didn’t see the dentist?

120
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,300
It’s a long story.

121
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,000
Anyway,

122
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,020
it looks like the painkiller
can't even handle me anymore.

123
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,840
Then you go sit over there.

124
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,810
I'll handle the directing instead.

125
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:12,740
Go. Go.

126
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,420
Get up. Get up already!

127
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,590
What do you want me to do then?

128
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,130
Take care of the location.

129
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,470
Go already.

130
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,700
Eh?

131
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,610
This way, please.

132
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,550
Head straight.

133
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,350
Hold on.

134
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,370
Please stop here.

135
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,300
There's a film set ahead.

136
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,050
Why aren't you resting
with a toothache this bad?

137
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:35,250
If I rest, will the work get done?

138
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,030
I'm not as free as you, you know.

139
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,400
Cut! It’s a pass.

140
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,560
Everyone, let’s change the location now.

141
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,360
Thank you so much.

142
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:44,990
Thank you so much.

143
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,300
I’ll be right back. Give me a second.

144
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,620
Sant,

145
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,820
we’ll move to film inside the building.

146
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,850
You don’t have to take care
of the location anymore.

147
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,550
Then, I’ll take care of the extras for you.

148
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,370
Un is in charge of that.

149
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,620
I’ll be an extra.

150
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,280
With your face, you'd just steal the scene.

151
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,750
Head home and rest. Look at your cheek.

152
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,450
Eh?!

153
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,350
Safe trip home.

154
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,790
Yeah! I’m coming.

155
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:09,610
Oh,

156
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,900
it looks like someone’s free like me now.

157
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,760
Do you want to relax somewhere?

158
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,540
I’ll give you a ride.

159
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,550
No, thank you.

160
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,040
I can go on my own.

161
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:23,740
What’s wrong?

162
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,320
Why did you turn stiff just like that?

163
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,230
I can’t think of a place to go.

164
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,760
Do you really have to think
about something like this?

165
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,480
Does that mean you never rested?

166
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,789
That’s not true.

167
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,690
I have such a good work-life balance.

168
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,300
The other day, I taught
a student to do her homework.

169
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,400
That’s your job, isn’t it?

170
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,910
At night, I ate snacks.

171
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,050
That’s your live stream job.

172
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,220
Get inside the car.

173
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:58,920
Huh?

174
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,540
Ouch.

175
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,470
I'll teach you how regular people rest, okay?

176
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,540
I’ve just realized our university
has this kind of cafe.

177
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,580
Has it just recently been opened?

178
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,180
It has been open since my freshman year.

179
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,890
What’s good at this cafe?

180
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,740
Sant, of course.

181
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:35,490
Huh?

182
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:36,990
Croissant.

183
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,920
But from your condition now,

184
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,740
I don’t think you can eat it.

185
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,230
I’ll order something else for you.

186
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:54,590
Thank you.

187
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,180
Drink it.

188
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:05,780
It’s on me.

189
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,450
You said that yourself, okay?

190
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:09,790
Yeah.

191
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,190
This reminds us of that day, doesn’t it?

192
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,020
What day are you talking about?

193
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,430
Our first date.

194
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,730
Date?

195
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,610
I was just your escort boy.

196
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:45,960
Drink slowly.

197
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:46,910
Don’t rush.

198
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,760
It’s going to be a long day today.

199
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,400
What again?

200
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,180
After we finish this,

201
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,660
let’s watch a movie.

202
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,740
Do record players still exist these days

203
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,000
Why not?

204
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,400
It's classic.

205
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,710
I even booked a screening room.

206
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,860
Pick the film.

207
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,030
Are you usually hot-headed?

208
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,540
Why did you ask me this?

209
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,110
That day when we went to the movies,

210
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,600
why did you pick a fight with them?

211
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,040
Oh, I see.

212
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,180
I’m usually not that type of person.

213
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,450
I'm not even the type to fight,

214
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,410
but that day was special.

215
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,430
Why was it special?

216
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,880
Well, I saw you enjoying it,

217
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,880
so I didn’t want anyone to interrupt.

218
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,130
Why wouldn’t I enjoy it?

219
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,880
Someone treated me to drinks and snacks.

220
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,470
After that day,

221
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,880
did anyone else ask you out to the movies?

222
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:16,760
Nope.

223
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,480
I’ve been working nonstop all day, super busy.

224
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,310
Who would want me as a boyfriend?

225
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,720
Back then, one person did, didn't he?

226
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,140
Hey, give me a second.

227
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,870
I’ll go to the restroom.

228
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,720
Eh?

229
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,790
Are you going to leave me again?

230
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:01,640
No.

231
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,970
I’m really going to the restroom.

232
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:03,680
I swear.

233
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,680
I’m going with you.

234
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:05,690
Don’t!

235
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:06,790
Wait here, okay?

236
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:07,930
It takes ages for each one to arrive.

237
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,080
Book a seat for me too.

238
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,290
Excuse me, let me go to the restroom for a second.

239
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,230
Big sister, hello?

240
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,560
Sant, are you free?

241
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,740
Come help me carry the furniture to my room.

242
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,630
I'll give you some snack money.

243
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,180
Sure. I will…

244
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,460
- Hold on!
- Darling, where have you been?

245
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,050
I’ve been looking for you.

246
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:49,320
Hey.

247
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,630
I’m helping you, okay?

248
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,300
You really don’t know

249
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,830
that this clinic isn’t up to standard?

250
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,070
Is it still not too late

251
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,190
to get a dental treatment with you now?

252
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,390
I’ve never left you behind, right?

253
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,040
I've got an errand to run.

254
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,370
Maybe next time.

255
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,060
Huh? Did I mishear that?

256
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,610
Sant, you're turning down a job?

257
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,320
I’m really sorry.

258
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,100
Maybe next time.

259
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:17,850
Yes.

260
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,810
I’m sorry for keeping you waiting.

261
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,180
Uncle, let’s go.

262
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:41,940
You drove here,

263
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,540
so why are we riding this?

264
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,350
If I drive, then it's not really a break, is it?

265
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,310
You know, the view is different
when you're the driver

266
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,240
versus when you're just a passenger.

267
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,490
Stop rambling.

268
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,720
If you're lazy, just say it.

269
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,680
Here.

270
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,680
I heard you complaining that you wanted
something refreshing to drink.

271
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,380
Being this much of a spender on me,

272
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,050
what are you hoping for?

273
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,260
Do you want it or not?

274
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,040
It smells good,

275
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,110
and it’s not too sweet.

276
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,600
You’re treating me so nicely.

277
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,390
I bet you must feel something for me.

278
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:51,360
Not at all.

279
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,340
I just wanted you to drink something yummy.

280
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,640
Looking ahead gets us there faster,

281
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:12,970
but sometimes it makes us forget
how beautiful the journey is.

282
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,190
I’m willing to drive slower

283
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,790
so I can enjoy the view more clearly.

284
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,630
Wow,

285
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,510
our campus view is this beautiful, huh?

286
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,190
Seriously?

287
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,900
We pass by here every day,

288
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,020
and you’re just noticing it now?

289
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,540
Right? Why have I never noticed it before?

290
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,090
This is the end of today’s trip, right?

291
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:01,990
I'll get off at the university entrance.

292
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,240
I'll take a motorbike taxi back.

293
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,619
It’s not over yet.

294
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,230
We’ve got one more thing left to do.

295
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:08,589
What is it?

296
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:09,890
Go stargazing with me.

297
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,180
Stargazing?

298
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,250
I already got permission from the professor.

299
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,930
We have 40 minutes before the building closes.

300
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:27,619
Wait.

301
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,290
Why are you taking me up here?

302
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:36,930
At least

303
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,450
you don’t feel tense
like you did in the morning.

304
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,690
Stress is one of the factors that
can trigger a panic attack in patients,

305
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,630
so helping the patient relax
is also part of the treatment.

306
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,580
I see.

307
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,750
You took me around all day to help me relax?

308
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:58,850
Yes.

309
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,160
But that’s not it.

310
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,600
When we get dental work done,

311
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,880
we usually just hear the sounds

312
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,880
without knowing what the dentist is doing.

313
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,700
That’s what makes it scary, right?

314
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,400
Now, go sit over there.

315
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,540
This is the tool

316
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,290
I used to clean your teeth
during the procedure.

317
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,260
My friend once told me that

318
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,620
the more we understand something,

319
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,040
the less scary it becomes.

320
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,610
Do you think that's true?

321
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,490
It’s probably true.

322
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,130
At least today, it made you brave enough
to look me in the eyes more.

323
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,280
Is this all you wanted me to come for?

324
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,150
Oh, nope.

325
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,580
There’s one more.

326
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,170
Are you going to treat my teeth now?

327
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,010
No,

328
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,390
today, just bear with the sound of the tools.

329
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,790
I told you,

330
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,890
I’d take you to stargaze.

331
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,820
Hey,

332
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,740
I’m no longer a kid.

333
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,190
You’re right.

334
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,160
You’re not a kid,

335
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,190
but a stubborn kid with a toothache.

336
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,340
Try listening to it again.

337
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:40,860
Yes.

338
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:20,710
Hey!

339
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:21,730
Hey!

340
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:22,910
Hey!

341
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:23,990
Can you hear me?

342
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,410
Hey!

343
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,270
Hey!

344
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,540
Don't feel bad.

345
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,430
Things like this take time.

346
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,650
At least it's way better than
earlier this morning.

347
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,090
I know you've done everything you could.

348
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,640
There are many cases where patients
are afraid of dental work

349
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,860
because of bad experiences as kids.

350
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,160
Is there something I don’t know yet?

351
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,260
Nothing.

352
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:36,820
Sant.

353
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,690
I think you should go find a new case.

354
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,510
I’m sorry for wasting your time.

355
00:22:58,890 --> 00:22:59,380
Huh?

356
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,030
And he walked away just like that?

357
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:01,530
Yeah.

358
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,660
He didn’t pick up my call either.

359
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,580
What are you going to do now?

360
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,160
What can I do?

361
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,570
Since in the end,

362
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,830
treatment is a team effort, I can't do it alone.

363
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,010
Didn't you say you wouldn't leave him?

364
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:14,850
Who’s leaving whom? Say it properly.

365
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,130
If you think he has something
he’s not ready to share,

366
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,210
just give him some time.

367
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,910
Some things, no one wants to
go back and think about.

368
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,990
I think you understand that well.

369
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:45,810
JENG

370
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,360
Gugg!

371
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,150
Tonight, you can call me Sugar Daddy!

372
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:09,950
Hello?

373
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:11,950
You haven’t finished your work?

374
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:13,500
Where are you now?

375
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,210
Tonight, I’ve got to go edit the film at Un’s room.

376
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,200
I see.

377
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,920
What time are you coming back for dinner?

378
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,970
Today, I bought a full set for you, all out.

379
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,820
Oh, I think it's probably early in the morning.

380
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,160
Go ahead and eat first.

381
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:25,660
Sorry,

382
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,030
catch you later, buddy.

383
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,220
Got it.

384
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,260
We’ve finished filming,

385
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,960
but my heart is still waiting for love!

386
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,740
Single and ready to mingle!

387
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,890
Of course!

388
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,380
- Are you promoting yourself?
- Yeah.

389
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,120
Eating sweets this late,
do you hate your dentist or something?

390
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,730
Hey, how did you get here?

391
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,600
I drove a car.

392
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,060
Oh, I mean, what are you doing here?

393
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:35,380
Look at my uniform.

394
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,590
I’m working a side job.

395
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:42,690
Oh wow.

396
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,480
You’re buying beer.

397
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,180
Are you even 20 yet?

398
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,380
Show me your ID card.

399
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,190
Fine.

400
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,380
I don’t want to drink it anymore.

401
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,590
Hello?

402
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:05,500
Huh?

403
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,130
Stomach issues?

404
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,540
Eh? It looks like I’ll be running
the shop alone tonight.

405
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:13,960
Can you find someone to cover for you?

406
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,580
Alright, I can do that.

407
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,100
I’ve been resting the whole day.

408
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,010
It looks like I’m getting broke.

409
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,320
Are you sure you can handle it?

410
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,710
Of course.

411
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,770
You can handle the stock check.

412
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,870
I’ll take care of things here.

413
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,940
If you like chocolate,

414
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,460
would you like to have some bread to go with it?

415
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,330
I guarantee it’s delicious.

416
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,310
I’ll take it too then.

417
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:56,610
Thank you.

418
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:58,710
Please warm it up for me.

419
00:26:58,930 --> 00:26:59,800
Sure.

420
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:06,470
Ouch!

421
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:13,160
Thank you.

422
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:20,960
Let me see.

423
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,360
Are you alright?

424
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,950
It’s totally not a big deal.

425
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,780
Just apply some toothpaste, and it'll be fine.

426
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,470
Who said that?

427
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,130
Applying toothpaste will make the wound worse.

428
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,350
You should use ice to compress it instead.

429
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:44,620
Come.

430
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,590
Ouch.

431
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,710
And you said you’re alright?

432
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:56,460
What a regret.

433
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,790
If it were the ring finger,
it would probably be better.

434
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,960
What’s with the ring finger?

435
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,620
If it’s the ring finger…

436
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,310
Congratulations!

437
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:17,820
We hope your love lasts long.

438
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,690
It’s alright. We’ll stop by again later.

439
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:24,840
What are you playing?

440
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:28,820
Continue working.

441
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,600
Thank you for using my service.

442
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:51,900
Free gifts for you.

443
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,810
Eh?

444
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,320
Sugar daddy, two cans for me?

445
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,290
Thank you.

446
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,170
Hold on.

447
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:58,670
One is mine.

448
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,590
The other is yours.

449
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,050
Let’s find somewhere to sit down and drink.

450
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,820
Do we really need to come
all the way up here just for beer?

451
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,080
We can finally watch the stars together.

452
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,620
My grandpa once told me that at our home,

453
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,290
the stars are up in the sky,

454
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,320
but in Bangkok,

455
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,770
the stars are on the ground.

456
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,970
Look, that building still has its lights on.

457
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,320
You might not know, but for people like us,

458
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:40,920
Bangkok is the place
where we work day and night

459
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:47,870
just to become those little stars
on top of the buildings here.

460
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,700
Are you alright?

461
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,150
Of course.

462
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,730
I have Gugg who helps me.

463
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:02,770
By the way,

464
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,770
invite him here.

465
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,070
I’ll go buy some more beers.

466
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:06,920
He’s not available.

467
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,670
He’s at his friend's place editing a film.

468
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,450
I see.

469
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,700
Oh, it looks like there's a kid left behind.

470
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,780
No wonder you seemed so frustrated
when you were down there buying stuff.

471
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,120
You might not know,

472
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:31,770
but Gugg and I have been
inseparable since kindergarten.

473
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:34,350
We were in the same class,

474
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,050
and sat next to each other.

475
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,020
I still remember in high school,

476
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,270
we'd skip class and hang out on the rooftop.

477
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,370
When we were bored, we'd play hide-and-seek.

478
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:49,980
You played hide-and-seek on the rooftop?

479
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,850
After two rounds of walking,
you’d find each other already, right?

480
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,190
Exactly.

481
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,630
That's why we made the rule harder.

482
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,320
The person who's looking
has to keep their eyes closed.

483
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:04,660
- Then what's fun about it?
- If you don’t believe me, close your eyes now.

484
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,450
Count one to five.

485
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,200
Just so you know, I'm really good at hiding.

486
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:11,420
Don't peek!

487
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:13,530
Fine.

488
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,360
One.

489
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,770
Two.

490
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:20,430
Three.

491
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,810
Four.

492
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,530
Five.

493
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,300
I’m going to start looking for you now.

494
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,200
I’m walking now.

495
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,820
Who the heck came up with this game?

496
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,410
It's so damn hard.

497
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:40,880
Give me a hint.

498
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,960
Help me out!

499
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,520
It’s still hard.

500
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,170
Can we do this then?

501
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,060
If I ask you something,

502
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,940
answer me, okay?

503
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:00,180
Alright.

504
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,730
When you were little,
you were abandoned, right?

505
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,700
Why aren't you answering me?

506
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,320
How could you know that?

507
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,230
Well,

508
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,820
if it were someone else,
they’d be happy to take a break,

509
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,630
but you seem frustrated
when you're not doing anything.

510
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,410
I think you’re the type of person
who always wants to do something for others.

511
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,120
What happened?

512
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,460
When I was about eight years old,

513
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,570
I had a severe toothache,

514
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:50,820
so my mom took me to
the dentist near our place.

515
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,990
That was my first dental visit.

516
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,060
I was really scared,

517
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,720
but my mom told me not to be scared.

518
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,420
If there's anything, just hold her hand tight.

519
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,130
But when the time came,

520
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,430
my mom wasn’t there anymore.

521
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,260
Where did she go then?

522
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:28,740
I don’t know either.

523
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,320
After that, I never saw her again.

524
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,580
My dad died,

525
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,670
and my mom disappeared,

526
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,520
leaving me to grow up with my grandparents.

527
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,320
Maybe it's because of this

528
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,570
that I don't like being alone.

529
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:16,520
I always find myself offering to help others.

530
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,620
Is that because you’re afraid that if you don't,

531
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,920
one day no one will need you?

532
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:34,350
You know what?

533
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,920
Every time I sit on the dentist's chair,

534
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:45,429
it makes me think back to that day,

535
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,639
the day I kept asking myself over and over.

536
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:56,120
What did I do wrong?

537
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,460
What wasn't good enough about me

538
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,120
for my mom to leave me?

539
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,330
I got you now.

540
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,020
I found you.

541
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,340
Can you not open your eyes now?

542
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,050
I don’t want you to see me like this.

543
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,970
No matter how many times I have to look for you,

544
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,430
I'll always find you.

00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,650
Did I fall asleep without realizing?

554
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,600
Based on how you look now,
you probably shouldn't even ask, huh?

555
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,140
Why didn’t you wake me up then?

556
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,590
I already tried,

557
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,070
but you insisted on sleeping here.

558
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,250
Since I couldn’t stop you,

559
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,330
then I should just join you, right?

560
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,970
I’ll head back to my room now.

561
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,320
Hold on.

562
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,340
Don’t forget our promise.

563
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,330
What promise?

564
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,870
You promised me

565
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:35,040
you'll have a dental appointment
with me the day after tomorrow.

566
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:35,820
Nonsense!

567
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,770
Why would I say such a thing?

568
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:38,690
You must have been drunk!

569
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,620
Hold on.

570
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,210
I’ll wait for you.

571
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:50,920
See you then.

572
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:57,290
I caused myself a problem again
because I was drunk!

573
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,010
You came so late.

574
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,430
Your patient has been waiting
for so long already.

575
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,010
I knew

576
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,010
you were definitely going to come.

577
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,180
Eh? What are you doing here, Uncle?

578
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,520
Young man, isn’t this unit 31?

579
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,970
Well, it’s not.

580
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,720
This is unit 13.

581
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,590
Unit 31 is over there.

582
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:38,450
I’m sorry.

583
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:40,590
No worries.

584
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,940
I don’t think he’s coming anymore.

585
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,480
Come help me with the lab instead.

586
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,360
He promised me already.

587
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,370
He will come no matter what.

588
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:01,120
This is unit 13.

589
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:03,830
I hope this patient isn’t coming
to the wrong unit.

590
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,200
Please take your seat.

591
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,480
Doctor, hello.

592
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:44,540
Hi.

593
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,820
Take your seat.

594
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,660
What brings you in today?

595
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:58,880
Mom.

596
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:00,520
Mom?

597
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,320
It’s alright. Stay still for now.

598
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,920
Doctor, where is my mom?

599
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:04,650
It’s okay.

600
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:05,530
Stay with me for a while.

601
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,220
Let me check your teeth for a moment,
and we’re done, okay?

602
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:07,830
Mom!

603
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:30,830
Don’t be scared.

604
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,060
I’m here.

605
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,680
I’m not going anywhere.

606
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,420
I promise.

607
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,500
I’ve put in a temporary filling for you.

608
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,320
For now, chew on the other side

609
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,490
and avoid hard foods.

610
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,420
Remember what I said?

611
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:06,360
Got it.

612
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,520
I remember. You've said it 3 times already.

613
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,090
You're talking so much.

614
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,720
It seems like you're not in much pain anymore.

615
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:12,820
Let's go.

616
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:14,350
Where are we going?

617
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:17,790
To test

618
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,850
if you can do what I explained or not.

619
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,670
I told you, this cafe’s croissants look delicious.

620
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,050
What are you waiting for?

621
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:54,730
Why don’t you eat it?

622
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,730
I can really eat it, right?

623
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,220
Of course.

624
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,610
Just make sure not to chew with the side I filled.

625
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:16,830
How is it?

626
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:23,880
You said it was delicious,

627
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,540
but the dough is just okay,

628
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:28,640
the butter's nothing special...

629
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,720
but why the heck is it so damn good?!

630
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,140
What?

631
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:05,340
Nothing.

632
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:08,370
I’m just thinking about the day we first met.

633
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:09,220
Why?

634
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:11,720
Is it funny that I'm obsessed with sweets?

635
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:12,720
No.

636
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,110
If that's what I thought,

637
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,530
I wouldn’t have said that to you that day.

638
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:18,550
What did you say?

639
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:19,690
Like that.

640
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,290
Like what?

641
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,590
I said it when I got out of the water.

642
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:25,520
Excuse me, please.

643
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:33,780
I didn’t mean to leave you.

644
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,020
I just went to the restroom,

645
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:37,860
and when I came back, the boat had already left.

646
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:41,280
I think I like you.

647
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,020
Huh?

648
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:43,220
Date me, okay?

649
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,230
Do you remember now?

650
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,580
Kind of.

651
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,120
Yeah, to be honest,

652
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,370
I don't really remember either.

653
00:43:57,790 --> 00:43:58,860
I only kind of remember,

654
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,280
not even sure what you said to me that day.

655
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:08,690
And do you remember your answer that day?

656
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:37,080
You're such a generous spender, buddy.

657
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:38,520
Do you think we'll have
enough money left to pay the rent?

658
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,990
So, even with the donations from last night,

659
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,430
we're still short by 2,000.

660
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,790
I’ll try talking to him.

661
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,790
Uncle, we have been broke recently.

662
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:46,320
Can I postpone paying the rent, please?

663
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:47,970
If you need anything, go ask the owner.

664
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,810
My mom owns this dorm.

665
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:51,790
Why didn’t you tell me that?

666
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:53,850
Handsome bro,

667
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,820
can you lower the rent for me, please?

668
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:57,050
Alright.

669
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:02,500
But you must be my secretary
for one week, Sant.

670
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:04,830
Deal?
