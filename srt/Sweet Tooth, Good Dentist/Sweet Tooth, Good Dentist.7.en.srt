1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,160
Have you picked the movie
for the closing event yet?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Oh, it’s the movie we watched together.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,960
How about we watch it again?

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,920
Not as a doctor and a patient, though.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,480
But because I’d like to ask you out.

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,160
Hey,

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,880
I’m secretly rooting for him to head back first.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,400
Good luck.

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,280
I’m sorry for keeping you waiting.

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,840
Have you been waiting long?

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,600
But it was worth it.

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,280
Gugg,

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,360
do you remember the romantic movie plot

14
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,080
where the main character
has to choose between

15
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,360
the doctor and the coffee shop owner?

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,440
Why?

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,000
Are you going to add another character,

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,240
a roommate who is his childhood friend?

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,160
Nope.

20
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,280
I’m about to say in the end,

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,600
the main character has
already chosen the doctor.

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,360
But…

23
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,960
I’m sorry I didn’t come to watch the movie in time.

24
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,880
It’s alright.

25
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,400
My main focus is you.

26
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,240
The event is over,

27
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,480
and everyone all went back already.

28
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,920
What should we do next?

29
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,360
Is there anything in your mind that
you want to let me know?

30
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,000
Sant.

31
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:42,600
Yeah?

32
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,479
Be my boyfriend!

33
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,840
I want to poop!

34
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,120
Let’s head back to the dorm.

35
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,600
So I’m thinking about changing the male lead

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,040
to the coffee shop owner instead.

37
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,560
Hey, relax, dude.

38
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,480
This kind of male lead knows
how to play with the audience’s hearts.

39
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,039
How?

40
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,240
He might not have had the guts
to ask you out in person,

41
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,040
but then he goes home and calls
to ask you to be his boyfriend.

42
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,400
Only you could come up with that.

43
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,200
Wait, did I even turn my phone’s sound on?

44
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,200
You aren’t going to bed?

45
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,079
Not yet.

46
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,079
You go to bed first.

47
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,360
I just need to think about something.

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,880
I’m sleeping now.

49
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,840
Jay, what took you so long to call?

50
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,200
Sant, it’s me.

51
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,880
Captain.

52
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,080
Did you call about something?

53
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,120
Sant, I have something important
to let you know.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,560
FACULTY OF DENTISTRY

55
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,840
It’s almost the end of term already.

56
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,800
Have you thought about which community
we’re heading to for the project?

57
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,880
There are so many people in our group.

58
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,840
Why are you asking me?

59
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,280
You know Kong and Karn just put their names down.

60
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,880
When have they ever helped us with anything?

61
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,600
How damn useless they are.

62
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,920
As for me, I don’t really care where we go,

63
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,800
just as long as it’s near my dorm.

64
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,600
Why?

65
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,800
You’re always posting stuff like,

66
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,399
“I just want to sit silly by the sea.”

67
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,840
Ohhh…

68
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,320
Maybe you’ve got your loved one
to spend the break with?

69
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,280
Nope.

70
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,480
Don’t be shy.

71
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,880
Just find the right moment
and ask him to come with you.

72
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,920
No, I mean,

73
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,800
we aren’t in a relationship.

74
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,680
Huh?

75
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,200
But didn’t you say

76
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,960
he came back to see you the other night?

77
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Well yeah, he came to make up with me,

78
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,120
with those puppy-dog eyes,

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,440
like a lost kitten looking for its owner.

80
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,840
I’ve opened the door wide,

81
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,760
so if you like me, just confess now.

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,760
Don’t be shy.

83
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,240
Just say it.

84
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,480
Say it.

85
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,160
Just say it.

86
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,840
Do you have something to tell me?

87
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:04,800
Huh?

88
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,720
See?

89
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,800
He just threw it back at me like
I was the one who had to ask him out.

90
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,200
That’s why I decided to go
with the pooping thing.

91
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,560
You’re insane.

92
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,960
How come?

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,800
I already asked him out once

94
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,040
and he rejected me.

95
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,160
This time he has to ask me instead.

96
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,440
Okay then,

97
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,040
if that’s how you think,

98
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,040
maybe you deserved to get dumped to go poop.

99
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:30,880
Eh?

100
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,760
Hey, I’m still your friend!

101
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,760
You’re insane, aren’t you?

102
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,720
Da!

103
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,760
Hello, everyone watching
Eat With Cap and Sant live stream..

104
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,720
HELLO, MOMMY IS HERE.
WHICH MENU IS IT FOR TODAY?

105
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,080
WHAT’S WRONG, LITTLE SANT? SMILE.
I WANT TO GO TO CAPTAIN’S CAFE ONCE.

106
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,080
Today, we have both good news and bad news.

107
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,840
Let’s start with the bad one first.

108
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,080
The bad news is

109
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,159
I’m going to temporarily close this shop.

110
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,440
But you’re not going anywhere, right?

111
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,840
Of course not.

112
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,960
So since we’ve already had some bad news,

113
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,160
here comes the good news.

114
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,960
This is the good news.
NOOO, I HAVEN’T EVEN BEEN TO YOUR SHOP YET!

115
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,720
CAPTAIN, WHERE ARE YOU GOINGGG?

116
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,560
Well, I’ll be coming back to work on
the Eat with Cap channel again!

117
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,640
OH, JUST TEMPORARILY? YOU SCARED THIS MOMMY.
I BETTER FIND TIME TO VISIT SOON. I REALLY WANT TO SEE YOU.

118
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,320
MY HEART TOTALLY DROPPED THERE.
NOW QUICKLY GIVE US THE GOOD NEWS.

119
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,680
THE GOOD NEWS IS… THEY’RE GETTING MARRIED!

120
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,880
You seem more delighted than me.

121
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,720
Today is the last live stream of
Eat With Cap and Sant channel.

122
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,520
That's pretty sad, huh.

123
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,600
And what we’re having today
could only be one thing.

124
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,360
It’s the shop’s signature menu item,

125
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,920
Sweet Fish Sauce Croissant!

126
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,200
CAN WE SEE IT CLOSELY? WHAT IS IT?

127
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,560
WHOA. IT’S THAT SWEET FISH SAUCE CROISSANT.

128
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,200
Yeah.

129
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,960
Thank you so much for today, Sant.

130
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,480
Today’s live stream was so much fun.

131
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,159
When you're back in Thailand,

132
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,720
let's do another eating live together, okay?

133
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,520
Let’s not do that, Sant.

134
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,920
Eh? Why?

135
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,280
You don’t want to snack with me anymore?

136
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,000
I want to, of course,

137
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,840
but I think you'd probably prefer
eating with someone else.

138
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,520
I’m sorry.

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,640
Eh?

140
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,240
Why did you say sorry? You didn’t have to.

141
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,480
I'm actually happy that from now on,

142
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,960
my friend won't have to eat alone anymore.

143
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,960
Take good care of my friend, okay?

144
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,960
Thank you, Captain.

145
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,280
Good luck.

146
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,680
Okay. You passed.

147
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,960
You’re all done with the scaling cases.

148
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,120
Thank you, professor.

149
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,480
Thanks for being my case.

150
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,800
I tried to be as gentle as possible.

151
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,240
I hope it didn’t hurt, right?

152
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,200
It did.

153
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,000
It hurt a lot.

154
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,400
I’m sorry for being honest,

155
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,280
but I just can’t lie to anyone.

156
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,280
Please have a seat, patient.

157
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,360
I’m just dropping by to say

158
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,880
I’m closing my shop soon.

159
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,120
I saw you mention that in the live stream.

160
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,240
Here you go.

161
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,240
Since you were my first customer,

162
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,280
I also want you to be my last.

163
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,840
You didn’t put anything in the box for me again.

164
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,720
Even if I gave you, you wouldn’t eat it anyway.

165
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,640
If that's all you wanted to say,

166
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,440
you could've just sent a message.

167
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,240
Actually, there's something I want to ask you.

168
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,640
Why haven't you asked him
to be your boyfriend yet?

169
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,080
Well, why?

170
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,360
He should be the one asking me
to be his boyfriend, right?

171
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,240
No, that's not it.

172
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,200
I know your reason.

173
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,440
Jay,

174
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,680
it's time to move on already.

175
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,360
It's been so long,

176
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,680
and I just want you to be truly happy.

177
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,160
JENG

178
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,200
The semester has finally ended!

179
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,680
When are you finally
going to pack up and go home?

180
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,400
Mom's been calling me non-stop.

181
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,800
Hmm, I’m not sure yet.

182
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,040
Why? Do you have something to do?

183
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,160
Yeah, I’m stuck writing a scene

184
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,080
that I need to clear up with the male lead
before I can move forward.

185
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,440
Can't you take it home and write it there?

186
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,000
Nope.

187
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,680
The thing happened at university,

188
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,000
so it has to be finished here.

189
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,040
I hope I get an answer soon.

190
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,160
Alright.

191
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,480
I need to use the bathroom for a second.

192
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,120
Hey, come on, Jay!

193
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,160
You’re the tsundere male lead here.

194
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,760
He’s going to call me soon.

195
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,320
Or is he waiting for me?

196
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,240
Hello?

197
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:36,880
Huh?!

198
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,200
Eh?

199
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,840
Well, is Sant home?

200
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,200
I have something important to talk to him about.

201
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,920
He didn’t tell you?

202
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,120
You sneaked out again.

203
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,280
Should I just toss you in the pot?

204
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,360
Grandma, I’m back!

205
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,040
Honey! Honey!

206
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,680
Honey,

207
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,280
look who’s here!

208
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,600
Hello, Mr. Handsome.

209
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,840
It’s Sant, your beloved grandson.

210
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,080
Grandpa.

211
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,560
Grandpa, is something wrong?

212
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,400
Eh?

213
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,600
Sant, look at him.

214
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,600
I don’t know what’s wrong with him.

215
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,280
He’s not saying a word,

216
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,040
just a stiff face all day.

217
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,440
I cooked for him, but he didn’t even eat it.

218
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,600
Today, we’re expecting
two guests to stay with us.

219
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,640
I already had Onew pick them up.

220
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,200
Yeah.

221
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,600
Hey?!

222
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,400
How could you get here?

223
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,000
Gugg told me there’s a
beautiful homestay around here,

224
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,960
so I’m interested.

225
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,200
Do you know each other?

226
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:31,920
Oh,

227
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,720
he’s a dentist.

228
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,160
He did my dental work in Bangkok.

229
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,720
His name’s Jay.

230
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,120
Jway.

231
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,000
I’m Jway.

232
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,080
Sant, bring some
"karma drink" to welcome them.

233
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,160
It’s pronounced as “welcome drink!”

234
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,880
Come on, I’ll hold it for you.

235
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,680
I can’t open it.

236
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,200
Open it for me.

237
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,400
There, there.

238
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,440
It’s so fizzy and refreshing.

239
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,480
Thanks.

240
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,280
Are you here for a holiday break?

241
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,280
I’m here to organize a dental care project,

242
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,200
just surveying to see...

243
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,520
if anyone around here is looking for a dentist.

244
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,880
You two are dating, right?

245
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,600
What makes you think that?

246
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,640
Oh? I just saw that you two came together,

247
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,520
so I thought you were a couple.

248
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,840
Oh, no.

249
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,520
We’re just in the same group.

250
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,200
I’ve got standards, you know.

251
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,760
Someone this bold isn’t really my type either.

252
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,400
Young man, what is your ideal type then?

253
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,400
Maybe I can introduce you to
someone around here.

254
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,320
I like someone a little stubborn

255
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,360
and someone who snacks a lot.

256
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,480
Is there anyone like this here?

257
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,520
Sant.

258
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,520
Got anyone in mind?

259
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:17,960
Um…

260
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,040
I think our guests must be tired.

261
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,240
Let’s get them to their room.

262
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,560
Onew, let’s go.

263
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,760
Yada, please follow me.

264
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,600
Let’s go.

265
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,720
Yeah.

266
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,960
Seriously? Not even
a single bar of signal out here?

267
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,040
Wait, Gugg?

268
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,600
What are you doing here?

269
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,640
I should be the one asking you.

270
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,640
This is my neighborhood.

271
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,680
Oh,

272
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,839
I’m just surveying locations
for a project with Jay.

273
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:09,800
Hey,

274
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,839
do you know where I can get
some signal around here?

275
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,079
It’s way out in the middle of the field, though.

276
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,560
It’s pretty far.

277
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,480
So how can I get there?

278
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,280
You’re jealous of the buffalo, huh?

279
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,480
At least it’s got teeth to chew grass.

280
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,400
Ahem.

281
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,280
Ahem.

282
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,160
Hey!

283
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,200
You’re not eating or saying anything

284
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,640
because you lost your dentures, right?

285
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,880
Whoa!

286
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,800
Your grandma bought them for me on my birthday.

287
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,920
I don’t want her to know I lost them.

288
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,360
But they’ve got a little crack, Grandpa.

289
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,080
If you want them fixed,

290
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,840
you’d need to take them to the hospital

291
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,840
so you can use them again.

292
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,880
But driving to the hospital takes over an hour.

293
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,560
She’s bound to find out.

294
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,000
So, here’s the mission.

295
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,160
Get Grandpa to the hospital

296
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,360
without Grandma finding out.

297
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,800
The coast's clear. Grandpa, hop in the car.

298
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,120
Sant, hold up.

299
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,480
A round trip to the hospital
takes three hours, man.

300
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,960
You need to add time for the fix.

301
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,960
How are you going to
hide this from your grandma?

302
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,720
That’s why I asked you
to come here to help, bestie.

303
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,600
In the meantime, stall Grandma for me.

304
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:11,920
Hey, hold on.

305
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,160
What do you want me to do?

306
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,120
Come on. Do whatever.

307
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,600
Do you want me to pretend
to be your grandpa or what?

308
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,600
Thank you, bestie.

309
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,080
Ugh!

310
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,440
Hey, I already checked.

311
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,600
Grandpa’s dentures are just slightly chipped.

312
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,560
The repair won’t take long at all.

313
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,680
You sure it won’t take long?

314
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,680
There aren’t many doctors around here.

315
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,120
Most patients are the elderly.

316
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,480
They only come if it’s really serious.

317
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,120
Even then, there are still so many patients.

318
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,800
But if you’re too tired, you can head back first.

319
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,600
I’ll go find something
for Grandpa to eat real quick

320
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:57,920
I’ll be right back.

321
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,200
Grandpa, did he really go back already?

322
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
Who said that?

323
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,400
That young man’s not bad at all.

324
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,840
About how many hours, Auntie?

325
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,760
He said he might not be much help,

326
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,120
but it’s still better than just sitting around.

327
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,680
But from what I saw,

328
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,240
I think he helped quite a lot.

329
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,920
He’s pretty cool, right?

330
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,280
Is he taken?

331
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,760
Why did you ask?

332
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,360
Well, maybe I could introduce
someone around here to him.

333
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,680
Once he graduates,
he could come be a dentist here.

334
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,280
No way!

335
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,640
That’s okay.

336
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,120
I’ll handle that part myself.

337
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,560
Oh?

338
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,120
Well, is he taken?

339
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,400
I don’t know. Ask him yourself.

340
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,200
Here, we raise our chickens naturally.

341
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,520
All their food comes straight from our own farm.

342
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:48,880
Gugg.

343
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,840
It’s alright.

344
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,440
It’s alright.

345
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,360
Don’t worry.

346
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,400
- Gugg!
- Yes?

347
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,240
Hurry up!

348
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,400
Take a picture.

349
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,560
Yes.

350
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,400
Sure.

351
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:06,640
Okay.

352
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,880
One, two, three.

353
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,920
Then let’s gather some eggs first.

354
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,160
I’m going to get more food for the chickens.

355
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,400
I know you’ve been trying to hit on me, Gugg.

356
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,520
I just didn’t want to waste your time,

357
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,160
so I brought my girlfriend that day.

358
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,960
Then why did you lie to me?

359
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,760
Why did you say you weren’t a tomboy?

360
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,480
When did I lie to you?

361
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,080
You said that girl was your girlfriend.

362
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,400
I’m not a tomboy.

363
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,920
It’s just that right now,
the person I like happens to be a woman.

364
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,760
You get it, right?

365
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,640
I’m sorry for accusing you of lying.

366
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,600
It’s okay. I’m used to it.

367
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,120
People have assumed I was a tomboy my whole life.

368
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,000
And when I dated a guy,

369
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,400
they said I’ve “switched sides.”

370
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,280
But…thanks for understanding.

371
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,400
Yeah.

372
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,760
Whoa!

373
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,960
Whose wife is this?

374
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,480
She cooks like a world-class chef!

375
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,120
Oh right!

376
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,320
She’s my wife!

377
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:41,800
Sant,

378
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,360
why is Grandpa suddenly in such a good mood?

379
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,200
I don’t know either,

380
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,440
but isn’t it a good thing?

381
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,120
Grandpa,

382
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,040
were you a likay lead actor back in the day?

383
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,520
Guess what?

384
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,760
Back then, even Sornram Namneung
would have to step aside!

385
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,600
Who do you think Sant inherited
his fan-charming skills from?

386
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,320
You’re going to think I’m bragging,

387
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,560
but fine, let me brag a bit.

388
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,000
Back in the day, I was performing
likay in this very village,

389
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,600
and that’s when I met her.

390
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,240
Ooh, so who made the first move?

391
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,760
You shouldn’t have asked.

392
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,800
She pushed through the crowd
just to give me a garland

393
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,720
and said she liked me!

394
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,240
And me? I’ve always had
a soft spot for bold women.

395
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,920
So that night, instead of
confessing to the lead actress,

396
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,480
you told her you loved her right on stage!

397
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,360
Hold on!

398
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,160
I didn’t even like you back then.

399
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,080
I liked the bandit character in the play.

400
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,000
Then why’d you give me the garland?

401
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,760
I’m asking.

402
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,160
Ugh, my mom liked you.

403
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,280
She asked me to give it to you, so I did.

404
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,760
You mean all these years, I misunderstood?

405
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,240
I thought you’d liked me this whole time.

406
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,240
So…the reason you confessed to me on stage

407
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,480
was because of this?

408
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,640
Don’t change the subject.

409
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,040
Let’s talk about the bandit thing first!

410
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,920
Oh, stop it!

411
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,360
If I hadn’t confessed first,

412
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,040
you wouldn’t have wanted to be with me, right?

413
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,760
Of course not!

414
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,520
You wanted to be that bandit’s wife, didn’t you?!

415
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,760
Grandpa, Grandma, that’s enough.

416
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,680
That was all ages ago.

417
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:22,720
Yeah, he’s right.

418
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,680
True.

419
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,080
Yeah, we should let it go.

420
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,160
Let it go,

421
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,120
like breaking up!

422
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,080
Oh yeah!

423
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,640
Think I won’t go through with it?!

424
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,680
You!

425
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,640
Grandma!

426
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,480
Grandpa!

427
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,680
Grandpa!

428
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,840
You two are way too old

429
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,400
to be fighting like a couple of teenagers.

430
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,400
What did your grandpa say?

431
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,960
He’s still sulking.

432
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,600
I guess your grandma is still sulking too, right?

433
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,560
But I get Grandma’s feelings.

434
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,040
She’s always believed Grandpa
was the one who liked her first.

435
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:20,880
Hey,

436
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,240
but poor Grandpa too.

437
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,440
He’s always thought she liked him first.

438
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,480
That’s why he asked her
to be his girlfriend in the first place.

439
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,400
Then why do you have to wait for someone else
to confess first before asking them out?

440
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,760
Have you ever heard that quote...

441
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,080
from some series?

442
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,880
“Whoever catches feelings first, loses.”

443
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,480
Ah,

444
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,920
so that’s how you think.

445
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,960
That’s why you didn’t dare
ask me to be your boyfriend.

446
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,720
See?

447
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,200
You were actually waiting for me to say it first!

448
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,200
Oh?

449
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,280
And why does it have to be me
who says it first every time?

450
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,200
Well then, why didn’t you say it first?

451
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,160
Were you worried it’d hurt your pride or something?

452
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,040
Then why didn’t you say it, Sant?

453
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,280
Why didn’t you say it?

454
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,200
You say it first then!

455
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:07,760
What?!

456
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,040
I was waiting for you to say it first!

457
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:09,960
Wait!

458
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,160
Why are you two arguing now?!

459
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,480
Just dealing with Grandpa and Grandma
is already giving me a massive headache.

460
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,280
Yeah, that's enough!

461
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,480
Just break up already.

462
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,040
Fine!

463
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,480
Break up it is! You think I won’t do it?

464
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,320
Break up then!

465
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,160
Fine!!

466
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,480
Walk carefully, okay?

467
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,960
There’re lots of holes around here.

468
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,800
There’s a signal here.

469
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,280
Thanks. You must be exhausted.

470
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,600
Here. Take this to recharge.

471
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,040
Thank you.

472
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,120
Here it is. I found it,...

473
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,920
but there’s only one bar.

474
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,000
How about you try going higher?

475
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,160
The higher, the better the signal.

476
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,800
Higher?

477
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,040
Hey! Two bars now!

478
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,320
Ouch!

479
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,080
Call now.

480
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,120
I’ll hold it for you.

481
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,840
Hello, Por?

482
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,040
I’m sorry, there was no signal, so I couldn’t call.

483
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,240
I haven’t forgotten.

484
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,160
It’s just been really busy.

485
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,680
I’ll try to call you every day from now on.

486
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,960
I came all the way out just to find
a signal to talk to you.

487
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,320
Grandpa.

488
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,120
When I dated her,

489
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,640
I quit performing likay

490
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,440
because her family thought of it as

491
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,200
a 'train-boat-likay-comedy-flirt' kind of job.

492
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,120
So if she never appreciated it,

493
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,200
why keep the costume?

494
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,840
Uh… Grandpa,

495
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,720
I don’t think you should throw it away.

496
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,960
I mean, why should I keep it here
and let it collect dust

497
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,200
when I could wear it again
and make the girls scream?

498
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:04,800
Grandpa.

499
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,960
Wait, Grandpa, please calm down.

500
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,840
Think about it.

501
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,840
Even if she didn’t say "I love you" first,

502
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,960
she’s always taken good care of you, hasn’t she?

503
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,280
This whole thing is about pride.

504
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,680
No, it’s not.

505
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,400
I think the reason you wanted her to say it first

506
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,240
is because you weren’t sure about yourself.

507
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,320
You were afraid you weren’t good enough

508
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,960
so you needed to hear her say it first.

509
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,640
Am I right?

510
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,240
How did you know that?

511
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,080
It’s because I’m just like you.

512
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,480
And right now,

513
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,160
that fear we both carry...

514
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,400
is hurting the people we love.

515
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,440
What is he doing?

516
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:51,400
I’m a prince who has journeyed far
through the wild lands.

517
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:59,240
By fortune, I’ve met a beautiful princess.

518
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:07,280
And now, I wish to make her my wife.

519
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,800
Hold it right there,

520
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,480
pretty boy!

521
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:17,880
Jay?!

522
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,560
What?

523
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,280
I’m not Jway.

524
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,920
I’m the ruthless forest bandit

525
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,360
called…

526
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,160
Paew.

527
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,520
If you want the princess,

528
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,360
you’ll have to get through me first!

529
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,080
Fine!

530
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,640
Bandit, if you catch me,

531
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:04,840
you’ll probably kill me, huh?

532
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,280
But if you do catch me,

533
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,120
please don’t hurt me, okay?

534
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:12,840
What?

535
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,480
That’s not fair! Come here!

536
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,160
Gasp!

537
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,360
I’m dead!

538
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,400
I’m sooo dead!

539
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,760
Serves you right!

540
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,000
Last time is in the past,

541
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,160
but this time,

542
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,280
I’ll go first.

543
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,960
My princess,

544
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,280
will you marry me?

545
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,240
What?

546
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,360
You’re only saying this now?

547
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,000
Take it.

548
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,600
I like you.

549
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,639
Did Grandma tell you to say that?

550
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,320
Nope.

551
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,320
This came straight from me.

552
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,800
Cheers! Bottoms up, everyone!

553
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,480
Come on, drink up!

554
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,960
Bandit.

555
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,080
You’re lightweight and you're still pushing it.

556
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,480
Sant.

557
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:01,960
Hmm?

558
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,960
I have something to tell you.

559
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:07,760
What is it?

560
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,320
Jay!

561
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,520
I want to say I like you.

562
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,720
I know.

563
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,800
You’ve said that like a hundred times today.

564
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,600
That’s because I like you!

565
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,200
What was that?

566
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,160
- I said I like you.
- I can’t hear you.

567
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:35,760
Huh?

568
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,440
I can’t hear you.

569
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,560
I like you.

570
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,640
I like you.

571
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,160
I like you.

572
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,120
Pardon?

573
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,160
I like you too.

574
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,640
I can't remember the last time
I had such a good sleep!

575
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,880
I'm going to brush my teeth.

576
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:34,920
Wait.

577
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,400
With this view so great, just brush right here.

578
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,520
You’re hooked on this brand now, huh?

579
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,640
Yeah. Most dentists recommend it.

580
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,880
It doesn’t make my teeth sensitive either.

581
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,640
I’m not switching anymore.

582
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,760
So, what do I have to do

583
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,840
to become a boyfriend most dentists recommend?

584
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,800
You know, so someone will not change his mind.

585
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,960
Just stay the way you are.

586
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,400
You already are one, aren’t you?

587
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,080
You know what?

588
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,680
This might be the most perfect and
relaxing toothbrushing moment of my life.

589
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,880
Same here.

590
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,880
Hi everyone!
SANT, MY LITTLE BABY

591
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,200
Welcome back to my channel,
HELLO. YOU’RE SO EARLY TODAY.

592
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,960
“Hungry While Sleeping, Yawning When Waking Up!”

593
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,440
It’s this same boy, Sant,
IS THE BACKGROUND REAL?

594
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,360
in a brand-new location

595
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,440
with a very special guest, Dr. Jay!
MOMMY IS HERE, READY TO SEND HEARTS.

596
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,560
Dr.Jway!

597
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,240
Anyone who has joined,
feel free to say hi in the chat!

598
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,440
E-wen, our top fan, sent 100 hearts already.

599
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,200
Thank you!

600
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,760
Thank you!

601
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,040
Hey,

602
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,920
are you introducing your boyfriend to us, Sant?

603
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,120
Eh? How did he know?

604
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:02,680
That’s right.

605
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,680
We’re…

606
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,240
A fan!

607
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,000
He’s my fan.

608
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,080
He’s been my fan for a long time

609
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,480
so he’s now visiting my hometown.

610
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,200
As a local,
SO WHAT’S THE DEAL? I’M READY TO SCREAM.

611
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,400
I've prepared the best items
from the province to welcome you,

612
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,480
starting with cube-shaped candy,

613
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,720
condensed milk pie,

614
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,000
glass bananas,

615
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,440
and pandan millet rice!

616
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,480
But I think there's still one thing missing.

617
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,680
It’s something iconic from Suphanburi.

618
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,400
What is it?

619
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,160
Sali cake, of course!

620
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,880
I heard it's really good, isn't it?

621
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,760
I don't like it.

622
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,200
Anyway, let's get to the point.

623
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,680
Today, Dr.Jay has some good news
to share with everyone.

624
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:51,000
AND THE GOOD NEWS IS…
Umm…well…
YOU’RE MAKING ME EXCITED AGAIN.
Well.
SO THE NEWS IS THAT YOU TWO ARE DATING, RIGHT?

625
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,360
I brought someone I know to get
dental treatment around here.

626
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,800
It’s clear that the hospital is so far away

627
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,640
that many people can’t make the trip

628
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,600
and don’t get proper dental care.

629
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,680
So, my friends and I started a project
called “Dentist on the Way.”

630
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,080
I’ll be coordinating with the hospital

631
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,960
to bring dentists to everyone instead.

632
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,120
With this project,

633
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,880
all the locals will receive free
oral health check-ups and dentures.

634
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,280
If you want to smile with confidence again,

635
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,160
please come and join us.

636
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,680
Thank you so much, Doctor.

637
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,080
Even on your day off, you still came to help us.

638
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,560
No worries, Doc.

639
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,200
I want patients to have
access to proper care too.

640
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,760
Here comes your coffee.

641
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,200
Thank you, Uncle.

642
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,240
Hey kid,

643
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,800
you’ve got a good build, huh?

644
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,280
Once you graduate,

645
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,920
why don’t you come be a dentist here?

646
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,880
You won’t get lonely around here.

647
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,200
Girls here are all real sweet.

648
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,280
Let me show you a photo of my granddaughter.

649
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,720
Oh, no need, Uncle.

650
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,480
I’ve already got someone.

651
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,880
He’s really cute too.

652
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,960
You don’t believe me? Let me show you.

653
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,480
Show me.

654
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,360
Here you go.

655
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:10,960
Show me.

656
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:11,760
Give me a second.

657
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,000
Where? Oh, here it is.

658
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,680
Everyone!

659
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,960
Everyone,

660
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,960
Grandma just finished making the rice noodles.

661
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,720
Let’s all go eat first,

662
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,760
and then we’ll get back to your dental checkups.

663
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:23,920
Let’s go, Uncle.

664
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,880
This way.

665
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,760
The food is still hot.

666
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,880
What were you doing?

667
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,320
I was about to show off my boyfriend.

668
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,600
Come on, what era do you think this is?

669
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,600
Why do you have to be shy?

670
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,000
I know,

671
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,120
but it still doesn’t work that way here.

672
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,960
People around here are super traditional.

673
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,080
I don’t want them gossiping
about Grandpa and Grandma.

674
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,200
Do you want me to hide it from everyone?

675
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,400
Well then, I deserve something in return, don’t I?

676
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,160
Ugh,

677
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,920
fine.

678
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,960
If it’s just the two of us,

679
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,080
I’ll do whatever you say.

680
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:20,840
Deal?

681
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,960
Well, it is just the two of us right now.

682
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,440
Sant!

683
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,160
Jay!

684
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,280
No cavities at all.

685
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,120
None!

686
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:49,920
That’s great!

687
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,360
No cavities, seriously.

688
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,240
Perfect.

689
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,600
This is excellent.

690
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,640
Hey, Onew,

691
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,560
don’t go getting any cavities like him, okay?

692
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:00,680
Got it?

693
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:01,800
Good!

694
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,880
Yada, do you want to
take a break and eat something?

695
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,520
Grandma sent over some rice noodles for you.

696
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,520
Thanks.

697
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,360
You’re welcome.

698
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,240
It’s done.

699
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,080
Thank you very much, Doctor.

700
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,080
Thank you.

701
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,720
Goodbye.

702
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,240
Is there anything I can help you with?

703
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,000
I'm super good with paperwork.

704
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,840
Well, there is one thing,

705
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,960
but it's not really work-related.

706
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,200
What is it? Shopping?

707
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,880
I can go get it for you if you want.

708
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,760
I can buy everything for you.

709
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,600
Reply to my girlfriend’s text for me.

710
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,200
Huh?

711
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,560
Oh.

712
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,120
Yada, you know what?
Some things only a partner can handle!

713
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,080
Hey!

714
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,520
The chat is popping up like a machine gun!

715
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,840
Who's going to be able to reply in time?

716
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,320
LET’S BREAK UP, THEN.

717
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:39,960
Oh?

718
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:46,640
Eh?

719
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,960
Hey, where’s the doctor?

720
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,440
I had my friend send him back already.

721
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,240
I see.

722
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,360
The food's ready.

723
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,240
You can go eat now.

724
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:19,960
Wait.

725
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:33,000
That means it's just the two of us here, right?

726
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,680
We're still outside.

727
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:37,840
Why rush?

728
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,960
Can't I just take a deposit first?

729
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,080
Sant!

730
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,360
No cavities, huh?

731
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,680
Your teeth are strong and healthy.

732
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,440
Great job!

733
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,160
Thanks, Doctor.

734
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,440
Hey,

735
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,600
it looks like we switched roles.

736
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,200
Do you have any herbal medicine?

737
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,680
Grandma’s complaining about chest tightness.

738
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,160
Oh,

739
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,400
I think we have some at home.

740
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,000
Let me go get it for her.

741
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:23,800
Go eat.

742
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,520
Thitapong is a good boy with good manners,

743
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,480
but he sometimes sneaked snacks into the room.

744
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,760
Who told you to come in here?

745
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,320
Don’t tell me that’s yours too.

746
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,400
It’s mine.

747
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,400
Grandma bought it for my birthday.

748
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,360
Why?

749
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,280
You’re into sweet stuff too?

750
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,160
Can I borrow it?

751
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:21,600
Nope.

752
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,680
You’re stingy.

753
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,960
Fine, I won’t wear it.

754
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,960
So you’re not just into sweet stuff,

755
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,800
but you’re into aromas too?

756
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,480
It was from Occupational
and Basic Life Skills Subject.

757
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,960
We had to make scented candles.

758
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,520
Everyone else made floral scents.

759
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:55,880
How about you?

760
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,560
I made a croissant scent, of course,

761
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,760
but the teacher said it smells
more like a Chinese pastry though.

762
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:09,640
Make one for me.

763
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,840
I want to know what it’s like.

764
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,560
I heard it helps you sleep better too.

765
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,960
Go away. Others might see us.

766
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,960
- Come onnn, just make me one.
- Go.

767
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,360
- Just one!
- We’ll talk about it later. Go.

768
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,120
Just one.

769
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:42,920
Sant!

770
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,200
Grandma's having trouble breathing.

771
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:48,600
Huh?

772
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:27,840
Hey.

773
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,240
I brought you your pajamas.

774
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,200
Thank you.

775
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,440
How do I use this?

776
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,920
Oh come on, it’s not that hard.

777
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,600
Just pull the mosquito net down,

778
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,560
tighten it up,

779
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,440
and tuck the edges under the bed.

780
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,040
That’s it.

781
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:08,760
Uh…

782
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,480
I’ll excuse myself now.

783
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:13,800
Hey, wait.

784
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,520
Actually, the project I’m working on

785
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,880
isn’t the only thing I want to do here.

786
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,120
Auntie.

787
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,400
Auntie?!

788
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,800
This dorm’s management loves
nitpicking tenants,

789
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,800
but never does their own job.

790
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,920
Just now one of the tenants,
I don't know which room, called me “Auntie.”

791
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,480
Hey? What the heck?

792
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,960
Should I check the CCTV

793
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,240
and have them kicked out of the dorm, Mom?

794
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,200
So, that day,

795
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,520
you liked me first, didn’t you?

796
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,080
Well, you must’ve liked me too.

797
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,360
Otherwise, why would you go with me after that?

798
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:49,960
I don’t know!

799
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,880
Who remembers stuff like that?

800
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,840
It was so long ago.

801
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,000
It’s okay if you don’t remember.

802
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,400
Let’s go on our first date again.

803
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,160
What do you say?

804
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:55,960
I’m here.

805
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,400
This outfit… this place…

806
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,920
It really feels like that day again, doesn’t it?

807
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:00,800
Not quite.

808
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:01,880
It’s missing the flower.

809
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,160
Go on a date with me, will you?
