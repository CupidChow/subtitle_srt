1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,070
Did you buy a cake too?

2
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:01,980
Is this cake for me?

3
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,100
I knew today is your birthday,

4
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,900
but I also just found out
you don’t like your birthday.

5
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:07,550
Sant.

6
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,300
I’m allowed to be happy with that, right?

7
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:10,800
You deserve this.

8
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,210
It’s your birthday today.

9
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,650
The one Sant loves is you,

10
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,830
not Jeng you’re trying to become.

11
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,290
Why have things turned out this way?!

12
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,330
You promised me you’d never leave me, didn’t you?

13
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,130
Thanks.

14
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,670
This is the best birthday I’ve ever had.

15
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,410
Go back.

16
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,740
Someone’s waiting for you.

17
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,400
It’s someone you want to return to, too.

18
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,590
Jay!

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,140
Actually, that night,
I prepared a cake for you, Jay.

20
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,010
Today counts as a belated birthday
celebration with your friends and me, okay?

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,130
Hurry and blow the candles.

22
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,170
I want to eat the cake already.

23
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,970
Whoa, this is your very first cake, isn’t it?

24
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,230
Let me see.

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,410
Hey!

26
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:32,810
Hey! Captain!

27
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:33,979
Stop right there!

28
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:35,520
Captain!

29
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:37,870
Mom!

30
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,039
Come here!

31
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,340
Move, Sant.

32
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,050
Jay!

33
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,060
Sant, get out of the way.

34
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,500
Sant, get out of the way.

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,900
Come back here!

36
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:46,750
Don’t move.

37
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,600
How did it end up like this?

38
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,310
Well, my mom had something to do.

39
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,830
She’s staying over at Robert’s.

40
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,160
Are you really going to be heartless
and leave me to sleep all stinky and alone?

41
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,470
I only helped because of your mom.

42
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,170
Otherwise, I wouldn’t have.

43
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,470
The croissant smells so good.

44
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,300
Which one?

45
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,980
There’s only one croissant, isn’t there?

46
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,700
You woke me up again, you know that?

47
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:45,900
You’re such a tease.

48
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:46,810
I’m leaving!

49
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,960
Hold on.

50
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,010
Take responsibility first.

51
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,610
THREE YEARS LATER

52
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,600
Hello to all our tooth cavity gang.

53
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,130
Welcome to Hungry While Sleeping,
Yawning When Waking Up.

54
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,600
Today, your same old good guy, Doctor Jay,

55
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,120
is going to eat snacks for you all to see.

56
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,230
Jay.

57
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,810
That’s my line!

58
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,620
Move over.

59
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,840
What?

60
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,490
What are you doing on my channel?

61
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,800
Oh? It’s your channel?

62
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,600
I thought

63
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,900
it was our channel.

64
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,810
Uh... so here’s the deal, everyone.

65
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,760
You’re probably wondering why the two of us
are here at Sant’s hometown.

66
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,500
Well, it’s kind of a long story.

67
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,550
We have to go back to when I had just graduated.

68
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,080
When I count to three, shout “Yay!” okay?

69
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,200
One, two, three.

70
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,930
Yay!

71
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:45,960
All done.

72
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,500
Wow, Sant!

73
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,970
I thought I’d never get to see you
in this outfit in my lifetime.

74
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,630
Don’t exaggerate, Grandma.

75
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,810
I only graduated two years
later than my friends.

76
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,720
Why are you crying, Grandpa?

77
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,350
Yeah, why are you crying?

78
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,050
You’re embarrassing us.

79
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,980
Uh, I’ll be right back.

80
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,110
Huh? Where are you going?

81
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,910
To see the doctor.

82
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,500
But you look fine. Why go to the doctor?

83
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,520
Exactly, why go see a doctor?

84
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,750
Honey, look at this.

85
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,950
The Miang Kham Croissant is ready to be served.

86
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,980
Okay then, let’s go!

87
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,110
Welcome.

88
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,659
Yada?

89
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,760
Gugg? Why are you here?

90
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:52,000
Didn’t I see on Instagram that you were
starting a band with your friends?

91
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,470
Oh, the band hasn’t debuted yet,

92
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,800
and I couldn’t wait around
because I need to pay the rent.

93
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,300
Luckily, Captain came back
and reopened the café.

94
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,810
What are you guys doing here?

95
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:02,870
Got some business?

96
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,070
We’re surveying the place,

97
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,400
looking for a small venue for an event.

98
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,770
What kind of event?

99
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,560
Take a guess.

100
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:17,600
Whoa!

101
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,850
Congratulations!

102
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,980
You’ve got to come

103
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,300
and bring Sant with you too.

104
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,570
You guys are still in touch, right?

105
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,360
Oh, you mean that famous internet idol?

106
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,290
He went straight home
after the graduation ceremony.

107
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,430
He’s probably already there by now.

108
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:39,909
Ugh, if I had known doing the service
would be this exhausting,

109
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,170
I would’ve stayed here anyway.
I’m just complaining for the sake of it.

110
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,900
Doctor, someone dropped off a lunchbox for you.

111
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,260
Who did?

112
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,280
Take a guess.

113
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,810
Hmm...who?

114
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,700
Oh? With such a small waist

115
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,600
and a lovely scent,

116
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,760
I bet he must be someone spicy.

117
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,400
Let me have a taste.

118
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:34,559
Hmm...with this flavor,

119
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:38,150
I’d say it’s someone delicious
no matter where or when I eat.

120
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,490
You’re not talking about the food, are you?

121
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,370
Were you waiting long?

122
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:48,960
Yeah,

123
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,070
but it was worth it.

124
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,840
Be careful. This is a hospital.

125
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,370
Are you grossed out?

126
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,980
You want it, huh?

127
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:30,730
You think I won’t do it?

128
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,900
Why did you slurp it all in? Spit it back out.

129
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,130
You must be really head over heels in love with me.

130
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,770
You chose to do your service in my hometown.

131
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,150
I’m just here to finish the dentures project.

132
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,900
That’s all.

133
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,640
That’s all?

134
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:58,180
Well, maybe if the results impress
someone around here,

135
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,470
they might finally hand over
their grandson to me.

136
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,500
Maybe you should be more worried about me.

137
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,600
By now, your mom probably hates me.

138
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,420
I dragged her son into this tough life.

139
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,090
Don’t worry.

140
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,000
Robert’s taking care of her.

141
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,310
Worry about this guy instead.

142
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,400
I was left alone by my boyfriend for years.

143
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,530
Well, I’ve graduated.

144
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,600
Once you finish your service,

145
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,700
we can move back to Bangkok together.

146
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,980
But in the meantime, I’ll be your food support.

147
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:33,710
Hmm?

148
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,400
Hot latte coming right up.

149
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,960
Thank you.

150
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,000
I’m sorry.

151
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,000
The only latte art we can do here is a heart.

152
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,060
Oh, that’s totally fine.

153
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,510
I actually like heart shapes.

154
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,070
Thanks again.

155
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,860
Of course.

156
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,030
Honey, come on.

157
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,700
You’re not a young girl anymore.

158
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,310
No more climbing up to fix this or that.

159
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,470
If I don’t do it, then who will?

160
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,960
Let the younger ones handle it.

161
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,740
I think it’s time for you to take a break.

162
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,500
What are you even saying?

163
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,860
They have good jobs over there already.

164
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,000
It’s good for them.

165
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,900
Why would we drag them back here to struggle?

166
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:16,250
I know you love this place so much,

167
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,020
but there’s no way just the two of us
can take care of this alone.

168
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,570
I was just worried that everything was
heading toward a happy ending too quickly,

169
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,360
so I added some conflict to spice things up a bit.

170
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,560
Well, it wasn’t just a little.

171
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,400
It messed with my head for a whole week.

172
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,500
What?

173
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,610
Why didn’t you talk to me about it back then?

174
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,200
You weren’t available.

175
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,200
On weekdays, you were at the hospital.

176
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,410
Weekends, you were working at the clinic,

177
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,710
and it was the very one my mom
left me at when I was a kid.

178
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,790
PAIRACH DENTAL CLINIC

179
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,470
There are so many clinics out there,
PAIRACH DENTAL CLINIC

180
00:12:59,470 --> 00:12:59,810
PAIRACH DENTAL CLINIC

181
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,170
but you had to pick this one.
PAIRACH DENTAL CLINIC

182
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,150
They needed someone here.

183
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,430
I’m finishing my service next month.

184
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,800
That means we’re finally going back to Bangkok.

185
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,580
Hey.

186
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:18,520
Yeah?

187
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,720
What if I don’t go back with you?

188
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,220
What do you say?

189
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,230
What do you mean?

190
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,270
Grandpa and Grandma have been talking.

191
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,980
They want me to stay and take care of this place.

192
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,300
I do want to go back with you,

193
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,720
but if it means leaving them behind,

194
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,110
I…just can’t.

195
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,340
I understand.

196
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,350
I know we both really want to be together,

197
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,190
but if we have to push it back
just a little longer,

198
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,200
would that be okay with you?

199
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,190
Don’t go quiet.

200
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:22,800
No, I’m just thinking.

201
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,500
The person Grandpa and Grandma
really want to come back and help

202
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,220
is probably not you, Sant.

203
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,790
Then who?

204
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,270
Your grandpa called me and discussed it.

205
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,940
I also want to go back home.

206
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,980
Grandpa and Grandma raised me,

207
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,250
so it’s my responsibility to repay them.

208
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:48,100
And didn’t they also raise me?

209
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,380
That’s not what I meant.

210
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,700
But this time, it really is my responsibility.

211
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,310
Sant, this is my responsibility.

212
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,960
Let me finally take on my role.

213
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,400
I’m not abandoning everyone, am I?

214
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,440
I’m sorry, son.

215
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,480
I’m sorry I let you carry all of this alone.

216
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,340
I’ve taken so much of your life already.

217
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:25,980
From now on, it’s time for you to live your own.

218
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,470
Since I met you,

219
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,340
I haven’t really felt much tingling.

220
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,410
Am I supposed to be happy about that?

221
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,800
I meant tooth tingling! Sensitivity!

222
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:01,970
Thank you

223
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,130
for helping me enjoy desserts again.

224
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:24,890
Is today really the last time
I’ll get to see this view?

225
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:28,740
Who said that?

226
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,410
This is just the first day
of a brand new adventure.

227
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,980
After that, the two of us moved back to Bangkok,

228
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,270
living in a tiny condo,

229
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,910
AKA our newlywed nest.

230
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,570
Newlywed nest? Really?

231
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,710
Oh, I’m sorry, everyone.

232
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,000
We moved back to Bangkok,

233
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,970
living in a tiny condo,

234
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,200
AKA our love nest.

235
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,030
You’re awake?

236
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:04,900
Why didn’t you wake me up?

237
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,400
I’m not awake yet.

238
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,560
I’m still dreaming.

239
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,550
Is this really our room?

240
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,880
Hey!

241
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,680
Well, now you know it’s not a dream.

242
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,800
But if you still don’t believe me,

243
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,600
I’ll make sure you really wake up.

244
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,450
Nooo!

245
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,890
No, Jay!

246
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,780
Jayyy!

247
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:36,730
Jay!

248
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,810
Jay!

249
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:38,770
Nooo!

250
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,380
Jay, stop it!

251
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,820
Stop. Stop. Stop.

252
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,730
It’s your first day at work.
You’re going to be late.

253
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,410
I won’t be late. It won’t take long.

254
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:48,350
Are you up yet?

255
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,530
Aghhh!

256
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,140
Noooo!

257
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,140
Stop!

258
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,430
I like everything Grandma brought.

259
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,480
What are you looking at?

260
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,800
The food’s right here.

261
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,940
And I can’t eat this?

262
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,280
If you want a bite,

263
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,900
come back quickly.

264
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,810
Someone might want it twice.

265
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,810
You said it, okay?

266
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,160
I’m back.

267
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,880
Let’s do it now, shall we?

268
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,480
Don’t mess around. Eat first.

269
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,150
I’m not messing around. I’m serious.

270
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,720
We’ve got time.

271
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,570
Nope.

272
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:32,980
It won’t take long.

273
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,380
Good things are worth waiting for.

274
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:35,330
It won’t take long.

275
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,140
- Eat first!
- We’ll make it quick.

276
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,720
Jay, eat already.

277
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,180
It won’t take long, okay?

278
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,330
Come on.

279
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,900
Ha! See? I knew it.

280
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,900
First day back in Bangkok
and I’m already getting hazed.

281
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,090
Come on.

282
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,300
It’s the first day of school for the kids.

283
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,300
They’ll understand.

284
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,300
Being late is not the point.

285
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,000
Uh-huh?

286
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,470
I really need to pee.

287
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,840
Like, it’s coming out now.

288
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:07,650
Damn!

289
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,630
I’m going to be late too.

290
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:10,910
I’ve got a meeting with a client.

291
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,410
Alright, I’ll take a motorcycle taxi.

292
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:19,930
See you later.

293
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:20,900
Wait.

294
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:21,670
Yeah?

295
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,010
Can I take this cup?

296
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,310
What for?

297
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,720
Just let me.

298
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,520
Fine, okay.

299
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,100
See you.

300
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:49,050
BKK means “Back home... after dark.”

301
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,780
I’m home, babe.

302
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,460
Are you asleep?

303
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,120
I have to rush the presentation for the client.

304
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:02,930
Wait. I saw your clothes
thrown all over the place,

305
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,800
so I thought tonight we’re going to…

306
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,740
Ohhh... I was sticky from working all day

307
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,160
and too lazy to shower,

308
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,230
so I just threw them off.

309
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:22,860
Really?

310
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:26,970
Alright, alright,

311
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:31,200
go shower or you’ll get sick.

312
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:34,210
Can I have five more minutes, Jay?

313
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,130
Nope.

314
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,330
Do you want to walk there yourself
or do you want me to carry you?

315
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:40,670
I’m not going.

316
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,920
Come on, up!

317
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,210
Let’s go!

318
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,540
Jay!

319
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,990
Don’t you feel bad for a tired working man?

320
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,060
- Go shower.
- No!

321
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,060
Just a second.

322
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,240
Then I’ll let you sleep again.

323
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,070
You know

324
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,090
our bathroom is pretty far, huh?

325
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,800
The bed is way more convenient.

326
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,810
If you don’t mind that I haven’t showered yet,

327
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,470
I won’t mind either.

328
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:38,880
Deal.

329
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:41,970
Give me a second.

330
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,660
Sant.

331
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:01,890
Sant.

332
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,240
Ugh!

333
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,800
BKK means “Burned out, Keep going!”

334
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,620
Sheeesh. I just passed out for one day.

335
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,610
Really?

336
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,100
Are you sure it was just one day?

337
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:26,720
Hey!

338
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,650
- What?
- Wait.

339
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,270
I just got a new idea. Let me jot it down.

340
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:34,940
Huhh?!

341
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,730
Ahhh! That tickles!

342
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,870
Ouch! Don’t bite me!

343
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,730
Jay!

344
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:42,810
Stop it!

345
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:43,870
Ugh!!

346
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,300
Why do they keep calling me?

347
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:48,710
Hello?

348
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,410
Yes?

349
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:50,550
Your filling fell out?

350
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,270
Got it.

351
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,700
I’ll be there right away.

352
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,270
Jay!

353
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,980
Jay, I’m live streaming!

354
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,880
Hello, our tooth cavity fandom.

355
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,520
I’m fixing your shirt, you know.

356
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,650
Oh, yes.

357
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,400
You’re out of your mother-in-law’s food already?

358
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,400
Do you want some of mine?

359
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,250
My girlfriend made it.

360
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,270
Are you being generous or just showing off?

361
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,610
Showing off, obviously.

362
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,430
You’re sure about that?

363
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,950
Yeah. I can eat this.

364
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:59,550
I mean, are you sure
about coming back to work here?

365
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,370
Why did you ask that?

366
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,100
Just look at your face.

367
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,440
You looked happier
when I visited you in Suphan.

368
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:12,920
Nonsense.

369
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,680
Over there I was seeing
over a hundred patients a day.

370
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:22,700
Here, I clock out at 7.

371
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:27,430
Bangkok, the perfect dream life.

372
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:30,960
Right?

373
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,600
But does your boyfriend feel the same?

374
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,060
Sant, go shower.

375
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,280
No live stream tonight?

376
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:27,260
Nope.

377
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:28,880
And you?

378
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,300
Phone’s off?

379
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:31,980
Yep.

380
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,400
Then bring it on.

381
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:03,450
Ouch!

382
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,140
What’s wrong? Did I kiss too hard?

383
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,140
No, I have a toothache!

384
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:27,980
All done.

385
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:28,980
Rinse now.

386
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,810
You’ve got a tooth cavity again,

387
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,170
just on the other side this time.

388
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,260
I’ve been doing late-night
streams often lately.

389
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,200
I haven’t taken care of myself.

390
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,500
I know exactly what you’re about to say.

391
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:54,630
“If you’ve got a cavity,
that means you’re living life wrong.”

392
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:56,980
Yeah, I know.

393
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,390
The thing is, the influencer industry
is super competitive now.

394
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,440
Plus, there’s stuff going on
at home I’ve had to deal with.

395
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,770
Let’s go back to Suphan.

396
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,180
What was that?

397
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,040
I miss Grandma’s cooking.

398
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,710
I miss my old patients.

399
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,600
And honestly,

400
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,230
I miss the version of myself who lived there.

401
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:32,900
I don’t know.

402
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,970
At least no one there got a toothache
when I kissed his cheek.

403
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,500
I miss Mom too.

404
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,070
I haven’t spent much time with her.

405
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:57,150
Then let’s go back to Suphan together, okay?

406
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,130
Jay,

407
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:13,670
are you really okay with
not living the life we planned?

408
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,120
Well,

409
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:27,270
my plan has always just been our happiness.

410
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,320
Coming back here wasn’t a difficult part.

411
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:59,400
What’s difficult was figuring out how to
make the people here understand

412
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:02,300
why the dentist who finished
treating their kid’s teeth for years

413
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:05,010
suddenly showed up to stay with him.

414
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,800
My family’s really traditional, you know.

415
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,310
I spent weeks thinking it over.

416
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:12,970
But eventually,

417
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,400
I found a way to help Grandpa
and Grandma understand.

418
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,800
That person… is you,
SAKKARIN DAOLOM LIKAY TROUPE

419
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:26,300
my prince.

420
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,610
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

421
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,170
Isn’t a prince supposed to be with a princess?

422
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,770
Times change. So do people’s minds.

423
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,320
Eh?

424
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,320
Love isn't about right or wrong.
It's not about gender.

425
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,100
Anyone can love anyone.
And we shouldn't be ashamed of that.

426
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:40,860
Hold up.

427
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:44,040
I'm confused now.

428
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,310
So who’s supposed to be with who?

429
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,900
We’re a couple.

430
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,730
Wait, is that even in the script??

431
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:05,520
Uh... Sant just wanted to tell everyone

432
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,000
and hopes you’ll still support
and love us the same.

433
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,560
Dad! Mom!

434
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,600
You think I’ve never watched
a BL series before?

435
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:49,280
Why wouldn’t I know you two are in love?

436
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:05,600
She’s in JimmySea fandom, okay?

437
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,300
Take care of him for me, dear.

438
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,600
A round of applause, everyone!

439
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,900
Hello, my tooth cavity gang.

440
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:43,760
Welcome to Hungry While Sleeping,
Yawning When Waking Up.

441
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,970
Today we’re going to talk about 5 signs

442
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,350
that show you’re living a good life.

443
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:54,160
Number one: A good life is one
where you exercise regularly.

444
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:57,310
Hey, hello?

445
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,450
What are you up to?

446
00:33:58,930 --> 00:33:59,730
Have you eaten yet?

447
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,100
Congrats on your debut.

448
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:02,900
Here you are.

449
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:04,870
Thank you.

450
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:05,980
No worries.

451
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:07,890
Thank you.

452
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:09,900
Let’s go.

453
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,090
We’ve got more events.

454
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:12,500
Okay.

455
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:18,000
Number two: A good life is one
where you eat nutritious food.

456
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,889
LOVE YOU, GUGG.

457
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,100
Can I sit here with you?

458
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:32,400
Sure.

459
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:38,800
Number three: A good life is one
where you do meaningful work.

460
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:53,760
Number four: A good life is one
where you have a regular sleep routine.

461
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:05,920
Look at this.

462
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,640
They’re so cute.

463
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,050
Look at them.

464
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,210
Look at his eyes!

465
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,440
And here comes the final sign.

466
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:21,810
A good life is one
where you get to love someone.

467
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,890
So, we’ve covered everything
we planned to livestream today, right?

468
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,130
Yes.

469
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,500
Let’s give our viewers a break then.
What do you think?

470
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,520
Do you all want us to end already?

471
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,450
It looks like they want us to continue.

472
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,450
Come on.

473
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:41,370
What else is there to tell?

474
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,200
Nothing left.

475
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:45,820
How about this one?

476
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:46,770
Hmm?

477
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,810
That story from my last birthday?

478
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:04,370
Do you think it’s too late to change
my mind and move back to Bangkok?

479
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:10,900
Come on,

480
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,780
at least here there’s no traffic.

481
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,420
And we don’t have to rush out of bed either.

482
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:25,650
Hey!

483
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,630
Someone might see us.

484
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,100
Who’s going to see?

485
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,970
Everyone’s off at the Kathin festival.

486
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,350
They’ll be back tomorrow.

487
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:37,730
Eh?

488
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:39,700
You should have told me.

489
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:54,740
It’s fine.

490
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:55,950
Let’s start over.

491
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,350
It’s fine.

492
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,430
Let’s start over.

493
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,540
Ugh!

494
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:17,810
Forget it!

495
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,250
I’ll just go shower!

496
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,310
I’ll boil you and eat you up.

497
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,900
Here you are.

498
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:38,940
Whoa. It looks delicious.

499
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,120
Jay.

500
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:40,980
Yes?

501
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:44,970
Wow.

502
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,200
Is that my birthday cake?

503
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:50,350
Sant, I told you not to—

504
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:52,510
It’s not yours.

505
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,300
It’s for Jeng.

506
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,800
Today’s his anniversary too.

507
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,100
Oh, okay.

508
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,400
Do you want to pay respect to him with me now?

509
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:07,480
Sure.

510
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,600
This year we’re doing it separately, bro.

511
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,980
Mom went to visit relatives with Robert.

512
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,980
Since it’s your anniversary,

513
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,500
drop us some lottery numbers, okay?

514
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:32,100
I miss you.

515
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,230
Come on. Let’s eat.

516
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,040
Whoa, everything looks amazing.

517
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,170
Then dig in.

518
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,180
What should I eat first?

519
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:55,700
Wait.

520
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,060
Take this with you.

521
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:01,860
Sant, if it’s a cake, I’m good.

522
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,750
You really don’t need to.

523
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,250
Cake? No.

524
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:06,890
It’s a lunchbox.

525
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,900
Uh…thanks.

526
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,510
Seriously,

527
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,510
do you actually want me to throw
you a birthday party or not?

528
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,210
Of course not!

529
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:22,940
I don’t want it.

530
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,710
If you do, I’ll be mad.

531
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,980
I hate birthday parties.

532
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:26,980
Just picture it.

533
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,350
I come home, open the door,

534
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,400
and there’s someone standing there with a cake.

535
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:35,800
There are balloons everywhere,

536
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,110
and a sign with my name at the front.

537
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,180
It’s all so predictable.

538
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:42,530
Throwing a party like that
would just be a waste of money.

539
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,500
So don’t. If you do, I’ll be mad.

540
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,020
You mentioned all that.

541
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,580
Are you sure you really don’t want one?

542
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,240
I don’t.

543
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,960
Don’t do it, okay?

544
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,180
Don't.

545
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,270
Yes sir.

546
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:53,790
Now hurry.

547
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,740
Your patients are waiting.

548
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,900
Did you forget something?

549
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:01,100
Nope.

550
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,160
Your lunchbox is right here.

551
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,550
Here.

552
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,400
That’s cute.

553
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:12,810
Alright, I’m off.

554
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,070
Don’t you dare throw me a party.

555
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:15,700
Got it.

556
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,970
- If you do…
- I won’t!

557
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,390
I hate people who throw
surprise birthday parties.

558
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,190
Why would they even do that, when it’s clearly
supposed to be… well, a surprise.

559
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,090
Right?

560
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:25,770
Right.

561
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:27,900
I’m off then.

562
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,120
Who works on their birthday anyway?

563
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,400
I’ve taken the day off for
a whole month in advance.

564
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,640
You’re planning to surprise me, huh?

565
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,310
There’s no way I’m falling for it.

566
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:19,640
Oho~ A round box like this?

567
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:23,360
Someone must have secretly
ordered a cake for me.

568
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:25,790
A cutting board?!

569
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,510
Huh?

570
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,400
Hello, Grandma?

571
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,310
The cutting board you ordered
just got delivered.

572
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,400
Okay, I’ll leave it in the kitchen.

573
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,980
Ahhh, so that’s why you didn’t order a cake.

574
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,840
You wanted to bake it yourself
and show off your skills.

575
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,840
That’s so sweet!

576
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,910
Whose boyfriend is this again?

577
00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:59,000
Omelet?

578
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,510
For real?

579
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:07,830
Seriously, whose boyfriend is this?

580
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,800
He’s so adorable.

581
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:11,980
I told him not to throw a birthday party,

582
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,900
and he actually didn’t.

583
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:14,700
He’s just sitting there playing
on his phone all day.

584
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,750
He didn’t even get me a present.

585
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:19,740
Ugh!

586
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:23,600
Ouch! Oww!

587
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,190
How come there’re ants here?

588
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,330
Shit!

589
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,270
Jay.

590
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,430
You told me not to throw you a party.

591
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,870
Who would dare go against that?

592
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,660
Exactly.

593
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:45,980
I didn’t want you to waste money,

594
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:47,520
so I came to peek, just in case.

595
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,320
Also,

596
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:53,600
I was worried someone here might try to
secretly surprise me with a cake.

597
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:02,140
Happy Birthday!

598
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,880
Happy Birthday, Jay!

599
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,400
You said I couldn’t throw you a birthday party,

600
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:13,200
so I had someone else do it instead.

601
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:42,980
Jay.

602
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:43,540
Yeah?

603
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:44,600
This is a present from me.

604
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:45,680
I promise you won’t be disappointed.

605
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:46,500
Oh yeah?

606
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,550
Tada!

607
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:51,390
An official GASP.ER band hat, signed by me.

608
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,460
I guarantee its value will only go up from here.

609
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,170
Really?

610
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:55,980
Thanks.

611
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:57,600
Aren’t you going to try it on?

612
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,580
You can eat the cake now.

613
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,480
Not even a quick try-on?

614
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:00,430
It looks so good.

615
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,500
Thanks, buddy.

616
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:04,530
Now this one’s from Captain.

617
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:06,720
Let me have a look.

618
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,440
Why is it an air conditioner remote?

619
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,550
Someone’s sleeping hot tonight.

620
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:20,700
Captain, you’re just…

621
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,160
Tell Captain thanks for me, okay?

622
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:27,100
And this one’s from me and Da.

623
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,070
Thanks, Baipor.

624
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:33,300
Wait.

625
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:35,840
Be careful unwrapping it.

626
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:43,110
Shit!

627
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,600
It’s to remind you about everything
you’ve gone through to get to this point.

628
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,920
Remind him? Of what?

629
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,970
Wait, he never told you?

630
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,110
If it weren’t for this toy,

631
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:58,980
he wouldn’t have been able to win you over.

632
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:01,240
He never told you?

633
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:01,740
He didn’t.

634
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,760
- Then let me tell you.
- Da, stop it.

635
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:06,140
- Why?
- Don’t say anything.

636
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,910
It’s in the past.

637
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:09,900
Talk to you later.

638
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:12,570
Sant, what about your present?

639
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:20,900
Well, you said not to get you anything,

640
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:22,300
so I didn’t.

641
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:23,700
What?

642
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:28,470
But I picked the cake for you myself.

643
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:31,400
Try it. I’m sure you’ll love it.

644
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:34,650
Aahh.

645
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,400
Good, right?

646
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:37,620
Aww, how cute.

647
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:38,900
Look at you feeding him.

648
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:39,990
One more bite.

649
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:42,110
You love it. I can see it in your face.

650
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,100
One more bite.

651
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:44,980
Good job.

652
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,760
No present, really?

653
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,940
Another bite.

654
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:53,210
So good, huh?

655
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,440
You even frowned.

656
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,010
Come on, I’ll do the dishes.

657
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:02,160
No, it’s okay.

658
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:03,970
I’ve got this.

659
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,300
You have work early tomorrow, right?

660
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,100
Hmm. Alright then.

661
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,970
Come see us when you have time, okay?

662
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:13,700
Un and I miss you like crazy.

663
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,100
I know.

664
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:16,920
Let’s hug.

665
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:18,510
Come.

666
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,560
Thanks, man.

667
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:24,870
Yeah.

668
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:27,010
Seeing you happy makes me happy too.

669
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,100
Take care, alright?

670
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:30,180
Get home safe.

671
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:30,780
I’m off.

672
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,640
I’ll go get the car.

673
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,560
Wait here, Da.

674
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,030
I was just about to head out too.

675
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:44,520
Do you want me to walk with you?

676
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,370
Jay, bye-bye.

677
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:49,700
Yada, goodbye.

678
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:02,350
Baipor and you seem happy together.

679
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:06,200
Look at my face. That’s your answer.

680
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:09,500
What about you?

681
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:10,880
Any regrets coming back?

682
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:14,870
Look at my face.

683
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:18,810
Where do I even start?

684
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,700
I get woken up by roosters
every single morning.

685
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:27,600
At work, when my assistant doesn’t show,

686
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:30,110
I have to run the clinic all by myself.

687
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:32,640
It’s exhausting.

688
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:37,870
But you’re smiling.

689
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:49,550
You two seem genuinely happy.

690
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:51,320
Trust me.

691
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:57,980
My girlfriend is here.

692
00:47:59,030 --> 00:47:59,980
Happy Birthday.

693
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,210
I wish you a lot of happiness.

694
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:02,980
I’m off. Bye, buddy.

695
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:04,110
Thanks for coming.

696
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:04,970
Bye.

697
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:38,100
Sant.

698
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,710
Sant, are you in the kitchen?

699
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:47,920
Eh?

700
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:52,620
Sant, where are you?

701
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,490
Sant!

702
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:08,540
What are you doing?

703
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:18,700
Jay,

704
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,340
you really think I didn’t get you
a birthday present?

705
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:23,060
Hmm?

706
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,910
I figured you had something,

707
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:32,100
but I just didn’t think it’d be this big.

708
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:38,850
And do you like it?

709
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:49,350
I don’t know.

710
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:55,070
I guess I’ll have to unwrap it and see first.

711
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,390
Everyone, look at this.

712
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:25,980
Doesn’t this treat look delicious?

713
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:15,700
Let me take a bite.

714
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,260
Mmm… hits the spot!

715
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:17,600
What?

716
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:19,110
Why are you smiling?

717
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:20,980
I’m not.

718
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:23,600
Why are you smiling?

719
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:26,370
Nothing.

720
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:27,900
I’m not smiling.

721
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:29,560
You obviously are.

722
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:36,490
How happy I am.

723
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:42,850
Why are you happy?

724
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:46,530
You want to know?

725
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:47,480
Yeah.

726
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:48,970
Well,

727
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:54,290
I got to eat a tasty croissant last night.

728
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:00,270
Do you want to eat more?

729
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:09,970
If you want more,

730
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:12,750
come and get seconds.
