1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:01,950
You think I don’t dare to?

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:03,680
Oops.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,030
This is the taste I missed.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,490
It’s so sweet!

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,210
Auntie.

6
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:10,410
Auntie?!

7
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,490
How have you been doing, Jay?

8
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,440
Great.

9
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,570
What brings you here today, Mom?

10
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,180
Can’t I come visit once in a while?

11
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,820
Gugg, I’ve been hiding something from you.

12
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,450
What is it? You’re scaring me.

13
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,220
Well, I’m dating Jay.

14
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,660
Sant! You said it?

15
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:25,600
Nice one, friend.

16
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,780
Hello? Where are you?

17
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:28,980
I’m here.

18
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,580
I thought something came up.

19
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,310
Something did come up.

20
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,420
My mom suddenly showed up at the dorm.

21
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,410
And how did you get away?

22
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:24,260
I texted her, saying I have an errand.

23
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,160
From now on, it’s just the two of us.

24
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,800
This outfit… this place…

25
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,950
It really feels like that day again, doesn’t it?

26
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:42,910
Not quite.

27
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,590
It’s missing the flower.

28
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:52,200
Go on a date with me, will you?

Come on.

44
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,260
You’ve never been to this kind of place before?

45
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,480
I haven't.

46
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,640
I'm telling you, you're going to love it.

47
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,480
I’ve played that machine before, too.

48
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,310
But this one? I’m the champion!

49
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,970
Once you try it, you’ll forget the library.

50
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,490
Let’s play that one.

51
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,620
This one, right here.

52
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,630
What game is this?

53
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,290
It measures your power.

54
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,120
You get a score based on how hard you hit.

55
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,050
Let me go first.

56
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,150
Whoa, you got a 10.

57
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,900
And I was holding back, too.

58
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,320
Can I try?

59
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:33,810
Sure.

60
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,320
Well, I think the machine's broken.

61
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,390
Let’s play something else.

62
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,570
What?!

63
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,209
Do you want to hop on the back, little bro?

64
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,040
Eh!

65
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:25,360
Ouch!

66
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:27,900
Ugh!

67
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,160
Ugh!

68
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,970
This really is more fun than the library.

69
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,500
What should we play next?

70
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,710
How about that one?

71
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,100
Wait!

72
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,310
Seeing this reminds me of that day.

73
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,910
I hope I won't have to dive in
and get soaked again today.

74
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:30,970
Oh?!

75
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,200
You said your throat was dry,

76
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:34,320
so I got you this.

77
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,310
Why?

78
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,920
Are you afraid I’ll ditch you again?

79
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,780
What’s there to be afraid of?

80
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,620
Nope.

81
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,650
Who would be afraid of such a thing, huh?

82
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,300
Wait.

83
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:47,900
Did you forget something?

84
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,670
What is it?

85
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,250
I see.

86
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,100
You’re in such a rush
you almost missed the good stuff.

87
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,630
You’re in such a rush
you almost missed the good stuff?

88
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,800
Getting cocky now, huh?

89
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,230
Why not?

90
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,570
Someone once told me that

91
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,450
looking straight ahead gets you there fast,

92
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,700
but don’t forget how beautiful the sides are too.

93
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,220
Oh!

94
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,150
Good thing I brought a tee to change into.

95
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,850
I had a feeling something like this would happen,

96
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,350
so I brought one too.

97
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,820
Finally we got to wear matching shirts
like you wanted, huh?

98
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,450
Who calls them “matching shirts”?

99
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,100
Since you know me this well,

100
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,650
we’re a “perfect match.”

101
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:13,470
Let’s go.

102
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,800
Hey.

103
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:22,840
Yeah?

104
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,520
Today, don’t get drunk
and yell at the DJ again, okay?

105
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,980
Yeah, yeah. Got it.

106
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,960
Whoa, wait.

107
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,800
That person looks like my mom.

108
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,100
That’s your mom’s style?

109
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,170
Yep.

110
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,230
Same hair color,

111
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,390
same dress,

112
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,580
same bag…

113
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,400
That is my mom!

114
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:01,740
Mom?

115
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:02,840
Jay?!

116
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,290
Hi again.

117
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,510
What are you doing here?

118
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:11,820
Hello, honey.

119
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,170
How are things so far?

120
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,610
Don’t tell me

121
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,420
this foreign guy is your boyfriend.

122
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:20,480
Hello.

123
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,340
I’m Robert.

124
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:23,800
I can speak Thai.

125
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,180
Hello.

126
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,400
I was just bored,

127
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,360
so I downloaded the app.

128
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,270
I never thought I’d find true love.

129
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,170
Ohh…

130
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,080
so when you came to see me this morning,

131
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,300
you were checking where I was going?

132
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:57,860
Wait a second.

133
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,600
You said you were visiting
your old school for a career event.

134
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,300
So why are you here?

135
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,000
Well,

136
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,540
I finished the school thing, Mom.

137
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,760
Now we’re out eating.

138
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,610
Right?

139
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,110
You look familiar.

140
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,510
Have we met before?

141
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:19,420
Auntie.

142
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,510
Auntie?!

143
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,040
Yes, you.

144
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,470
I don’t think so, Auntie.

145
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,050
Oh!

146
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:31,570
Mom.

147
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,260
We’re out of beer.

148
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,650
I’ll go order some.

149
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,810
Mom, how long have you known him?

150
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,780
It’s been a while.

151
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,030
It’s been two whole weeks.

152
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,350
What?! Two weeks?

153
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,470
Mom, how is that "a while"?

154
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,660
Who is he? Where is he from?

155
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,610
What does he do?

156
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,300
How can you trust him already?

157
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,460
Whoa.

158
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,690
Beer’s here.

159
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,560
Robert, where do you come from?

160
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,820
I’m American.

161
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,140
Really?

162
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,060
What is the capital city of the USA?

163
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,500
Washington, D.C.

164
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,790
Washington, D.C.

165
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,220
Isn’t it New York?

166
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:21,970
It’s D.C.

167
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,280
What do you do?

168
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:29,190
Robert works in accounting at Silicon Valley.

169
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,720
Wow.

170
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,130
Can I see your business card?

171
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,260
Jay, you’re being rude!

172
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,460
It's okay, babe.

173
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,330
I’d love to, but I didn’t bring one.

174
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,140
See? He’s totally a scammer!

175
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,350
Mom, you’ve been fooled.

176
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,290
Let’s go. We’re leaving.

177
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,140
Okay.

178
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,720
I’ll tell you the truth.

179
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,120
I’m not an accountant.

180
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,450
I’m a CEO.

181
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,850
Whoa!

182
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,450
You really went all out with that lie.

183
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,400
Where did you get this fake one?

184
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,490
Khaosan Road?

185
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,410
Huh?

186
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:12,680
Go ahead and check.

187
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,350
So?

188
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,700
He’s telling the truth.

189
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,350
I didn’t say anything because

190
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,600
I wanted you to judge me by who I am,

191
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,850
not what I have.

192
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,150
Aww, Robert.

193
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,060
Why are you so sweet?

194
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:49,730
Where’s Mom?

195
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,750
Robert asked her to dance.

196
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,900
Ugh, Mom! Seriously?

197
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,690
A lady like you

198
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,240
shouldn’t go off with a guy.

199
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,620
Ever heard of modesty?

200
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,690
Aren’t you going to stop her anymore?

201
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:53,670
Sant.

202
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:54,910
Yeah?

203
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,010
Let’s pay the bill and go.

204
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:04,950
Got it.

205
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,080
The sky’s really beautiful tonight.

206
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:29,830
Jay,

207
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,770
can I ask you something?

208
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,010
Sure.

209
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,390
Why did you let your mom go so easily today?

210
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:00,980
I’m sorry.

211
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,800
If you don’t want to talk about it, that’s okay.

212
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:09,730
I just thought

213
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,800
now that we’re together,

214
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,980
maybe you’d want to share things with me.
Let me carry some of the weight with you.

215
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,800
Of course, I can tell you.

216
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,880
It’s no big deal.

217
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,970
It’s because

218
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,100
Robert can make her smile.

219
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,100
You ever wonder...

220
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,580
why a kid like me, obsessed with sweets,
ended up in med school?

221
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,700
Yeah.

222
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,030
The truth is,

223
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,660
I had an older brother.

224
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,200
His name was Jeng.

225
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,300
I'm off to class, Mom.

226
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,260
Why don’t you just get a new box already?

227
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,200
Aren’t you embarrassed
walking around with that thing?

228
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,570
I can’t do that, Mom.

229
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,800
My student mentor gave it to me.

230
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,410
What kind of degree takes six years?

231
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,660
Other kids finish in four
and help their families already.

232
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,980
Mom, I’m in dental school.

233
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,070
Obviously, I’ll become a dentist.

234
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,070
If you want someone to help collect rent,

235
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,010
let Jay do it.

236
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,340
Look at him.

237
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,520
He eats sweets all day.

238
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,980
There’s no way he’s holding down a job.

239
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,600
Hey! Why am I the one getting roasted?

240
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:49,880
I’m just teasing.

241
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,240
I’m off now.

242
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,950
Mom, can you wash my lab coat?

243
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,530
Ugh, you’re always making me do stuff!

244
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,880
Do you want to wash his coat?

245
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,040
Nope.

246
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,970
My brother graduated...

247
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,300
and became a top dentist.

248
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,400
And I went on to study baking,

249
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,610
hoping to open
a little dessert shop with Captain.

250
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,740
I see.

251
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,210
Well, that’s how it should’ve gone

252
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,630
until one day,

253
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,700
a car ran a red light and hit Jeng.

254
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,640
But that wasn’t the first time

255
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,530
someone in my family passed away.

256
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,500
My dad died when I was little.

257
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,819
My mom raised both of us all by herself.

258
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,349
In my memories,

259
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,780
she’s always been incredibly strong.

260
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,630
Oh!

261
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,240
It looks like it’s about to rain.

262
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,500
I’ll go bring the laundry in first.

263
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,520
Mom, can’t it wait a bit?

264
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,600
Seriously?

265
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,460
She still has the energy to do chores.

266
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,400
She probably just doesn’t want to sit around.

267
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,900
She’s more sad than she lets on.

268
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,490
Really, Uncle?

269
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,810
Back when Jeng was still around,
they fought every single day.

270
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:19,580
Jay,

271
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,560
your mom only finished grade 4.

272
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,200
She wanted her kids to get
a high level of education.

273
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,110
You know what?

274
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,100
When Jeng got into dental school,

275
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,890
she kept bragging about it to all the relatives.

276
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,400
Even when I had a terrible toothache,

277
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,260
she wouldn’t let me see a dentist.

278
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,260
She told me to wait until Jeng graduated

279
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,500
and get my teeth done by him instead.

280
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,580
Just think about that.

281
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,770
JENG

282
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,420
Mom, I’m off to class.

283
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,710
When are you going to get a new box?

284
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,870
Aren’t you embarrassed
carrying that thing around?

285
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,180
It’s fine. I’ll get one soon.

286
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,020
Ugh, when will you finally be able to help me out?

287
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,300
What kind of degree takes six years?

288
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,170
I’m off.

289
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,150
Yeah.

290
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,870
So I promised myself

291
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,700
I’d do everything I could...

292
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,460
to protect that smile.

293
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,980
But today, I almost ruined it with my own hands.

294
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,630
Jay, listen.

295
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,460
You didn’t do anything wrong.

296
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,880
You just cared.

297
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,340
You were afraid he’d be the reason
your mom lost her smile.

298
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,590
But what about you?

299
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,970
Have you smiled at all?

300
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,500
I don’t know.

301
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,240
I’ve had to quit sweets,

302
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,490
pull all-nighters studying,

303
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,760
and some days I was so stressed.

304
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,220
I barely slept.

305
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,010
But there’s someone

306
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,560
who still manages to make me smile.

307
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:28,810
YOU GOT THIS, JWAY!

308
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,090
Hello, all my fellow cavity crew!

309
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,030
This is “Hungry while sleeping,
Yawning when waking up!”

310
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,250
This adorable Sant is here to snack for you!

311
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,130
If you’re enjoying the stream,

312
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,800
don’t forget to send hearts to cheer me on!

313
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:55,230
And what Sant is going to eat today is…

314
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:59,980
Croissant!

315
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,980
If I helped bring back Mom’s smile,

316
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,500
you’re the one who brought back mine.

317
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,420
Thank you.

318
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:16,550
Yeah.

319
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,560
Then can I ask for something in return?

320
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:35,610
What is it?

321
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:42,910
Gugg doesn’t believe we’re really dating

322
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,980
unless he sees a picture of
me kissing your cheek.

323
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:48,180
That’s it?

324
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:48,940
Mm-hmm.

325
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,200
Sure.

326
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:54,130
If he doubts us that much, I’ll prove him wrong.

327
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,120
Let’s do it. Ready?

328
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,270
One, two—

329
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,700
Hey! I wasn’t done counting yet.

330
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,790
It’s the end of our date,

331
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,300
and you kissing me feels a little basic,

332
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,060
so I’m kissing you back.

333
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,800
Just to make it crystal clear we’re dating.

334
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,070
Who said it’s the end?

335
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,510
There’s still one thing
we haven’t done together yet.

336
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,700
But we’ve done everything now, haven’t we?

337
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,690
Well, this time, I’m not drunk.

338
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,440
♪ Since you came into my life,
it's been so bright ♪

339
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:50,110

342
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:14,900
Thanks for walking me home.

343
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,120
No problem.

344
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,710
That’s all I can do for you.

345
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,010
See you around.

346
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,700
- Aaaahhh!
- Hey!

347
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,390
Hey! What? What is it?

348
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,760
There’s one right there!

349
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,820
- It’s by the door!
- Hey, hey, calm down.

350
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,270
What do you mean “one”? Oh, that thing?

351
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,320
Don’t worry.

352
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,810
We’ve got tons of them back home.

353
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:36,770
They’re way bigger than this one.

354
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,700
Let me take care of it.

355
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,980
All done.

356
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,750
You can go in now.

357
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,530
Thanks.

358
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,530
You were seriously cool just now.

359
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,410
What did you say?

360
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,510
I said you were super cool, Gugg.

361
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,560
I mean it.

362
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,300
Holy crap!

363
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,440
They really are dating!

364
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:46,560
Jay!

365
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,320
Jay!

366
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:48,410
Jay, wake up!

367
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,200
What happened last night?

368
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,300
Why are we like this now?

369
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:00,650
I vaguely remember it was cold,

370
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,560
so we went to get a can of beer each.

371
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
How many did we have again?

372
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,570
I guess it got a little out of hand,

373
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,150
and the two of us…

374
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:18,730
Wait!

375
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,300
Maybe nothing even happened.

376
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,500
We were just hot,

377
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,600
so we took our shirts off and slept.

378
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,550
That’s all.

379
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:27,840
Phew.

380
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:32,010
At least we’ve still got our bottoms covered.

381
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,010
Yeah, you’re right.

382
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:37,880
But I’m wearing yours,

383
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,080
which means you’re probably wearing mine.

384
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,860
So last night…

385
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,760
we did something

386
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,570
that required taking our underpants off.

387
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:06,400
Sant,

388
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,740
I’m sorry.

389
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:13,710
No,

390
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,470
I’m just a bit upset.

391
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,590
It was our first time,

392
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,980
but I can’t remember any of it.

393
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:26,570
It’s okay.

394
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:29,910
If you can’t remember it,

395
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,430
then how about we make a new first time?

396
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,430
What do you say?

397
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,900
Can we?

398
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,240
Of course.

399
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,480
If you’re okay, I’m okay.

400
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,570
Then, go close the curtain.

401
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,390
The light is hurting my eyes.

402
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,060
Mmm.

403
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,680
Wow.

404
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,490
HBD, JAY!

405
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,430
Strawberries!

406
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,850
- Hey!
- Ouch!

407
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,510
Are you in a rush or what?

408
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,550
- Come here!
- Let me go!

409
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,200
In a hurry, huh?

410
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:25,730
By the time you’re back, I'll be asleep.

411
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,090
I'll wake you up myself.

412
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,330
You have to wait until I finish my lab.

413
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,910
But it's my birthday.

414
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,870
Why can't I eat first?

415
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,670
It’s your birthday, but that’s my cake.

416
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,530
If you really want to eat, go buy it yourself.

417
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:42,890
Behave.

418
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,150
Jay!

419
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,090
Wait for me. We'll eat it together.

420
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:55,720
Fine.

421
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,500
I’ll wait.

422
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,190
Hey, what's wrong?

423
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,060
Bad dream?

424
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:20,000
No.

425
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:25,700
I just dreamed about us
swapping underwear that day.

426
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,200
Why did you bring that up again?

427
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:36,280
But last night we kind of flowed into it again.

428
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:39,010
Or?

429
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,060
What a relief.

430
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,330
Mine's still on.

431
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,440
Oh?

432
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,770
So where’s yours then?!

433
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:49,500
Surprise!

434
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,040
I felt uncomfy,

435
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,100
so I ditched it hours ago.

436
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,080
It’s way comfier.

437
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,380
What time is it?

438
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:00,970
I’m supposed to meet my mom this morning.

439
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,290
Can you get dressed first, please?

440
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,000
Do you sell birthday candles?

441
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,540
Yes, left side in the back.

442
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:16,920
Got it, thanks.

443
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,500
You're actually a pretty warm person.

444
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,160
You’re selling birthday candles too.

445
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,250
I actually meant to order prayer candles,

446
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,240
but messed up.

447
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,210
Why are people happy
about getting older anyway?

448
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:39,670
Well, they get cakes and gifts.

449
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,080
Wouldn’t you be happy too?

450
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,010
Not really.

451
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,580
If I want something, I buy it.

452
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,930
Why wait for my birthday?

453
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,980
So how is that the same?

454
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,260
How isn’t that the same?

455
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:54,270
Or is birthday cake
just tastier than usual ones?

456
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:58,410
So, you won’t care about my birthday either?

457
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:02,980
To me, birthdays are just exciting for kids.

458
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,430
Are you still a kid, Sant?

459
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,010
Here you go.

460
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:10,740
I'd like to pay, please.

461
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:11,770
That’ll be 20 baht.

462
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,410
You can scan here.

463
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,570
Thank you.

464
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,300
Do you know what day it is today?

465
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,710
What day?

466
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,090
It's been 90 days since we met.

467
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,910
Honestly, I’m really tired.

468
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,640
No matter what I do, you still can’t forget your ex.

469
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,990
Maybe I’m the one

470
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,340
who needs to forget you.

471
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,610
Don’t say that! I’ll hit you!

472
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:49,960
Cut, cut!

473
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,660
That’s from the wrong page.

474
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,910
That was the gangster’s line.

475
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,190
I’m sorry.

476
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,910
I told you I don’t know how to do this.

477
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,440
Why don’t you rehearse with someone else?

478
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:07,030
I just wanted to hear
you sweet-talk me for once.

479
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:07,620
Huh?

480
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,679
Oh, nothing.

481
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,580
Let’s take a short break.

482
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:17,570
Thanks.

483
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,570
It’s like you knew I was hungry.

484
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,300
So what are you rehearsing for?

485
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,810
A senior’s thesis project.

486
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:41,159
I heard the lead actress is really pretty too.

487
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:45,400
And with my natural charm... well, trouble.

488
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,800
Really? Let me see her photo.

489
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,889
Come on. Show me now.

490
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,870
Nope, I was just kidding.

491
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,420
There’s nothing. It’s just a joke.

492
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,030
Gugg, help me out.

493
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,360
Alright.

494
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,350
Let me handle it.

495
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:10,560
Damn, that’s heavy.

496
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,730
I’m putting it over there.

497
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,280
Oh, and by the way,

498
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,700
I’ve got a film shoot this evening.

499
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,370
Oh yeah?

500
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:21,910
Uh-huh.

501
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:24,900
Dude, Jay totally played it cool with me.

502
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,970
He acted like he didn’t care about his birthday,

503
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,840
so I planned a huge surprise.

504
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,360
Let’s see if he can keep this cool after this.

505
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,900
How did you even know his birthday?

506
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,400
Come on, it’s not that hard.

507
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:39,080
Everyone’s birthday is on their ID.

508
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,440
And his says it’s today!

509
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,320
Shit.

510
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,240
You’d better book a place now.

511
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:44,970
All the good ones are probably full.

512
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,800
But if I take him somewhere fancy,

513
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,300
he’s going to know something’s up.

514
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:51,610
I want it to be a real surprise.

515
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,360
Then what about our faculty’s canteen?

516
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,550
I’m sure that’s a surprise.

517
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,550
Save that idea for your birthday, okay?

518
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,070
I’ve already got a plan.

519
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,500
I’m going to take him somewhere unexpected.

520
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,980
I saw his note on his phone.

521
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:08,480
He’s going to make merit
with his mom that morning.

522
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,980
After that, when he comes back to his room,

523
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,420
a whole set of big surprises
will be waiting for him.

524
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,200
Ta-da!

525
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:23,350
With you wrapped in a bow, huh?

526
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:24,770
Wow!

527
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,200
I know you don’t eat sweets,

528
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,620
but I made this cake for you myself.

529
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,460
I know you aren’t mean, Jay.

530
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,160
Just one bite? Please?

531
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,070
Now, I feel surprised, really.

532
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,870
Someone like you knows how to bake a cake?

533
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,600
Who said I know how?

534
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,430
I just know someone who can help.

535
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,500
When it comes to desserts,

536
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,990
you can count on me.

537
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,480
Thank you very much, Uncle.

538
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,610
But I just need to borrow your kitchen.

539
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,140
Eh?

540
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,910
The person I want to teach me is...

541
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,240
Sant!

542
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,490
Why did you come to me to learn cake baking?

543
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,380
Oh.

544
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,660
That’s because I’m making a birthday cake for Jay.

545
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,140
Sant.

546
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,340
You know how much I like you, right?

547
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:15,580
You doing this kind of breaks my heart.

548
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,400
Like, you’re breaking it real hard.

549
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,670
Do you even realize that?

550
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,170
Ugh!

551
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,910
I was scared of this happening.

552
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,440
That’s why I told him

553
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,440
I’m just collecting material for a script.

554
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,300
Ta-da!

555
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,940
My very first homemade cake.

556
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,140
Taste it, coach.

557
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,630
It looks pretty nice.

558
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,430
Wow, it’s delicious from the first bite.

559
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,440
That’s my student!

560
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,810
Even I can’t get it to taste like this.

561
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,100
I tweaked the recipe a bit to match my taste.

562
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,310
But don’t worry, I wrote it all down.

563
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,540
Let me see.

564
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,450
SWEET FISH SAUCE CAKE RECIPE
STEP 1: CAKE

565
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:09,100
Wait, where did the rest go?!

566
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,420
12 hours later,

567
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,280
a lot of fails,

568
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,890
and I finally made it work!

569
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,670
Damn.

570
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:21,530
So now all that’s left is sneaking into
his room to set everything up.

571
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,150
Yeah, but I don’t know how to get in.

572
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,270
I don’t have a key.

573
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,060
Dude.

574
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,050
That should’ve been your Step One.

575
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,290
Jay,

576
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,140
my A/C is broken.

577
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:46,430
Can I crash here tonight?

578
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,710
Holy shit.

579
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:54,820
I saw the actress.

580
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,190
She’s gorgeous in person.

581
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,400
Let’s hope she’s just as nice.

582
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,870
They’ve been bragging like crazy.

583
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,010
Wait and see.

584
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,150
Hey, here she comes.

585
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,940
Baipor, this way for makeup, please.

586
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,180
Hello, Baipor.

587
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,440
Have you eaten yet?

588
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,450
Yes.

589
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,340
Please sit here for your makeup.

590
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,180
Whoa. You’re stunned, huh?

591
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:29,990
Her cuteness knocked you out, didn’t it?

592
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:35,580
Yeah,

593
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,460
I’m stunned.

594
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:38,980
She’s adorable, right?

595
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:43,870
You take the bed tonight.

596
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,360
I’ll sleep on the couch.

597
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,300
Nope.

598
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,030
We’re dating now.

599
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,300
We should sleep in the same bed.

600
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,790
You’re not thinking anything dirty, are you?

601
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:56,270
What?

602
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:57,690
No…

603
00:39:59,150 --> 00:39:59,900
Well, how could I not?

604
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,660
Do you have anything to do tomorrow?

605
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,550
Oh right,

606
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:13,420
I’m seeing my mom in the morning.

607
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:14,920
Really?

608
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,880
Then while you’re out making merit,

609
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,340
I’ll clean up the room.

610
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:21,080
Aww, thanks.

611
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:22,810
Wait.

612
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,140
I didn’t say anything about
making merit just now.

613
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,270
Come to think of it...

614
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:38,030
You’ve been smelling like cake lately.

615
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,360
You’ve also been acting kind of weird.

616
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,170
Is there something you’re hiding?

617
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:56,400
Uh-oh. Busted!

618
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,550
The truth is my A/C isn’t really broken.

619
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,810
I just wanted to use yours.

620
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,100
Ha!

621
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:05,880
I figured as much.

622
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,640
Good thing I came prepared.

623
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:10,000
I even brought an extra pair of boxers.

624
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,100
Hey!

625
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,110
Hold up.

626
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,350
Close the curtain first!

627
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:24,600
Nope.

628
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:25,970
Just cover your eyes.

629
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:36,450
Oh,

630
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,370
this is what you want?

631
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:43,800
This time, I’m not letting you win.

632
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:50,980
Hey!

633
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,780
Is this how you want it?

634
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:58,430
Heh?

635
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,100
Jay!

636
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,070
Jay!

637
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,090
Jay!

638
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:06,980
Jay, come on!

639
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:09,980
Jay!

640
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:38,100
I’m sorry

641
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,600
for making you listen to all
that drama for so long.

642
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,990
Ooh, new car?

643
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:50,100
It’s one of the other cars from my family.

644
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:51,710
Hop in.

645
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:17,030
Hey,

646
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,210
can I charge my phone?

647
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:23,160
I’m using wireless charging,

648
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:25,800
but there are other ports too.

649
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:26,970
Here,

650
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:28,570
inside here,

651
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,250
and in the back.

652
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,970
Take your pick.

653
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,100
Oh,

654
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,430
there’s one more.

655
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,470
Huh? Where?

656
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,370
That’s for phone charging.

657
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:54,320
But this one...

658
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:57,510
is for charging my hand.

659
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:06,870
If I’d known you were this clingy,

660
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:08,720
I would’ve asked you out ages ago.

661
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:14,320
Thanks for opening up about your brother.

662
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:19,020
You can tell me anything from now on, okay?

663
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,710
I don’t want you carrying it all by yourself.

664
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:29,800
Now I’m not sure anymore who's recharging who.

665
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:33,900
Let’s go.

666
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,360
Hope you have a great day today.

667
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:16,020
Mm-hmm.

668
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:17,180
Wait for me, okay? I’ll be back soon.

669
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:18,240
It’s all set now.

670
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:19,190
Room's ready.

671
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,050
Cake’s ready.
HBD DR.JAY, THE WEIRDO

672
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:20,850
Shit!

673
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,380
I forgot the candles!

674
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,300
You're getting candles for Jay’s birthday cake?

675
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:24,960
Captain.

676
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:28,240
I kind of figured something was up
when you asked me to teach you how to bake.

677
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:29,560
I just didn’t want you to feel bad.

678
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:31,200
The one who would feel bad isn’t me.

679
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,910
It’s the birthday boy.

680
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:33,620
Sant.

681
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,350
Is being with me really that good?

682
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,720
Why are you asking that?

683
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,990
Someone like me isn’t good enough
to make anyone happy.

684
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,020
You deserve someone better than me.

685
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,850
Are you saying you want to break up with me?
