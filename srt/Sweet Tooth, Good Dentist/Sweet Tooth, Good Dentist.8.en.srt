1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,760
Why haven't you asked him
to be your boyfriend yet?

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,990
I already asked him out once and he rejected me.

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,670
This time he has to ask me instead.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,260
Ah, so that’s how you think.

5
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,980
That’s why you didn’t dare
ask me to be your boyfriend.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,110
I want to say I like you.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,600
If it’s just the two of us,

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,600
I’ll do whatever you say.

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,130
Doctor, how is her condition?

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,360
The patient has acid reflux,
which is causing chest tightness.

11
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,880
We've already given antacids,

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,070
and we'll do a thorough check-up tomorrow.

13
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,190
That’s the miracle of the Venerable Father
who keeps danger away!

14
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,610
You should give credit to the meds he injected.

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,020
But there’s one thing I’m concerned about.

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,840
She keeps insisting on going home.

17
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,700
Please take care of that for me.

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,690
Thank you.

19
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,849
Why should I stay?

20
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:05,800
It’s a waste of money,

21
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,220
and I’m fine now.

22
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,990
You said the same thing before we came.

23
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,370
Don’t be stubborn, Grandma.

24
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,510
Go talk to Grandpa.

25
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,250
He’s really worried about me.

26
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,150
He won’t let me stay here alone.

27
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,850
He went back home already.

28
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:18,610
What?!

29
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,350
Behave yourself, okay?

30
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,910
I’ll visit again tomorrow.

31
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,910
No way!

32
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,400
I said it’s a waste of money.

33
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,930
Do you even know how much this room costs?

34
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,820
Mom, I’ll take care of that.

35
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,650
I haven’t seen you in ages.

36
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,300
You’ve grown so much, Sant.

37
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,430
Mom, I’m hungry.

38
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,610
Is there anything to eat?

39
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,310
It’s on the table.

40
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,170
I prepared it for you.

41
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,160
It’s Sali cake!

42
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:08,780
Hello?

43
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,620
I’ve finished packing.

44
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,500
Are you sure I can’t bring my son?

45
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,740
Grandma said if anything emergency came up,

46
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,050
we should call your mom back to check on her.

47
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,980
Here, I bought you some snacks.

48
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,620
These are from abroad.

49
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,680
Whoa. Thank you.

50
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,410
Have you eaten yet, Dad?

51
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,600
Let’s go get something to eat.

52
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,570
It’s on me.

53
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,460
Hotpot or sushi?

54
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,470
Uncle Sant, what do you feel like eating?

55
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:04,960
I’m not hungry.

56
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,820
Eat without me.

57
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,070
You said you weren’t hungry, didn’t you?

58
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,170
I’m not hungry.

59
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,470
Go ahead and eat.

60
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,360
Are you sure?

61
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,209
Yeah.

62
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,180
Okay.

63
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,250
Do you want some?

64
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,770
All the yummy stuff's gone already.

65
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,900
You took too long to decide.

66
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,610
Here you are.

67
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,930
There's one can left.

68
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,030
Well...

69
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,140
it happened a long time ago.

70
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,140
Maybe she really came back
to apologize this time.

71
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,890
You think I never gave her a chance?

72
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,670
Actually,

73
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,170
I know she has been
keeping in touch with Grandpa.

74
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:43,200
One day, I secretly used his phone to text her.

75
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,300
That was the day I told her

76
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,950
I won first prize in
the garland contest of the province.

77
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,800
I hoped she'd show up,

78
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,740
but, in the end,

79
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,460
she didn’t.

80
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,980
Deep down, I thought maybe life was hard for her,
and that’s why she didn’t dare to come.

81
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,890
But it’s turned out,

82
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,980
she’s been living comfortably all along.

83
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,910
Do you still think I should forgive her?

84
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:00,460
Auntie, are you looking for something?

85
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,400
My watch.

86
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,270
It’s the silver one.

87
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,260
I have no idea where I left it.

88
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,430
It’s expensive too.

89
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,500
Let me help you find it.

90
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,700
Are you Sant’s friend?

91
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,440
Oh, I’m his senior.

92
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,340
Sant came to me for dental work.

93
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:29,810
I see.

94
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,900
And how’s he doing now?

95
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,990
Well…

96
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,770
I really shouldn’t be asking that.

97
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,250
Showing up out of nowhere like this,

98
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,280
of course, I think he’s not okay.

99
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,700
Is this the one?

100
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,160
Yes!

101
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:11,870
That’s it.

102
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,470
Thank you.

103
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,210
I remember that model’s a limited edition, right?

104
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,870
My mom has the same one.

105
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,200
Yes, I got it when I was traveling in Europe.

106
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,440
Oh, but that model has a lot of fakes.

107
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,100
The way to tell is to flip it over.

108
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,980
If there’s an engraved logo on the back, it’s real.

109
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:53,290
Actually, Auntie, you don’t even need to flip it.

110
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,970
If you bought it in Europe,

111
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,910
it should be real no matter what.

112
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,480
Or what you showed us all along

113
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,410
isn’t the truth?

114
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,980
Sant's dad passed away when he was little.

115
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,660
I raised him all by myself.

116
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:31,570
There’s not much to do out here
in the countryside.

117
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:39,200
One day, a man asked me
to move to Bangkok with him.

118
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,560
He promised to open a beauty salon for me,

119
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,900
but only if I left Sant behind.

120
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,600
I really wanted to talk to Sant,

121
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,760
but everything happened so fast.

122
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,610
Back then, all I thought was

123
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,340
I’d go work, save up,

124
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,620
and bring him to live with me.

125
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,200
But that salon he promised?

126
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,070
He gambled it all away on online betting.

127
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,800
Then he left me for another woman,

128
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,220
and dumped all his debt on me.

129
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:40,200
My maid’s salary could only cover the interest.

130
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,700
I couldn’t afford to go back to my son.

131
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,820
Maybe Sant doesn’t need all that.

132
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,870
Maybe he just wants his same old mom back.

133
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,270
At the very least,

134
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:06,000
I think he deserves to know
the truth about his mom.

135
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,980
So what if he knows?

136
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,170
Just carrying the burden here
is hard enough for him.

137
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,970
Why would I add myself to the load?

138
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,160
And is this how you want him
to understand things?

139
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:26,880
To remember that

140
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:31,600
his mother left him to live a comfortable life?

141
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,560
At least,

142
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,970
he won’t have to keep worrying.

143
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,700
This is the only thing I can do for him.

144
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,010
Onew, did you see Yada?

145
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,500
She came to borrow my bike.

146
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,340
I’m not sure where she's going.

147
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,430
The bike?

148
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,750
You already found out, right?

149
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,260
Yeah,

150
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,990
in the end, she broke up with me.

151
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,730
I kind of saw it coming,

152
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,300
so I brought this along.

153
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,860
I promised her I wouldn’t drink.

154
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:09,900
Okay.

155
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:15,860
Whoa…

156
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,030
Whoa.

157
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,700
Can I ask?

158
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,770
What did you guys argue about?

159
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,400
She just went back to her ex, a guy.

160
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,950
How did you find out?

161
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,370
Did she tell you?

162
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,800
She posted photos of them together.

163
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,500
Do I even have to ask?

164
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:58,170
When we were together,
I knew she still hadn’t gotten over her ex.

165
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,900
She used to date a guy before me,

166
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,170
so it’s hard not to compare.

167
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,700
So what’s the big deal, huh?

168
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,270
When we were together,

169
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,390
I was always worried...

170
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,500
if I could live up to her ex.

171
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:29,060
He had something that no matter how hard I tried,

172
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,210
I couldn’t be.

173
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,300
Everyone’s been telling me
to go back to dating guys.

174
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,370
But here’s the funny part, you know?

175
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,570
All the guys I dated...

176
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,230
were scared I’d eventually
go back to dating girls.

177
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,580
But what can I do?

178
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,790
I made my choice.

179
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,200
I think

180
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,410
you just haven’t found the right person yet.

181
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,500
It’s hard, but don’t give up.

182
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,700
There’s definitely someone good waiting for you.

183
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,800
Yeah!

184
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,080
I’ll just go ahead and announce
to the world I’m single!

185
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,650
Hey, be careful.

186
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,290
The signal isn’t working.

187
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,330
Back then, your mom tried to contact you.

188
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,530
But it was I who didn’t let her.

189
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,350
I wanted your mom to feel guilty for leaving us.

190
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,830
I’m sorry, Sant.

191
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,280
Why are you apologizing?

192
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,800
I’m happy I got to live with you.

193
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,350
No matter how hard things were,

194
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,200
you never left me.

195
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,500
The doctor told me this morning
I’ve got acid reflux

196
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,119
because of gallstones.

197
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,000
Surgery could fix it,

198
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,339
but I’m not sure...

199
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,300
my body can handle it at my age.

200
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,500
Grandma, you’re strong.

201
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,740
That’s nothing. You’ll be fine.

202
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:49,810
Sant,

203
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,060
promise me you’ll forgive your mom.

204
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,140
I don’t want to leave with any regrets.

205
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,450
No, don’t say things like that.

206
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,650
Sant.

207
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,000
I’m not promising anything.

208
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,980
Let’s talk when you get better.

209
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:20,720
Sant.

210
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:23,540
Ouch!

211
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:24,690
Ouch!

212
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,300
Grandma?

213
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:26,300
Grandma?!

214
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,830
Grandma?!

215
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,850
Someone, please help my grandma!

216
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:30,940
Grandma!

217
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,400
How is her condition?

218
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,880
The doctor said she’s got a blood infection.

219
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,100
She needs emergency surgery.

220
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,580
Grandpa!

221
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,400
Grandpa!

222
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,360
Dad!

223
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,710
- Dad.
- Grandpa, get up.

224
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:48,400
Be careful.

225
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,300
I called out to her myself.

226
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,180
Grandpa, sit down.

227
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,980
Everyone’s scared of losing their mom.

228
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,910
No one knows that better than you.

229
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,570
No, I’m not going.

230
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,280
I’m waiting for my mom.

231
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,540
Mom! Mom!

232
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,850
Where are you?

233
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,560
She didn’t show up to console me that day either.

234
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,310
Hold on.

235
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,310
Do you want to be like her?

236
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,760
If you leave now,

237
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,530
you’re no different from her.

238
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:22,900
Grandma’s strong.

239
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,100
She won’t leave us that easily.

240
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,160
The surgery’s done.

241
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,850
Grandma said the doctor is safe now.

242
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,630
You’re so excited you’re mixing up
your words, Grandpa.

243
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,900
Haha, I meant the doctor said she’s okay now.

244
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,070
I said it correctly already.

245
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:07,390
Grandma,

246
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:08,900
I brought you some oranges.

247
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,840
How are you feeling?

248
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,060
I'm okay now.

249
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,030
The doctor said I can go home
the day after tomorrow.

250
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,400
Aww, and here I thought I’d get an inheritance.

251
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,980
Turns out, it’s just debt. Do you want it?

252
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,970
Have you talked to your mom?

253
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,370
Not really.

254
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,760
You promised me already.

255
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,810
I’m feeling a lot better now.

256
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,560
So now it’s your turn to keep your promise.

257
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,430
Any food? Any food?

258
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:58,080
I’ll treat everyone tonight to celebrate
Grandma’s coming back home.

259
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,100
Tell me what you want to eat.

260
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,240
Sant, your mom already left.

261
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,560
I know.

262
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,480
I didn’t buy any for her anyway.

263
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,460
If we hurry, maybe we can still catch her.

264
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:23,950
This is my family.

265
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,950
I can take care of it myself.

266
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,490
No one else needs to get involved.

267
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,630
Sant,

268
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,060
her life isn’t as easy as you think.

269
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,810
She didn’t tell you

270
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,500
because she didn’t want you to worry.

271
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,800
You think I didn’t know?

272
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,930
Just holding her hand, I knew.

273
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,710
No rich woman’s hands are that rough.

274
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:02,340
She left me behind because she hit rock bottom.

275
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,980
I’m her son.

276
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,290
Didn’t she ever think how hard it was for me?

277
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,360
I had no mom to cheer me on like other kids.

278
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,300
Huh?

279
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:21,700
Sant,

280
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,270
she might not have reached out,

281
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,180
but she was never truly gone.

282
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,500
She was always there for you.

283
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,370
every time you went live.

284
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,900
Hello, all my fellow cavity crew!

285
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,860
This is “Hungry while sleeping,
Yawning when waking up!”

286
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,130
This adorable Sant is here to snack for you!

287
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,770
If you’re enjoying the stream,

288
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,400
don’t forget to send hearts to cheer me on!

289
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,740
E-Wen, the leader of the cavity crew
fandom sent you 1,000 hearts.

290
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,560
I’ll let her ask me one more question then.

291
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,500
Don’t forget to say hi when you join in.

292
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,980
Today, I’m eating my croissant.

293
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,280
It’s from my regular shop

294
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,400
that I’ve been to often
since I’ve just moved to Bangkok.

295
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:20,990
Welcome back to my channel,

296
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,450
“Hungry While Sleeping, Yawning When Waking Up!”

297
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,770
It’s this same boy, Sant,

298
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,520
in a brand-new location
with a very special guest, Dr. Jay!

299
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,830
Dr.Jway!

300
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,780
Anyone who has joined,
feel free to say hi in the chat!

301
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,260
E-wen, our top fan, sent 100 hearts already.

302
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,060
Thank you!

303
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,230
Thank you!

304
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,960
Hey, are you introducing
your boyfriend to us, Sant?

305
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,240
Eh? How did he know?

306
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:46,820
That’s right.

307
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,410
She named herself "E-Wen"

308
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,380
because it fits

309
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,980
since she believed that’s
how you should call a mom like her.

310
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:06,840
Hey,

311
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,780
can you take me to see my mom?

312
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,680
It’s full.

313
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,240
We can go now.

314
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:27,240
Excuse me.

315
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,820
Did the Bangkok bus leave already?

316
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:30,980
Just left a minute ago.

317
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:32,900
Next one’s in two hours.

318
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,810
Come on, Sant. Let’s go home.

319
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,240
No. I’m not going.

320
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,850
I’m waiting for my mom.

321
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,520
She’s not coming back.

322
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,750
She has to.

323
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,350
She has to come back for me.

324
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,370
I said, go home.

325
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,340
No way!

326
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,620
I’m not going.

327
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,340
I’m waiting for her.

328
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,710
Mom! Mom!

329
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,770
Where are you?

330
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,100
Mom!

331
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:43,760
Sant!

332
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:45,530
Sant!

333
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,380
What’s wrong?

334
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,320
Mom!

335
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:50,880
I’m right here.

336
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,600
I’m here.

337
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,440
Mom!

338
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,650
Don’t cry.

339
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,160
I’m right here. I’m here.

340
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,080
Mom, I love you so, so much.

341
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,840
Don’t cry, sweetie.

342
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,670
Good thing she didn’t make it in time.

343
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,070
Otherwise we’d have a sobbing kid.

344
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:46,910
Who?

345
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,400
Who’s crying?!

346
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,780
Whoa.

347
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,880
Who let you wear someone else’s shirt?

348
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,810
Grandpa did.

349
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,400
I said I was cold last night,

350
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,460
so he gave it to me.

351
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:07,920
The smell of the old owner is good, though.

352
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,530
Then keep it.

353
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,630
It’s yours now.

354
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,840
Don’t give it back.

355
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:18,180
Thanks.

356
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,920
Oh, before she left,

357
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,880
your mom gave me this.

358
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,910
She said it’s your favorite,

359
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:28,960
but I doubt it.

360
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,500
She probably remembered wrong.

361
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,460
Hey, wait.

362
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,750
This is the taste I missed.

363
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,340
It’s so sweet!

364
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:50,600
Eh?

365
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,990
Didn’t you say you don’t like it?

366
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:55,820
I changed my mind.

367
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,020
It’s good.

368
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,070
If you don’t believe me, try it.

369
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,700
Nope.

370
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,910
You know I don’t like desserts.

371
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,670
Are you sure?

372
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,320
You think I don’t dare to?

373
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:20,600
Oops.

374
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,980
ONE YEAR AGO

375
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:01,560
Dude,

376
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,300
I’m not ready for a relationship now.

377
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,300
Meeting her will just waste her time.

378
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,830
Hey, give it a try.

379
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,110
From what I’ve seen,

380
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,900
she’s actually pretty sweet.

381
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,410
And so what?

382
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,760
No matter how cute…

383
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,560
She’s playful too.

384
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,100
Most importantly, she loves sweets,
just like you used to.

385
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,410
Hello? Jay, are you even listening?

386
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,880
Yeah, I’m listening.

387
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,770
What’s her name again?

388
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,300
So, that day,

389
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,800
you liked me first, didn’t you?

390
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:38,850
Who liked you?

391
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,760
I was just glancing.

392
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,690
Mmm...

393
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,100
you liked me.

394
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,980
But you went up to talk to the girl next to me

395
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,600
because you were shy.

396
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,620
Stop it.

397
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:58,760
Well, you must’ve liked me too.

398
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,300
Otherwise, why would you go with me after that?

399
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,540
I was in it for the money, obviously.

400
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:05,750
Swear on it then.

401
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,740
If you’re lying, may you get a cavity.

402
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:11,610
I don’t know!

403
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:12,620
Who remembers stuff like that?

404
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,660
It was so long ago.

405
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,300
It’s okay if you don’t remember.

406
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,830
Let’s go on our first date again.

407
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,100
What do you say?

408
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,560
Whoa, who’s this stylish guy?

409
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,600
Give me back my friend!

410
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,080
Gugg,

411
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,000
I’ve been hiding something from you.

412
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,070
What is it? You’re scaring me.

413
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,810
Well,

414
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,500
I’m dating Jay.

415
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,580
Sant! You said it?

416
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:04,680
Nice one, friend.

417
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,160
Wait. Why are you acting weird today?

418
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,110
You usually say you already knew,

419
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,110
or like, “Finally, you told me!”

420
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,700
You’ve watched too many movies.

421
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,300
I mean it.

422
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,530
I didn’t want to hide it anymore.

423
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,350
Yeah?

424
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,040
So if I saw a photo of you two kissing cheeks,

425
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:18,970
I’d believe you.

426
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,120
Who’d even have that?

427
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,470
Exactly. Who would?

428
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:22,360
No one would

429
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,760
because you’re not even dating!

430
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:30,700
I’ve got to go.

431
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,230
See you, bestie.

432
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,630
Bye!

433
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,630
Bye.

434
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,550
Look how happy you are.

435
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:50,460
I’m heading out now.

436
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,470
Okay.

437
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,900
I’m almost done getting dressed.

438
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,980
See you there.

439
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,700
Can I ask you something?

440
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,600
Why aren’t we going together?

441
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,270
If we did, it wouldn’t feel like our first date.

442
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,680
I told you

443
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,200
we’re recreating our first date today.

444
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,940
Whatever makes you happy.

445
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,190
See you.

446
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:19,550
Auntie.

447
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:22,630
Auntie?!

448
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:25,150
Yes, you.

449
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,540
This dorm’s management
loves nitpicking tenants,

450
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,770
but never does their own job.

451
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,980
I suggest parking elsewhere.

452
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,420
This is just a friendly warning.

453
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,300
I’m off.

454
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,020
Bye now!

455
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,680
Oh, Jay!

456
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:51,810
Mom?

457
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,500
Here’s some water.

458
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,200
Just now one of the tenants,
I don't know which room,

459
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,440
called me “Auntie.”

460
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,200
Hey? What the heck?

461
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,880
Should I check the CCTV and have them
kicked out of the dorm, Mom?

462
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,940
No, no.

463
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,980
How have you been doing, Jay?

464
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,070
Great.

465
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:14,310
What brings you here today, Mom?

466
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,719
I was bored

467
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,760
and I only have you, Jay.

468
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,730
Can’t I come visit once in a while?

469
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:25,650
Of course, you can.

470
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:29,540
But maybe let me know first next time.

471
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:30,900
Why?

472
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:32,960
Hold on.

473
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:35,310
What’s with the outfit? Where are you going?

474
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:40,949
Uh... I'm, I'm… going…

475
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,820
Going?

476
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,570
I'm going to my old school to help out
with career day with a friend.

477
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,110
Which friend?

478
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,530
Da.

479
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,040
You know, the one whose number is next to mine.

480
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:55,460
What time will you be back?

481
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,040
Around 7 PM.

482
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,840
Is something wrong?

483
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,440
Why so many questions about me all of a sudden?

484
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,960
Nothing!

485
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,370
I’m just worried about you.

486
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:07,100
Can’t I even ask a few questions, huh?

487
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,600
Of course you can, Mom.

488
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,490
I’ve only got one mom, you know.

489
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,970
I’m happy you care.

490
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,650
You're going to your old school, right?

491
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:18,690
I’ll give you a ride.

492
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:20,740
What?

493
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,870
Can’t I give you a ride?

494
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,300
Can’t I, huh?

495
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,270
Sure, sure.

496
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,990
With that smile,

497
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,100
how can I not fall for you?

498
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,460
Gugg, what are you doing here?

499
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:22,040
I was nearby and brought your favorite chicken.

500
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,600
Eat with me.

501
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:26,630
I can't finish it alone.

502
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,600
All my friends ditched me to go on dates.

503
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:29,700
Sure.

504
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,560
Don’t you want to do that too?

505
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:37,520
Huh?

506
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,990
I mean, go out.

507
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,310
Oh, well… yeah, I want to.

508
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,400
There’s nothing more to do this semester,

509
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,510
but I don’t know where to go.

510
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,700
Where do you usually hang out on your day off?

511
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,250
The library,

512
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,810
the lab,

513
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,730
or tutoring sessions.

514
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,500
And when you had a partner,

515
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:01,800
where’d you guys go?

516
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,610
When I had a partner?

517
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,880
We mostly just studied at the library.

518
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,900
Maybe an outdoor movie at most.

519
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,540
Whoa, you can’t live like that forever.

520
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,400
Let me show you something fun.

521
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,400
I’ll go change.

522
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:16,660
Meet you outside the ward, okay?

523
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:17,830
Bye-bye. See you.

524
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:18,670
Bye.

525
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,350
Hello?

526
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,700
Where are you?

527
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:37,900
I’m sorry, Sant.

528
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,420
Well, I’m…

529
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,120
I’m…

530
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,510
I’m here.

531
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,160
I thought something came up.

532
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:52,970
Something did come up.

533
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,080
My mom suddenly showed up at the dorm.

534
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,050
And how did you get away?

535
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,200
Someone randomly parked in Madam's spot,

536
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,500
but don’t worry.

537
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,900
We locked the wheels already.

538
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,200
Uncle, that’s my mom’s car.

539
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,020
Oh crap!

540
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,020
I’m so sorry.

541
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,500
I didn’t know you had more than one car, Madam.

542
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,640
I’ll take care of it right away.

543
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,150
Yeah. Hurry up.

544
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:29,100
Which key?

545
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,880
- Ugh, it’s not this one either.
- Come on!

546
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,210
I’ll find it myself. Give it to me.

547
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:33,960
You don’t know a thing.

548
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,610
Why did you bring so many keys?

549
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,420
I'm getting fired for sure.

550
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,260
Hey, help my mom.

551
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:39,960
Hurry up.

552
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:40,540
Yes, sir.

553
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,980
- You too.
- Yes, sir.

554
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,170
How come you messed up your job like this, huh?

555
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,500
My mom is not like the others, you know!

556
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:45,850
This is nuts.

557
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,770
The whole thing is crazy!

558
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,490
I texted her, saying I have an errand.

559
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,290
From now on, it’s just the two of us.

560
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,050
This outfit… this place…

561
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,150
It really feels like that day again, doesn’t it?

562
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,100
Not quite.

563
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:13,730
It’s missing the flower.

564
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,300
Go on a date with me, will you?

565
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:26,580
♪ You're like a magic potion,
you're my special one ♪

566
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,840
♪ Not a pill or syrup, but the right stuff ♪

567
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:39,220
♪ No fever late at night,
but you’re the cure that I need, all right ♪

568
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:42,790
♪ Whenever I see you, I feel better than fine ♪

569
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:48,200
♪ Magic potion, you're my magic potion ♪

570
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,480
♪ La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la ♪

571
00:39:58,810 --> 00:39:59,920
Seeing this reminds me of that day.

572
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:00,660
Why?

573
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:01,700
Are you afraid I’ll ditch you again?

574
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:02,520
What’s there to be afraid of?

575
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,280
Nope.

576
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,810
Finally we got to wear matching shirts
like you wanted, huh?

577
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,110
Who calls them matching shirts?

578
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,710
Since you know me this well,

579
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,270
we’re a perfect match.

580
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,220
Dude, Jay totally played it cool with me.

581
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,400
He acted like he didn’t care about his birthday,

582
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,100
so I planned a huge surprise.

583
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,590
Let’s see if he can keep his cool after this.

584
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,140
Tadaaa!

585
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:20,680
Wow!

586
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:23,760
Jay! Jay!

587
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,590
Jay, wake up!

588
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,970
What happened last night?

589
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,900
Why are we like this now?
