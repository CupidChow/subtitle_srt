1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,160
Uncle, you’re mistaken.

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,680
Jay doesn't eat desserts.

3
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,220
Who's the one getting it wrong?

4
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,660
Jay used to stop by every day.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,390
Can I sleep here tonight?

6
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,000
Huh?!

7
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,270
Actually, you’ve remembered it
all this time, right?

8
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,220
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,300
You asked me to date you.

10
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,570
You treated my teeth.

11
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,500
Why did you do all these things?

12
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,010
Or is it because you really have feelings for me?

13
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,330
I really like you

14
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,800
until... you dumped me.

15
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:25,830
Eh?

16
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,880
Look at you crushing
my tiny heart into pieces.

17
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,340
Do you think I’ll continue
having feelings for you?

18
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,240
Aren’t you too full of yourself?

19
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,620
I thought I’d have to close
this legendary shop for good.

20
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,270
This shop is way too big for me to run by myself.

21
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,150
I’ll need some help.

22
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:33,820
The tooth I filled for you last time…

23
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,330
Long time no see.

24
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,690
It’s just six years, five months, and twelve days.

25
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:51,770
Even if you got it wrong, I wouldn’t know.

26
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,900
I'm back to continue
the dream the two of us shared.

27
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,180
Now, I’m taking over Uncle’s dessert shop.

28
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,910
Congratulations, buddy.

29
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:07,800
Head back already.

30
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,699
I’ve got patients to check on.

31
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:14,800
I knew it.

32
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,020
You’re not going back anyway.

33
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,660
But no matter what,

34
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,300
I still hope you’re my first customer.

35
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,200
Here you are.

36
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,650
If you change your mind,

37
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,390
my shop always welcomes you.

38
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:58,640
Dude.

39
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,000
Hey? Jay?

40
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,900
I figured that one day,

41
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,610
my dessert would change your mind,

42
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,280
but I didn’t expect it to be this soon.

43
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:13,990
Captain.

44
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:14,900
Yes?

45
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,240
You forgot the dessert

46
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,810
and gave me the AC remote instead!

47
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:25,500
Hey.

48
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,790
Thanks a lot, Jay.

49
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,720
I haven't slept with the AC on
for three days already.

50
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,740
You? Yeah right,
someone like you never changed.

51
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:37,810
Listen to me.

52
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,660
You can’t run a shop on your own.

53
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,230
Just don’t.

54
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:46,800
Yeah,

55
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,600
thanks a lot for the warning.

56
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,300
I know I can’t do it alone.

57
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,930
That’s why I made a post looking for help.

58
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:57,280
Hello,

59
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,400
is this place hiring?

60
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,500
I saw the post on your page.

61
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,300
Yes.

62
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,950
I see.

63
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,600
Since I restricted you
from doing the live stream,

64
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,190
you came to apply for a job here?

65
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,420
Eh?

66
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,100
You know each other?

67
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,160
I know him well.

68
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,700
He’s my patient.

69
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,650
This is Jay, my friend.

70
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,200
Are you Captain who used to
run a dessert review channel?

71
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,110
Eh?

72
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,590
You know my channel?

73
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:49,690
Of course, I do.

74
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,150
I consider your channel
the number one in my heart.

75
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,430
Whoa. Thanks a lot.

76
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,030
When can you start working?

77
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,920
Hey, hold on.

78
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,350
After a short conversation
and you’re getting along well,

79
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,490
you’re hiring him right away?

80
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,630
You have to check his work experience, don’t you?

81
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,210
He just enjoys desserts,

82
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,090
and that doesn’t mean he can sell them,

83
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,830
just so you know.

84
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,200
If you're not confident in me,

85
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,060
should I show you how I can sell?

86
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,400
This is Dr. Jay,

87
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,060
the dentist that most dentists
wouldn’t recommend,

88
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,900
unless…you like someone unusual,

89
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,660
full of himself,

90
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,870
and talking to him gives you a headache.

91
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,760
Then this is the dentist I’d recommend!

92
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:43,750
I really like it!

93
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:44,810
I bought into the idea.

94
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,080
You can start working today.

95
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:47,940
Huh?

96
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,250
Hello.

97
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,560
I was just dropping off some food around here,

98
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,020
so I picked up some snacks for you.

99
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,320
Thanks though,

100
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,560
but you don’t have to next time.

101
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,980
Oh, well,

102
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,710
I’m actually looking up
information to write a script.

103
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,100
I’m not sure if you’re free.

104
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,310
I didn’t bring the printer cable
to connect to my phone.

105
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,500
Oh, this model can print from your phone.

106
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,500
You just need to download the app.

107
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,080
Do you want me to do it for you?

108
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,230
The app’s downloaded.

109
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,060
You can go ahead and print now.

110
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:41,890
Thanks.

111
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,120
She’s using a pink phone case.

112
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,800
I don’t think she’s a tomboy.

113
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,680
But she wears some manly sneakers too.

114
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,620
But she did choose to print
a photo of a handsome guy,

115
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,200
so I guess I kind of fit her stereotype, huh?

116
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,200
By the way,

117
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,020
what kind of information are you looking for?

118
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,380
Uh, how do I explain this?

119
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:35,530
It’s about two characters who just met,

120
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,020
and one of them wants to know

121
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,870
what the other person’s sexual preference is.

122
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,850
But they’re not sure how to ask
without being rude, right?

123
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:44,960
Exactly.

124
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,620
Or is it something that shouldn’t even be asked?

125
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,560
I don’t know about others,

126
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,570
but for me, I think
discussing preferences is normal.

127
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,710
If we’re close,
it’s something we can talk about.

128
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,670
For me, I don’t mind
when people ask if I’m a tomboy.

129
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,510
How do you usually respond?

130
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:12,230
Hey!

131
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,840
I’ve already looked up the information

132
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,900
about the bold senior girl.

133
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,510
How do you usually respond?

134
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,700
I’m not a tomboy.

135
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,760
Despite my look, I used to date a guy.

136
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,020
I think you need to rewrite the conflict.

137
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,110
We can change it to
her already having a boyfriend.

138
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,780
She’s single.

139
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,760
If she’s dating someone,
I must know about it.

140
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,539
Now what?

141
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,710
You were playing hard to get,

142
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:42,970
and now your friend has taken him away.

143
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,220
They’re just working together.

144
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,320
Or probably not?

145
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,840
There, there.

146
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,170
It’s alright.

147
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,300
- Hey.
- Yeah?

148
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,770
What do the characters
who are in a relationship usually do?

149
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,930
If they're a couple,

150
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,060
they tend to be more physical
with each other than usual.

151
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,620
It’s alright.

152
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,410
Also, they often wear matching outfits.

153
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,310
Doesn't the doctor have to wear
the same outfit too?

154
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,960
And most importantly,

155
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,600
there will be those sweet moments

156
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,250
that someone who’s not a couple can't replace.

157
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,100
Damn, I told her I didn’t want blood,

158
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,270
but she gave me a whole lot.

159
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,190
It's a waste.

160
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:35,820
Eat it for me.

161
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,090
No way!

162
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,790
I told you to open your mouth properly.

163
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,730
Ugh!!!!

164
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,600
I brought some of
Captain's shop's desserts for you.

165
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,070
Why are you sitting here alone,
acting in a music video?

166
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,930
Yada already has a boyfriend.

167
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,610
It’s alright, buddy.

168
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,620
I’m here for you.

169
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,140
She’s dating Jay.

170
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,570
I saw her feed him.

171
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,210
One's handsome, and the other's beautiful.

172
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,860
They're that close,

173
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,800
and I couldn't figure it out?

174
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,430
I'm such an idiot!

175
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,440
You aren’t an idiot!

176
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,700
Who could have known?

177
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,610
We need to blame the ones
who already have a partner

178
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,100
but still act all nice to others.

179
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,480
We're not toys, you know!

180
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,030
Is it you and me who are heartbroken?

181
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,700
It's me!

182
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,700
I sympathize with you.

183
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,520
It’s alright.

184
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,290
It’s alright, buddy.

185
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:06,830
Fine.

186
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,570
There, there.

187
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,760
One Stir-fried Thai Holy Basil
with chicken, please.

188
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,170
This shop only sells desserts and drinks.

189
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,990
Oh, really? I’m sorry!

190
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,640
In that case, I'll have one Americano.

191
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:31,950
Dark roast or light roast?

192
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:32,780
Light.

193
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,850
Small or large?

194
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,500
Large.

195
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,410
Less sweet or extra sweet?

196
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,540
Extra sweet.

197
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,500
Aha, I know you were going to
crack a joke by saying

198
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:40,460
it’s sold out.

199
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,120
Am I right?

200
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,240
Nope, but I’m not selling it to you!

201
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,710
If you want it, go to another shop.

202
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,370
Hey, I'm a customer, you know!

203
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,520
Hey!

204
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,120
Sant!

205
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,390
Hmph, serves you right.

206
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,250
Your boss is definitely going to scold you.

207
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,030
I did it!

208
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,380
Yesterday, you told me that

209
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,510
our shop only has the same old menu from Uncle.

210
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,050
So today, I created a new menu.

211
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,430
Here’s the Sweet Fish Sauce Croissant.

212
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,400
Is that even going to work?

213
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,450
I’ve only ever heard of
sweet fish sauce with mango.

214
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,250
Croissants are my favorite.

215
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,740
I've traveled around trying them everywhere.

216
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,730
This one, just by looking at it,

217
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,780
I can tell it’s delicious.

218
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,400
You’re buttering up your boss too much.

219
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,900
Do you think we should post it for sale now?

220
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,710
Oh, this one falls for
compliments too easily, huh?

221
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,810
Other shops,

222
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,290
when they come up with a recipe,
it takes them years.

223
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,080
This is just the first day.

224
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,270
It’s not going to be…

225
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:36,970
Delicious!

226
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,120
It’s like a croissant
with salted caramel sauce,

227
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,190
but richer.

228
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,600
Plus, it has a subtle herbal scent,
like it’s infused.

229
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,140
What ingredients did you put in this?

230
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,730
I added about 20 ingredients,

231
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,940
and it took me over 30 steps to finish.

232
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,300
But don’t worry, I won’t forget the recipe.
I’ve written it all down.

233
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,180
Here.

234
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,810
SWEET FISH SAUCE CROISSANT RECIPE
1. CROISSANT

235
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:01,650
Eh?!

236
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,600
I think I deleted it already.

237
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,140
But you still remember the recipe, right?

238
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,210
I do.

239
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,390
If I just try making it randomly,
I’ll figure it out anyway.

240
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,030
I think this is not yet right.

241
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,510
It’s not the same as the first one you made.

242
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,780
Come on.

243
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,160
I shouldn’t have lost the recipe.

244
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,710
It’s okay.

245
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,910
We can continue tomorrow.

246
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,220
No,

247
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,880
I won’t stop until it’s done.

248
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,170
And if you’re not stopping,

249
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,120
then I’ll wait to taste it!

250
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,980
Hey, get me a coffee.

251
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,630
You’re still here?

252
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,160
We’re already close for today. Head back already.

253
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,050
I see.

254
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,370
Or are you kicking me out

255
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,020
because you just want to be alone together?

256
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,350
Gotcha.

257
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,680
You’re imagining things too far, huh?

258
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,530
If we didn't know each other before,

259
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,090
I’d probably think you’re jealous of me.

260
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,480
Fine. I’ll head back.

261
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:57,750
Are you alright, Sant?

262
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,190
Ouch.

263
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,730
Oh, thank you.

264
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,340
I hope I’m going to succeed this time.

265
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:16,810
Yeah.

266
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,310
That's an even bigger mistake.

267
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,480
Jway…

268
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,140
Jay doesn't eat desserts.

269
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,400
Who's the one getting it wrong?

270
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:34,170
Jay used to stop by every day.

271
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,640
If you don't believe me, just look at that.

272
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,280
As soon as classes ended,

273
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,380
he'd be at the table,

274
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,940
filming reviews for his channel.

275
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,850
Captain.

276
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:46,790
Yeah?

277
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,480
I’ve heard that

278
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,510
Jay once owned a dessert review channel.

279
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,610
Is that true?

280
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,620
Yes.

281
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,890
We did it together.

282
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,450
You two are complete opposites!

283
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,800
How could you end up as besties?

284
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:05,300
That’s completely not true, Sant.

285
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:10,200
We’re close because
we share things in common.

286
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,020
Uncle Pun, hello.

287
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,920
Uncle Pun, hello.

288
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,080
Hi.

289
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,610
One Mango Bingsu, please.

290
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,630
I’ve only got one left.

291
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,500
Share it, okay?

292
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,280
The other items here are delicious too.

293
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,970
If they’re really good,
you should order something for yourself.

294
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,160
Eh?

295
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,080
If talking nicely doesn’t work,

296
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,980
then I guess we’ve got a problem, huh?

297
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:02,980
Right. Bring it on!

298
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,140
I think

299
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:40,630
we should eat it first,

300
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,320
or it will melt.

301
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:42,660
That’s a good idea.

302
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,330
Let go.

303
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,190
You let go first.

304
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,640
Let’s count one, two, three and then let go.

305
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,800
- One.
- Okay.

306
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,480
Two.

307
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,070
Three.

308
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,280
He used ripe Kaew Kamin mango

309
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,860
for a hint of sourness

310
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,800
to cut through the richness
of the Hokkaido milk.

311
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,210
Plus, the sauce amount matches the ice,

312
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,520
and the flavor’s bold enough

313
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,270
so when the ice melts, the taste stays just right.

314
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,260
I’m Captain.

315
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,230
Call me Jway.

316
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,680
Do you come here often?

317
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,240
I see you here everyday.

318
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,150
Yeah.

319
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,100
I’ve enjoyed eating desserts since I was young.

320
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,660
If possible, I want to own a shop like this.

321
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,360
Same here!

322
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,500
Well then, after Uncle dies,

323
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,830
let’s run this shop together.

324
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,590
Deal!

325
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,980
After he dies, don’t forget to let me know.

326
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:44,580
Yeah.

327
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,900
Are you guys cursing me or something?!

328
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,070
Promise?

329
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,360
Thinking back to that moment,
I think it was actually pretty funny.

330
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,570
So how did Jay who loved desserts back then

331
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,710
turn into who he is today?

332
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,800
What happened to him?

333
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,250
Well,

334
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,680
the croissants are ready.

335
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,190
I’ll go get them.

336
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,210
Here we go!

337
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,010
Something tells me that

338
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,310
this time it’s just right.

339
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,200
I think it’s just a little more,

340
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,950
but it’s really close now.

341
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,580
I can’t continue, Sant.

342
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,890
I ran out of the ingredients already.

343
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,600
I’ll go buy them for you.

344
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,490
Let’s stop it, Sant.

345
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,410
I guess it’s true, like what others said,

346
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:21,340
that I’m just one of those wannabe rich kids.

347
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,440
Who’s the one that insulted you like that?

348
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,490
Many people did.

349
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,050
I quit running the channel
because of those comments.

350
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:30,700
A lot of them said

351
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,300
someone like me was only good at criticizing.

352
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,210
If I was really that good,
why didn’t I open my own shop?

353
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,340
And that’s one of the reasons
I opened this shop.

354
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,530
I want to prove to others that I can do it too.

355
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,270
But in the end,

356
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,730
all I could do was copy Uncle’s recipe.

357
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,640
I guess I have to accept the truth

358
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,930
that I’m just a wannabe rich kid.

359
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:01,950
Hey.

360
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,420
Listen to me.

361
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:08,580
From the first time I had your croissant,

362
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,260
I knew right away that

363
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,270
it must have gone through countless tastings

364
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,300
to create a flavor like this.

365
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,280
But if you quit now,

366
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,310
you’ll be no different from
what the netizens said.

367
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:31,420
Here’s the deal.

368
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,780
I’ll go buy the ingredients.

369
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,140
You stay here, alright?

370
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,810
I’m sure you can do it.

371
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:06,840
I want it.

372
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:09,880
Oh, come on.

373
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,120
It’s the last one here.

374
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,440
Let me have it.

375
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,380
You’ve got too much
of something else already.

376
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,630
What did I get?

377
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,000
I just got snatched away
by a third party today.

378
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,200
You broke up with Yada already?

379
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,430
We aren’t dating.

380
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,330
Plus, she’s not my type either.

381
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,190
Are you serious?

382
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:28,980
Yeah.

383
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,980
Why would I lie to you?

384
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,700
Don’t tell me

385
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:36,830
Sant understands it like this too.

386
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,340
Yes.

387
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,650
When he found out,

388
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,900
he was really angry on my behalf.

389
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,300
No wonder he’s been acting
all tense with me today.

390
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:48,640
Alright, here’s the deal.

391
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:52,980
Please watch the shop for me. I’ll be back soon.

392
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,300
Jay!

393
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,400
Jay, I’m not…

394
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,840
I’m your customer!

395
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,600
I’m your customer!

396
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:31,720
Ouch!

397
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,120
Just because you saw me alone,
you’re acting all big now!

398
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:33,790
Ouch!

399
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,160
Heyyy, it’s me!

400
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:36,440
Jay?!

401
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,060
Ouch!

402
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:40,360
Ouch.

403
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,970
You scared me.

404
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,500
Ouch.

405
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:54,920
Ouch!

406
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:55,750
It hurts.

407
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,170
Why are you following me this late at night, huh?

408
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,050
Well, I saw you walking alone,

409
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,220
and it’s already late.

410
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,300
I’m worried about you.

411
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,490
I went to buy stuff for Captain.

412
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,720
But what about you?

413
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,410
What are you doing out here?

414
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,300
Well, I’m studying for an exam tonight,

415
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,170
so I thought I’d grab some coffee.

416
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,040
There’s no coffee shop around here.

417
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:48,690
Uh,

418
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,300
Gugg said you thought I’m dating Yada?

419
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:00,700
You came all the way here
just to talk about this?

420
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,580
Nope!

421
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,880
Well, I’m afraid others will misunderstand Yada.

422
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,700
Also, I’m single.

423
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,120
Yada isn’t my type at all.

424
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,610
To be honest,

425
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,430
I’m not surprised you’re single.

426
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,400
Who would want to date someone like you?

427
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:26,930
I’m sorry,

428
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,900
but you just got to know me.

429
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,360
If you get to know me better,

430
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,800
you might change your mind.

431
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,220
By the way,

432
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,520
why did someone who loved desserts like you

433
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,860
stop eating them?

434
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:52,570
Why did I stop?

435
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,880
Someone’s eating in my place now.

436
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,370
When I see him eat,

437
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,760
it’s so satisfying.

438
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:13,470
Oh, who is it?

439
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,410
You want to know?

440
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:18,480
Yeah.

441
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:29,850
I won’t tell you.

442
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,700
Aren’t you in a hurry to go see Captain?

443
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:41,490
Oh, right.

444
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,850
By now, he must have been waiting for so long.

445
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:46,520
Hey, wait.

446
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:52,570
My leg is numb.

447
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,070
Ouch.

448
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:55,890
My leg is numb.

449
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,620
Help pull me to get up.

450
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,290
Hurry up.

451
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,300
It hurts so much when...

452
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,310
when our legs get numb, you know.

453
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:23,230
Ouch.

454
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:26,980
You’re alright now?

455
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,420
You don’t need to walk me there.

456
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:41,570
What?

457
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,450
I’m already passing by that way.

458
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,220
Hey.

459
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,870
Can I ask you something?

460
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:58,680
Is the croissant at Captain’s shop
really that good?

461
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,290
It’s not just good,

462
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,300
but it's insanely delicious.

463
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,660
I’d rank it as number 2 in my croissant list.

464
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,160
How about number 1?

465
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,710
You don’t have to tell me. I already know.

466
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,720
I bet it’s the place I took you to
after getting your tooth filled.

467
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,420
Nope.

468
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:19,860
That one was just so-so.

469
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,580
For the number 1 croissant in my heart,

470
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,300
when I first ate it,

471
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,870
the taste was kind of strange.

472
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,380
But I didn’t know why, when I kept eating,

473
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,580
I couldn’t stop.

474
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,410
It was a flavor I’d never tasted before.

475
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,520
Until now,

476
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,200
the taste still sticks with me.

477
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:48,980
Whoa.

478
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,310
You’ve got me wondering which shop it is.

479
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,080
You want to know?

480
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,090
Yeah.

481
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,630
Move your ear closer.

482
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:15,720
I won’t tell you.

483
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:23,800
♪ Since you came into my life,
it’s been so bright ♪

484
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:29,490
♪ With you right here, it feels so warm, so right ♪

485
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:35,480
♪ So stay with me, don’t ever leave my side ♪

486
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:43,100
♪ ‘Cause every day, you make me smile ♪

487
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,110
This is the last one.

488
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,140
I’ve tried all the ways.

489
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,920
If it isn’t right, I have no idea how to go on.

490
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:09,610
How is it?

491
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,280
Is it as good as the first one?

492
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,090
No,

493
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,540
but it’s even better than the first one!

494
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,110
Are you serious?

495
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:25,480
Yeah.

496
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,060
Hey, it’s really better than the first one!

497
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:38,330
Sant.

498
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,150
Sant, we did it!

499
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,920
We did it!

500
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:42,840
We did it!

501
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,840
Yay!

502
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,410
Eh?

503
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:49,820
Sant.

504
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:51,490
Sant.

505
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,380
I bought coffee for you.

506
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,700
Jay.

507
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,900
You do know that my shop sells coffee, right?

508
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,260
Hey,

509
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,230
did you find the recipe already?

510
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,040
Yes, thanks to Sant.

511
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,600
Don’t get too involved with him.

512
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:27,860
He’s just a greedy kid.

513
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:29,700
No,

514
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:34,300
actually, he’s a dessert expert,

515
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,270
just like us.

516
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,640
How do you know that?

517
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:47,410
Actually,

518
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:51,490
I've known him since before
he applied for this job.

519
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,930
Running a shop in this era,

520
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,020
you need to find someone to help promote it.

521
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:09,870
Don't worry, Uncle.

522
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,100
When it comes to desserts,
I'm following one channel.

523
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:15,900
This is “Hungry while sleeping,
Yawning when waking up!”

524
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:19,090
This adorable Sant is here to snack for you!

525
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,380
And the one I’ll be eating today is

526
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:29,990
the number one in my heart, croissant!

527
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,210
Don’t tell me

528
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,570
you chose to make croissants

529
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,450
just because you know he likes them.

530
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,810
Well, he believes in me,

531
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,990
so I guess this is how I can give
something back to him.

532
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,020
Hey,

533
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,500
you’re trying to please him this much.

534
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,250
You two are way past
the boss-and-employee stage now, huh?

535
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,430
Well, since this employee's this adorable,

536
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,450
if you were me, could you resist?

537
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,200
Hello.

538
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,260
Please have a seat.

539
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:37,030
Today, we’re introducing our new menu,

540
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,770
Sweet Fish Sauce Croissant.

541
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,730
I recommend placing
your order quickly because…

542
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:42,960
Sant!

543
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,200
I can’t continue anymore.

544
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:48,800
What’s up?

545
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,640
I didn’t expect us to sell this well.

546
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,690
Can we close already? I won’t bake anymore.

547
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:53,430
Excuse me,

548
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,770
can we get one
Sweet Fish Sauce Croissant, please?

549
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,500
Of course.

550
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,360
Come on.

551
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,230
I’m sure you can do it.

552
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,220
I’ll help.

553
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,520
Okay.

554
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,560
Please serve it.

555
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:09,980
Finally, it’s the last order.

556
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:11,100
Come on.

557
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,270
I haven’t tried any.

558
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:14,310
But it's fine.

559
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,070
Customers matter more.

560
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,090
Which table is this for?

561
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,100
It’s for you.

562
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:22,820
Thank you so much for today, Sant.

563
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,510
Without your help,

564
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,350
I wouldn’t have successfully created this menu.

565
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:28,989
Thank you.

566
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:30,659
No worries.

567
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,810
Here is your bonus.

568
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:43,210
It goes great with a nice cup of coffee.

569
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:48,710
Thank you, Captain.

570
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,870
Don’t you know he doesn’t drink coffee?

571
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:57,820
What’s with you?

572
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:58,640
Eh?

573
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,470
I’m a customer here

574
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:03,150
and happen to want some coffee now.

575
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,330
I’m sorry.

576
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,220
I didn’t realize you don’t drink coffee.

577
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,320
Well, then,

578
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,860
I’ll make you a chocolate latte instead.

579
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,410
Can you teach me how to do latte art?

580
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,340
I want to learn.

581
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:17,650
Sure.

582
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:20,300
But I can only make a heart shape.

583
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,650
You got it.

584
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:25,650
Come here.

585
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,160
That’s hilarious.

586
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,640
What on earth makes you think
I’m dating that dude Jay?

587
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,980
Well, you two are practically glued together.

588
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,420
Our numbers are next to each other,

589
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,620
so we have to be in the same group.

590
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,390
If I had a choice, who would want
to be friends with someone like him?

591
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,510
You’re right.

592
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,260
I think someone adorable like you

593
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,220
can definitely find someone better than Jay.

594
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,730
If you’re going to gossip,

595
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,690
at least mind the person
whose number is next to yours.

596
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:00,310
By the way,

597
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,790
when is your friend getting here?

598
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,610
I’ve been waiting so long I’m growing roots.

599
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,890
Oh, I forgot to tell you that

600
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,970
Sant asked me to reschedule.

601
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,880
He’s the head of
the faculty’s film screening event,

602
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,740
so he took Captain to check out the booth.

603
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:13,650
Pardon?

604
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:16,060
Oh, it’s the students’ films screening event.

605
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,480
It's set up like an outdoor screening.

606
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,350
Nope.

607
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,600
Who did Sant go to see the booth with?

608
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:24,930
Huh?

609
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,890
Thank you for helping out with the booth.

610
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,830
Your booth will definitely attract a crowd.

611
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:37,530
I don’t usually take on off-site jobs,

612
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:40,510
but if it’s for you, I’m fine with it.

613
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:46,930
Oh.

614
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,600
This is your booth.

615
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,530
The one next to yours is…

616
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,590
Teeth brushing lesson booth.

617
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:53,420
Exactly.

618
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,110
After you finish eating desserts,
you need to brush your teeth.

619
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,510
What?

620
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,370
This is a cake booth, isn’t it?

621
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,320
If they eat a lot of cakes,
they might get a tooth cavity,

622
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,700
so I can give them a treatment right away.

623
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:07,020
Also, your faculty already approved my booth.

624
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,290
If you don’t believe me,

625
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,310
here you go.

626
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,360
Show me one more time.

627
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:15,500
Here.

628
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,440
Hey!

629
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,850
This is a warning

630
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,600
that you parked over the teacher's spot.

631
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:24,710
Let me see.

632
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,220
Oh, I probably grabbed the wrong one.

633
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,100
The other one should be in the car,

634
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,690
on the back lock,

635
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:34,840
near the driver’s side.

636
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:35,900
Around…

637
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:37,300
Let’s just forget about him.

638
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,230
Talking about the parking,

639
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,510
I’ll show you the loading area.

640
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:42,160
- Let’s go.
- It’s over there.

641
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,250
Hey?!

642
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,750
I set up the camera to film us while setting up,

643
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,910
in case we need behind-the-scenes footage.

644
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:57,590
Can you change the battery
for me in the morning?

645
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,630
Aren’t you setting up the screen with us?

646
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:00,630
You go ahead.

647
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:03,110
I need to go back and pick the movies.

648
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:05,230
Alright.

649
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,440
How do you get home?

650
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,710
It’s really late.

651
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,500
Plus, an engineering student
got his bag snatched the other day.

652
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:12,300
Huh?

653
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,980
Anyway, safe trip home.

654
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:16,500
Just message me if you need anything.

655
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:17,880
Text me, okay?

656
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,670
Sant.

657
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,620
I heard there are a lot of thieves around here.

658
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,110
But don’t worry,

659
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,200
I’ll take you home tonight.

660
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,150
It’s probably easier if he goes with me.

661
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,600
He stays in the same dorm as I do anyway.

662
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:41,460
But we still have to talk about
the booth tonight, Sant.

663
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,490
Can’t you just talk about it another day?

664
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,160
Nope.

665
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,900
We need to wrap it up tonight.

666
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,520
Have you ever heard of work-life balance?

667
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,890
Let him choose who he wants to go home with.

668
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,900
Yada, here you are.

669
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,230
Thanks for the treat.

670
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,300
No worries.

671
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,880
You came all the way just to drop me off.

672
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:24,590
You like it?

673
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,900
Like…what?

674
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,710
This one.

675
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,600
I saw you drinking it the other day
when you came for your dental appointment.

676
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,590
Yeah, I like it.

677
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,710
It’s pretty good.

678
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,010
Gugg, why didn’t you upload a clip today?

679
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,630
I was waiting to see you dance!

680
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:52,260
Oh, I’m a healthy lifestyle guy.

681
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,510
In my free time,

682
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,950
I like doing aerobics and posting
on TikTok and stuff.

683
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:56,760
Really?

684
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:00,520
I saw you dancing to
“Yak Don Chon Gang” yesterday.

685
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:02,930
Do you want me to play it here?

686
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,630
Hey, no!

687
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,770
Don’t! Not that one!

688
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:06,810
You danced to that.

689
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:13,320
Go away! I’m busy, can’t you see?

690
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:14,140
It’s fine.

691
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,610
I also want to see you dance.

692
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,130
Are you sure?

693
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,370
I’ll show you just a bit then.

694
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,720
Music, please.

695
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:27,540
You got it.

696
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:29,810
Louder.

697
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,430
Louder.

698
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,100
Thanks for taking me home.

699
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,740
It’s truly my pleasure.

700
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,490
We’ll get to talk about the booth, too.

701
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,510
Before we talk about that,

702
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:57,650
let me ask one question.

703
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:58,510
Yeah.

704
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:00,310
Why did you get inside the car?

705
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,730
Here, I brought the
official permit to show you that

706
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:09,890
your faculty has already approved me

707
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,590
to set up a booth for teaching how to brush teeth.

708
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:13,970
Look.

709
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,000
If you're done here,

710
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,650
please feel free to head out.

711
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,650
We want to go home already.

712
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:23,970
Oops,

713
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:27,220
I just realized I didn’t bring my car.

714
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,290
Let me catch a ride with you.

715
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,250
Thai people are kind, right?

716
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,450
Let’s go.

717
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,850
We’ve arrived.

718
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:52,920
Sant.

719
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:55,420
I’m hungry.

720
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,400
Let’s grab something to eat, shall we?

721
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,540
Nice.

722
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,310
I know a great chicken rice place around here.

723
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:00,990
It’s good.

724
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,900
I’m asking him, not you.

725
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:10,130
You guys go ahead.

726
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,740
I’ll go upstairs to work first.

727
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:13,600
Wait a second.

728
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,620
Oh, I just remembered, I’m full already.

729
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:21,440
Hey, Sant,

730
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,240
this is heavy.

731
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,450
Come on, I’ll help you carry it.

732
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:28,760
Let’s go.

733
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:08,200
I need your advice.

734
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,040
The main character
has two people crushing on him.

735
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,250
Who should he choose?

736
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,590
The hot nerdy café owner

737
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,640
who gives him rides and brings him food

738
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:18,920
or a weird doctor?

739
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,980
Next time will be the last time.

740
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,590
The last time?

741
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:26,450
From now on,

742
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,500
let's compete fair and square.
