00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,760
We’re the cast from Sweet Tooth, Good Dentist.

I play the dentist.

00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,200
I play his boyfriend.
[MARK PAKIN AS DR. JAY / OHM THIPAKORN AS SANT]

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,440
Hello, all my fellow cavity crew.

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,840
I’ll be holding a Q&A session today.

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,200
What’s the weirdest job you’ve ever done?

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,000
You want me to ask for a breakup
with your boyfriend for you?

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:32,759
Jay!

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,640
Queen asked me to tell you that
she’s sorry she couldn’t make it today.

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,360
He said…

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:39,760
Ouch!

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,640
Hey, what was wrong with him?!

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,560
Nothing was wrong with him,

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,680
but something is wrong with me now!

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,520
Go see the dentist.

16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,600
Will you pay for me, huh?

17
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,400
But I think there’s one place that can help you.

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,600
At the Faculty of Dentistry,
FACULTY OF DENTISTRY

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,240
they offer special prices for dental work.

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,840
It's for cases where dental students
are just starting out.

21
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,960
Sant goes to the same university with Jay.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,320
He has tooth cavity because
he always does a snack-eating live stream.

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,160
Exactly,

24
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,080
but Sant doesn’t have enough money

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,800
to afford going to
regular clinics with high prices,

26
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,160
so he seeks free treatment at the university.

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,680
Then, he meets Jay,
who’s looking for a dental case

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,280
to submit to his professor in order to graduate.

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,680
They meet.

30
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,600
Overall, I think,

31
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,120
this story is mainly led by
the relationship between Sant and Jay.

32
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,840
This then later leads to different conflicts,

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,120
and many more characters.

34
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,160
I’d rather go to a normal dentist!

35
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,080
What’s not normal about me?

36
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,080
Your smile is lovely.

37
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,000
Do you want to hang out with me?

38
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:31,800
Huh?!

39
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,039
Jay!

40
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,520
What a small world.

41
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,320
What’s special about
Sweet Tooth, Good Dentist is that,
[NOPPHARNACH CHAIYAHWIMHON / PRODUCER]

42
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,640
while we were working on the scripts,

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,440
we talked to the scriptwriting team,

44
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,440
telling them to make a series

45
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,759
that can make people laugh
in every episode they’re watching.

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,600
I want a series that gives them
a good night before going to bed.

47
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,479
After finishing the episode,

48
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,920
they must turn off the TV with
the remote control while feeling a good vibe.

49
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,920
That’s how the scriptwriting team
and I came up with a new phrase,

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,920
“Romantic Therapy.”

51
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,280
As it names suggests,

52
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,640
we want our viewers to smile
while watching and feel happy.

53
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,520
They might want to date
someone after watching it.

54
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,840
Awww, stop it.

55
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,960
Shhhh!

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,560
Why?! The staff hasn’t even said anything.

57
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,360
Hey,

58
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,360
if you’re going to be all over each other
like that, go do it somewhere else.

59
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,760
People are here to watch a movie.

60
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,560
There's a noodle shop right across.

61
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,360
Just cross over, and we're there.

62
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,120
Hey!

63
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,920
Someone jumped into the river!

64
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,680
I play Jay.
[MARK PAKIN AS DR. JAY]

65
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,520
He’s a dental student.
[MARK PAKIN AS DR. JAY]

66
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,120
Actually, he’s a sincere person

67
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,760
and he always keeps what he feels to himself.

68
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,520
He doesn’t express everything he feels.

69
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,440
For example, he thinks a certain way

70
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,400
but expresses it another way.

71
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,760
Also, he’s confident in simself.

72
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,040
I’d say, he’s being himself so much

73
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,480
that people find him weird,

74
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,600
but he actually has a warm heart.

75
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,720
He may put on a show or act indifferent,

76
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,160
but deep down,

77
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,640
every action is filled with small,
thoughtful details.

78
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,280
If the person he cares about
isn't paying close attention,

79
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,240
they won't even notice.

80
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,040
When Jay is with his patients,

81
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,960
he’s just like any other dentist.

82
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,160
He really loves being a dentist

83
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,880
and wants to become a good one.

84
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,640
But it’s just that the way
Jay hits on someone is weird.

85
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,320
He acts annoyingly toward them

86
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,360
or makes himself memorable
in a way they shouldn’t remember.

87
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,200
But Jay believes it’s a good thing

88
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,240
that they will appreciate.

89
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,000
For example, he compliments himself
that he’s handsome in front of that person.

90
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,040
They might see him as confident,

91
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,840
or maybe just full of ourselves.

92
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,480
That’s what Jay’s like.

93
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,960
As for Dr.Jay’s character,
[OHM THIPAKORN AS SANT]

94
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,240
[OHM THIPAKORN AS SANT]

95
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,040
he’s sincere but not serious.

96
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,040
This is how I define him

97
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,360
because he thinks,

98
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,440
but he doesn’t know how to express it.

99
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,800
Everything he does or says
ends up feeling unserious.

100
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,320
The clearest thing is his word—
what people call a sharp tongue.
[VIEW BENYAPA AS YADA]

101
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,880
That’s just how Dr.Jay is,

102
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,920
and Yada will always talk back

103
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,720
because she refuses to back down.

104
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,080
I’m too handsome,

105
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,840
so I need to wear a mask
to cover my handsome face,

106
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,360
or else everyone will be dead.

107
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,240
If Sant sees my face, he might go like, oho,

108
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,160
so I need to wear a mask,
so he won’t be shocked.

109
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,320
You know what I mean?

110
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,480
Ouch.

111
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,840
Funny.

112
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,640
I’d say Jay is good-looking
[JIMMY JITARAPHOL AS CAPTAIN]

113
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,080
but weird.
[JIMMY JITARAPHOL AS CAPTAIN]

114
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,080
but weird.

115
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,680
He’s a friend who's hard to read

116
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,760
but makes you feel at ease.

117
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,159
He’s someone who makes you
want to help fulfill his dreams.

118
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,320
If I'm being honest,

119
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,000
I'd say I'm about 70-75% like Dr.Jay.
[MARK PAKIN AS DR. JAY]

120
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,040
Looking back, P’Aof once told me that

121
00:04:54,159 --> 00:05:00,080
they partly based this novel,
Sweet Tooth, Good Dentist  on me,

122
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,960
which later became this character, Dr. Jay.

123
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,400
P’Aof and I are pretty close,
and he knows me really well.

124
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,000
The main difference, I think, is in how we flirt.

125
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,120
I don’t really flirt the way Jay does.

126
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,400
If Jay’s flirting style is a 10,

127
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,640
I’d say I’m about halfway there.

128
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,960
I get where Jay is coming from
when he flirts in his weird ways.

129
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,080
I can see how someone could act like that.

130
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,800
And if I had to flirt with someone,
I might even do it that way too.

131
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,159
As for P’Mark’s portrayal of this character Jay,
[OHM THIPAKORN AS SANT]

132
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:35,920
I think,
[OHM THIPAKORN AS SANT]

133
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,120
as briefly mentioned earlier,

134
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:41,360
this series was written based on the two of us.

135
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,720
The way he does strange things

136
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:47,520
or acts a little out of the ordinary,

137
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,040
I think P’Mark already gets.

138
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,080
He knows exactly how to express it,
how to make it understandable

139
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,880
and funny for the viewers,

140
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,840
and how to strike that perfect balance
of not too much, not too little.

141
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,920
He knows how to make
the viewers understand it.

142
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,320
I’ve gone wild now.

143
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,320
The sun is making me go crazy.

144
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,760
Actually, this series was something
I was really worried about the most at first,

145
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,360
but it ended up being no problem
at all during the filming

146
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,440
because we did some workshops

147
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,160
and there was a real dentist on set all the time,

148
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,360
guiding me on how to hold a tool,

149
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,760
if I had to wear a mask or a head covering first,

150
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,880
or if I had to take off the gloves first or later.

151
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,280
The dentist told me all of it,

152
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,440
making the filming a lot easier.

153
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,880
I must thank her for that.

154
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,880
Then gently brush down.

155
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,880
Gently scrub, then brush down.

156
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,240
Gently scrub.

157
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,520
He said move.

158
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,320
-Gently move.
-Gettly move.

159
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,600
Oh, I copied that, you know.

160
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,880
I feel like I got the hang of
the tools pretty quickly.

161
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,600
Maybe I was meant to be a dentist from the start,

162
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,240
but my love for acting led me to become an actor.

163
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,640
It feels like coming home.

164
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,400
How do I put it back?

165
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,280
What makes it challenging is the fact that

166
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,040
Jay and I are very similar.

167
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:14,160
We’re so alike that the more
comfortable I feel in a role or scene,

168
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,720
the more my true self as Mark comes out.

169
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,560
When I act, I like to improvise

170
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,360
or add things based on
how I understand the character.

171
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,080
But with Jay, since I feel so close to him,

172
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,120
I wonder if some scenes end up
feeling more like me than Jay.

173
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,760
And I don’t want the viewers
to see me more than Jay.

174
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,760
I really want to bring Jay to life.

175
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,840
Cavities are a sign that something
in your lifestyle isn’t right.

176
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,960
If you keep doing the same things,

177
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,120
you’ll be back here again soon.

178
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:42,960
Eh?

179
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,159
Or do you want to see me again?

180
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,560
You have a dental appointment tomorrow.

181
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,080
If there's nothing else, I'm heading to bed.

182
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,680
Sweet dreams.

183
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,960
Do you say this to everyone?

184
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,760
Nope.

185
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,640
I only say it to some people.

186
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,520
I play Sant.
[OHM THIPAKORN AS SANT]

187
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:03,240
This character always
puts others before himself.

188
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,720
Sant was abandoned as a child,

189
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,560
so he has a special fear of being left behind.

190
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,840
That's why he cares so much
about the people around him,

191
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,160
the one he loves, his close friends, and family.

192
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,560
With each person, Sant expresses
his love in a different way.

193
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,440
Sant is cheerful and lively,

194
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,800
expressing everything.
[MARK PAKIN AS DR. JAY]

195
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,160
He's the backbone of the family,
[MARK PAKIN AS DR. JAY]

196
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,960
a really sweet person, and... what's the word?

197
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,679
Charming.

198
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,799
He's a character who doesn't hold anything back.
[JIMMY JITARAPHOL AS CAPTAIN]

199
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,480
He says whatever he wants to

200
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,000
and shows whatever he feels clearly.

201
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,280
He’s the kind of character that,

202
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,160
if they existed in real life,

203
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,200
you could totally be friends with

204
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,480
because he’s not complicated at all.

205
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,840
He has nothing hidden, no secrets.

206
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,600
He’s straightforward and sincere.

207
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,640
He’s a fighter,
[POON MITPAKDEE AS GUGG]
but also the backbone of the family
[POON MITPAKDEE AS GUGG]

208
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,480
because he has to take care of them.
[POON MITPAKDEE AS GUGG]

209
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,080
He takes on whatever comes,
whether it's heavy or light.

210
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,200
He's the type who, at first,
didn’t fully know himself.

211
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,840
He didn't realize what he liked
or what he should do.

212
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,600
But he kept doing what he loved
until things started coming together.

213
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,880
Gugg, as his friend, feels happy
for him and supports him.

214
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,520
Sant’s characteristics are
partly developed based on mine

215
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,600
and being a content creator,

216
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,280
he’s quick-witted and good with words,

217
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,600
so it’s no surprise he can cut
people down with his speech.

218
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,880
He’s quick with words,
ready to argue in the moment.

219
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,160
When he wants something,
he will just say it right away.

220
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,160
That’s him.

221
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,840
Ohm and Sant are very similar in various aspects,
[POON MITPAKDEE AS GUGG]

222
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,920
but in real life, he's more glamorous,
[POON MITPAKDEE AS GUGG]

223
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,200
but Sant is someone who's
down-to-earth and truly a fighter.

224
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,960
What’s challenging about
portraying Sant is the inner feeling

225
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,440
because what he once experienced in the past

226
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,240
has shaped him into who he is now

227
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,120
and also the way he thinks.

228
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,400
And this mindset shapes his actions,

229
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,680
speech, thoughts, and expressions in many ways.

230
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,680
This role isn’t intense enough
to make the viewers feel stressed,

231
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,200
but it’s something that
can’t be expressed directly.

232
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,160
The viewers have to be able to
sense what he's thinking.

233
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,240
If you ask about Sant’s job as a content creator in the series,

234
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,480
I think I’ve trained a lot for it.

235
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,600
I’m not the kind of person who can just speak
in front of the camera without preparing.

236
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,320
Speaking off the cuff,

237
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,760
speaking in a way that others can
listen to, that’s tough for me.

238
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,680
It was a workshop where I had
to put in a lot of work.

239
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,760
I talked with P’Pepsi about

240
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,880
how I needed to find case studies,

241
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,000
how I should think,

242
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,640
how to express it just enough

243
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,200
so that the viewers don't get annoyed.

244
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,600
It was really challenging for me.

245
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,320
Everyone, I have to end my live stream for today.

246
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,520
See you later.

247
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,120
Thank you for watching.

248
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,960
Hey! Stop!

249
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,440
Give it to me.

250
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,800
Brush gently.

251
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,800
One secret about this series is that
[NOPPHARNACH CHAIYAHWIMHON / PRODUCER]

252
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,280
I’ve had the plot in my hands for about 4 years.
[NOPPHARNACH CHAIYAHWIMHON / PRODUCER]

253
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,360
During that time, we still couldn't
figure out who would play these roles.

254
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,320
We spent a lot of time developing the script,

255
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,600
and I talked to JittiRain about the plot.

256
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,880
JittiRain then turned it into a novel.

257
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:50,080
Still, we hadn't found the right people
for the roles of Dr.Jay and Sant.

258
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,920
If you asked the actors in GMMTV,

259
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,400
there were more than 5-6 people

260
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,720
who had auditioned for these roles before.

261
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,560
But sometimes,

262
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,120
something about the right person
just clicks at the right moment.

263
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,800
When I finally talked to Mark,

264
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,800
I felt like his quirky vibe really matched
the character Dr.Jay,

265
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,320
so I decided to have him read
the script to see what he thought.

266
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,400
He did his homework and came back saying,

267
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,120
"This character is so much like me.
I want to play this role."

268
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,360
Then we discussed who else
Mark thought might be suitable,

269
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,600
and the process led to casting Mark
and a few other people.

270
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,560
Eventually, we found Ohm.

271
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:34,120
Ohm was in the same series with Mark before.

272
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,640
It’s Last Twilight.

273
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,280
Their characters never
actually meet in the storyline.

274
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,400
But behind the scenes,

275
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,560
I noticed this amazing chemistry between them.

276
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,920
The special thing was that

277
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,160
someone like Mark needs
someone like Ohm to bring out his best.

278
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,040
So we decided to cast these two
together and see how it went.

279
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,720
Mark auditioned and said, "This is the one."

280
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,560
Mark felt that,
since he was going to play this role,

281
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,840
he needed someone he could
believe in as being adorable.

282
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,920
I feel like everyone who came for
the casting did a great job,

283
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,720
but there’s one person, and that’s Ohm,

284
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,720
who made me feel like I could
actually get shy around him.

285
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,240
He brought Sant to life with such charm.

286
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,400
There was a moment when I thought,
"Wow, he’s really cute."

287
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,160
I called P’Aof and told him,

288
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,400
"He makes it so much easier for me to act now.”

289
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,080
He’s cute.

290
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,080
When I have to smile,

291
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,720
I don’t even have to force myself to feel like

292
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,560
I need to smile because Sant is cute.

293
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,120
It's because Ohm's portrayal of Sant is so natural

294
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,280
that it makes me smile automatically.

295
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,680
I can smile naturally without even trying.

296
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,320
When Mark told me that, I was like, deal.
[NOPPHARNACH CHAIYAHWIMHON / PRODUCER]

297
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,960
It was a joint decision between Mark and me

298
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,640
that Ohm had to be the one.

299
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,160
Mark felt that Ohm was charming.

300
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,600
With eyes and a smile that,

301
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,240
when he looks at him, he can't help feeling shy.

302
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,160
When I learned that I’d get to pair up with Mark,

303
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,720
I was happy because at first, when I saw him,

304
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,880
I felt that he had a charm that
not everyone would see right away.

305
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,000
But after talking and getting to know him,

306
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,240
I realized that he's someone easy to work with,

307
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,120
and his vibe really matches mine.

308
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,440
Our attitudes align.

309
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,080
At that time, P’Aof told me
I’d be casting with Mark,

310
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,280
and I’ve always known what kind of person he is,

311
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,760
how he talks, and that he’s someone
who stands his ground.

312
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,080
I felt excited about the idea of
going up against him.

313
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,680
There's a certain chemistry
between us that just clicks.

314
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,360
Throughout our 4 years of
searching for Dr.Jay and Sant,

315
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,840
in the end, we found MarkOhm

316
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,880
as a perfect match for these roles.

317
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,880
With Mark's character in the story
and his real-life personality,

318
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,520
there’s a mix of mischief.

319
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,320
There are both similarities and differences.

320
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,080
And when thinking about who could
pull off the character of Dr. Jay,

321
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,520
it turned out to be Sant.

322
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,880
As for the chemistry, it’s strange,

323
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,840
just like how it’s mentioned in the series

324
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,800
where they say he’s a weird doctor,

325
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,000
He’s good-looking but weird.

326
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,040
So, it made sense to pair someone
with this same vibe.

327
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,760
In the character, it’s about
how oddness meets oddness,

328
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,720
but I believe the viewers will find it adorable.

329
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,080

342
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,960
But he's also clumsy.

343
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,280
He wants to succeed in life and be recognized,

344
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,720
but the problem is

345
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,760
he's not particularly skilled.

346
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,960
That’s why he wants to prove himself.

347
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:13,320
He's the owner of
the dessert shop I love going to,

348
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,680
and I also work there.

349
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,040
Like I said, I'm hardworking, so I have to work.

350
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:24,120
When I met him, he took a liking to me.

351
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:31,120
He's another person who's practically perfect
—checking off every box.

352
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,560
Honestly, he's even more perfect than Dr.Jay.

353
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,280
Captain is adorable.
[MARK PAKIN AS DR. JAY]

354
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,400
His character is way more charming than Jay's.
[MARK PAKIN AS DR. JAY]

355
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,480
Just his physical presence alone
steals the show.

356
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,200
He’s immaculate, fair-skinned,

357
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,800
handsome, and impeccably neat.

358
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,040
On top of that, he's polite.

359
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,360
When Captain tries to hit on Sant,

360
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,280
he does it with gentleness,
warmth, and tenderness,

361
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,000
which is completely different
from Jay’s approach.

362
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,400
So, if anyone ends up rooting for Captain more,

363
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,560
it’s totally understandable.

364
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,079
At first glance, I thought,
[POON MITPAKDEE AS GUGG]

365
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,599
“This guy is so cool.”
[POON MITPAKDEE AS GUGG]

366
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,040
He’s the kind of second lead
who’s genuinely sincere,

367
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,920
cool, warm, and understanding.

368
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,480
He’s definitely more calm than Dr. Jay

369
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,480
and more normal.

370
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,560
Captain is someone who puts in a lot of effort.
[JIMMY JITARAPHOL AS CAPTAIN]

371
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:36,200
When he dedicates himself
to something, he goes all in.

372
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,200
But what’s really different from me is that

373
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,840
this character absolutely loves sweets.

374
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,440
He’s really in love with them.

375
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,240
He loves them so much that
he opened a dessert shop.

376
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:53,320
Another thing that sets him apart from me
is that Captain never swears.

377
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,600
Even when, his friend,
Jay throws curse words at him,

378
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,240
he always finds a way to
respond without using any.

379
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,520
It’s pretty fun, actually.

380
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,000
For this series,
[MARK PAKIN AS DR. JAY]
[MARK PAKIN AS DR. JAY]

381
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,200
if I were a fan of Jimmy,
[MARK PAKIN AS DR. JAY]
[MARK PAKIN AS DR. JAY]

382
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,160
I’d definitely want to watch it.
[MARK PAKIN AS DR. JAY]

383
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:18,480
This role really develops his acting skills
compared to his past projects.

384
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,240
It’s like he gets to try so many new things

385
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,880
and take on new challenges.

386
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,400
His acting this time leans into comedy,

387
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,840
and I think he did a great job.

388
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,640
The tricky part about comedy is the timing.

389
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,080
At first, I thought Jimmy
might struggle with that

390
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,840
since comedic timing is hard to grasp.

391
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,880
It’s not something you can just teach.

392
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,680
But he picked it up super fast,

393
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,440
and the two of us made our scenes so much fun.

394
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,840
There are some scenes that are just so cute,

395
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,040
like seriously adorable.

396
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,480
I feel like our acting was really enjoyable,

397
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,160
and I think it’s going to turn out amazing.

398
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,040
I really love the friendship
between Captain and Jay.

399
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,760
Please watch the series
to find out how it’s unfolded.

400
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,240
It’s a strange dynamic,
but they love each other in their own way.

401
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,560
It’s like they love each other so much
they could fight to the death.

402
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,760
So, does he have feelings for you?

403
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,760
I play Yada.
[VIEW BENYAPA AS YADA]

404
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,120
She’s a dental student
[VIEW BENYAPA AS YADA]

405
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,120
and Jay’s friend.

406
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,360
She’s not the typical girly type.

407
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,720
She’s got a cool, and tough vibe.

408
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,960
She’s bold, smart, and doesn’t rely on anyone.

409
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,080
That’s the kind of energy she brings.

410
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,560
Yada is a great friend

411
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,600
who keeps Jay grounded in reality.

412
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,120
She’s always there to knock some sense into him,

413
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,080
reminding him how his actions affect others,

414
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,920
like, "If you do this, he’ll feel this way, you know?"

415
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,240
or "If you do that, he’ll feel bad about it."

416
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,680
She guides him on how to really hit on someone.

417
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,200
When Jay runs into problems,

418
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,200
Yada is the one who gives him solid advice.

419
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,360
At first glance,
[POON MITPAKDEE AS GUGG]

420
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,280
she might come off as cold and intimidating,
[POON MITPAKDEE AS GUGG]

421
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:11,840
but in reality, Dr.Yada is kind, warm, and sweet.

422
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,040
If I met her in real life,
I’d probably be intimidated too

423
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,320
but in the series, Gugg likes her.

424
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,160
Hey, don’t!

425
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,760
Don’t!

426
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,440
Stop it!

427
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,000
She’s naughty, huh?

428
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,120
Open your mouth.

429
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:27,960
Try opening your mouth.

430
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,360
Just for fun, okay?

431
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,840
Sometimes, I have to handle real dental tools,

432
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,800
which I’ve never used before,

433
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,280
and I think it’s fun.

434
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,160
First of all, not only do I have
to memorize the script,

435
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,880
but I also have to remember the steps

436
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:48,160
for handling the equipment, gloves,
hats, masks, and other tools.

437
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,600
I have to know which hand does what,

438
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,160
how to adjust the chair,
and press the right buttons.

439
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,120
Everything must be memorized
along with the script.

440
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,440
I also have to remember
how to remove things correctly.

441
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,520
On set, they brought in the real dentist

442
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,240
to guide me on what to remove first.

443
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,560
It’s tough, and I have to stay focused

444
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,400
because I can’t make any mistakes.

445
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,000
The reason he’s treating your teeth is probably

446
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,960
because he still likes you.

447
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,720
Nonsense!

448
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,040
He might be a little weird,

449
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,720
but he didn’t really do you any harm.

450
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,520
Stop now!

451
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,440
It’s you who should stop!

452
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:24,960
Ugh!!!

453
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,000
Ouch!

454
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,120
Ouch!

455
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,160
I play Gugg.
[POON MITPAKDEE AS GUGG]

456
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:29,640
[POON MITPAKDEE AS GUGG]

457
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,920
He’s a student from
the Faculty of Communication Arts,

458
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,440
originally from Suphanburi.

459
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,720
He’s a straightforward and sincere person

460
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,840
who believes in whatever others tell him.

461
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,000
He enjoys helping people
and is a content creator,

462
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,960
especially in the dance field.

463
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,200
So, in many ways,
he’s quite different from my real self.

464
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,760
This character is similar to Poon,

465
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:03,360
a talkative and self-confident person.

466
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,720
If compared to Sant,

467
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,920
Sant would be more well-behaved.

468
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,920
However, Gugg is the type who...

469
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,680
There will be a part where they help
each other make money.

470
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,440
Gugg uses dancing as a way to earn money.

471
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,320
I did the most homework with this character.

472
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,400
Their energy has to make the scene
fun but not too over the top.

473
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,000
I feel like I need to balance this part.

474
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,920
Also, besides the character,

475
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,800
there are other skills that need to be added,

476
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:38,280
like dancing and live-streaming skills,

477
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,160
and speaking on camera as well.

478
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,280
I think if I didn't get the role of Jay,
[MARK PAKIN AS DR. JAY]

479
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,040
I would have played this character.
[MARK PAKIN AS DR. JAY]

480
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,520
[MARK PAKIN AS DR. JAY]

481
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,920
I probably would have played someone like this.
[MARK PAKIN AS DR. JAY]

482
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,000
We improvised, did this and that,

483
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,400
and it was so much fun acting together.

484
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,040
Poon did really well.

485
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:00,720
I feel like Gak and Poon are
super similar, almost the same.

486
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,240
I’m not tired.

487
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,440
I’m not tired yet.

488
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,040
It’s no surprise that
[OHM THIPAKORN AS SANT]

489
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,840
Poon was chosen to play
my best friend in the story.
[OHM THIPAKORN AS SANT]

490
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,240
When we play around together,

491
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,880
both on-screen and off-screen,

492
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,160
there’s a certain closeness between friends

493
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,120
that I feel isn’t the same with many people.

494
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,000
I’m not surprised he was chosen
to be my best friend.

495
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,360
At the same time, there’s the fun,
energetic vibe between Sant and Gugg.

496
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,800
They’re both people with overflowing energy,

497
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,840
so it’s no surprise that they get along.

498
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,360
It’s also no surprise that they picked Poon,

499
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,280
because Poon holds his character well.

500
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,920
He knows how to play it,

501
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,480
how to contribute to the color
and energy of the story.

502
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,120
Without this character,
the show would still be fun,

503
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,960
but it wouldn’t be as great.

504
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,480
Actually, there's one more
actor I want to mention,

505
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,280
and that's P'Honey, who plays my mom.

506
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:13,200
I’ve known her already, and I've seen
a lot of her work in acting.

507
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,560
In the first few scenes, I was really nervous.

508
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:21,200
Going in for a hug or kiss,
with the mom and son relationship,

509
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,680
it’s something I can do, but I was like,
‘How should I hug her?’

510
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,520
I went for the hug and kiss,
but my whole body was tense.

511
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,640
P'Honey helped me a lot.

512
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,720
She told me, ‘Oh, just do it, don’t be shy,
don’t feel embarrassed, just do it.’

513
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,800
Her real-life kid is actually older than me,

514
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,680
and she said her kid is much older.

515
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,960
So, I’m practically her grandchild.

516
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,240
It was really great that she played my mom,

517
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:51,400
and I felt that this is what they mean
by being a true veteran actor.

518
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,120
When it’s ‘5, 4, 3, 2, action,’

519
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,760
she just steps right into it.

520
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,320
She acts immediately,

521
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,400
and she gives such good emotional responses,

522
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,400
and the actions she gives,

523
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,480
just receiving her reactions
made me feel so much fun.

524
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,480
On the days when P'Honey was on set,

525
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,360
I knew I would experience
something fun for sure.

526
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,600
And especially with a dramatic role,

527
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,600
it was exciting to act with her.

528
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,920
Oh my, both of them are so cute!

529
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,680
My child and my child's partner.

530
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:31,360
I'm so happy to have had the opportunity
to be a small part of this series.

531
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:37,720
I had the opportunity to work with
many veteran actors in this series,

532
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,960
and I feel very honored to
have worked with them.

533
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,360
On the other hand, it's also exciting

534
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,760
because there was a time
when I used to see them on TV,

535
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,320
and it felt so distant from me.

536
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,800
But one day, I got to act with them,
sit and talk with them,

537
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,680
and be in scenes with them.

538
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,560
It's a special feeling.

539
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,800
I learned a lot from their way of working.

540
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,880
They are great examples of
how things should be done.

541
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,680
The buffalo was eating, and it was looking down,

542
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,280
but it was swaying back and forth,

543
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,880
and it ended up bumping into me just right.

544
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,600

Not with his best friends or his family.

550
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,560
There’s a certain attraction that

551
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,320
he doesn’t quite know what to think of it.

552
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,920
He doesn’t like what Jay does,

553
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,360
but he also doesn’t want to
stop being around him.

554
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,760
It’s like having a sweet tooth.

You know it’s not good for you,

but you just can’t stop.

557
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,320
I think it’s something like that.

558
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,240
Since Mark is a cheeky guy,

Or even when they pull a prank on me!

They get along so well when
it comes to making me miserable.

they’d be filming some TikTok videos.

I see their videos and thought
they get along really well.

They’re adorable.

They complete each other’s jokes.

They’re adorable like that.

I’m not uncomfortable,
but it’s embarrassing sometimes.

584
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,640
There’s this scene where you stick
a concave mirror in my mouth.

585
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,920
After we wrapped up the scene, we heard “cut!”

“Ohm, you need your teeth cleaned.”

I see my dentist every month

595
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,600
to get my retainer looked at.

596
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,720
My teeth get deep cleaned monthly.

I’m sure I don’t have any plaque.

598

Speaking of minor accidents,

599
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,480
there’s this scene
where I have to fall off a bicycle.

600
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,320
I see.

601
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,240
Is it when you fall off and…

602
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:02,760
Yes.

603
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,560
I see.

604
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,600
There’s supposed to be some
soft landing to break the fall.

605
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,400
When we were rehearsing,

606
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,600
it went perfectly, right on the soft padding.

607
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,360
P’Pep told me to nail it just like that
when she yelled action.

608
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,120
So she said, “Action!”

609
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,880
We were on a bike when I fell
right onto the hard ground!

610
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,360
How was it?

611
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,280
I heard a loud thud.

612
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,040
We should have shot the rehearsal.

613
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:21,680
Totally.

614
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,000
P’Pep shouldn’t have trusted Ohm
to nail the scene twice.

615
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,960
This is P’Pep’s fault.

616
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,640
She should have filmed the rehearsal.

617
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,000
Totally.

618
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,160
She knows we always do better
when we’re not rolling.

619
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,280
She shouldn’t have expected
anything from the actual shoot.

If it were me,

I would have nailed it in one take.

625
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,040
He wouldn’t even have
the chance to make mistakes.

where she was also an assistant director.

After that, she’s been working as a director.

644
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,400
I have the chance to watch what she creates,

645

and love her work and this unique style of hers.

646
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:40,720
So I thought the time was right
to work with her as a director,

647
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,560
and gave her the idea for this series.

648
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,720
Since she’s a soft, mellow person,

and feel-good films,

650

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,920
she saw how she wanted the series to be like.

I feel like I can… share anything with her.

was going to direct this series,

[MARK PAKIN AS DR. JAY/OHM THIPAKORN AS SANT]

682
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,560
They sort of knew the two of us would be
starring in this series together.

683
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,160
That’s what I think.

684
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,720
I mean, you could have guessed it
from the Last Twilight concert.

685
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,240
Right.

686
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,320
If you could tell, you could tell
right away this was inevitable.

687
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,240
The feedback was good, right?

688
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,760
Everyone was eager to learn about this

689
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,440
and really looked forward to it.

690
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,320
It’s been roughly a year since then, right?

691
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,000
Right.

692
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,000
I’m quite glad that everyone adores us

693
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,040
and believes in our chemistry.

694
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,160
They believe in us.

695
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,680
It’s a really good feeling.

696
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,080
For me,

697
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,280
that press conference was
unlike any previous conferences.

698
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,640
I was happy and also sentimental.

699
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,800
I was nervous.

700
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,800
It was full of pressure, right?

701
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,440
We worried about how that would have turned out.

702
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,640
But eventually,

703
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,480
we got through what we thought
was the hardest part.

704
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,920
We got through that because of everyone.

705
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,920
We were worried about how we would be
received once the series was announced.

706
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,920
We wondered if anyone would even watch it.

707
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,800
But when we saw that the feedback was good,

708
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,800
it lit this fire within us to work even harder.

709
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,000
We know who we’re doing this for.

710
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,480
We know there are people waiting.

711
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,920
We’d love to thank you all for waiting.

712
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,080
The time has come now,

713
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,000
so please continue to support us.

714
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,320
’Morning.

715
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,640
(What are we doing today?)

716
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,920
Filming an MV.

717
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:52,680

Yeah.

721
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,080
It’s Magic Potion.

722
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,080
Oh, yeah.

723
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,800

You say something.

728
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,600
Oh.

729
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,719
This song…

730
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,480
It’s the first time we perform together.

731
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:27,000
It’s also the original soundtrack for our series.

732
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,520
It’s a feel-good song, don’t you think?

733
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:29,960
Yeah.

734
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,360
It’s easy to understand.

735
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,679
I think it’ll put a smile on people’s faces.

736
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,320
There’s not a lot of songs like this.

737
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,840
The music video is also fun.

738
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,520
It’s bright, for sure.

739
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,080
It fits with the mood of the song.

740
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,520
It’s bright, lively, boyfriend-material music.

741
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,480
It is.

742
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,120
It’s the theme of cohabitation and such.

743
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,320
Being lovey-dovey, that kind of thing.

744
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,120
I think this is the first time for the both of us

shooting a music video

746
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,440
for our own music.

747
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,040
Right.

748
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,120
We’ve only ever been on other people’s MVs.

749
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,480
This is the first time it’s for our own music.

750
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,520
Yes.

751
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,600
It’s new to me.

752
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,040
When it’s for other people’s music,

753
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,000
we don’t have to lipsync the words.

754
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,560
Right.

755
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,840
What do you mean, lip sync?

756
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,080
We actually sing it.

757
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,120
We sing it.

758
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:24,960
There’s no lip syncing here.

759
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,680
We’re singing.

We will.

It’s not all that fleshed out, these moves.

772
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,240
But it’s all a matter of improvising.

773
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,800
You can dance along with just your facial expressions.

774
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,080
No need to get up and dance for real.

some food for thoughts.

As for food for thoughts,

00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:09,280
it’s hidden within each character.

It’s a feel-good agenda

795
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,720
that will make you understand
what it’s like to be human,

796
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,440
and what it’s like to be a family, friends,

to have love, to work,

00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,200
to have dreams.

you will smile,

you might also cry,

but you will totally get it.

804
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,800
Like I said, it’s more of a “romantic therapy” genre.

00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,080
It will make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

just two people in love.

854
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:11,280
I’d love it if you spread the word,
make it a family time, even,

855
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,720
because it’s perfect for people of all ages.

856
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,480
Thank you for waiting.

857
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,720
It’s here now.

858
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,520
I have always done my best for my job,

859
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,360
and I promise you will be happy watching it.

860
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,880
Someone like me isn't even sure
if I’ll have money to buy food to chew tomorrow.

861
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,400
Hey!?

862
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,960
I don't know what you’re carrying,

863
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,640
but it might get lighter

864
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,040
if someone helps carry them.

865
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,960
You’re worth enough

866
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,640
to be someone’s partner, at least for me.

867
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,640
I need my daily dose, please.

868
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,720
Please look out for our series
Sweet Tooth Good Dentist.

869
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,800

871
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,560
See you.

872
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,120
Bye.

873
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:57,880
Goodbye.

874
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,880
Check it out, guys.

875
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,560

876
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,200
- before going to bed after the series ends.

877
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,960
Or else your breath will be as smelly as P’Mark’s.

878
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,640
Oh, how dare you!

879
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,680
You don’t get to tell me about—

880
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,560
This brand is recommended by most dentists.

881
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,120
It won’t cause tooth sensitivity.

882
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,840
So, what do I have to do to become the kind of
boyfriend most dentists would recommend?
