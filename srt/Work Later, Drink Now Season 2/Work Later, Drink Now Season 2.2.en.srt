00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:31,039
By the way,

7
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,340
what can we do about this?

8
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:35,570
Well...

9
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,539
What Hyun Ju can't do, but we can.

10
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:40,149
Right.

11
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,350
Let's go.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,920
(Gone Drinkers, Part 2)

13
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,119
Done.

14
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:56,929
Have we ever been this dedicated to something before?

15
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:07,109
Thank you.

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,709
Thanks.

17
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,849
We poured in all of the money we had saved up,

18
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:15,750
our talent,

19
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,620
and the stamina that let us drink like horses.

20
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,489
The first order of business...

21
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:27,560
was to see what we could do and what we couldn't do.

22
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,089
(What we can't do)

23
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,358
(What about drinking water? We need a hose.)

24

(Staying positive, No drinking, Meditation, No arguments)

27
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,968
Tug on it and it'll unravel easily.

28
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:40,310
I studied this knot, and it can be easily untied.

29
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,510
- What the... - It won't unravel.

30
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,879
- Seriously. - I can't...

31
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:46,849
Why won't it unravel? Is it this end?

32
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,518
Here.

33
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:55,150
There. You won't be able to untie it.

34
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,750
Sweet, right?

35
00:01:57,989 --> 00:01:59,290
I untied it!

36
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,328
No way.

37
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,759
Why did it unravel? Take it as a gift.

38
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,159
- Thank you. - Darn it.

39
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,509
But then again, who are we?

40
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,110
We'll take what we can't do and make sure it's done.

41
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:53,949
Gosh.

42
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,029
- Gosh. - Darn, I'm exhausted.

43
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,258
- Here. - My arm.

44
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,468
- My legs are like jelly. - Are you all right?

45
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:16,229
Sorry about that. Here.

46
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:17,969
It hurts.

47
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,369
- Get over here already! - She must be stiff all over.

48
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,110
- Come on. Let's go. - It hurts.

49
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,709

50

(Refrigerator, Campfire)

52
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,749
And then came the day...

53
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,349
when what we could do surpassed what we couldn't do by far.

54
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:36,960
Shall we get going, then?

55
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,319
- Is it finally time? - Yes.

56
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,029
- Let's do this, then. - All right!

57
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,599
Let's go.

58
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,110
Doesn't it feel like there will be ghosts around here?

59
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:58,709
- What? - What is it?

60
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,109
There's a bug!

61
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,508
What did you expect in the woods? Get a grip on yourself.

62
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,379
But I hate bugs and insects.

63
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:06,878
Should we come back some other time?

64
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,719
We're too far away from the city.

65
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,659
Do you remember where we parked the car?

66
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:11,918
I do.

67
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,628
There's no cell reception.

68
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:16,629
No cell reception means we're on the right track. Come on.

69
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,059
- Really? - Yes.

70
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,129
But I don't want to.

71
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:22,100
This way.

72
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,469
Are you sure there aren't more bugs?

73
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,969
Please. What if there are snakes?

74
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,040
There aren't any.

75
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,339
It's a spider web! Hey, check out the flowers.

76
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,480
- What now? - Okay, let's see.

77
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,689
The mountain is higher to the Northwest,

78
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,589
and there's a slope to the Southeast.

79
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,959
Look. This is where we are.

80
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,528
Behind us is a tall mountain,

81
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:51,929
- and a stream is ahead of us. - Right.

82
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,328
- Can I have a tissue? - A tissue?

83
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:54,699
- Yes. - Got it.

84
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:57,899
All right.

85
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,970
It's been windy all day, but the air is now still.

86
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,680
There isn't any crosswind, and nothing's blocking the sun.

87
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:06,938
- In other words... - Is this the ideal spot?

88
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,049
That's it.

89
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,209
- Let's check the energy here. - Sure thing.

90
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,480
- Like this. Here we go. - Sure.

91
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:17,019
- What on earth? - Gosh.

92
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,359
Here. This is the spot.

93
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,000
You guys were like detectives just now.

94
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,970
- I can't believe it worked. - We're good.

95
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,169
Guys, there's poop here. Isn't that a good sign?

96
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,500
- Poop? - Yes, poop.

97
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,869
- Poop. - Gosh, that's a lot.

98
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,809
I wonder whose it is. Is there any more around here?

99
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,839
Hey, let's get digging. The shovel, please.

100
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,050
Nice.

101
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,879
The weeds have overgrown.

102
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:49,850
- I love the smell of soil. - This is a lot of work.

103
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,689
Okay, let me see.

104
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:57,300
Gosh, the soil here is fine.

105
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,399
This is the spot.

106
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:05,470
Girls, let's hold hands.

107
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,040
Hands.

108
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,750
I can feel it.

109
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,319
The ground's energy.

110
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,319
The warmth of the sun.

111
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,149
The texture of the wind.

112
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,420
It sure is relaxing.

113
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,189
I'm sure of it. This has to be a good spot.

114
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:36,429
- What on earth? - What is that?

115
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,499
- What was that? - What screeched?

116
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,769
(Reinforcements for windows)

117
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,268
Videos online...

118
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:44,439
make you think that anything can be done easily.

119
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,208
This is too heavy.

120
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:48,479
Push on two.

121
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,219
- One, two. - Two.

122
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,448
- One, two. - Two!

123
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:55,888
- One... - Then we get to realize...

124
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:58,060
that there's more to the work than what is seen on the videos.

125
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,120
A bee!

126
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,789
- But by then, it's too late. - It's gone.

127
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,829
Gosh.

128
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,828
Because we have already moved out of our homes.

129
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:06,829
Darn it.

130
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,800
For this day,

131
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:10,540
we trained in various fields.

132
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,109
The training we went under at the arcade...

133
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,980
finally proved its worth.

134
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,500
- One, two. - One, two.

135
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,799
There wasn't anyone...

136
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,269
who actually believed that this could work.

137
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,039
But what I can say for sure...

138
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,509
is that it can be done when push comes to shove.

139
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,879
- Are we good? - It's good enough.

140
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,278
No matter the circumstances,

141
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,818
there was always a way to eat, sleep, and excrete.

142
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:33,220
- Gosh, that feels good. - We were able to spend...

143
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,989
more and more time out in the wild...

144
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,389
which felt impossible at first.

145
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,330
We overcame the fear by believing in one another.

146
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,460
We did it!

147
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:48,330
We couldn't have done it alone. But as a group, we prevailed.

148
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,729
- Ji Yeon. - Yes?

149
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,798
Tomorrow,

150
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:53,038
we'll build a fireplace inside and light it up for warmth.

151
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:55,538
A chimney will also go up.

152
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:56,808
Starting tomorrow, we'll have heat therapy.

153
00:08:56,809 --> 00:08:58,710
- Okay. - Got it.

154
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,950
- Hello, ladies. - Hello.

155
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,788
Sorry to bother you,

156
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:10,789
We're from the mountain over there.

157
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,129
We came to ask if we could use your electricity.

158
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:16,990
Can we?

159
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,529
We promise to pay for it.

160
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,000
Please.

161
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,669
How long will you be there for?

162
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,509
Do you want some chilli peppers?

163
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,009
We have dried radish strips too.

164
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,750
- We'll be back again! - See you again!

165
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,580
- Look at all this. - I know.

166
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:41,350
Someone must be sick.

167
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:46,418
We got electricity from a home down the mountain,

168
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,690
and clean water from a stream up the mountain.

169
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:53,970
Hey, we have water!

170
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,070
This is amazing.

171
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,600
Our chickens didn't run away today.

172
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,969
Hello.

173
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,769
Hi. Gosh, I'm exhausted.

174
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,279
The sweeties.

175
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:06,878
It looks like you gathered a lot.

176
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,809
They're just greens, but still.

177
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:10,949
"Just greens, but still?"

178
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,178
You can't get these anywhere in Seoul.

179
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,990
Then dinner is bibimbap with seasoned greens and...

180
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:17,860
fried eggs!

181
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:20,388
- They laid eggs? - Yes, two.

182
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:22,758
Our dear chickens.

183
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:25,298
Well done. Good for you. Come here.

184
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:26,799
There are three of us.

185
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,940
One more scoop.

186
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:33,469
- Mix it up! - Mix it up!

187
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,940
Mix it up!

188
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,340
It looks so good.

189
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,350
How is it?

190
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,148
The egg makes all the difference.

191
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:49,149
Doesn't it?

192
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,789
- Shall we wet our throats? - We must.

193
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
Yes.

194
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:54,159
- Let's drink. - Cheers.

195
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,500
We'd quit drinking alcohol.

196
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:03,470
It's detox tea.

197
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,070
Dried radish greens,

198
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:06,639
carrots,

199
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,539
dried radish, burdock,

200
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,038
oh, and some shiitake mushrooms.

201
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,979
I can tell it's made with love and care.

202
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,980
Right.

203
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:19,519
We quit drinking.

204
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,889
It's as rare as the sight of a chicken flying.

205
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,429
Hey.

206
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:30,860
The nights are seriously long up here in the mountain.

207
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,399
What time is it?

208
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,399
Right now?

209
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:35,398
It's 6:40pm.

210
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,569
- It's that early? - No way.

211
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,710
The old us would slowly be getting ready to leave home...

212
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:46,139
"Hello, it's us again."

213
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:50,820
Can I have some chicken feet with lots of Cheongyang chillies?

214
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,288
And a bottle of soju. Cold.

215
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:55,849
Do you want a beer too?

216
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,148
The first shot must be a mixer.

217
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,558
- Two-to-one, deal? - Deal.

218
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:00,789
Here comes the beer.

219
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:02,259
Pop.

220
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:03,759
Pow.

221
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:04,859
Hold out your glasses.

222
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,758
- Here comes the soju. - Nice.

223
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,499
And then I pour.

224
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,298
The clear sound you only hear the first time.

225
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:15,039
- What a lovely sight. - Here comes the beer.

226
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,940
A smooth pour.

227
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:19,278
How about I use my wrist this time?

228
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,450
At an orchard on the outskirts of the village, bottom's up.

229
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:23,750
Take your own.

230
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:25,149
Let's drink!

231
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,379
- Let's drink! - Let's drink.

232
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,628
The chicken feet is here.

233
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,258
It's hot, so take your time.

234
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:38,859
- Chicken feet! - Chicken feet!

235
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,200
- Gloves, gloves. - Right.

236
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,039
It's hot.

237
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,519
Shall we stop?

238
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:02,389
Shall we?

239
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,590
I was ready for one more shot.

240
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,058
Aren't you getting the signal?

241
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:08,159
- I am. - Yes.

242
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,229
Let's go. It's about time.

243
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,230
Right now?

244
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:13,059
Running will only make it worse.

245
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:15,628
We must gather our energy for this.

246
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,469
- Oh, dear. - Watch your step.

247
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,138
(Pretty Girls' Toilet)

248
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:21,070
- Hey, guess what. - What?

249
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,070
We pooped together every day since we moved here.

250
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:28,148
I got it. There's this rhythm thing.

251
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:29,149
- What's that? - What's it called?

252
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:30,149
Yes.

253
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:31,149
"Biorhythm?"

254
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,320
- Yes. - Yes, that.

255
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,048
- That's it. - Yes, biorhythm.

256
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:36,249
We must be synced.

257
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,320
- Yes. - In rhythm.

258
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,819
Biorhythm.

259
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,590
This is nice.

260
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,700
What's this smell?

261
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,569
You guys need to wait for me.

262
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,629
Gosh, you're so rude.

263
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,039
I feel so much better.

264
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,799
- Me too. - Gosh.

265
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:55,939
Should we have built it closer?

266
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,580
- Yes, it's far, isn't it? - A bit?

267
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:58,679
Is it?

268
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:02,250
- Hey. - What?

269
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:04,950
Why do you keep putting the teddy bear up there?

270
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,418
Goodness. What's that doing up there?

271
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:08,690
You left it there.

272
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:12,219
I did not. Why would I do that with something I hug in bed?

273
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,820
I bet it was you.

274
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:16,059
It wasn't me.

275
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,730
Don't you lie.

276
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,898
It wasn't me. Why'd I put it up there?

277
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:24,500
I have so much else to do.

278
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:28,070
Then who did it?

279
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:34,779
Darn it.

280
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:37,449
What was that?

281
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,649
I don't know.

282
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,100
Shoot.

283
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,899
Did you... see something?

284
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,269
I'm not sure,

285
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:02,409
but it bothers me.

286
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,149
Could you tell me if there is something?

287
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,379
Knowing won't do you any good.

288
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,220
You won't stay for long, right?

289
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,320
We're here to heal in nature.

290
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,220
My friend's sick.

291
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:20,220
We have to get better.

292
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,429
All mountains are haunted.

293
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,070
There are lots of graves.

294
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,869
This village has an extra lot of vengeful women.

295
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,899
Don't you scare her.

296
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,740
All graves are in good spots.

297
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,580
Actually,

298
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,220
I saw something like bones.

299
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,929
I don't believe in ghosts.

300
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,439
If you scare us and keep us up,

301
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,039
I will really kill you.

302
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:10,369
Are you already dead? Anyway, I have a nasty temper.

303
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,278
If you so much as touch a hair on us,

304
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:16,379
then I swear I'll follow you to the end of the earth to end you.

305
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,990
I tend to speak harshly.

306
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:27,759
Don't take it all to heart.

307
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:30,730
I heard a little about you.

308
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:32,658
I don't get you, to be honest.

309
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,798
Why would you die for a man?

310
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,470
Even if life was horrid back then,

311
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,340
didn't you have pride? Were men your everything?

312
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,409
Darn it. I went and upset her again.

313
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:44,409
Sorry.

314
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:46,580
I'm off. Isn't this pretty?

315
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,529
(3 months later)

316
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,900
They must be mating.

317
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:15,339
It's high time.

318
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,440
There's a bug on your side.

319
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,380
We're friends now.

320
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:24,149
We got accustomed to life in the mountains.

321
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,578
I'm heading to the stream to do laundry.

322
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:26,749
Do you have anything?

323
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,950
- No. - Ji Yeon?

324
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:30,750
Why bother washing clothes when there's no one to see?

325
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,559
Ji Yeon stopped looking into the mirror she couldn't do without.

326
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,759
Ji Goo quit smoking cigarettes which she couldn't do without.

327
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,369
Workaholic me even stopped using my phone all the time.

328
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,200
We actually became one with nature.

329
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:50,470
It's done.

330
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,818
Wow, it looks good.

331
00:17:57,819 --> 00:18:00,450
- Do you like it? - It's comforting.

332
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:03,319
Why don't we call the protective spirit "Yang Ki Nam?"

333
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:05,059
- Yang Ki Nam? - Yes.

334
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:08,059
Three women living together is way too much female energy.

335
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,890
Well, yes, you have a point.

336
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:11,259
I like it. "Man of Energy."

337
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,699
But it looks like it's missing something.

338
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,700
What?

339
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:17,430
I'm off to do the washing.

340
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:18,599
Okay.

341
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:23,068
No, don't you dare.

342
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:24,679
- Hey! Get out! - What is it?

343
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,139
- The wild boars. - Are they back?

344
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,309
- Yes. - Again? Darn it!

345
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,819
- That's just wrong. - Right.

346
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:36,690
Is that so?

347
00:18:40,589 --> 00:18:42,690
Those little pigs come during the day now.

348
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,230
Who do you think you're messing with?

349
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,730
Let's get guns in Seoul and shoot them with it.

350
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,299
You darn little pigs. Move!

351
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:53,039
What on earth?

352
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,339
She has lost it.

353
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:56,838
(Makgeolli)

354
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,039
Hold that for me.

355
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,109
Okay.

356
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,220
My dad told me that wild boars go crazy over makgeolli.

357
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,818
Once they tumble into this,

358
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:12,420
they won't be able to crawl back out.

359
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,289
I see we have something in common.

360
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,700
Darn it.

361
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,769
Gosh.

362
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,008
Got it.

363
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:35,009
- No, don't. - Wait.

364
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,048
- Don't. - Why not?

365
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,750
- No! - Don't open it!

366
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:51,430
(Makgeolli)

367
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,519
Guys.

368
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,429
What was that just now?

369
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,130
Tell me about it. I was completely out of it.

370
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:29,670
Why don't we have a drink?

371
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:33,799
No.

372
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:37,710
We'll meditate. I've been wanting to do it anyway.

373
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:40,039
- Namaste. - Sure.

374
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:54,960
(Kim Hyun Ju)

375
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,759
It didn't get any worse.

376
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,470
But the change isn't all that dramatic.

377
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:12,880
We'll see how you are in three months.

378
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,410
Sure.

379
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,119
Did we choose the best option?

380
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:26,019
Was chemotherapy the right way to go?

381
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,690
Would it have been better to do both?

382
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:32,099
Like every other patient and doctor,

383
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,930
we take a gamble...

384
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,730
while not knowing the right answer.

385
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:40,099
Ji Yeon...

386
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:46,539
She's asleep.

387
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,450
Right. She must be exhausted.

388
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,730
Are we...

389
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:05,400
doing the right thing?

390
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,869
I was about to ask you that.

391
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,170
What if...

392
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,910
What if this was the wrong choice?

393
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,450
That is a possibility. I could've been wrong.

394
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:28,150
Why would you blame yourself...

395
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:30,190
when it was a group decision?

396
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,390
If only I had let her...

397
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:37,859
receive chemotherapy.

398
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,159
You would've been wrong!

399
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,098
You almost gave me a heart attack!

400
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:43,129
Weren't you asleep?

401
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,268
I would've had to do it alone, and you know I lack tenacity.

402
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:47,269
After a few sessions, I would've bolted.

403
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:51,068
All those bars used to be ours to drink at.

404
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,179
I'll get better soon so that we can grab a few.

405
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,779
It's a green light. Go on.

406
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,079
It was the twist I hoped for,

407
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:01,990
but Ji Yeon kept pretending to be asleep.

408
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:06,960
Ji Yeon, we know you're not asleep.

409
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:08,828
Don't keep anything bottled up inside.

410
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:10,390
It'll only stress you out.

411
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:13,299
We won't pretend to be fine with everything,

412
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,099
so cry if you want to...

413
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,799
and be angry at the world.

414
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:27,380
Ji Yeon was truly the mother of all twists.

415
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,480
She was actually asleep.

416
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,589
She fools us every time, but we fell for it once again.

417
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,630
Whenever she seemed cheerier than usual...

418
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:45,930
- Ji Yeon. - Yes?

419
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:47,558
You don't have to fake it.

420
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,528
Just say it's taking a toll on you.

421
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:51,329
How can you not find this funny?

422
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,970
Fine.

423
00:23:56,539 --> 00:24:00,240
The fact that she's one-dimensional is the greatest twist of all.

424
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:04,079
- This doesn't seem right. - It isn't.

425
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,049
- She laughs at what's funny. - Come on.

426
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:16,089
What is it? Does it hurt?

427
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,500
My mom visited me in my dream.

428
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,659
She cries when she's sad.

429
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,630
- Your mom? - Yes.

430
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:26,200
One, two, three, four,

431
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,039
five, six, seven, eight.

432
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,979
- She goes when nature calls. - One, two,

433
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,609
three, four.

434
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,779
(Pretty Girls' Toilet)

435
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:40,979
She jumps up and down when she's happy.

436
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,890
Guys, come on out. The cloud is in a shape of a heart!

437
00:24:49,829 --> 00:24:51,059
She sleeps when she's tired.

438
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,430
Gosh.

439
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,399
She does what she's told to do.

440
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,240
Ji Yeon, get up. It's your turn to start the fire.

441
00:24:58,299 --> 00:24:59,640
Okay.

442
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:02,308
You'll be going into the water too.

443
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:04,209
We're taking a bath today.

444
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,309
Okay.

445
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,480
You have to write your name with your butt today.

446
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,209
Okay.

447
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,880
With your pants down.

448
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,680
Okay.

449
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,450
- What? - She was willing to do it all.

450
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:18,048
Those sick...

451
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,788
- question everything. - You agreed to do it.

452
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:21,858
They wonder if a certain method can help them get better...

453
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:23,829
or if it's the right course of treatment.

454
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,500
However, Ji Yeon questioned nothing.

455
00:25:27,829 --> 00:25:30,029
She blindly put her faith in us.

456
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:33,598
No way. It worked.

457
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:37,309
Guys, come quick. We got one!

458
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:40,140
You're all dead meat. Let's see how big it is.

459
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,180
- Hey. - What?

460
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:47,880
It's only a boarlet.

461
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:50,519
- What? - It's a baby.

462
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,589
Is a young boar allowed to drink? When it's that young?

463
00:25:57,329 --> 00:25:58,359
There it goes.

464
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,130
Were we right to release it?

465
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,400
It's only a boarlet.

466
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:02,799
A darn boarlet.

467
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,268
Wild boars must have been walking down this path...

468
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:07,269
before we ever settled down here.

469
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,038
Since we are the intruders,

470
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:12,078
we had to find a way to share the land.

471
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,740
What are you doing over there?

472
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:15,549
This much is fine.

473
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,759
Once again, we predicted correctly.

474
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:29,390
Guys, check it out. They cleaned it out.

475
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:31,329
- Really? - Yes.

476
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,598
The wild boars...

477
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:35,630
had their makgeolli and left quietly.

478
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,999
What startled us more than the wild boars...

479
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,039
- Tell me about it. - were the people.

480
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,970
- What is it? - What's wrong?

481
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:46,180
- Where? - What's going on?

482
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,210
It's a human being!

483
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:52,979
Why don't you dig in first?

484
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,779
- I'll enjoy this, Ms. Han. - Sure.

485
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:01,119
It's good.

486
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:03,859
You look like a foreigner getting a taste of Korean cuisine.

487
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:05,160
It's delicious.

488
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,299
- He looks like Robinson Crusoe. - Right.

489
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,930
What is it?

490
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,630
- Is it a wild boar? - What's wrong?

491
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:12,869
A wild boar?

492
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,680
No, it's nothing. Please dig in.

493
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,278
- Are these organic? - We harvested these ourselves.

494
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,318
Of course, it has to be good.

495
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,549
You're all grown up.

496
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,420
Go on and eat.

497
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,420
Thanks.

498
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:39,660
Wow, this is crazy.

499
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:45,269
I should go now.

500
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:48,339
I'm not sure if I should leave you here.

501
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,970
It gets so dark at night.

502
00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:51,339
I feel the chills too.

503
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:53,979
This is a good spot so you needn't worry.

504
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,048
- You watch out for yourself. - Yes.

505
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,279
Do you know the way?

506
00:27:57,549 --> 00:27:58,549
I do.

507
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,779
What?

508
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:01,919
- What? - You don't know.

509
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,150
It's not that way, it's this way.

510
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:05,959
- You're right. - Goodness.

511
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,359
Bye, then. See you in Seoul.

512
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:09,890
Take care.

513
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,758
- Goodbye. - Bye.

514
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,328
- Take care. - I will.

515
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:14,599
Oh, dear.

516
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:16,869
Don't worry.

517
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:19,970
What a weird taste.

518
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,108
Goodness. What's that about?

519
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:24,940
Director Kang came and went,

520
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,339
and the severely cold winter came upon us.

521
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,150
It's the season when all things huddle and hide.

522
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:33,819
We were told we'd be lucky if Ji Yeon stayed stable at all.

523
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:44,529
Even she couldn't escape the clutches of winter.

524
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:57,410
You didn't sleep last night, did you?

525
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,440
No. I dreamed of...

526
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,809
a woman in white who asked me...

527
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:05,079
to come with her.

528
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,079
Am I dying?

529
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:11,220
You'd see a Grim Reaper if you were dying.

530
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,920
Not a woman in white.

531
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,660
Right?

532
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:17,959
I'd prefer a Grim Reaper over a woman any day.

533
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,459
Stop talking. You have a fever.

534
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,598
Have I ever not been with a man for this long in my life?

535
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:25,599
Darn it.

536
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:27,400
I quit smoking for you.

537
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,338
Quitting men is nothing like quitting smoking.

538
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:33,308
Cigarettes have no use but men do.

539
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:35,879
When did you ever date a guy with any use?

540
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,009
You of all people shouldn't say that.

541
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:41,278
I'm just saying men are better than cigarettes.

542
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,289
Darn you.

543
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,450
That's enough.

544
00:29:44,089 --> 00:29:45,389
She's running a fever.

545
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,490
I'm burning up inside.

546
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,190
Whatever.

547
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:54,630
Did you have to upset her when you're sick?

548
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,730
Hearing her tell me off when I'm sick...

549
00:29:58,099 --> 00:29:59,440
makes it a little more bearable.

550
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,809
What a joke.

551
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:16,390
That wasn't good enough?

552
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,559
Why are you digging?

553
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,759
I have something to do.

554
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,399
- Are you going somewhere? - Up the mountain.

555
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,729
To dig something up to feed her.

556
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,240
Is there anything to dig in this cold?

557
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:36,170
If there is something out there, it'll be the real deal.

558
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:38,009
Don't dig too much or you'll hurt your back.

559
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,578
Watch your step and don't slip.

560
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:40,640
- I won't. - See you.

561
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,879
When we first came here,

562
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,049
we were so sure.

563
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,819
That we could do anything.

564
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:55,118
Girls. Whenever Ji Yeon's condition worsens,

565
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,190
bring her right over.

566
00:30:56,589 --> 00:30:58,829
There are benefits to relying on nature,

567
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:00,959
but if stubbornness becomes a belief,

568
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,869
it's worse than nothing at all.

569
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,630
It's possible...

570
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,710
there's not much left that we can do.

571
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,099
Let's see.

572
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,599
There has to be some mistletoe here.

573
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:41,299
All I see are mushrooms.

574
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,880
What the...

575
00:31:56,549 --> 00:31:58,250
Stay there. What on earth?

576
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:07,200
Shoot. Why?

577
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,170
Don't come closer!

578
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:23,109
Come at me.

579
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:24,849
Fight me, you punk!

580
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:38,859
It's a baby.

581
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:40,599
Is a young boar allowed to drink?

582
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,940
Darn it, I was scared pantless.

583
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,839
What was that?

584
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,819
Darn it.

585
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:07,519
Did I wet myself?

586
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,059
Oh, shoot.

587
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,329
Is this poop? Darn it.

588
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,069
Darn it.

589
00:33:23,609 --> 00:33:24,609
What?

590
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,879
I've never put so much care...

591
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,309
into something I couldn't care less about.

592
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:31,650
Help us out.

593
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,680
Help us.

594
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:47,430
Does Ki Nam...

595
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,629
have it at last? How interesting.

596
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:52,869
Don't touch it. It hasn't hardened yet.

597
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,068
I see.

598
00:33:55,069 --> 00:33:59,038
It hasn't hardened yet, has it?

599
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,079
Guys!

600
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,349
- What? - I got lucky!

601
00:34:03,349 --> 00:34:04,349
This is...

602
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,690
I found wild ginseng!

603
00:34:27,269 --> 00:34:28,269
Here.

604
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:32,210
Eat it slowly, over a long time.

605
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,480
Chew on it.

606
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,550
There you go.

607
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,489
Good girl.

608
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,889
It's bitter.

609
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,900
No, don't swallow it yet. Chew a bit longer.

610
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,940
Chew it for ages, until you sucked out all the juices.

611
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,079
What have you done?

612
00:35:08,849 --> 00:35:10,349
Wait. Let's see.

613
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:12,179
You swallowed it already?

614
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,848
You swallowed everything?

615
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:15,319
- Yes. - But...

616
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,448
Yes. Swallow every little bit stuck between your teeth.

617
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:18,449
- Okay. - That's it.

618
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,360
I ate it all.

619
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:22,829
Then rinse your palate with detox tea.

620
00:35:23,429 --> 00:35:25,530
Won't that detox the wild ginseng's properties?

621
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,800
She's right.

622
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:29,929
- Don't drink this. - Okay.

623
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:33,098
Don't eat or drink even water until you poop.

624
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:35,039
I won't ever do that.

625
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,340
I'll keep it inside me for as long as possible.

626
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,209
That's a bit gross.

627
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,779
- Is it? - Let's go.

628
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,380
Was it the wild ginseng?

629
00:35:44,849 --> 00:35:47,550
Or was it Yang Ki Nam sporting lots of male energy?

630
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:52,659
Doesn't Yang Ki Nam look like Director Toe?

631
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,460
It's not this big.

632
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,408
Ji Yeon recovered...

633
00:36:11,409 --> 00:36:13,579
as if she'd never been sick.

634
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,440
Twenty-eight.

635
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,349
Forty-eight.

636
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:19,349
Forty-nine.

637
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:22,419
One more. Let's do one more.

638
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,420
One more?

639
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,558
- Well done. - Yes!

640
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,659
- What's next? - Well done.

641
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,289
- Slowly. - Okay.

642
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:31,559
Make sure you don't slip.

643
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,259
Left, left.

644
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:37,070
Like so, we overcame the harsh winter.

645
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,309
I'll see you again in six months.

646
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:52,779
Six months?

647
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,349
Six months and not three months?

648
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,090
You ultimately did it. Congratulations.

649
00:36:58,389 --> 00:36:59,619
Thank you, Hyun Ju.

650
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,360
Ji Yeon.

651
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,800
The 3-month interval became a 6-month interval.

652
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,400
Come in again six months later.

653
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,239
Your cancer levels, neutrophils,

654
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,510
white blood cells, and liver index are all normal.

655
00:37:18,909 --> 00:37:20,980
Another six months passed,

656
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:24,409
and it became autumn.

657
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,550
You can come in a year later now.

658
00:37:30,889 --> 00:37:31,988
For real?

659
00:37:31,989 --> 00:37:33,989
Hyun Ju. This isn't a dream, is it?

660
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:36,929
She can even participate in the triathlon with this result.

661
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,429
You're amazing, Ji Yeon.

662
00:37:40,829 --> 00:37:42,929
I only did as these two told me to.

663
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:47,199
- Great job. - You had it tough until now.

664
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:53,939
There was a time we doubted our decision...

665
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,849
as we walked out of this hospital.

666
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:01,649
But when we were faced with the result...

667
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,750
that our decision was the best,

668
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:08,789
we became cheeky for a moment.

669
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:14,099
"Our decision was right."

670
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:18,530
"Our faith was something," is what we thought.

671
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:25,780
Hey. Are you still travelling?

672
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:31,150
You better come back now.

673
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,488
Two and half years ago, the owner of Obok House...

674
00:38:36,489 --> 00:38:39,820
went on a backpacking trip the moment we disappeared.

675
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:41,519
And...

676
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,059
in the meantime, the world was...

677
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:48,300
said to have been calm and more peaceful than ever.

678
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,238
- What? - Oh, my gosh.

679
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:02,179
- What's this? - Is something happening?

680
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,179
- But everyone felt that day... - Oh, no.

681
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,119
was just around the corner.

682
00:39:20,429 --> 00:39:22,429
What's going on?

683
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,320
(Obok House)

684
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,409
(Obok House)

685
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,820
(Obok)

686
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,389
(Obok)

687
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:28,619
(Let's Drink)

688
00:42:20,179 --> 00:42:21,340
Thank you.

689
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,570
Let's drink?

690
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:20,639
You did well.

691
00:43:36,889 --> 00:43:38,019
Thanks.

692
00:43:43,929 --> 00:43:48,159
It was one day when our 26-month-long abstinence ended.

693
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:57,639
(Mic Game)

694
00:43:58,539 --> 00:44:00,579
When was the hardest after moving into the mountain?

695
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:02,539
Let's see.

696
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:06,050
The first day. No, scratch that.

697
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:09,750
It was the first month after we came here.

698
00:44:09,889 --> 00:44:11,820
It was really hard that time.

699
00:44:12,789 --> 00:44:14,659
I was scared and at a loss.

700
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:18,130
There were times when I wondered what I was doing here.

701
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:21,659
So a bit back then.

702
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,738
Nothing gave me a hard time.

703
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:28,599
I'd really appreciate it...

704
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:32,510
if you could answer the question with a little more sincerity.

705
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:33,908
But nothing was tough for me.

706
00:44:33,909 --> 00:44:36,679
Would you have had a hard time when your friend was sick?

707
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:39,010
Well, I never had a friend who was sick.

708
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:43,789
There's at least one person like that in your life.

709
00:44:43,949 --> 00:44:45,320
If not, you haven't met them yet.

710
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:51,929
I'm not sure. I'm not the type to get stressed over things.

711
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:53,360
But...

712
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:00,469
(Mic Game)

713
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:07,980
What was the question again?

714
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,449
