(Department of Korean Language and Literature)

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,940
It's nice to meet you.

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,840
I didn't like alcohol or knew my limits when I was in university.

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,439
I drank a glass to prove that I had become an adult.

12
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:41,479
I drank another glass, fascinated by how I'm getting drunk.

13
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,920
I poured in the alcohol faster,

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,219
and by the time I started feeling the alcohol flowing down my throat,

15
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:53,530
its bitter taste went away,

16
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:54,890
and it became like water.

17
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,929
From that moment, it's not me drinking the alcohol.

18
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,729
My legs...

19
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:03,200
It's not me falling down.

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,239
Are you okay?

21
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,879
Mine.

22
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,250
It's sad.

23
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,390
That's when I first knew...

24
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:25,420
that I can't bear watching poor things when I'm drunk.

25
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:29,530
You were standing in punishment...

26
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,060
when all you have left are bones.

27
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,359
What are you looking at?

28
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,599
And that I become aggressive against everything else.

29
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,799
Look away!

30
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,340
In a state where no one can calm me,

31
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,209
not even the police or the president,

32
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,980
there's only one thing that calms me down.

33
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:48,510
- And that's... - An So Hee.

34
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,920
when Ji Goo calls my name, An So Hee.

35
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,219
Get your bag.

36
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:55,989
That's right.

37
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,390
The fact that I packed my bag after causing all the scenes...

38
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,530
means that my consciousness was back.

39
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,959
That's what taking the bag means for drunk people.

40
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,370
- Cheers. - Love shot.

41
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,770
Of course, I wasn't the only one like this.

42
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,099
- Hold on. - Let's just drink.

43
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,870
I don't like this.

44
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:16,610
Darn it. This is no fun.

45
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,110
Seriously.

46
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,979
She said she doesn't want to do a love shot with you.

47
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,979
Is Korean that hard for you?

48
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:26,419
None of your business.

49
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,650
Who are you to interfere?

50
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:34,360
Ji Goo had a drunk habit...

51
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,560
of turning everything upside down...

52
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,199
when she got angry.

53
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,599
Ji Goo.

54
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,930
There's a larger table here. Throw this one too.

55
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,330
Turn all the tables. Let's finish them today.

56
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,599
Surprisingly, it was Ji Yeon who could calm her down.

57
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:51,139
Han Ji Yeon, the bigger psycho.

58
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,449
That's so funny.

59
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:00,219
Who are you?

60
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:03,150
We are one nation, one family,

61
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,159
and my name is Han Ji Yeon.

62
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,629
What a coincidence to meet you. I'll join you.

63
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:09,889
Ji Yeon had a drinking habit...

64
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,759
of joining any table.

65
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,229
She wouldn't get chased right away thanks to her pretty face,

66
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:15,729
but that didn't last ten minutes.

67
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:18,199
The drinks are so sweet today.

68
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,969
It's so delicious,

69
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:25,210
- and it's... - The only words...

70
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,750
that could calm Ji Yeon were...

71
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,110
- Let's go, Ji Yeon. - And...

72
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,150
Ji Goo is coming.

73
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,620
I had lots of fun today.

74
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,789
We may have gotten heavily drunk,

75
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:38,120
but we somehow managed to take our bags...

76
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,360
and look out for each other.

77
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:42,330
Perhaps that's the reason why...

78
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,129
- Where should we go? - we weren't...

79
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:45,159
- afraid to get drunk. - Right.

80
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:49,629
- Right. - Right.

81
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,439
What are you doing?

82
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,969
That's what happened.

83
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:53,969
What's that?

84
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,210
What are you doing?

85
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,710
What?

86
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:05,449
Gosh.

87
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,490
Get up.

88
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,189
Goodness.

89
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,090
What's this?

90
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,699
People who've been dead drunk...

91
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:20,970
would automatically know...

92
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,269
that we should be taking care...

93
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,000
of this man.

94
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,509
What do we do with him?

95
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:29,310
Hey.

96
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:33,779
- I feel sad for him. - What?

97
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:36,850
What's there to pity? He's a man who's enjoyed his drinks.

98
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,980
No. I pity him.

99
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,420
She's obsessed again. You know her.

100
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,620
This is his address, but he lives quite far away.

101
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,519
- You're going to carry him? - I can do it.

102
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,860
She's already carried him. We can't stop her now.

103
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,699
What are we doing after a good drink?

104
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,699
- Let's hurry. - Where do you live?

105
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:58,100
(Part 7, May Seem Like Nothing, But Turns Out Helpful)

106
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,110
You're strong. Isn't he heavy?

107
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,540
He's not pitiful. He looks fine.

108
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,639
(Part 7, May Seem Like Nothing, But Turns Out Helpful)

109
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:06,180
Vrikshasana.

110
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,250
This pose...

111
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,980
is a pose of a tree deeply rooted in the ground,

112
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,420
mentioned in the Goraksha-satakam, the yoga scripture.

113
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,160
It symbolizes the good tree that makes the meditator...

114
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,029
accomplish things and makes their wish come true.

115
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,730
How about we fulfill the wish of the person who lasts the longest?

116
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,040
I said multiple times...

117
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,769
that the Asana training shouldn't be done...

118
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:37,509
- in such a light way. - You're not confident, right?

119
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,759
Don't drink beer alone next time.

120
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,620
It's not a great place, but we can drink together here.

121
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,970
- Hello. - You scared me.

122
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,379
I didn't come here.

123
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:14,379
I came to deliver to the first floor of the building next to it.

124
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:15,879
What a fate-like coincidence.

125
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,220
- What? - I usually don't come here...

126
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,680
around this time.

127
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,319
I suppose we're destined to be together today.

128
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,290
Let's go.

129
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,389
("Mic Game")

130
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,300
Cut.

131
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,800
Why are you sweating on the food?

132
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:15,810
I'm sorry, my body sweats a lot.

133
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,509
- Will you get him a towel, Ah Reum? - I'll get it.

134
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:21,310
I know it can be hot because of the strong lighting.

135
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,550
We can go again after wiping your sweat. It's all right.

136
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:27,079
If you know you sweat a lot, you should have done something,

137
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,790
like put on a headband.

138
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,319
Why didn't you check on this?

139
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,589
But this isn't in my control.

140
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,930
It's sweat. How...

141
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,490
Why is he so sensitive?

142
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,129
I guess he wants to play director.

143
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:38,259
I can hear you.

144
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:41,269
But you're also...

145
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:42,269
What?

146
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,370
You're sweating a lot.

147
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,769
This doesn't matter.

148
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:47,540
I'm not there getting filmed.

149
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,139
Am I the one cooking?

150
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,180
Here.

151
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:53,509
Thank you.

152
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,680
I'm sorry.

153
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,480
Let's go again, Ji Yong.

154
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,000
One hour and 20 minutes.

155
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,800
You two are really...

156
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,269
Amazing.

157
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,509
I won't ever suggest we make a bet.

158
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:29,079
You were right, Director.

159
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:30,550
Tell me your wish.

160
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,519
Goodness. Really?

161
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,289
You won, Ms. Han.

162
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,759
A bet is a bet.

163
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:44,330
Well...

164
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
That's right.

165
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:47,929
Then,

166

They say you even pay to donate talent.

172
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,429
- Meaning? - It took away your delivery time,

173
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:15,590
but this will also be a good work.

174

I'll be the judge of that.

175

I followed you out of my will anyway.

176

You always speak so coldly,

177
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,769
but when I think about it, they're warm words too.

178
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,070
I do have to think about it a little, though.

Why don't you sit up right?

that I would like to do if I sit in front of my desk again.

I'll sit on my butt instead of my back.

Because...

It's weirdly embarrassing to sit up right, isn't it?

Then just lie down.

Let's sit up straight, Si Eun.

Ms. Kang. Why don't you say it a little...

You should have observed well from the beginning.

236
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:45,899
The moment you fold paper, you leave a mark.

237

You can't undo that.

238

You're saying that to us, who have a criminal record.

You're telling us that there's no answer...

It's driving me crazy when I haven't even been drinking.

307
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:06,299
I must be crazy to have these thoughts in broad daylight.

How about doing this?

Are you really attracted to it? Do you like it that much?

How did that pop out now so suddenly?

Gosh.

Let's think about something sad.

Me? Am I red?

Maybe the heat from the alcohol I drank yesterday is showing up now.

Am I in menopause?

I'm just kidding.

325
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,549
Since we have a good idea,

326
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:53,350
how about having a get-together after a long time?

327
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,750
I'm hungry.

328
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,389
We must enjoy eating then.

Let's go.

331
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,830
Okay.

332
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,430
But how could I be attracted to him all day like this?

333
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,000
No, there must be something.

334
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,299
It's not me, there must be something about this punk.

335
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,009
If that's not the case, how could I be so...

336
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,549
I can't be attracted to someone like him?

337
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:30,549
Why isn't your brother picking up?

338
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:34,490
Director Kim, please pull yourself together.

339
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,960
Taxi!

340
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,869
No.

341
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:45,500
I'm sorry, please just go.

342
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,440
A bone is stuck in my throat.

343
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,740
Please pull yourself together.

344
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:54,279
- Darn it. - What?

345
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,509
What?

346
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,319
I'm sorry.

347
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,160
I'm surprised you can drive a truck.

348
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,829
When I was young, my parents drove a truck to do business.

349
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,839
It felt like we were a team...

350
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:20,470
when they sat side by side...

351
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,769
and I sat in the middle.

352
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,279
It felt like we were close like a real family.

353
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,509
But after we changed our car to an ordinary car,

354
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:29,049
I had to sit in the back.

355
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:30,950
The number of fights they had increased dramatically.

356
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,119
They ended up getting a divorce.

357
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:37,789
That's why I'm automatically reminded of trucks...

358
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:39,190
when I think about family.

359
00:18:40,589 --> 00:18:43,859
So I decided I would only let my wife sit there.

360
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:52,299
Can I get off?

361
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,140
I feel a little uncomfortable.

362
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:57,470
You don't have to feel pressured.

363
00:18:57,809 --> 00:18:59,880
A lot of women already sat there.

364
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,049
Did a lot of women already sit here?

365
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:04,150
It's not a small number.

366
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,049
Women liked truck dates more than I thought.

367
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:13,660
I didn't ask you.

368
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,279
- Wait. - Why?

369
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,539
What is this?

370
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,880
They're just stretch marks.

371
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:40,119
Do you really have to touch them?

372
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:41,150
No.

373
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:46,490
It's sad for some reason.

374
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:49,759
Why is it sad?

375
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,799
I feel bad for you.

376
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,440
If you didn't want to do it, you could have just told me.

377
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,910
How could you stop like this?

378
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:12,220
- It's on back to front. - What?

379
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:14,519
Okay.

380
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,430
Do you want to have a drink with me?

381
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,599
That's it.

382
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:31,799
Director.

383
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,710
Gosh.

384
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,910
She's unbelievable.

385
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,150
Sun Guk.

386
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:47,279
The director is slightly drunk.

387
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,890
But she keeps saying she has a bone stuck in her throat.

388
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,089
- Is she spitting by any chance? - Yes.

389
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:54,220
Did the other instructors also see her?

390
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,930
No, I made them go.

391
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,529
I'm leaving Chuncheon after finishing the reserve forces,

392
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:00,329
- but I'm in a traffic jam. - Okay.

393
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,970
Fortunately, she fell asleep.

394
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,500
She's probably not asleep.

395
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:07,140
Do you have any handcuffs there?

396
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,569
Handcuffs? Motels don't have handcuffs.

397
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,210
That's right!

398
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:15,109
(Safe purchase system using credit cards)

399
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:17,410
I guess this motel doesn't cater to that kind of preference.

400
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,319
They sell ordinary things in general.

401
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,720
You should remove everything she can hang around her neck.

402
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,789
Her neck?

403
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,039
Like her bag?

404
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,819
Namaste.

405
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,940
Are you crazy? Do you have a death wish?

406
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:15,309
If you want to die, just die alone.

407
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:17,539
Seriously...

408
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:18,539
Move!

409
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:22,349
Vrikshasana.

410
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,920
A yogi said this...

411
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,220
in a crashing elevator.

412
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,319
"This is the perfect time to meditate."

413
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,829
It's also the perfect time...

414
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:39,160
for us to do vrikshasana.

415
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,410
What is this crazy woman doing?

416
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,710
I don't care.

417
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,180
What is she talking about?

418
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,990
It's green!

419
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:09,160
Let's go now. Give me your bag.

420
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,130
It's mine.

421
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,900
That's right. It doesn't matter how you drink.

422
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,599
You got your money's worth as long as you have your bag.

423
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:16,470
Let's really go drink now.

424
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,670
What?

425
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:21,069
Please give us a bottle of Chamisul...

426
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:22,269
and a brass bowl.

427
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:25,079
Go easy.

428
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:31,180
Thank you.

429
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,250
Are you...

430
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,490
trying to scam me as a set?

431
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:38,559
You always scam people by saying meditation is the answer too.

432
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,190
Meditation and alcohol are the same.

433
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:51,799
Do you know how to fill...

434
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:54,170
a glass with a broken bottom with alcohol?

435
00:23:57,069 --> 00:24:00,380
Just throw the broken glass in a jar of alcohol.

436
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,720
At the bottom of that jar,

437
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:11,990
there's a sense of unconsciousness that even I don't know about.

438
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:14,720
But people like you who have bad drinking habits are...

439
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,930
usually scared of that state.

440
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,559
That's why they always try hard to hide...

441
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,400
or run away.

442
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:23,769
But if they end up getting in that state,

443
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,099
they completely let go of themselves.

444
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:27,339
They black out.

445
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:34,609
Unconsciousness eats you up completely after that.

446
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,950
You don't exist anymore.

447
00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:53,400
Real alcohol...

448
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:56,099
doesn't take you away from yourself,

449
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:59,700
but it makes you courageously face yourself...

450
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,569
in that state of unconsciousness.

451
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,549
How dare you beat me?

452
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,450
Why don't we drink alcohol at today's gathering?

453
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,119
I can't drink tea anymore.

454
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,579
You scums!

455
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:17,289
Isn't that the sound of Sun Guk laughing?

456
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:18,990
You scum!

Everything!

I didn't do it.

you?

Are you okay?

00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,650
You surprised me.

Director,

468
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,789
you will drink alcohol again for the first time today.

469
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,630
This alcohol won't make you run away,

470

and even more, it doesn't want to fight with you.

This alcohol is just on your side. Okay?

472
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,690
I'll drink soju.

473
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,890
Producer, you're going to drink soju-like water.

474
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,660
You know that the weight of water is different from soju, right?

475
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,430
Think of this as soju.

476
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,900
Feel the weight of soju,

477
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,259
and drink it bottoms up in one move, okay?

478
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,470
Well,

479
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,210
it's not that bad.

480
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:52,049
You've been on my nerves...

481
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:54,180
all day.

482
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:00,519
You were irritated at the actor for sweating this morning,

483
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:03,529
but your armpits were also really sweaty.

484
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:06,200
I think it started from then.

485
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,069
I kept...

486
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,569
feeling bad for you,

487
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,509
and I wanted to hug you.

488
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,980
Everyone was saying you're dirty, but why did I keep...

489
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,079
Why did you keep what?

490
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:25,849
I don't know, I thought I should have embraced you.

491
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:28,819
Is that why you came here?

492
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,890
I'm sorry for this.

493

It's okay. You're right.

494

I also had a hard time since the morning.

00:27:37,829 --> 00:27:38,829
It happens, right?

496
00:27:39,829 --> 00:27:42,569
It felt like aching knees on a rainy day.

497
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,339
My stretch marks were aching all day.

498
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,839
But you touched them like you knew something.

499
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,410
Gosh, I thought you were a shaman.

500
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,109
You could start working as one.

501
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:00,720
I had one close friend in my life.

502
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:02,849
Joong Gu,

503
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,519
I bought ice cream.

504
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:12,230
Fat people can't eat food on the street.

505
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,130
People will say, "That's why you're fat."

506
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,670
"I'll also gain weight if I eat that."

507
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,599
I can see everyone thinking that.

508
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,369
You're reading too much from it.

509
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,839
So even if I want to use...

510
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:27,779
the shared fan at my boarding house,

511
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,380
I tend to come out at night in secret and use it.

512
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,210
If I'm in front of the fan,

513
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,319
everyone blocks their noses.

514
00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:35,049
They think my armpits will be sweaty.

515
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:36,049
I know everything.

516
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:38,960
Won't it be better to lose weight...

517
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:41,289
if you're going to live like that?

518
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:43,630
I can't do that.

519
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,160
If I lose weight,

520
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,599
I will look like my mom.

521
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,500
Why? Can't you look like your mom?

522
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,470
Is your mom really ugly?

523
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,740
She's really pretty.

524
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:57,509
But my dad doesn't like it...

525
00:28:57,509 --> 00:28:59,079
because he gets reminded of her when he sees me.

526
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:02,579
I need to appease the living person...

527
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:05,049
more than the deceased person.

528
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:09,650
Did he gain weight...

529
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,019
because he didn't want to look like his mom?

530
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,559
I feel so bad for him.

531
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,390
Is your friend living happily now?

532
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:18,089
I guess he will be living happily somewhere...

533
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,230
or he's either dead.

534
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:26,769
It's you.

535
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,009
You were also fat,

536
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:39,250
but you lost your temper with that actor.

537
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,019
You're really mean.

538
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:44,720
I can feel everything...

539
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,690
that hurts people.

540
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,759
Even if you try so hard to hide it, I can see everything.

541
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,029
Do you have superpowers?

542
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,099
It's a type of superhuman strength.

543
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,170
Who do you take after so you can't drink?

544
00:29:58,839 --> 00:29:59,940
Well...

545
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,140
My dad was an alcoholic.

546
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:05,109
So I probably take after my mom.

547
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,089
- Oh, my gosh. - Come to think of it,

548
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,029
you resemble my mom a lot.

549
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,529
And you, your dad.

550
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,460
What?

551
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,700
You drank two-thirds of it all alone.

552
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,130
What are you saying?

553
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:33,640
But this is water, isn't it?

554
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:35,710
It's not?

555
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:38,240
That one's water. This one's soju.

556
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:39,880
I mixed it up. Sorry.

557
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,980
What the heck? What just happened?

558
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,849
You were fine just a second ago.

559
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:50,990
Director Kang? Kang Book Goo?

560
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:53,119
Darn it. This again, punk?

561
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:56,829
You know,

562
00:30:57,259 --> 00:31:00,529
people who say they never drank until they lost their minds?

563
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,170
There are times...

564
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,630
when I feel bad for them.

565
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:06,970
Spitting, carrying your bag around your neck,

566
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,809
and swinging it once in a while...

567
00:31:08,809 --> 00:31:10,109
makes you feel alive, no?

568
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:13,809
But in return, you need to have one button with you.

569
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:16,309
A button that will bring you back...

570
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,980
no matter how much you drink.

571
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:23,089
That button for me is my friends.

572
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:24,990
An So Hee.

573
00:31:25,859 --> 00:31:27,289
- Get your bag. - Regardless of how drunk...

574
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:28,289
or wild I am,

575
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:30,529
that one button makes me come to my senses right away.

576
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:32,559
There's a larger table here. Throw this one too.

577
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,730
Turn all the tables. Let's finish them today.

578
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,269
It's like when you were a kid...

579
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,039
and lost track of time playing around like crazy.

580
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,410
- But you clearly heard your mom... - Ji Goo is coming.

581
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,839
calling you for dinner from afar.

582
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,339
Kim Seon Jung.

583
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,849
I guess you have one too, Director Kim.

584
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:56,289
A return button.

585
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,230
But those handcuffs are weird.

586
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,980
Thank you so much for today.

587
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:25,079
It wasn't all that easy, was it?

588
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,079
It wasn't that bad.

589
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,420
Honestly, it was tough on me.

590
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:32,420
How come?

591
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,490
You looked like you were on edge...

592
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,130
more than those kids who had caused trouble.

593
00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:39,059
Is that so?

594
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,900
So I couldn't help but keep my eyes on you.

595
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,730
You were like a three-year-old baby.

596
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,000
A baby?

597
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,750
It used to be broken.

598
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,289
How unbelievable. Gosh.

599
00:33:07,089 --> 00:33:08,890
Yes, So Hee? Okay.

600
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,630
Darn it.

601
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,029
All right. Got it. I'm on my way. Bye.

602
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,430
I was wondering when your friend was going to call today.

603
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,269
I'm off.

604
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:23,740
Hey, can I ask you a favour?

605
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,480
No, a question?

606
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,039
What is it?

607
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:33,750
I can make a call once every week.

608
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,250
And?

609
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:38,490
By any chance...

610
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:43,289
She won't harass you or make prank calls.

611
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:46,200
My number is no biggie. Give it to her.

612
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:49,170
I knew it. I'm glad I didn't get in their way.

613
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:52,700
Oh, then can I ask you a question too?

614
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:55,099
- Sure. - What's your name?

615
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,539
Name?

616
00:33:58,609 --> 00:33:59,940
Forget it if you don't want to tell me.

617
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:02,109
No. It's just...

618
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,180
My name is a biggie for me.

619
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,119
Can I tell you when we get drinks next time?

620
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:10,619
Okay.

621
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:21,260
If you try to suppress drunks,

622
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,099
they become stronger.

623
00:34:24,369 --> 00:34:28,239
So in those moments, wait for them while thinking,

624
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,170
"I'm on your side no matter what."

625
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:33,079
It might not seem like a big deal, but it will help.

626
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,449
I'm sorry.

627
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,250
What?

628
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,760
Darn it. Why did he drink until he dropped?

629
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,860
- Did you make him drink? - No, I didn't.

630
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,929
Wait, did I? Anyway, his alcohol tolerance is weird.

631
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:57,400
You should've just left him there. Why did you bring him out?

632
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,940
Hold on. Why are you here?

633
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,440
Gosh. We didn't sleep together. I swear.

634
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,539
- I can't believe you. - Guys!

635
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:05,679
Hurry up, Han Ji Yeon.

636
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:07,679
Oh, my. I'm ending up at different motels today.

637
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:10,050
Guys, grab his arms and legs. I'll carry him on my back.

638
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:12,280
- No, I'll carry him. It's okay. - What?

639
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,679
- Let's go. - But he's heavy.

640
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:14,820
- It's okay. - Mom!

641
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,550
Isn't he too old to look for his mom?

642
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,150
Hey, let's carry him first. Are you ready, So Hee?

643
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,219
- Okay. - Support your legs.

644
00:35:19,219 --> 00:35:20,289
Okay. In 1, 2.

645
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,019
Can you walk? Are you okay?

646
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:24,329
She even carried a fatty who weighed 100kg before.

647
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:26,230
- Mom. - What is it?

648
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:28,199
I doubt he was that heavy.

649
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:30,130
- Who? - Someone who takes after his mom.

650
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,570
He became a new person.

651
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:33,800
- Darn it. - Are you okay? Let's hurry.

652
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,869
- I'm beat. - Shut it. Darn it.

653
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,380
(10 years ago)

654
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,210
You should forgive your mom.

655
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,050
Forgive her for what?

656
00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:46,949
"For what?"

657
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,619
For killing herself in front of her child.

658
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,039
Gosh, An So Hee. You're really carrying him?

659
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:14,179
- I'm shocked. - Hold on. This is hard.

660
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:15,340
It runs in the family.

661
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:16,750
Where do you live?

662
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:21,219
Hey. Her name is An So Hee.

663
00:36:21,219 --> 00:36:22,789
Remember it and return the favour.

664
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,320
Don't you think he'll look handsome if he loses a bit of weight?

665
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,760
I don't care.

666
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,030
The world is much more complicated...

667
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,960
- than we can see. - What?

668
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,030
- Mom. - If you get drawn...

669
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,800
to someone for no reason,

670
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,639
- they might have been... - Mom.

671
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,099
kind to you...

672
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:42,469
for no reason one day.

673
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:45,039
Wake up, Director Kang!

674
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:46,280
Is he doing this on purpose?

675
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,409
- One day, you might receive... - I bet he is.

676
00:36:49,409 --> 00:36:50,579
kindness for no reason again.

677
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,619
I'm not okay.

678
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,889
