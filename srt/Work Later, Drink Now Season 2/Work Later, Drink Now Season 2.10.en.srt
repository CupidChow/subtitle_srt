I knew I was in the wrong,

but I took it out on him for no reason.

53
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:59,550
But it was strange that he bore with me.

54
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,050
So, I kept taking it further to see how much he'd tolerate.

55

Don't get out now. It's dangerous.

I felt a type of magnetic force at that moment.

so you return the favor that way.

Because they don't have company insurance.

169
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,670
Why would he bring up insurance?

170
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,910
We're going to officially apologize...

171
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,610
and have our head director quit the show.

172
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,939
Quit the show?

173
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:32,980
(Shikpang Delivery)

174
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,090
Hello.

175
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,559
It's me, Si Eun.

176
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,730
Hey.

177
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,399
- Have you been well? - Yes.

178
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,470
Well, I was learning how to dye hair in my class today.

179
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,169
I was wondering what your favorite color was.

180
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,240
My favorite color?

181
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,539
I actually don't have one.

182
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,110
Did you take the origami class?

183
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,440
Yes. This morning.

184
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,909
But did you have a fight with the origami teacher?

185
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,850
- Why do you ask? - Well...

186
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,679
when I asked him why he didn't bring you,

187
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,419
he suddenly put on this straight face.

188
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,450
- He did? - Yes.

189
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,090
It looked like he was annoyed.

190
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,230
I'll pick purple.

191
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,360
Sure. Purple sounds good.

192
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,330
Yes.

193
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,870
Gosh. We're checking on that.

194
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,700
- Pardon? The online forum? - I'll get back to you after that.

195
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,169
- We'll check and... - Right. I'm sorry.

196
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,769
Hello.

197
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,840
Oh, that. We didn't do that.

198
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:32,639
Okay. Sorry.

199
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,049
Guys, let's pull out the lines.

200
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:36,409
- Okay. - Okay.

201
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,879
It's still the most searched term online.

202
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,519
We explained everything in the apology letter.

203
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,549
But it didn't work.

204
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,230
Hong Seok.

205
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:50,389
I'm sorry.

206
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:51,659
At least tell us why.

207
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:54,629
Did you do that on purpose to ruin our careers?

208
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:56,429
I thought sending out the same trailer...

209
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,970
with the same captions was boring.

210
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,970
So I wanted to mix things up.

211
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,970
Where were you when he added the captions?

212
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,240
Well,

213
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,110
that was after we had gone home.

214
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,610
I'm sorry.

215
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:09,480
It's not your fault.

216
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,779
I changed everything at the last minute.

217
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,779
Save it. What did Director Kang say?

218
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,590
He said he would take full responsibility for it...

219
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,259
and didn't want you to feel small because of this incident.

220
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:22,789
Since when did he start looking out for us?

221
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,559
All right. We can't let this affect us.

222
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:29,000
Let's be honest. We can still keep it going without Director Kang.

223
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,740
I know. But you didn't have to say that.

224
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,340
I mean, he has to drop out because of this incident.

225
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,509
You're so heartless.

226
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:38,009
Then kick me out of the show too.

227
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:41,909
I'm sorry.

228
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,519
That fool.

229
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,720
He doesn't know the difference between being heartless and upset.

230
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,159
He saw them hugging each other. Can't he take a hint?

231
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:53,090
Wasn't that the day Director Kang's pimple popped?

232
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,490
It was. Gross.

233
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,960
Disgusting.

234
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,200
- Ji Yeon. - Yes?

235
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,100
You should go easy on those rice cakes.

236
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,440
Don't you have a date later?

237
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,139
Wouldn't the blind date stick more...

238
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:11,779
if I eat rice cakes beforehand?

239
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:13,639
- Do you have a blind date today? - Good for you.

240
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,750
- Who's the guy? - I don't know.

241
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,149
If I knew who he was, this wouldn't be a blind date.

242
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,120
Are you already leaving?

243
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,720
Ja Young brought rice cakes. Have some before you leave.

244
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:27,389
He's always listening to something, so he can't hear us.

245
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,679
Hello. Can I ask you a question?

246
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:46,840
There's a yoga studio called Baum.

247
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,179
I heard it was on the third floor.

248
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:50,649
But there are over 10 buildings that have more than 3 stories.

249
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,019
Of course, I can call my date and ask her where the studio is.

250
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:55,049
But I don't want her to think...

251
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:57,120
I'm some guy who can't find a yoga studio on my first date.

252
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,559
Do you think you can help me with that?

253
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,129
You don't know where the yoga studio is.

254
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,330
That's understandable.

255
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,299
It's not common for men to know about yoga studios.

256
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:10,000
Yoga is popular among women.

257
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,440
Have a good day then. Thank you.

258
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,169
It's Bium.

259
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,710
Pardon? What did you say? I didn't hear you.

260
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,340
It's Bium, not Baum.

261
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:21,110
It's Bium? Not Baum?

262
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,789
I knew it. I kept looking for it, but I couldn't find it.

263
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,519
Gosh. This is a funny story.

264
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,460
Wouldn't my story win a prize if I send it to "Cultwo Show?"

265
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,759
You don't like the radio show.

266
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,659
I'm like you. At 2pm,

267
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:39,899
reading a book is better than listening to the radio show.

268
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:45,769
Are you having a bad day, perhaps?

269
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,169
A staring contest.

270
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,940
What brings you here?

271
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:23,269
Well,

272
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,240
I wanted to smoke a cigarette here.

273
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,149
It's not like this whole area belongs to you.

274
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,720
You told me to come here and smoke if I couldn't find a spot.

275
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,220
I didn't say anything.

276
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:45,259
You know, I crave pork belly after smoking cigarettes.

277
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,500
So what?

278
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:08,519
Darn it.

279
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,990
Darn it.

280
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,460
What?

281
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,200
Come on. I knew it.

282
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:25,440
Director Kang.

283
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:34,980
Director Kang?

284
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,179
Director...

285
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:43,190
Come on.

286
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,289
I knew it was from a game, but I still fell for it.

287
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:54,600
Director Kang.

288
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,639
Gosh. Are you okay?

289
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:06,710
I knew it was you, but I still got startled and fell.

290
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,750
Did you know?

291
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:14,590
It felt like I was looking in the mirror when I met you.

292
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,220
You said you liked pork belly.

293
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,059
This place has great pork belly.

294
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:21,159
- Are you in? - No.

295
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:25,129
I take it that you're not interested in me much.

296
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:26,730
- Right. - Gosh.

297
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,970
You really are honest.

298
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,700
I get that. But too bad.

299
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,240
I really like you.

300
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,070
I like women who are honest.

301
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,610
However,

302
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:39,340
I respect your decision.

303
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,049
Sadly, I'll get going then.

304
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,649
- Wait. - Yes.

305
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,850
What do you think about indecisive women?

306
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,220
So attractive. They always catch me by surprise.

307
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:50,620
I changed my mind.

308
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,960
I want to eat pork belly now.

309
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,720
Okay!

310
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,590
I'm in. Let's go!

311
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:07,440
Gosh. Look who's here!

312
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,070
It's you, Ji Goo!

313
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,909
No way!

314
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:12,940
What? What's going on?

315
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,610
Do you know her?

316
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:15,649
Of course!

317
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:18,120
She's my best friend!

318
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,850
What a small world!

319
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,990
How could we run into your friend here?

320
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,419
It's not every day you run into your friends.

321
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:24,460
Can we join you?

322
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,259
And it just so happens, there are two available seats.

323
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:27,559
One for Ji Yeon. One for me.

324
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:29,789
- Excuse us. - Excuse us.

325
00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:40,769
What? I hate this awkward silence.

326
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:42,509
It's so nice to meet you.

327
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:44,440
So I'll make a drink for you.

328
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:49,580
All right. Give me your glasses.

329
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,120
There are 4 people here, but I'm using 5 glasses.

330
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,320
Why is that?

331
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,120
Watch me, and you'll find out.

332
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,850
Smack the bottom of the beer bottle.

333
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,960
Smack it!

334
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,029
You're so good.

335
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:08,069
- Soju... - Pour it.

336
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,569
Pour!

337
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,869
Shall we count it down?

338
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:13,400
- Three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

339
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,440
Fire!

340
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:19,480
You're so good, Sung Soo!

341
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,009
You're the best!

342
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:23,279
You must have been dating for years.

343
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:24,650
Such amazing teamwork.

344
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,319
No, we met two hours ago.

345
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,750
We were on a blind date, but it didn't work out.

346
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,319
I'm actually into her,

347
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:34,160
but she says that she doesn't like guys who are more hyper than her.

348
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,359
It's absolutely relatable, isn't it?

349
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:37,960
She was so persuasive that I had to give up.

350
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,099
But how did you end up here?

351
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:42,630
She suddenly had a change of heart, so I tagged along.

352
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,869
It doesn't seem that important. Why don't we just eat?

353
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:46,440
It is not that important.

354
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,470
The meat seems cooked to me. Let's eat.

355
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:52,839
Eat up, mister.

356
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,680
- Okay. - "Mister?"

357
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,079
Didn't he say he was older than us?

358
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,380
Oh, I guess he didn't.

359
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:03,950
But I always call a handsome guy, "Mister."

360
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:07,289
Thanks.

361
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,630
I'm probably older, right?

362
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,500
You still don't know your age?

363
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,430
- Did you tell her your name? - Of course, he did.

364
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,670
Wait, you don't even know his name?

365
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,029
Then what do you call him?

366
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:20,569
Our names and ages didn't seem to matter, so...

367
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:25,339
Then, may I ask your name?

368
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,309
What is your name?

369
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,650
Well...

370
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,619
It's not like your name is covered in gold.

371
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:33,450
Tell us! I want to know.

372
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,519
It's Woo Ju. Han Woo Ju.

373
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:40,420
Oh, my goodness!

374
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,390
- Which Han Clan? - Cheongju.

375
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,359
Awesome! I'm also Cheongju Han Clan.

376
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,759
It's so nice to meet you!

377
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:49,400
We're practically family. Does that mean we're married?

378
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,299
You can't be married if you have the same family name.

379
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,170
You're hilarious.

380
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,670
I've never seen a woman who was funnier than me.

381
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,740
Cheers, everyone!

382
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,180
Cheers.

383
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:04,410
I can't really handle my liquor, so...

384
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,079
What happens when you drink?

385
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,589
I just fall asleep.

386
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:11,259
Oh, my gosh! He just falls asleep!

387
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:13,559
Is it me or is it super cute? Am I the weird one here?

388
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,759
That's enough.

389
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:16,759
What? I'm always like this in front of guys.

390
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:18,200
Don't be weird.

391
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,900
Emergency!

392
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,700
All our meat is burning. Eat up.

393
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,069
Ji Goo, you should eat too. Don't just keep drinking.

394
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:29,569
Ji Goo doesn't like it when men treat her well.

395
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:30,569
Do you know why?

396
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,680
It's because she's so independent and manly.

397
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,049
So many girls were into her back in college.

398
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,980
But she only had guys around him.

399
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,779
Right, guy friends.

400
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,920
I bet you had a lot of boyfriends.

401
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,319
Bingo!

402
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:46,619
We click so well. Should we just date each other?

403
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,529
But I'm married to him tonight.

404
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:50,190
Shut the heck up.

405
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,859
Come outside.

406
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,329
- Why? - "Why?"

407
00:19:55,329 --> 00:19:57,069
Stop pissing me off and follow me.

408
00:19:57,069 --> 00:19:59,069
Do I have to listen to you when you're pissed off?

409
00:19:59,069 --> 00:20:00,200
Prick.

410
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:03,140
Stop swearing. You're not the only one who can.

411
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,910
Wait, Ji Yeon.

412
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,880
- "Ji Yeon?" - Why?

413
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,210
What's wrong with him calling me by my name?

414
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,119
You didn't even know his name seconds ago.

415
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:14,849
You can't be jealous.

416
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:16,390
- Do you want me to kill you? - No.

417
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,720
What did I do so wrong to get killed?

418
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,299
This is terrifying.

419
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:32,099
Hey, Kang Ji Goo!

420
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:36,039
Look at her go. She's not even saying goodbye.

421
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,410
I'll get going.

422
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,180
- Thanks, Sung Soo! - Wait.

423
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,710
Can I go to her instead?

424
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:46,180
I think it should be me. See you next time.

425
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:53,119
Look at that bill.

426
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,430
Sorry. I should have paid.

427
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,930
Don't be. It doesn't matter who pays.

428
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,400
The one with a bigger salary should.

429
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,230
How much do you make?

430
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:07,170
Ji Goo.

431
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,309
You don't even say goodbye to your acquaintance?

432
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,670
How rude!

433
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,680
My acquaintance?

434
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,750
I thought he was your acquaintance. At least, it seemed so.

435
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,079
- Are you jealous of me? - Yes, I'm jealous.

436
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:20,480
That's all right.

437
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,450
You didn't have to come...

438
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,519
all the way to my house...

439
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:26,160
to apologize.

440
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,130
I'm sorry, Mr. Kang.

441
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:30,329
I just wanted to be a good director.

442
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:33,230
There are no good directors in this world.

443
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:36,029
All directors are trash.

444
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:37,029
Gosh.

445
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,269
He called himself trash.

446
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,170
Why did I hide?

447
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,710
Mr. Kang, it's me!

448
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,980
Hong Seok?

449
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,809
- Oh, shoot. - I'm here.

450
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:48,880
- Hide! - Where?

451
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,980
- Where? - My room!

452
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,680
- Your room? - My room!

453
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,349
It's not like I committed a sin.

454
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:54,579
Even the assistant director is here.

455
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,390
Why can't the head writer be here?

456
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:58,690
I shouldn't have hidden.

457
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,490
Mr. Kang, I'm actually...

458
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:05,559
going out with the new writer.

459
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:06,799
Of our team?

460
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:09,599
So Ri? Seriously?

461
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:11,299
What? So Ri?

462
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,769
- But... - So Ri?

463
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:14,140
why are you telling me?

464
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,539
Actually, she did it.

465
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:19,680
- What do you mean? - The captions in the teaser.

466
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,410
She wrote me those subtitles.

467
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,549
What?

468
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:26,180
She said it was boring to always use the same subtitles.

469
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,720
How long are you going to write, "Coming next week?"

470
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,920
I can make you successful.

471
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,960
Really? How?

472
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,359
Is that the truth?

473
00:22:36,829 --> 00:22:39,599
But isn't she pretty quiet?

474
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:42,170
She completely changes when it's just us.

475
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,869
Man, you always do what they tell you to do.

476
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:48,140
Find a way to make it neat.

477
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,609
Stop making me angry.

478
00:22:49,609 --> 00:22:53,380
You should have protected her to the end if you loved her.

479
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,210
Why are you telling me now?

480
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,950
Because I felt so sorry for you.

481
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,819
Right. But don't tell anyone else.

482
00:23:00,819 --> 00:23:04,220
That's not up to you.

483
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:07,819
There are ears everywhere.

484
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:08,890
But you can't tell anyone.

485
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,759
I really love her.

486
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,329
Whether she's crazy or not,

487
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,700
I still love her, and I always will.

488
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:19,900
Please let us love each other.

489
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,309
Who's telling you not to be in love?

490
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,380
- The world? - Just be in love, Hong Seok.

491
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,450
The world isn't that interested in you.

492
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,220
Take this one last shot and get home safely.

493
00:23:37,589 --> 00:23:39,859
- Hey, Ji Goo. - Ji Yeon left the house.

494
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:42,289
- What? - She left, so keep that in mind.

495
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:44,289
What are you talking about? Did you guys fight?

496
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:47,029
If you let her back in, I'm done with you too.

497
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:48,829
But... Hey!

498
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,970
Oh, gosh.

499
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,039
I get it, so just stop...

500
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,069
and go home!

501
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:59,039
You're not the only lovers in the world!

502
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,740
- Mr. Kang. - What?

503
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,250
- You're jealous, aren't you? - Jealous?

504
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:07,349
No, I'm not jealous of anything about you.

505
00:24:07,349 --> 00:24:09,589
Would one be jealous of you for going out with the new writer...

506
00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:11,789
or me for going out with the head writer?

507
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:14,160
Has he lost his mind?

508
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,160
What did I just say?

509
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,500
The head writer? Ms. An?

510
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,599
That lunatic!

511
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,299
When did I say it was the head writer?

512
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:23,869
You're blinded and deafened by love, aren't you?

513
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:27,940
Anyway, my point is that I am not jealous of you.

514
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,339
Of course, I won't be able to tell you my whole story.

515
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:33,079
- But I am also... - No.

516
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:35,950
I'm in a relationship that's much more detailed,

517
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:38,720
deep, tragic, thrilling,

518
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,420
rich yet voluptuous,

519
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,450
- and sensual... - Sensual?

520
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:47,059
Dude, what do you know about sensuality?

521
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:48,960
- Stop. - You're just playing house...

522
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,990
- with that young writer. - Shut your mouth, idiot.

523
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,430
- Please. - Anyway, there's that.

524
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,930
You have no idea how deep and sensual we are.

525
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,400
- You're crazy! - Mr. Kang.

526
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,000
Did you sleep with her?

527
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,670
Of course, I did! Multiple times.

528
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,109
Even twice a day.

529
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:07,509
There's nothing we haven't tried.

530
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,380
Ms. An...

531
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,220
Jerk!

532
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,759
I just can't fall for you!

533
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:20,319
You're garbage!

534
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,859
Get out of here!

535
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,329
No! Ms. An.

536
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,230
Gosh.

537
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:28,829
I'm out.

538
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,500
Ms. An!

539
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:34,440
- So Ri was right. - What was right?

540
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,710
That you two are FWB.

541
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,740
What's FWB?

542
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,680
Friends with benefits.

543
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,980
"Friends with benefits?"

544
00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:43,680
So...

545
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,349
we benefit each other?

546
00:25:45,349 --> 00:25:46,819
It just means you guys are doing it.

547
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,329
That nasty witch.

548
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,299
Darn it.

549
00:26:37,369 --> 00:26:38,940
Why do I have so much stuff?

550
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,470
It sounded like you were ready to move out.

551
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,039
But you had a lot of stuff to take with you.

552
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,240
I did. The house looked pretty barren without my stuff.

553
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,650
You two must have been mooching off on my stuff all this time.

554
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,180
We didn't mooch off on your stuff.

555
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,180
We weren't already well-off.

556
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,819
Didn't it cross your mind that perhaps, you were the only one...

557
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:55,390
who bought everything you wanted?

558
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,119
Do you think So Hee and I don't like shopping?

559
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:59,490
Besides, think about why we ended up here in the first place.

560
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,019
So it's my fault?

561
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,029
When I was about to start chemo,

562
00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:03,589
remember who wanted to go into the mountain?

563
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:04,630
Let me clear this up too.

564
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:07,259
So Hee had to give up on her job. You were already jobless. Remember?

565
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,700
You didn't have a job.

566
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,470
You had turned your back on the world and hid in your cave.

567
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,839
You must have thought going into the mountain...

568
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,470
was better than where you were.

569
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,769
Gosh. You're unbelievable.

570
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:18,109
Keep going. Why don't you blame your cancer on me too?

571
00:27:18,109 --> 00:27:19,609
Actually, I'm moving out...

572
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:21,539
because I'm afraid you might make me relapse.

573
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,210
Is that so? Live a long and healthy life.

574
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,619
You rude brat.

575
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:27,579
Sure thing. Darn you.

576
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:28,789
That little... Gosh.

577
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:36,730
Come on!

578
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:55,009
(Ji Goo, Call)

579
00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:04,990
(Ji Yeon, Call)

580
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,289
- Ma'am. - Yes?

581
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:09,460
Are you in a hurry?

582
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,829
Yes. I'm in a hurry.

583
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,069
No. I think I'm already late.

584
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:30,309
I barely ate anything. Why do I have indigestion?

585
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,390
You're not satisfied with the men you keep around, right?

586
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:42,759
You seduced and dated all of my friends from college.

587
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:45,730
But you had no problem breaking up with them a few days later.

588
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:47,900
Darn it. Whenever you did that, I lost a friend.

589
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,500
All because of your vulgar greed for men.

590
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,500
Hey.

591
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,700
You're mistaken. Big time.

592
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,710
Befriending you was never their goal for those guys.

593
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,069
They became friends with you, so they could date me.

594
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,579
You weren't their friends. They used you, idiot!

595
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,460
Sir.

596
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:19,759
Can I help you close the bar tonight?

597
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:21,730
I don't need any help.

598
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,670
Then can I crash here?

599
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,400
You can't sleep in a bar.

600
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,769
Don't you have other friends?

601
00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:28,940
They're my only friends.

602
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,539
If you didn't have any other friends,

603
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:31,839
you shouldn't have fought.

604
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,980
Gosh.

605
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:40,750
Director Kim.

606
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:44,349
Sung Soo was worried about you, so he called me.

607
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,059
Did something happen?

608
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,960
I moved out.

609
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,059
More like kicked out.

610
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:51,630
Move.

611
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,099
Gosh.

612
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:03,410
Ji Goo.

613
00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:04,769
Ji Goo.

614
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,140
Gosh.

615
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:10,549
Goodness. I can't believe this. What is this?

616
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,380
- Gosh. - Are you okay?

617
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,920
Yes. Just empty it out.

618
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,890
Goodness.

619
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,029
It's just for tonight.

620
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:34,670
Ji Goo.

621
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,410
Put this on your stomach. Your body is way too cold.

622
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:38,809
Okay, thanks.

623
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:49,750
You can call Ji Yeon.

624
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,890
I only said that earlier because I was furious.

625
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:55,859
How big was this fight this time? Seriously.

626
00:30:55,859 --> 00:30:58,059
She took all of her things.

627
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,859
Fighting is one thing. Now, she moved out?

628
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,630
I guess I have an inferiority complex against her.

629
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,069
You?

630
00:31:06,069 --> 00:31:07,640
She's pretty.

631
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,170
She's the complete opposite of me.

632
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:10,910
She's popular too.

633
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,279
This isn't like you.

634
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,779
Did I feel insecure?

635
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:17,450
About what?

636
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,190
This hits the spot.

637
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:24,549
Did you get slapped?

638
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,890
Do you think I'll let people slap me?

639
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:29,460
Go ahead. Hit me!

640
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,890
Darn you.

641
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,000
Are you serious? You little...

642
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,670
Let go.

643
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:43,140
- Let go of me! Come on. - Gosh.

644
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,339
Say that I twisted your arms.

645
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,539
- Hey, that hurts. - How will you get out of this?

646
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:48,109
Go ahead.

647
00:31:48,509 --> 00:31:49,609
Go ahead.

648
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,480
No. Twist your body.

649
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,980
You should hit me. Are you just going to whine?

650
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,190
I returned kindness with violence.

651
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,660
So...

652
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,529
why did you fight in the first place?

653
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,630
I hit on a guy my friend was with.

654
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,500
So she must have been upset.

655
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:15,470
What's the relationship between your friend and that guy?

656
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,240
I think there was something going on between them.

657
00:32:17,609 --> 00:32:19,680
Then you shouldn't have done that to your friend.

658
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:21,339
There's a code for that.

659
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,049
I always did that.

660
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,549
Ji Goo.

661
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:26,619
Who is this?

662
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:28,519
He's my friend, Kyung Mo. Say hello.

663
00:32:28,819 --> 00:32:30,819
Hello, Kyung Mo. It's nice to meet you.

664
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:31,990
Hello.

665
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:35,589
- Gosh. It's hot today, isn't it? - It's cold.

666
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:42,869
Say hello.

667
00:32:42,869 --> 00:32:45,369
Hello, Hyun Joong. Ji Goo told me a lot about you.

668
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:46,400
Nice to meet you.

669
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,769
Okay.

670
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,740
So what are you guys going to do today?

671
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,970
I don't have any classes today.

672
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,650
To tell you the truth,

673
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,279
ten out of ten guys fell for me when I hit on them.

674
00:32:58,349 --> 00:33:00,079
And then I would make a wish in my head.

675
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,420
"Please don't fall for me."

676
00:33:03,789 --> 00:33:05,019
"Please don't."

677
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,690
What's...

678
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,319
the reasoning behind that?

679
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,230
You didn't want to date them.

680
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,660
But you didn't want someone else to date them?

681
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,559
Ji Goo isn't someone else to me.

682
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,630
Ji Yeon is unbelievable.

683
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:19,670
Don't cry.

684
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,769
Don't cry over this. You shouldn't be crying.

685
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,910
Why can't I stop crying?

686
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,640
It's nothing.

687
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,609
No, you can't dismiss it like that.

688
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:31,049
If I were there, I would have taught her a lesson.

689
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:33,650
I'll be honest. Whenever she did this in college,

690
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:36,150
I didn't understand why you just let her do that to you.

691
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,119
There were many times...

692
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:40,089
I didn't introduce my boyfriends to Ji Yeon on purpose.

693
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:44,289
But the truth is, after that incident at the beach,

694
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,430
I can't trust men, not Ji Yeon.

695
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:50,099
But there's something wrong with her too...

696
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:51,670
seeing how she can't stop hitting on your guys.

697
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,299
She knows that she's pretty...

698
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:55,170
and men like girls like her.

699
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,569
She should have left you with him when it was just you and him.

700
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:59,779
Not to stand out, she could have applied lipstick...

701
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:01,509
once instead of twice. Couldn't she do that for a friend?

702
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:03,880
I don't get it. Why did she always dress up better?

703
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,450
The more I think about it, the angrier I'm getting.

704
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:06,549
What's her problem?

705
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,989
Let's just drink.

706
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,420
Hey, are you all right?

707
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,889
You have indigestion.

708
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,559
Wouldn't you want to drink now?

709
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,829
I will. What do you want to drink?

710
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:21,329
Shall we open up a strong one?

711
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:31,110
You don't want your friend...

712
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:34,110
to be involved with guys who fall for...

713
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:37,980
your one wink and seduction.

714
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:42,289
Your friend has not much experience with men.

715
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,550
So is it because she can't detect those men herself?

716
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:47,789
- Yes. - I understand what you're saying.

717
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:50,789
That's being nosy.

718
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:53,599
You should've left your friend to decide.

719
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,969
Who are you to interfere?

720
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,800
That man was not good for you...

721
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,170
but to her, he might've been a good man.

722
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:07,510
But it's very difficult to find a man like that.

723
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:10,650
So you found out that this man wasn't good enough...

724
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:13,519
and you seduced him this time as well?

725
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:25,800
Ji Yeon did that to him too?

726
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:29,170
I heard that his name is Woo Ju.

727
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:32,570
You're Ji Goo and he's Woo Ju? That's funny.

728
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,269
When I asked him last time,

729
00:35:34,269 --> 00:35:36,909
he didn't tell me right away and said he would tell me next time.

730
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,739
But he told his name immediately when Han Ji Yeon asked.

731
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:43,579
He's seriously so clueless.

732
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,519
Was she really trying to seduce him?

733
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:49,519
When he came to my house to look after the baby,

734
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:52,389
she was attracted to his arms.

735
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,460
I saw how her eyes changed.

736
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:57,329
She's always like that.

737
00:35:57,329 --> 00:35:59,559
So I never thought about it deeply.

738
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:01,099
This is so annoying.

739
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,769
What's the alcohol content of this? Why is it so strong?

740
00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:08,099
Hey, wait. Let me bring you some ice.

741
00:36:08,909 --> 00:36:09,969
Gosh.

742
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,309
What a night.

743
00:36:20,449 --> 00:36:22,550
That brat seriously.

744
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:25,489
I can't take this anymore.

745
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,489
When she comes back, I'll never let her go away with this.

746
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:30,090
Even though she begs you to forgive her,

747
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,889
I can't forgive her.

748
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:35,159
This is embarrassing to tell anyone.

749
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,800
We've been friends for ten-plus years.

750
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,769
We've seen everything each other in the mountains.

751
00:36:39,769 --> 00:36:42,769
It's a friendship that we've built through anguish and death.

752
00:36:42,769 --> 00:36:44,539
Is this all we've got?

753
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:47,309
For goodness' sake.

754
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,449
I should head out.

755
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:53,280
Where are you going?

756
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,019
It's raining outside!

757
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:03,929
I have no more beer.

758
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:05,059
Really?

759
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,059
I'll go and buy it.

760
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,099
You surprised me.

761
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,900
- When did you come down? - A while ago.

762
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,199
Were we noisy?

763
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:15,239
I didn't know you were here.

764
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:16,809
I'm sorry to be here so suddenly.

765
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:18,869
Do you want to join us?

766
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,710
He never comes down.

767
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,150
Isn't he downstairs now?

768
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,280
I'll go and buy the beer.

769
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,820
For real?

770
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,579
Hey, it's raining outside.

771
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:32,519
That's right. I'm fine to stop drinking.

772
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:33,889
Didn't you ask me before?

773
00:37:33,889 --> 00:37:35,489
To silently be on your side.

774
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:38,360
You said it may feel like nothing, but it'll help.

775
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,099
Kang Ji Goo!

776
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:52,139
For goodness' sake.

777
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,119
(So Hee)

778
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:09,659
(So Hee)

779
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,030
Yes, So Hee.

780
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,900
- I'm fine. - Hey, Han Ji Yeon.

781
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,199
I was always on both sides when you two fought, right?

782
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,539
But...

783
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:22,909
now...

784
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:25,139
I can't be on your side anymore.

785
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:26,710
No, I don't want to be on your side.

786
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:29,650
And I don't care how or where you live in the future.

787
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,050
But keep in mind...

788
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,880
that you're the one...

789
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,449
who broke this friendship.

790
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,630
Clumsy brat.

791
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,199
That brat.

792
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,369
Rude brat.

793
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,980
Where did Ji Goo go in this rain?

794
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:37,380
For goodness' sake. Everything is so chaotic.

795
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:53,099
Ji Goo. Why are you all wet?

796
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,030
- Are you okay? - You said...

797
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,829
I should like dating more than being with my friends, right?

798
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:00,400
- That I'm not in school anymore. - Yes, I said that.

799
00:40:00,769 --> 00:40:03,670
- But I was angry at that time. - Let's date.

800
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:06,880
I don't need friends anymore.

801
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,960
As soon as I saw him,

802
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,230
I could feel it.

803
00:40:30,269 --> 00:40:32,130
This time, it's different.

804
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:37,369
This man is different from others.

805
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,539
So I was afraid.

806
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,750
So I ignored her when she wanted to borrow my dress.

807
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,650
If I had let her borrow it,

808
00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:55,619
Ji Goo would've become the fairy in "The Fairy and the Woodman"...

809
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,329
and flew away from me forever.

810
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:05,730
So Hee and I always end up coming back.

811
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:09,070
But for Ji Goo,

812
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,679
I felt like she'd go away forever.

813
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,550
May I go and talk to her?

814
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:57,989
I think it should be me. See you next time.

815
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,889
