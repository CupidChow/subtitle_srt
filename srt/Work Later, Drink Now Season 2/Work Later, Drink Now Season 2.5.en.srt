I just had an idea.

My brain works only when it rains.

19

No wonder my back was hurting.

Don't go out delivering today. It's dangerous.

Maybe there's a difference between the soil and asphalt?

Why is it harder to take out the gunk in your eyes...

when you're in the city than in the mountains?

Because it's drier in the city?

You're so smart, So Hee.

Thank you!

107

Ms. An made a request to upper management,

108
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:05,240

that Ji Hoo used to go to school for the gifted?

Oh,

Normal is the best way to go.

00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:05,100
- I'm still jealous. - Me too.

Now, I deliver food...

251

then she gave birth to me,

265
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:05,620
so all her love for her future husband came to me.

Oh, my gosh.

274
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:30,379
That was an inner voice.

275

I've been meditating so much lately...

276
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,350
that I could hear Director Kim's inner voice in my head.

277
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,120
Then I added a short impersonation of Kim Soo Mi.

278
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:44,629
I told you in the car that I was going.

279
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:46,629

We actually added hand-drip coffee to the menu today.

I'd recommend that one.

So, the smell was coming from that.

297
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,490
Or you could try the new drink that we're promoting this month...

298
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:42,789
I'll have hand-drip coffee.

What was so wrong about calling my mom, Mom?

00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:02,730
It might be in the middle of Seoul,

332
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:06,500
but the food at this bar is authentic Jeju cuisine.

333
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,170
- Gosh. - Oh, that's sweet.

334
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,930
- Yes! - Nice!

335
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,069
Here is the horse mackerel soup.

336
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:17,109
- Fried silver-stripe round herring. - Gosh, that's legit.

337
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,609
- It looks great. - Shall I pour you girls a drink?

338
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:21,750
- Yes! - Sounds good.

339
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,309
Here we go.

340
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:27,279
We're off to Jeju Island.

341
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,220
Yes! Soju bomb!

342
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,690
The owner here was the first person to teach us...

343
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,559
that alcohol tasted different depending on who poured it.

344
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:34,589
- With two hands? - All right!

345
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:40,329
It looks so delicious.

346
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,799
Auntie, this is practically draft beer.

347
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,539
Take a big gulp of that.

348
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:46,799
- Thank you. - Gosh.

349
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,910
- All right. Let's drink! - Let's drink!

350
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:04,150
Is this Jeju Island? Gosh, this is amazing.

351
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:06,259
Oh, my goodness.

352
00:18:08,329 --> 00:18:12,230
You, fried silver-stripe round herring. Seriously?

353
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,660
Hey, try the horse mackerel soup.

354
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:17,430
- This is the perfect hangover cure. - It's so good, isn't it?

355
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,269
- Her food keeps getting better. - I know.

356
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,109
(Don't answer)

357
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:25,910
Hey, isn't that your mom?

358
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,680
Why is she calling Ji Goo and not us?

359
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,680
I know. Is there something wrong?

360
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,809
Nothing is wrong.

361
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,619
- Still, you should answer that. - It's fine.

362
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,490
- Hey! - I answered it.

363
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,420
Good.

364
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,859
You call your mom too.

365
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:44,190
What are you doing? I called her this morning.

366
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,400
That was your mom calling you. Here.

367
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,630
She's sleeping right now.

368
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,599
Gosh.

369
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,400
Hello? Mom?

370
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,569
Ji Yeon was playing around and called you.

371
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:56,309
I didn't wake you, did I?

372
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:03,450
Mom. Did you drink?

373
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,750
My mom was drunk.

374
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,720
With who at this hour?

375
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:10,220
I just had a bit to drink in town.

376
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,990
- You're not at home right now? - Goodness.

377
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:13,890
I am home.

378
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,859
Why would you drink so much at home?

379
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,900
Is there something going on?

380
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,400
Mom.

381
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,769
Yes? What?

382
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,710
Do you drink like this on your own every night?

383
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,809
I told you, it's not like that.

384
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,380
I am right.

385
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,819
Gosh, this is so annoying.

386
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,319
Mom...

387
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:51,930
How could you do this to me?

388
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,869
How could you?

389
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,200
Why must I live like this because of you?

390
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,440
Why? What did I do so wrong to you?

391
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,980
I went through the trouble of giving birth to you and raising you.

392
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,039
But you just decided to cut me out of your life as you pleased.

393
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:10,049
You didn't show your face once, and you looked down on your parents.

394
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:11,779
You just live however you want.

395
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:15,490
Since when did you greet me so cheerfully?

396
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,819
Is it fun for you to torment me?

397
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:20,920
Do you know how loose-lipped those women are?

398
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:22,930
It's one thing for your life to be embarrassing.

399
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,859
Why would you make my life embarrassing as well?

400
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:29,500
Why are you making your brother's life embarrassing too?

401
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,049
Do you need a smoke?

402
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,220
No, you're smoking one for me.

403
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,490
My mom only needs a cigarette and a cup of coffee.

404
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,829
Still, if I knew today was such a day,

405
00:20:59,829 --> 00:21:01,769
I would've at least made some pork noodles.

406
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:04,599
You know my mom's death anniversary rites are like spontaneous parties.

407
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:10,210
It was about a year and a half after Ji Yeon's mom had passed away.

408
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,210
What?

409
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,509
- Let's drink. - Okay.

410
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:15,309
(4 years ago, one summer day)

411
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:16,980
They gave us an extra glass.

412
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,180
- Really? - Yes.

413
00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:19,950
Then let's make that my mom's glass.

414
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,019
What?

415
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:24,589
Is today your mom's death anniversary?

416
00:21:24,589 --> 00:21:27,920
Come on, her mom passed away in late fall...

417
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,789
Wait, no. Her death anniversary already passed.

418
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:30,890
Did it?

419
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,529
Didn't you hold your mom's death anniversary rites?

420
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,900
You're crazy.

421
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:36,799
Didn't I tell you?

422
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,740
My mom said...

423
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,000
she didn't want me to remember the day she died...

424
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,009
if it was homework.

425
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,069
So she wanted me to forget her death anniversary.

426
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:45,640
Really?

427
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:48,150
But you know how the moment you try to forget it,

428
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,579
you totally remember?

429
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:52,279
It's like deleting your ex's number, but you suddenly have it memorized.

430
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:55,519
That was your mom playing a trick since you always forget everything.

431
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:57,750
She wanted you to remember her death anniversary at least.

432
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,720
That's right. Your mom was smart.

433
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,359
But you know, I really forgot.

434
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:04,700
I couldn't remember, no matter how hard I tried. Isn't it incredible?

435
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,200
I really must be an idiot. What do I do?

436
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:10,430
Gosh, this is getting old.

437
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,670
The tree frog listened to his mom's dying wish.

438
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:16,039
He buried her by the stream and cried whenever it rained.

439
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:19,240
But Ji Yeon listened to her mom's dying wish...

440
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,809
and forgot all about her death anniversary...

441
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:23,349
and just kept on laughing.

442
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:27,720
The rain must be over now.

443
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,250
Yes, you're right.

444
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,559
When I came to Seoul,

445
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,990
I couldn't get used to the smell of the rain.

446
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:39,730
Whenever it would rain, I'd feel so homesick.

447
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:43,170
But now I don't remember the smell of rain in Jeju.

448
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,869
Black herbal tea with an egg yolk.

449
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,970
That's what my mom would say.

450
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,980
She said that if you put an egg yolk in black herbal tea,

451
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,940
it smelled exactly like the rain on Jeju Island.

452
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,980
Your mom sure was a weirdo.

453
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:02,119
But this morning, all the eggs I cracked had two yolks in them.

454
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:03,490
All three of them.

455
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:11,599
Here. Eat up.

456
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:14,099
Gosh, there are two yellow yolks.

457
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,900
I feel bad for that egg.

458
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:19,170
It's because a young chicken was laying eggs...

459
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,369
and didn't know how, so this happened.

460
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:24,269
Then is this a bad thing?

461
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:26,740
Of course not.

462
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,549
Did I ever dislike you?

463
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:30,150
Am I a double-yolk egg?

464
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,819
In the end, I couldn't eat it.

465
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,480
It felt like I was eating myself.

466
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:37,319
You made such a fuss. My goodness.

467
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:41,829
But then, as soon as I got to work this morning,

468
00:23:41,829 --> 00:23:44,730
I sat in front of the camera because we had to shoot introductions.

469
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,299
And I suddenly thought of that.

470
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:49,970
I once entered a singing contest when I was little.

471
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:52,299
And my mom was right there just a moment ago,

472
00:23:52,569 --> 00:23:54,640
but then she suddenly disappeared.

473
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:59,980
Was my mom embarrassed that I was a bar owner's daughter?

474
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,509
Hey, don't make me laugh.

475
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:04,880
Do you think your mom would've been embarrassed by that?

476
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:06,849
She'd say that...

477
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:10,250
you were the smartest bar owner's daughter in the world.

478
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,819
She even told the neighbourhood mutt.

479
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,859
I do think I'm smart.

480
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,599
I knew the moment I saw this.

481
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,130
We actually added hand-drip coffee to the menu today.

482
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,569
I'd recommend that one.

483
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:29,210
It shouldn't suddenly appear here, but it did.

484
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,369
Oh, this is from my mom.

485
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,309
Isn't it more elegant...

486
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,450
than spinning alcohol bottles?

487
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:42,819
I mean, grinding coffee is just manual labour too.

488
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,460
Why does it seem so cool?

489
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,230
If I'm ever reborn, I want to be born as drip coffee.

490
00:24:56,829 --> 00:25:00,599
You must've missed her so much.

491
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:04,170
Auntie, the horse mackerel soup was so good today.

492
00:25:04,339 --> 00:25:07,009
That was your mom's specialty.

493
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:10,509
She and I both should've stayed in Jeju,

494
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,680
working in the sea.

495
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,049
I never got to take her back to Jeju before she died,

496
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:18,589
and I'll forever feel sorry about that.

497
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,819
Come on. Do you know what my mom said...

498
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,259
as she left Jeju?

499
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:25,660
"Farewell, Jeju. I will never come back here as long as I'm living."

500
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,059
"I'll come back once I'm dead."

501
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,599
- Your mom said that? - Yes.

502
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:29,769
How do you know that?

503
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:30,970
I heard it.

504
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:34,240
You were still in your mom's womb at the time.

505
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,210
That is how I know best.

506
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,279
I was the closest person to her.

507
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,710
Will you keep lying?

508
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,740
It's the truth.

509
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,009
I remember everything that happened inside my mom's womb.

510
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:45,119
When my mom went diving in the sea,

511
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:48,650
I'd follow along and swing around holding my umbilical cord.

512
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,549
I can remember swimming with her and everything.

513
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:53,690
I told you to stop lying.

514
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:56,259
I'm not lying. One day,

515
00:25:56,259 --> 00:25:57,789
- I was... - Ji Yeon always said...

516
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,700
that she could remember the days...

517
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,970
when she was still in her mother's womb.

518
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,839
You can't really believe her since she forgets what she ate a day ago,

519
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,640
but some days, it does sound like the truth.

520
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,069
Gosh.

521
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,539
Like mother, like daughter. My goodness.

522
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:15,680
Gosh.

523
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:23,289
What's up with this mood?

524
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,559
Did you find out that this is my mom's death anniversary rite?

525
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,460
Do you guys know?

526
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:31,859
I take after my dad.

527
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,559
Your dad?

528
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,799
Do you know who he is?

529
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,299
I don't know that.

530
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,170
But she said I had an IQ of 160 because I took after my dad.

531
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:41,369
Auntie knows who your dad is too?

532
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,109
How would Auntie know that?

533
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:46,609
But if I ever meet my dad, I'd recognize him right away.

534
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:49,079
Why? I remember his voice.

535
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,480
From when you were in your mother's womb?

536
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,380
- Yes. - Sure, we believe you.

537
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,420
- Of course. Drink up. - It's the truth.

538
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,049
I know what someone looks like just by the sound of their voice.

539
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,119
I can't believe that.

540
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,190
You know I have the perfect pitch, right?

541
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,420
The moment I hear someone's voice,

542
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,759
I can picture the skull, cheekbones, collarbones, pubic bones,

543
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:04,630
and the size of all those bones too.

544
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:07,059
- Just drink. - Okay.

545
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:15,069
I saw my mom on the street today, and she ignored me.

546
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:16,210
Really?

547
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,740
- Did she forget your face? - As if.

548
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,980
She was embarrassed in front of her friends.

549
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:26,079
She used to want to show me off so much when I was a teacher.

550
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,819
But today, she was trying so hard to hide me.

551
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:32,660
Hey, but you can't get upset with your mom over something like that.

552
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,789
I know. I'm not upset at all.

553
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,559
- Come on. You're obviously upset. - Right.

554
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:41,230
Forget it.

555
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,829
Later on, I will never do the same thing...

556
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:47,240
to my own kids.

557
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:48,910
- You should have a daughter just... - You should have a daughter just...

558
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,009
- Jinx. - Jinx.

559
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:53,140
- Jinx. - Here.

560
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:58,779
- Jinx. - Jinx.

561
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:04,690
I seriously have zero interest in getting married.

562
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,359
But I'm going to have a daughter just like me and show my mom.

563
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:10,589
So I will...

564
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,460
get married.

565
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,299
- Get married? - Get married?

566
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:16,930
Kang Ji Goo is talking about marriage?

567
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,269
Sure, go ahead.

568
00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:21,839
I won't be nice to my kid when she's good at something or makes me proud.

569
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,309
When she's at her lowest point,

570
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,009
and...

571
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,650
when she has nothing to boast about and feels embarrassed,

572
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:38,220
That's when I'll be the nicest.

573
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:44,059
She saw her own daughter for the first time in a while.

574
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:45,900
And she said, "I can't go on living because of you."

575
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,930
"How could you do this to me?"

576
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:50,869
"I can't even sleep, and I'm in and out of hospitals because of you."

577
00:28:50,869 --> 00:28:52,369
I won't say that.

578
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,369
"Have you been eating?"

579
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:57,670
"Are you feeling ill at all?"

580
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,609
I'm going to say that stuff.

581
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,210
Whenever we drank,

582
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,319
we trash-talked our moms as if it were a race.

583
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,119
It's like we're in a competition to see whose mom is the worst.

584
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,549
Thank you.

585
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,490
- Would our moms know? - I don't get it!

586
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,619
That we talk badly about them so often?

587
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:17,859
I mean, I have plenty to say too, you know?

588
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:19,099
- Gosh. - Hey.

589
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,970
She always pretends like she's not sick or having a hard time.

590
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,599
You...

591
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:28,240
Do you know how annoying that can be?

592
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:32,740
She's going to get caught in the end anyway.

593
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:36,309
Or else, I'm the only one who becomes a bad person like today.

594
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:39,380
It's to prevent you from being worried.

595
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,380
- For goodness' sake. - Gosh.

596
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,990
Then don't answer the phone. Why would she answer?

597
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,019
Hey.

598
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:49,259
How can she ignore your call?

599
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,630
At least your mom is...

600
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:54,660
not telling you that she's going through a tough time.

601
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,000
- That's what a mom does. - Hey.

602
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,900
If she's always telling you that she has sleep problems...

603
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,200
because of you,

604
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,109
or that you're the reason she always has panic attacks...

605
00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:08,650
as if she'll die tomorrow...

606
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:11,509
and making the daughter feel bad...

607
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,519
is that a mom?

608
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:17,619
If she's a real mom, she should tell her daughter.

609
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:21,420
Hey, real moms can't say those things to their daughters.

610
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,589
- Hey! - What?

611
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:24,930
Stop talking!

612
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:27,160
I don't even have a mom.

613
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,470
Why did she have to say that?

614
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:32,269
- Oh, seriously. - I'm sleepy.

615
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,670
Hey! I don't have a father!

616
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,740
Hey! I didn't have one since birth.

617
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,079
- Why are they doing this? - You're right.

618
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:42,450
I'm sorry. I apologize.

619
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,349
- You weirdos! - Oh, gosh.

620
00:30:44,349 --> 00:30:45,549
Go home now!

621
00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:46,549
- We have to go? - Why?

622
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:49,589
After having daughters like you all,

623
00:30:49,589 --> 00:30:52,960
your mothers still cooked and ate seaweed soup.

624
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,589
No, my mom hates seaweed soup.

625
00:30:55,589 --> 00:30:59,460
For goodness' sake. Good for you.

626
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:02,170
I'm fed up with you all.

627
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:05,569
- Auntie, the food was so delicious. - Right.

628
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:07,440
Thank you.

629
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,269
- The menu was great. - Takeout, please

630
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:11,369
For goodness' sake.

631
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:19,450
- Let's go. - What's this?

632
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,779
You're drunk.

633
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:24,750
Ms. An, you'll end up at a dog house today.

634
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,819
Excuse me.

635
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:29,089
- You shouldn't hold my head. - Sir.

636
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:31,359
- You can't hold my head like that. - Sir.

637
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,900
- You all drank too much. - Yes. We did.

638
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,599
Why did you drink so much?

639
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:38,200
Aren't you our driver?

640
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,670
Straighten your legs. Straighten them.

641
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,710
Oh, my. I don't know you.

642
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,450
You obnoxious people.

643
00:31:55,349 --> 00:31:56,789
What's that?

644
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,519
(Memorandum: No drinks during the day,)

645
00:31:58,519 --> 00:31:59,720
(during the weekends, and overnight if possible.)

646
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,559
They should know the meaning of a memorandum.

647
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,289
For goodness' sake.

648
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:06,500
Sometimes, we need to drink.

649
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:08,670
Like today.

650
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:12,200
On days when we miss our moms.

651
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:15,339
No, I mean...

652
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:17,309
When we drink and talk badly about our moms,

653
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,240
we don't understand our moms...

654
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:22,579
but understand each other's moms.

655
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:24,049
I'm sorry because...

656
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:26,819
- What they said was all right. - I think she made me feel sorry.

657
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:31,019
Why is she drinking alone?

658
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:35,460
But she pretends as if nothing is wrong in front of me.

659
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,930
It's all because she doesn't want you to worry.

660
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,730
(Call log: My daughter)

661
00:32:46,369 --> 00:32:47,500
So Hee.

662
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:52,039
I had a drink with the other aunties at a neighbourhood feast.

663
00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:55,380
So don't worry about me.

664
00:32:55,609 --> 00:32:56,779
Okay?

665
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,750
Do you know what my mom was like?

666
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,549
One day,

667
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:08,289
she said she'd be jealous and lonely if I got married...

668
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:11,089
and told me not to get married. You know?

669
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,130
Is that what a mom should say?

670
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:16,430
She said that because she was worried you'd meet...

671
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:19,269
any man and get married.

672
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:21,140
Mom.

673
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,839
Hey.

674
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:28,140
Tell my daughter's future husband...

675
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:32,180
that I know...

676
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:36,990
that he's marrying her because she's pretty...

677
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:42,190
and that he has great taste.

678
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:44,930
In my eyes too...

679
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,599
she's so pretty.

680
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,230
So...

681
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:54,500
please...

682
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,980
love her forever.

683
00:34:00,579 --> 00:34:02,309
Until she gets old...

684
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,549
and doesn't look pretty anymore.

685
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:14,260
I won't be nice to my kid when she's good at something or makes me proud.

686
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,289
When she's at her lowest point,

687
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,300
and...

688
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:26,570
when she has nothing to boast about and feels embarrassed...

689
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,969
That's when I'll be the nicest.

690
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:33,340
Ji Goo, your mom...

691
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,710
would've wanted to say the same.

692
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,849
My mom?

693
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:51,260
Everyone called my daughter...

694
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,670
a genius when she was young.

695
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:03,010
She was good at painting and singing.

696
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,269
She was good at sports too.

697
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,780
But...

698
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:10,980
do you know when I was proud of her the most?

699
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,719
It was when she was about 200 days old.

700
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,860
She was so little crawling here and there.

701
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:26,030
So I was very tired...

702
00:35:26,429 --> 00:35:28,730
and left her on the sofa.

703
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:31,099
Oh, gosh.

704
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,639
She saw me cleaning from afar...

705
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:40,510
and suddenly turned her back to climb down the sofa.

706
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:47,420
Then she looked at me and came crawling...

707
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,559
towards me.

708
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,960
I was so happy.

709
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,400
Will she know?

710
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,340
My daughter is awesome.

711
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,539
Oh, my.

712
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,440
My daughter is a genius.

713
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,480
Come here. I'll hug you.

714
00:36:15,909 --> 00:36:18,780
