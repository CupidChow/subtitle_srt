6
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:27,268
Gosh. I said I was on my way.

7
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:29,268
Ms. An, we made it.

8
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:30,338
What do you mean?

9
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:33,570
We made it! Our show is officially listed!

10
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:35,469
Are you serious?

11
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,139
Our television pilot didn't do so well,

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,038
but they listed it for catching a lot of attention.

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,279
It's on the regular schedule too.

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,479
You and I are in charge of it!

15
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:45,548
Awesome.

16
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:47,320
Let me call my girls first.

17
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:48,689
Wait.

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,358
Director, I'm getting a call.

19
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,520
I'll see you soon.

20
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:56,289
Hey, Ji Goo.

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,009
Director Kang, congrats on the new show.

22
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,539
- It's all thanks to Ms. An. - You bet.

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,578
Where is she?

24
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:16,408
She's on her way. I bet she's flying here on a jet.

25
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,078
Director Kang, I'm sorry.

26
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,548
I won't be able...

27
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:21,789
to work on the show due to personal reasons.

28
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,119
I apologize.

(One year later)

31
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,170
Gosh, that team is at it again.

32
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:39,468
It's like a paused scene, isn't it?

33
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:42,268
I can't imagine a show without the main writer for a year.

34
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,480
I know, right? They're like abandoned puppies.

35
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,879
It's hard to watch.

36
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,048
Director Kang.

37
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:56,518
I'm sorry to bring this up again,

38
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,659
but maybe it's time...

39
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,730
to find another main writer...

40
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:05,159
The main writer...

41
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,129
has always been...

42
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,169
and will always be...

An So Hee.

44
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,779
Director Kang, I have good news.

45
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,049
Your main writer is here. To the lobby ASAP.

46
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,150
Ms. An?

47
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,889
Ms. An!

48
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,590
- Ms. An. - Here.

49
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,429
I was going to take a break after childbirth,

50
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,699
but the chief begged me to come back.

51
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,638
Also, my parents-in-law, who live in Ichon-dong,

52
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,879
are huge fans of "Mic Game."

53
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,939
I did not create it.

54
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,378
Beg your pardon?

55
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:56,810
She gave birth to her child and ran off.

56
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,889
She left me all by myself.

57

Director Kang.

58
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,919
Are you a single dad?

59
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,259
That's pitiful.

60
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,259
Right?

61
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,930
I am pitiful, right?

62
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:17,269
A child needs his mother, right?

63
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,168
You bet. That poor child.

64
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:21,270
Right?

65
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,109

Here. Why?

68
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,448
I'll get the next guest.

69
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:30,579
- The microphone. - The microphone.

70
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,818
You're doing it yourself?

71
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:33,948
I'll get the interview myself.

72
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:35,149
- Wish me luck. - But...

73
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,249
- What? - What?

74
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,560
- Who? - Who?

75
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:41,859
I'm currently on my way...

76
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,329
to find the writer who ran after creating this show.

77
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,098
("Mic Game")

78
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,668
Hello, sir.

79
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:50,938
I'm the producer that left his business card last time.

80
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,270
I'm a new security guard.

81
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,309
I've never seen her at the training institute either.

(Han Yu Ra, the main writer's best friend's colleague)

Maybe she got married?

84
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,349
Have seen women that look like them?

85
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,249
Oh, my. Who are you?

86
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,318
Who on earth are you?

87
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,049
Why are you looking for them?

88
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,888
What does a hairy guy have to do with them?

89
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:13,090
- I'm a director! - You're no director!

90
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,229
Ma'am, I don't have cell service here.

91
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,999
I know I lost contact, but I'm doing fine.

92
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,898
Please give my regards to your husband.

93
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:24,539
What part of this country has no cell service these days?

94
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,109

Fine. My daughter has always been that way.

97
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,508
But I don't get why the other two are gone.

98
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:35,410
Oh, my Lord.

99
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,319
By the way,

100
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,089
are you sure you can find them?

101
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,258
This bar was much frequented by Ms. An.

102

(Closed for the moment)

103
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:47,759
It seems to have shut down.

104
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,028
She wanted to get to the end,

105
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:52,599
so we ended up there.

106
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,929

I apologize.

- It's a criminal! - Stop!

127
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,499
Stop right there!

128
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,529
Get out of here!

129
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,039
Have you seen these people?

130
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,769
I'm currently a director at TVING.

131
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:11,310
I'm worried about my colleague who went off-grid...

132
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,078
a couple of years ago.

133

(Have you seen these people?)

134
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,619
If you ever meet them or run into them by accident,

135
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,720
please give me a call.

(Successfully posted)

137
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,059
- Yes. - You don't have any?

138
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,698
- Yes. I got it. - I don't have any.

139
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:36,370
It's because you helped her.

140
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:37,838
(Have you seen these people?)

141
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,339
I think I've seen them before.

142
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,379
I think I saw them on a fishing boat in Uljin.

143
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,079
Ms. An!

144

An So Hee!

145
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:57,759
I've seen them at the top of the Baekdudaegan mountain range.

146
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,490
It's either Mount Seorak or Taebaek.

147
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,198
Ms. An!

148
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,729
I've seen them taking photos at Gochang's barley field.

149
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,769
I'm positive it was them.

150
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,370
Ms. An!

151
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:16,110
Ms. An!

152
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:17,480
An So Hee!

153
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:20,649
Ms. An!

154
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:32,589
I think I saw them at a club in Seomyeon of Busan.

155
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:35,359
I think I saw the three women at a traditional market in Jeongseon.

156
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,828
I like the one in the middle. Let me know if you find her.

157
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:38,198
The one on the right looks sassy.

158
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,258
They look like good drinkers.

159
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,898
I'm 100 percent sure that she only blocked the producer.

160
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:42,769
These people, seriously. For goodness' sake!

161
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,688
(Have you seen these people?)

162
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:09,689
I've met them at a hospital in Seoul about one or two months ago.

163
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:12,430
I heard they were on a mountain in North Chungcheong Province.

164
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,129
So they're definitely together.

165
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:22,040
(One week later)

166
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,240
Is that a wild animal?

167
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,500
Oh, man.

168
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:18,899
What is it?

169
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:02,610
Save me!

170
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:05,110
Director Kang!

171
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,980
Ms. An?

172
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:09,080
Hello, Director Toe.

173
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,049
How did he get here?

174
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:15,990
I found you.

175
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,519
What are you doing?

176
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:49,450
Gosh, I didn't expect this.

177
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,090
- Eat first. - Yes.

178
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,700
- What? - Oh, my.

179
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,500
What's going on?

180
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,168
Are you really crying?

181
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:06,599
- What an eyesore. Give me a break. - Oh, no.

182
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,839
Director Toe must've missed So Hee so much.

183
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,878
- Yes. - Or...

184
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,480
did you miss your sex partner?

185
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:15,750
Sorry?

186
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:18,278
Why are you bringing that up now?

187
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,878
Are you crazy?

188
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,989
Say those dirty words again.

189
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,418
If you're here to die, you came to the right place.

190
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:24,960
There's plenty of space to bury you.

191
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,519
- Oh, my. - Choose one.

192
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:29,359
She's just happy to see you.

193
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,629
You should understand.

194
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,299
But I...

195
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,730
was on your side before as well.

196
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:36,070
For goodness' sake.

197
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,099
Do you think that makes sense?

198
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,370
Isn't he crazy?

199
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:42,008
Why? What's wrong with a sex partner?

200
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:43,609
What do you mean?

201
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,579
- It's the most romantic partner. - Hey, Han Ji Yeon.

202
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,979
Do you think that romance and sex are the same thing?

203
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,120
It's not the same, but isn't it good if they're together?

204
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:55,250
It's like milk and cereal. They're different but together.

205
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,658
Hey, don't listen. Don't be seduced.

206
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:00,989
- They're different but together. - Stop.

207
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,389
I don't know. Get lost.

208
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,399
Director Toe,

209
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:07,768
you also put cereal in the milk, right?

210
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,528
- Stop. - Hey.

211
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,538
We agreed not to discuss that anymore.

212
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:14,340
Okay. "Sex partner" is a prohibited phrase from now on.

213
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,808
SP is also prohibited, right?

214
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:17,039
Hey!

215
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:19,509
Be quiet. For real.

216
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,110
- Help yourself. - Yes.

217
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:24,620
- It looks delicious. - Yes.

218
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:29,120
Hey, put that down.

219
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,720
- For goodness' sake. - Enjoy your meal.

220
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,370
Ms. An.

221
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:48,139
I waited a long time for you.

222
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,710
We worked so hard to put together a program,

223
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:53,909
but you tell me to find another writer and wish me good luck?

224
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,179
Gosh, this is like...

225
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,919
She flirted with you but slept with someone else?

226
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,419
Yes, pretty much.

227
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,788
I was close.

228
00:13:05,789 --> 00:13:10,529
Anyway, tell me what on earth happened.

229
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,428
Hey, Ji Goo.

230
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:17,669
(One year ago)

231
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:31,450
Ji Yeon.

232
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,398
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

233
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,668
One day before she started chemotherapy,

234
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:49,730
Ji Yeon...

235
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,559
stopped drying her hair and ran off just like that.

236
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:26,299
Ji Yeon, what's going on?

237
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,110
Please just go.

238
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,769
To the farthest place from here.

239
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:47,419
So,

240
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:51,600
could you tell me about your wife?

241
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,230
My wife was...

242
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,339
On this day, Ji Yeon asked to hear how his wife had died...

243
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,210
after battling cancer...

244
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,110
from the beginning to the end.

245
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,320
As the long story was nearing its end,

246
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,120
the two had arrived at a small seaside village in Haenam.

247
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:21,730
That was the last time.

248
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,759
The end.

249
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,570
Great.

250
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,739
On this day, for the first time in her life,

251
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,580
Ji Yeon sent a man away after coming to the beach with him.

252
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:44,179
And...

253
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,409
Oh, my. Is it really that cold?

254
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,450
That was the longest I held that pose.

255
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,460
And just like that, she went to the mountain.

256
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:37,359
This is nice.

257
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,000
Am I well suited for the mountains?

258
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,640
The mountains are probably well suited for your constitution.

259
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,940
Oh, my. Are you a monk?

260
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,410
Namaste.

261
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:57,279
I've been walking along this path for over 20 years.

262
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,049
An udumbara I've never seen before has bloomed.

263
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:05,490
Some say udumbaras bloom once every 1,000 years.

264
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,190
Others say they bloom once every 3,000 years.

265
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,329
You could even consider these flowers non-existent.

266
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,230
However, I would like to say this today.

267
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,839
It finally bloomed on the day you came.

268
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,240
Oh, my.

269
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,609
I don't understand a word you're saying.

270
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,279
Make a wish.

271
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:33,380
There must be a reason this flower came all the way here to bloom.

272
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,289
Dear Lord.

273
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:37,349
Dear monk.

274
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,960
I mean, dear flower.

275
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:43,960
You know, I can do whatever I'm told to do.

276
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:49,400
But I don't think I can go bald.

277
00:18:50,069 --> 00:18:53,499
I will get all 7 or 8 rounds of chemotherapy.

278
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,839
Could you please just let me keep my hair?

279
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,279
I look pretty only because of my hair.

280
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,880
So, please...

281
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,920
I also look pretty...

282
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,980
because of my hair.

283
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,450
I see.

284
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,058
What guided Ji Yeon next was...

285
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:15,859
an unknown smell.

286
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:19,960
I love this smell.

287
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,108
Is anyone here?

288
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:33,240
Yes.

289
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,680
I had to stop by because of this amazing smell.

290
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:40,578
Can you tell me what this place is?

291
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:41,990
A makgeolli brewery.

292
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,519
I see.

293
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:45,690
I must be a genius.

294
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,358
Slosh!

295
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:49,430
Just one cup.

296
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,669
(Makgeolli)

297
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,940
Slosh! Just one more cup.

298
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:07,380
Goodness.

299
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:09,278
Delicious!

300
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:12,250
It's so delicious!

301
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,859
This is nice.

302
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,759
Try this.

303
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:26,758
Only a small amount of this is created as makgeolli ages.

304
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,629
It's so clear and rare.

305
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,868
For you, it's on the house.

306
00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:31,899
Thank you, sir.

307
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,239
But I'm sorry.

308
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,808
All I can give you is this.

309
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:36,969
A wink. And a bullet of love!

310
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,109
Oh, you're going to give me a heart attack.

311
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,379
I should pour you another glass.

312
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,679
Don't die of a heart attack yet.

313
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,348
Give me another glass.

314
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:45,720
- Wait here. - Thank you.

315
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:46,980
Oh, my gosh.

316
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,750
It looks so holy.

317
00:20:59,829 --> 00:21:02,400
Maybe I should drink this and die.

318
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:04,640
Do you want to die?

319
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:10,740
The thing about this bottle is...

320
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:14,038
- that this is like life. - Yes.

321
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,879
It's exactly the same.

322
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,420
They live and die too.

323
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:20,319
You think it's dead, but it's alive.

324
00:21:25,589 --> 00:21:26,788
Pew-pew!

325
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:27,959
This is that.

326
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,930
Now I'm drunk. I love you very much. Thank you.

327
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,429
That's exactly what I'm saying.

328
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,229
Do you understand? Am I right?

329
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,499
Right?

330
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,839
You're so right!

331
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,179
Are they actually making conversation?

332
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,348
"When will you ever come back?"

333
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,608
That's what they said.

334
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,149
That's nonsense, isn't it?

335
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:55,489
It's absolutely ridiculous.

336
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,649
I was so...

337
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,750
Ji Yeon.

338
00:22:00,589 --> 00:22:02,088
That voice sounds familiar.

339
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:03,359
Han Ji Yeon.

340
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,799
What?

341
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,838
Seriously, Ji Yeon?

342
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:17,109
I know it seems insane.

343
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:18,609
But listen.

344
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,778
Once I start chemotherapy,

345
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:23,809
I can't go on a trip or drink alcohol.

346
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,278
I will lose all my hair after the first dose.

347
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:29,548
Then, I'll have nowhere to go but the hospital and my house.

348
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:31,858
I wouldn't be able to go outside even if I wanted to.

349
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:35,358
So, it makes more sense to do all of those things...

350
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:38,258
before my therapy rather than losing my mind later.

351
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:40,258
I'm not refusing chemotherapy.

352
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:43,629
I'm going to take it like a champ. You know I'm a good listener.

353
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,769
But...

354
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:48,669
the thought of going to the hospital tomorrow made me wonder,

355
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:54,508
"What if I have to stay there the whole time like my mom?"

356
00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:56,778
- Ji Yeon. - So, for one day,

357
00:22:56,779 --> 00:22:58,818
I wanted to go as far away as possible from the hospital...

358
00:22:58,819 --> 00:23:01,848
and have fun all day long, but...

359
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:03,349
Will you let me speak?

360
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,619
Okay.

361
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:07,490
Sorry.

362
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:10,529
So,

363
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,099
let's do it.

364
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,729
Let's have fun.

365
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,169
Do whatever you want to do...

366
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:18,140
and eat whatever you want to eat.

367
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,769
One day isn't enough. We need at least a week.

368
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,710
What? Look at you.

369
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,338
Don't look so touched now.

370
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:28,038
We're going to do everything we want to.

371
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,250
Everything.

372
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:34,990
You guys.

373
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,819
But how did you know I was here?

374
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,089
You posted pictures everywhere you went.

375
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,789
Right.

376
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,430
Wait. It's Ji Yeon.

377
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,900
"Haenam Fisheries?"

378
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:53,969
- Haenam? - Why were you posting pictures...

379
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,069
when you wanted to be secretive?

380
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,240
So what should we do first?

381
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,609
Anything...

382
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,380
but a nightclub.

383
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:06,950
Girls, come on!

384
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:09,589
- In a second. - Have fun.

385
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,589
Ji Yeon...

386
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:14,190
enjoyed her time like a lunatic.

387
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,069
Why aren't we going?

388
00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:26,240
The wind is too strong at the moment!

389
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,269
We call this type of wind the crazy girl's skirt!

390
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,038
- Then we should go now! - Sorry?

391
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:38,420
Because I'm the craziest girl!

392
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:41,150
- Wait. - Hey!

393
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,890
- Wait. - Wait.

394
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:56,470
Shouldn't we follow her?

395
00:24:57,269 --> 00:24:58,439
- Ji Goo! - Let's go.

396
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,470
Here we go!

397
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,939
Sir, let's go!

398
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,569
- Go! - Let's go!

399
00:25:04,339 --> 00:25:06,710
Yes!

400
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:21,319
Guys!

401
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:24,160
- Use your walkie talkie! - What?

402
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,828
Guys, this is awesome!

403
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:31,098
My hair is blowing in my face!

404
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:32,499
This is so funny!

405
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,039
I feel like I'm going crazy right now!

406
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,039
Yes, I think you are crazy.

407
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,749
This is so freaking awesome!

408
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,679
You ladies are great are swearing.

409
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,279
Sorry, but it really is so freaking awesome.

410
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:50,019
Let's fly!

411
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,618
- Let's fly. - Okay!

412
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:54,119
- Let's fly today. - Yes!

413
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:58,730
We used to drink and fly all the time.

414
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,029
But this time, we flew for real.

415
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,868
I love you, witches!

416
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:07,769
- I freaking love you too! - I freaking love you too!

417
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:14,949
Gosh, that's a terrifying sight.

418
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,548
Wait, this is us?

419
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:19,078
You should never do this with a guy. Just delete them.

420
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,249
- Why? They're funny? - Just delete them.

421
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,890
I want to go once more.

422
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:25,319
Again?

423
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,660
What's up with her eyes?

424
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:51,279
Guys!

425
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,920
Should we go to the sea now?

426
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,989
What do you think?

427
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,189
You can't hear her very well, right?

428
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,759
- Turn it off. - Okay.

429
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:07,659
That day, even the fish were getting caught by Ji Yeon...

430
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,670
as if they were at the end of their lives.

431
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,299
Help!

432
00:27:12,069 --> 00:27:15,108
She even caught a huge octopus that is usually never found...

433
00:27:15,109 --> 00:27:16,940
in these waters during this season.

434
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,950
Gosh, that looks great.

435
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:29,018
- Eat up. - Oh, that is incredible.

436
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:31,118
- This is legit. - It's the bomb!

437
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:34,690
All right, then. This is really the last one.

438
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:38,700
- Let's drink! - Let's drink!

439
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:41,160
With the octopus ramyeon, we drank...

440
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,829
for the last time.

441
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:50,009
What did you guys do?

442
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,750
Did it get a lot worse?

443
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:06,190
Her numbers are down 20 to 30 percent.

444
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:07,890
She hasn't even started chemotherapy yet.

445
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,799
What did you guys do?

446
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:13,200
Tell me.

447
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,369
Honestly, there were lots of possibilities.

448
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:20,568
It could have been the udumbara at Mount Dalma...

449
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:22,410
that granted her wish.

450
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,809
The special drink the makgeolli brewery owner gave her...

451
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,650
could have actually been the elixir of life.

452
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:31,778
According to the Korea Food Research Institute...

453
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:34,649
The effects of makgeolli that the drunk man told her about...

454
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,949
could have been true.

455
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,490
They say it has anti-cancer effects.

456
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:42,130
She might have laughed so much while paragliding that...

457
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:45,900
her endorphins and dopamine levels momentarily skyrocketed.

458
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,999
And then, for about 30 seconds,

459
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,399
she cried her eyes out.

460
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,868
That could have produced dynorphins which only occurs when you cry hard.

461
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:56,509
It could have had 4,000 times the effect of endorphins.

462
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:59,539
I'm so happy.

463
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:02,649
The huge octopus that she luckily caught...

464
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,078
could've been full of taurine.

465
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:06,848
It could have gotten rid of all the active oxygen and toxins...

466
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:09,848
inside Ji Yeon's body.

467
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:11,149
Isn't this insane?

468
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,459
- Let's drink! - Let's drink!

469
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,230
Of course, it's more likely that this isn't the case.

470
00:29:15,829 --> 00:29:18,159
That udumbara could've just been a wild flower...

471
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,229
that is commonly found in the mountains.

472
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,798
The free drink that the makgeolli brewery owner gave her...

473
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:23,868
This is really precious.

474
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:25,899
could have been a common drink...

475
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,939
that he gives out to other customers as well.

476
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,640
- Thank you. - Thank you.

477
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,108
The drunk old man who claimed to be a professor somewhere...

478
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:35,209
- could have just been... - My heart only beats for you!

479
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,548
absolute nonsense coming from an alcoholic...

480
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:40,680
who wasn't even aware of what he was saying.

481
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,559
If you wish to doubt, nothing makes sense.

482
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:50,289
If you wish to believe, everything is possible in this story.

483
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,460
What's certain is...

484
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,828
that these unbelievable possibilities came together...

485
00:29:56,829 --> 00:29:58,699
It is like a miracle.

486
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,170
and made a miracle happen.

487
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:12,650
After that, we left the hospital.

488
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:15,250
For a very long time.

489
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,629
This is the face of a man who has heard the unbelievable story,

490
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:33,399
but a story that he must believe, that a boy from India...

491
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,670
survived a plane crash by living on a boat with a tiger.

492
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,909
I know, right? It's hilarious.

493
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:41,139
Director Kang. I'm hitting the play button.

494
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,750
That's why you came to this mountain?

495
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,950
Yes.

496
00:30:48,049 --> 00:30:49,589
The real story...

497
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:52,960
starts after that.

498
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:59,859
(Work Later, Drink Now 2)
