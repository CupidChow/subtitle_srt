00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,750
It'll just take a second.

169
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:46,490
Hey, Ji Goo.

170
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,690
Is he crying again? Did he poop?

171
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,830
That probably means he's hungry this time.

172
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:52,230
He won't eat?

173
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,360
Then what would be the reason?

174
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:55,299
Did you give him a piggyback ride?

175
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:56,669
What's that?

176
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,899
You have to know what a piggyback ride is.

177
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,269
Watch, Ji Goo.

178
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:01,639
I'm ready.

179
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,879
Wrap up the baby like this.

180
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,909
Put a strap around his bottom so that he doesn't fall.

181
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,279
Bring it up to your shoulder...

182
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,490
and tie it fast. Do you get it? Just like this.

183
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,620
This is driving me nuts.

184
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,659
This won't work.

185
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,799
Come here.

186
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,139
Hi, I'm a monkey.

187
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:40,039
I love you.

188
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,210
Do you like this?

189
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,120
I love you.

190
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:46,250
Kisses.

191
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,690
Feeling better? Peekaboo!

192
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,590
Peekaboo.

193

She said she'd be back by five. Where is she?

194
00:10:56,529 --> 00:10:57,659
Peekaboo.

195
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,169
Ma'am, you said that you'd be back by five.

196
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:04,799

What was that?

200
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,049
Oh, I'm sorry.

Peekaboo!

202

I'll see you at this restaurant at 6:30pm.

203
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:28,389
If you stand me up again, I'll cry my eyes out.

204
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,490
Goodness. What do I do?

205
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:32,299
Oh, my gosh!

206
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:33,700
That looks delicious.

207
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,570
Hi.

208
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,809
Hey. Sliced raw octopus tonight. Get some soju.

209
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:45,440
But I want to drink beer tonight.

210
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,139
Hey, there. Take a seat.

211
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,850
Octopus, raw octopus

212
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,450
Why don't we drink something strong like Terra and Chamisul?

213
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,990
- Where's Ji Goo? - She has plans.

214
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:57,519
It's Ji Goo.

215
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:00,559
- What is that? - What's that on your back?

216
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:03,029
Give me the bottle in your hand.

217
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,730
Wait. Hi.

218
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,730
Now.

219
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,440
Let me drink first.

220
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,539
Not so fast.

221
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,909
Whatever situation you're in,

222
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:16,769
you can't drink with a baby in your arms.

223
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,139
There are laws too.

224
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,610
- No way. - No way.

225
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,980
But I'm not giving it to the baby.

226
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:23,610
- What? - Ji Yeon.

227
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,720
- What? - Come on.

228
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,149
Sit.

229
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,990
Darn it.

230
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:40,529
Oh, no.

231
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,269
Do something.

232
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:43,970
Call his mother.

233
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,070
She must have brought him here because she couldn't reach his mom.

234
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,340
- Hey, kid. - Sorry.

235

Where's his mom?

We wouldn't be doing this if we knew. Just drive.

Shouldn't you have taken a right?

Oh, I should have. This is crazy.

Keep your eyes on the road! It's not your first time here.

I have a mental breakdown when I hear a baby crying.

Soothe him or something.

Three women can't handle soothing a baby?

247

Hey, what makes you think that all three women are good at it?

248

Why are you bringing up gender?

Do you want me to say that there are four women here?

250

You ought to shut your mouth.

251
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:27,110
No, he should shut his mouth.

252
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,649
Is it normal for a kid to cry so hard?

253
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:29,850
Shouldn't we take him to a hospital?

254
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,879
It's normal for babies to cry. You're louder than him.

By the way, what's his name?

256

How would I know?

257
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,320
You don't even know his name?

258
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,820
Did you drink and kidnap him?

259

- Pull over! - Fine!

263
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:50,429
Did you actually pull over just now?

Don't do this in front of a baby!

Come inside.

- Right here. - Okay.

269
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:03,779
- Hold on. - I think he'll fall, though.

270
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:05,320
Right. Put him on the floor.

272

Come on, Jae Hee.

When did you breastfeed him?

281
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,440
How do you expect me to breastfeed him?

282
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,070
That means he's hungry. But...

283
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,440
- we can't produce milk. - We can't.

284
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,610
Well, we can give him baby formula.

303
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,539
Unbelievable.

304
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,250
I thought the sound of my toothbrush was the baby's cries.

305
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:44,750
Gosh, you scared me.

306

No...

What? I got it as a present from the director.

00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,069
- Bye. - Bye.

332
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,170
(Playing with Five Senses, Children's Songs)

333
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:15,170
Yes, we can fit your schedule, whether it's morning or afternoon.

334
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:17,809
If the long shoot feels like a bit too much,

335
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,740
I could switch you to the afternoon shoot.

336
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,849
Gosh, this little thief.

337
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,680
Why did he give you something that he stole?

338
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,150
That's why he's a weirdo.

339
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,049
Is this kind of like how cats bring dead mice...

340
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,059
as a present for their owners?

341
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:33,220
Gosh, what are you saying?

342
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:42,769
- No way. - Oh, good job!

343
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:45,940
Have we ever been so desperate?

344
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,470
A regular day of eating, pooping, and sleeping...

345
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,710
never felt so desperate before.

346
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,279
In other words, this means...

347
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,480
kids are beings that drive all mothers crazy.

348
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:06,960
That's why we were crazily happy at this moment.

349
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:16,569
He's crying.

350
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,240
He's crying again.

351
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:21,940
It hasn't been long since he cried, but he's crying again.

352
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,440
- Hey. - What's wrong?

353
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,210
Why? What's wrong?

354
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,980
Is our baby not happy about something?

355
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,880
We were out of bullets,

356
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,250
but we still had a long night ahead of us.

357
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:35,190
Are so many mothers hanging on throughout the long night...

358
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,059
just because they are mothers?

359
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,289
Gosh.

360
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,930
Hey, I can't do this.

361
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,700
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

362
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,940
We're not getting any sleep tonight.

363
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,670
Hey, Ji Goo. Don't you have some sort of plan?

364
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:56,339
I don't have any plans.

365
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,640
That's why you should've just finished things up at that house.

366
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:01,980
Then you guys go to bed.

367
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,109
I'll take him out and do whatever it takes,

368
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,349
whether I die or this punk...

369
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,119
Hold on.

370
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:10,549
I think we are all a little sensitive right now.

371
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,490
Hey, let's just take him to the police station.

372
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,059
I think his mom could've abandoned him.

373
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:17,490
I have a gut feeling.

374
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,960
The kid understands everything you say.

375
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,029
- Then raise him yourself. - Wait.

376
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:25,140
I feel like someone is knocking on our door.

377
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,210
- What? - What? Did you order something?

378
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,240
What? It's a man.

379
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,880
- Isn't that Director Toe? - No.

380
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,579
Why is this guy here?

381
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,819
You're the guy we saw at the hospital, right?

382
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:47,890
- Oh, yes. - So it is you.

383
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:53,500
Then did you two keep in touch?

384
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,700
No, I ran into him by chance while making a delivery.

385
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:58,400
Oh, right. It was by chance.

386
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,970
- It was by chance. - By chance?

387
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:06,210
Then she must've told you her home address by chance too.

388
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,309
I know, right?

389
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:09,910
I don't even know this guy's name.

390
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:11,349
Oh, that's...

391
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:15,990
I heard that Ji Goo had some trouble with a baby today.

392
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,990
So I thought I could help.

393
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,019
I was walking in the area.

394
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:24,230
And I happened to hear a baby crying and loud arguing from this house.

395
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,069
You don't have to tell us such a detailed Alibaba.

396
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:31,869
Anyway, welcome!

397
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:34,869
- It's called an alibi. - Yes, okay.

398
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:35,970
Oh, gosh.

399
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:39,279
Could I see the baby for a minute?

400
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,880
Will you be okay?

401
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,009
It's okay.

402
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:45,019
Does he know what he's doing?

403
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,279
- Oh, my. - One minute.

404
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,289
It's okay.

405
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:52,759
I practically raised my younger sibling.

406
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:55,789
Hey, it's okay.

407
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,730
He must've held babies often.

408
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:02,869
Look at his arms.

409
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,970
Is that so?

410
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:10,769
It's okay.

411
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:12,410
What is he doing?

412
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:15,680
I think he's communicating, like Kang Hyung Wook.

413
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:17,049
That guy trains dogs.

414
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:19,019
I say dogs are better at communicating.

415
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:24,759
I see.

416
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:27,660
Hey. You lucked out.

417
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:30,960
Hey, could you give me the baby carrier?

418
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,029
Oh, right.

419
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,000
Oh, my goodness.

420
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,430
Do you know how to do this too?

421
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:39,640
That's impressive.

422
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:41,299
You even know how to carry a baby on your back.

423
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:47,809
I'll lay him down once I think he's sleeping deeply.

424
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:49,109
You guys should get some rest.

425
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,750
- You look really tired. - Oh, there's no need to...

426
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,819
Yes, I think that would be good.

427
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,019
Then if you're okay with me staying here for a while...

428
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,819
Why don't you just stay the night?

429
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,230
We don't have money, but we have blankets.

430
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:06,000
Do we have blankets?

431
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,500
- Yes, we do. - We do.

432
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:29,119
By the way, do you think he's singing that lullaby for us too?

433
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,150
Don't mind him and just sleep.

434
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,990
When did you ever fall asleep to lullabies?

435
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,089
But you know, this scene...

436
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:38,500
reminds me of a polygamist household.

437
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,460
You're talking nonsense.

438
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,670
It is an odd sight.

439
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:44,740
What's even funnier is,

440
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:47,400
we don't even know those guys' names.

441
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:50,069
Then are they called Jae Hee and Jae Hee's dad for now?

442
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:51,440
Please, let's get some sleep.

443
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:56,079
But you know, if Director Toe said he would help with the baby,

444
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:58,009
Ji Goo would never have allowed it.

445
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,079
Don't you think Ji Goo is...

446
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,049
rather generous with that nameless man?

447
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:04,990
It is a strange man and three women, after all.

448
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:09,829
Hey, that man is putting the baby to sleep for us.

449
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,529
Director Toe was looking at the baby like he was a bug earlier.

450
00:23:12,529 --> 00:23:13,630
Didn't you see?

451
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,569
Yes, So Hee. I don't think he's marriage material.

452
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:16,799
If you marry Director Toe,

453
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,269
you will end up taking care of the kids on your own, for sure.

454
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:19,970
Did I ever say I was going to marry him?

455
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,009
But you know,

456
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:25,039
Director Toe doesn't drink.

457
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,109
He doesn't seem to be skilled in flirting with women.

458
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,250
He would make a decent husband.

459
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,809
Guys like him cause trouble later in life...

460
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,779
and do anything and everything.

461
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:34,420
Aren't you guys sleeping?

462
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:37,190
I'm so tired that I can't fall asleep.

463
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,190
We should've drank the beer.

464
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,690
- But you know... - Hey.

465
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,500
How many times are you saying that?

466
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,599
Sorry.

467
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,470
But you know, doesn't it feel weird...

468
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,069
to have a baby in the house?

469
00:23:53,069 --> 00:23:55,140
I think we'd be fine if you weren't here.

470
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,839
Still, we each played our parts today.

471
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,950
So Hee's tulip was a good idea,

472
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,410
and so was my music box.

473
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,549
- What did Ji Goo do? - The porridge.

474
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:07,680
I was the one who brought that, so that's mine.

475
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:09,319
Ji Goo, you brought...

476
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:21,029
Hey, stop staring at him. You're so embarrassing.

477
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:24,130
I learned today that a man looking after a baby is very sexy.

478
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:27,569
Today's MVP is Ji Goo's guy friend.

479
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,970
Don't be so sure that he's only her guy friend.

480
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,609
He could become her boyfriend.

481
00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:34,109
Anyone who talks from now on will get a beating.

482
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:38,980
Talk.

483
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,650
- Gosh, seriously? - Oh, my.

484
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,180
What?

485
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,599
What?

486
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,039
Am I seeing things?

487
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,549
What was that?

488
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,920
Come to think of it, earlier today...

489
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,579
Come on. No way.

490
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:28,220
What's that?

491
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:32,559
Oh, gosh!

492
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:54,319
Usually, in these circumstances...

493
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,250
The baby is still alive.

494
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,650
You have the money, right?

495
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,160
Please spare my baby.

496
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:02,289
Then I'll give you whatever you want.

497
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:04,890
Please...

498
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:06,960
This is what is normal.

499
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:13,740
I'll pay you however much you want.

500
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,369
So please...

501
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:20,279
Just don't give the baby back to me.

502
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:27,980
How did this woman...

503
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,190
end up as this kind of mom?

504
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:34,920
I thought he must be an angel.

505
00:27:35,829 --> 00:27:37,490
If I left the window open,

506
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,160
I thought he might fly away into the sky.

507
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,269
He was so pretty that I thought someone might snatch him away.

508
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,500
I couldn't keep my eyes off him.

509
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,410
That wasn't love. It was just...

510
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,180
who I was.

511
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:57,910
He was the loveliest part of myself who I had held deep within me...

512
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:00,119
for a long time.

513
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,920
I felt as if I had given birth to myself.

514
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,390
Honey.

515
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,259
Can you take the baby for a second?

516
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,789
Honey, can you give me the wet wipes?

517
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:12,660
Honey?

518
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,869
Did I have this baby on my own?

519
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,500
Isn't that what happened?

520
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,700
I think that's when it started.

521
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:25,079
If I lost my senses for a few seconds,

522
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:27,809
or if I wasn't by his side for a few seconds,

523
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:29,809
he would die.

524
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:32,619
If I was careless about taking care of him for once,

525
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,450
or if I wasn't cautious enough with his safety,

526
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:37,450
he would die.

527
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,059
Even if I did well for 86,399 seconds out of 24 hours,

528
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,759
if I missed a single second,

529
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:44,890
he would die.

530
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,400
The responsibility as a mom with this child's life in my hands...

531
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,869
That responsibility turned into fear.

532
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,539
The fear that I could kill that child.

533
00:28:55,539 --> 00:28:57,710
Was there ever a place for me in this house?

534
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:05,009
I happened to buy this Jagermeister at the convenience store that night.

535
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:09,890
After taking a sip of it,

536
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:12,720
I felt like I was flying back to my 20s.

537
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:17,130
I could just have some ramyeon instead of rice for a day...

538
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:21,599
and spend all day in bed, not really doing anything.

539
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:24,099
And yet, that didn't have any effect on my life.

540
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,039
I used to live such a carefree life.

541
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:31,309
Looking for someone to babysit for just an hour.

542
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,410
I'd leave the baby with a babysitter.

543
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:35,009
Then...

544
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:37,109
I'd watch him as I drank.

545
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,180
Seeing how fine he was without me...

546
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,789
made me feel relieved.

547
00:29:43,589 --> 00:29:45,420
And I thought...

548
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:48,390
someone would look after him even if I died.

549
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:50,559
That thought comforted me.

550
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,400
Here you go, ma'am.

551
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,700
Then, I must have...

552
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,170
forgotten for a second.

553
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:05,109
Or maybe I did it on purpose.

554
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:08,609
I don't remember that moment very well.

555
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,650
What I do know is...

556
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:20,059
that this baby always made his way back to me somehow.

557
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,829
- Good job. - Yes.

558
00:30:22,829 --> 00:30:23,960
I made this one.

559
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,430
No matter how I tried to get rid of him,

560
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,869
in the end, he would show up next to me again.

561
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:39,740
If it hadn't been for this evil being,

562
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,680
my husband wouldn't have abandoned me.

563
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,809
I had to save myself from the evil being.

564
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,849
You're in grace!

565
00:30:46,849 --> 00:30:50,920
Die. Just die!

566
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:53,890
Hey.

567
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,630
Don't cry. Jae Hee, don't cry.

568
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:14,740
I was jealous of you all.

569
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,549
Even when you couldn't walk properly after getting wasted,

570
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,950
you wouldn't be afraid of being drunk...

571
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,859
since you had two friends on each side.

572
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:30,390
Shut the heck up!

573
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,630
Why are you so happy?

574
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,680
What she needed wasn't a religious sect leader,

575
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:48,509
but a friend.

576
00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:53,119
Just drink freely today.

577
00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:55,220
We'll be here.

578
00:31:58,789 --> 00:31:59,819
Let's drink.

579
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,690
- He's asleep. - For real?

580
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,829
On this day, we saw the face of the child sleeping comfortably...

581
00:32:42,829 --> 00:32:44,029
next to the mother.

582
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,369
I want to have a baby again.

583
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,269
He's pretty.

584
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,539
- You're right. - He's sleeping well.

585
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:58,509
And we chatted non-stop until the day was bright,

586
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:00,720
night after day.

587
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,049
It's called Obok House.

588
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:03,390
Ji Yeon suggested that she come to the Obok House...

589
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,990
whenever she felt like drinking.

590
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:09,190
Then she talked about the history of Obok House unnecessarily.

591
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:11,829
She taught her good yoga postures...

592
00:33:11,829 --> 00:33:13,630
and breathing techniques for depression,

593
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,769
and then decided to fart, which is her specialty.

594
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,170
Oh, gosh.

595
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,140
If we break wind, we have nothing else to break.

596
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,980
We're friends now.

597
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:27,910
I'm down.

598
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,980
They eventually ended up as friends.

599
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,250
You know the two who said they were best friends? I said earlier.

600
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:35,490
I exposed a lot of behind-the-scenes stories of the station.

601
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,789
I'm frustrated.

602
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:39,359
- But she reacted the most... - It's surprising, right?

603
00:33:39,619 --> 00:33:42,019
- He seriously ate everything? - Yes.

604
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:44,930
when she heard her baby ate his baby food well.

605
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:47,960
It takes me a couple of hours to make this covered sweat.

606
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,700
When he spits everything out, it drives me crazy.

607
00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:57,440
Mom, the porridge you sent me...

608
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,809
Why? Are you worried that I put poison in it?

609
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,710
Do you have the recipe for it?

610
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:08,949
Potato, beef,

611
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:11,949
radish, zucchini, and various vegetables are the same.

612
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,389
But she said a little bit of onion juice...

613
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:15,789
and a lot of pear juice made it taste sweet and likeable.

614
00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:17,090
I see.

615
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,800
Didn't you graduate from Seon Il Girls' High School?

616
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,400
No, Sang Il not Seon Il.

617
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,730
I see.

618
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,099
At least you got one letter right.

619
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:30,710
Let's drink!

620
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,340
- Be quiet. - Oh, right.

621
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,110
If he wakes up, you make him sleep.

622
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:36,280
- Let's drink. - For goodness' sake.

623
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,409
ASMR.

624
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,050
007 Bang!

625
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,550
Please.

626
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:45,519
That's not it. You're crazy.

627
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,960
0-0-7, bang! You're wrong.

628
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,090
0-0-7, bang!

629
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:52,929
We became friends like that.

630
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,469
You aren't cursing, right?

631
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,030
The baby may live because of you,

632
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,860
but someday you will live because of the baby.

633
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,929
We're usually at the Obok House.

634
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:03,130
Come for a drink when life gets hard.

635
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,969
We can have meals together too.

636
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:07,739
But what's his name?

637
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,010
Jae Hee,

638
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:14,480
let's go home after mom finishes eating this.

639
00:36:15,309 --> 00:36:16,349
Okay?

640
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:34,960
Cheers!

641
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,840
It's refreshing.

642
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,269
The beer tastes awesome today.

643
00:36:43,809 --> 00:36:44,809
Wait a minute.

644
00:36:44,809 --> 00:36:46,179
Didn't you graduate from Seon Il Girls' High School?

645
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,309
- Yes. - No way.

646
00:36:48,309 --> 00:36:49,849
Then she was your alumnus?

647
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,159
Hey. Kang Hye Jin is passing by.

648
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,969
Who's she?

649
00:37:09,969 --> 00:37:11,530
She's the Queen of Seon Il Girls' High School.

650
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,900
At the national ballet contest or whatever,

651
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,340
she won first place.

652
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:18,809
Her legs are about to break.
