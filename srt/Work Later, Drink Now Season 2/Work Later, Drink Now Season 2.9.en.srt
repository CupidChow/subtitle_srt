I don't want to eat.

From head

329
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:39,240
What will you say

330
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,149
If I tell you, friend

331
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,590
Stand straight, So Hee.

332
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:57,529
Come on. Put your heels down.

333
00:15:57,529 --> 00:15:59,960
Stand up straight. That's right.

334
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,269
It's right here. Let's see.

335
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,940
It's here.

336
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,940
Let's see.

337
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:07,600
Goodness.

338
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,210
When did this young lady grow so tall?

339
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:14,139
Mom said I grew taller thanks to her.

340
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,950
That's what Mom told you?

341
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,049
I'm sorry.

342
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:20,720
When you get married in the future,

343
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,990
I'll get you the most expensive...

344
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,659
and nice things in the world.

345
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:27,659
Promise.

346
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:29,029
Promise? Sure.

347
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:30,659
Promise.

348
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
Dad.

349
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,370
What will you say

350
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:45,940
If I tell you, friend

351
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,720
I will be there

352
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,850
Like I will never give up

353
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,690
Mom!

354
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:03,889
What happened to Dad's room?

355
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,910
Baby, you're so cool! Speed up!

356
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,880
You're so cool!

357
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,619
Ms. Han, you call everyone "baby."

358
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:27,480
Of course, everyone is a "baby." They're not my dad.

359
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,349
Director Kim, look at this.

360
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:33,160
My hair keeps flying everywhere.

361
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:36,390
Are you okay?

362
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:39,359
Isn't it loud?

363
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:42,930
It would have been amazing if we could open the roof right now.

364
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:44,940
- That's... - It opens.

365
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,470
Really?

366
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,170
Doesn't the roof open?

367
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:51,440
Let's go.

368
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,240
Let's enjoy your car.

369
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:56,779
Does it really open?

370
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:02,150
This is so nice. Speed up.

371
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,890
Director Kim, speed up.

372
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,119
Go down.

373
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,359
Why are you closing it? Please let it go down.

374
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,160
Are you really okay?

375
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:13,059
Do you like hardcore swearing by any chance?

376
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,400
Darn it, you punks!

377
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,069
I'm Han Ji Yeon. Move out of the way.

378
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:25,779
The world sucks!

379
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,150
I love this so much.

380
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,420
It's not here, so stop.

381
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:37,450
Just stop.

382
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,160
How many times do I have to tell you it's not here?

383
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,359
How could it not be here?

384
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:48,609
Mom, don't lie.

385
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,029
How could you be like this?

386
00:18:51,069 --> 00:18:52,970
Ms. An, just calm down for a second.

387
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,640
Your mother just told you.

388
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:57,839
It was a good gong,

389
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,480
so she gave it to your father's junior colleague.

390
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,380
Do you think this makes sense?

391
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:04,519
Mom, it belonged to my dad.

392
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,579
Dad said he'd hand it down to our family for generations.

393
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:08,049
He even went to sleep with it.

394
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,319
Dad has been playing it all his life...

395
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:11,859
while having such a hard time clanging it on the streets.

396
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,589
There's only one of them in the world.

397
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:15,190
But how could you give that to someone?

398
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,859
Should I go to sleep with it then?

399
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,599
Mom.

400
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,529
Are you really my mom?

401
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,769
What is wrong with you?

402
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,710
That's Dad's room.

403
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:34,009
He covered the walls in red clay and laid the floor.

404
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,210
He worked on everything there.

405
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:40,950
Mom, don't you remember how Dad saved us in that room?

406
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:46,019
What is going on?

407
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,289
Take So Hee and go out quickly.

408
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:51,599
Hurry up and go out.

409
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,430
You said we would have all died if it wasn't for Dad that day.

410
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:57,029
You said no one was like him.

411
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,069
You said you would marry him even if you were born again.

412
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:04,369
But if you forget him like this,

413
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:05,910
what is he going to do?

414
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:09,109
I feel so sorry for him.

415
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,849
Mom, did you also throw away his chair?

416
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,460
Gosh.

417
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:23,630
You did. You also threw away his chair.

418
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:25,960
That was his chair.

419
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:29,230
It's his seat and his chair.

420
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:31,299
Where will he sit now?

421
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:32,539
Ms. An, stop it now.

422
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,309
What about the muffler I knitted for him?

423
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,039
Mom!

424
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:42,779
Yes, I threw it away.

425
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:45,849
If you were going to throw it away, you should have just given it to me.

426
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,390
Who do you think you are to throw it away?

427
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,119
I gave it to him.

428
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,220
How could you throw it away as you please?

429
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,200
Listen. This is my house now.

430
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:00,460
I'm still young.

431
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,470
How long do I have to live alone?

432
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:04,430
- What? - How much longer do I have...

433
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,440
to look at my dead husband's stuff and drink makgeolli?

434
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:10,809
I have a boyfriend now.

435
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,210
What?

436
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:16,210
Mom, you're crazy.

437
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,920
Mom, it hasn't been three years.

438
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,750
That means if we were living in the past,

439
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,950
his three-year mourning period wouldn't even have been over yet.

440
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:27,289
Ms. An, why are you so old-fashioned?

441
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:28,829
Darn it, step aside.

442
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:35,369
Aren't you going to sleep here?

443
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,240
Do you want me to?

444
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,109
How could I sleep here when there's no place for me to do that?

445
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:49,109
Dad and I have...

446
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:51,779
no place to sleep in this house. How could I do that?

447
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:55,720
You should just sleep here with your boyfriend.

448
00:21:58,059 --> 00:21:59,819
Ms. An.

449
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,690
Go away. I'm leaving alone.

450
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,059
- Please get her quickly. - Okay.

451
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:07,930
Ms. An.

452
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,829
I understand, so please get in the car.

453
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,700
I don't want to. Just let me go.

454
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:13,940
I understand.

455
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,309
I understand, so listen to me.

456
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,309
So Hee, just take these side dishes with you.

457
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,720
I packed some braised short ribs, sweet rice with nuts and jujubes,

458
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,980
and your favorite young radish kimchi.

459
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,650
I don't need it.

460
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:52,339
Are you okay? Please stand up.

461
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:56,450
I'm okay. Hurry up and go back.

462
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:01,990
No, please wait here for a second.

463
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:11,960
You wait here.

464
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,460
You?

465
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,670
Please stand up. I'll clean this up.

466
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:25,309
Stand up. Let's go.

467
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,779
I'll clean everything up.

468
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,009
Darn it.

469
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,579
Gosh.

470
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:03,680
Go away.

471
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,380
Go away. No.

472
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,480
Darn it.

473
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,559
When did she cut all sides of these?

474
00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:38,279
Do you know he's really big,

475
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:40,250
but he's actually a mama's boy?

476
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,490
Really? He doesn't look like it.

477
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,490
Well,

478
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:50,190
you know what people say.

479
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,259
About what?

480
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:58,000
Oh, my. That's crazy.

481
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,500
Yes, the set went crazy.

482
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,769
I didn't think he would be like that.

483
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:06,079
- Seriously. - I know. He looks good,

484
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,210
but who would have known?

485
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:15,720
Anyway, don't judge a book by its cover.

486
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,390
You didn't get lost again today, did you?

487
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:24,529
What a cozy and nice house.

488
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:26,660
I've never been to the countryside before,

489
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,970
so it feels a little strange.

490
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,430
I'm serious.

491
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,470
Isn't that right? He should be scolded.

00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:41,079
Natural spicy fish stew is the best.

493
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,849
You have to eat all the fish and soup.

494
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,680
Fish oil in the soup is...

495
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,450
the best tonic.

496
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,619
Did you know how to eat spicy fish stew?

497
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,029
Seriously? He's not a kid. How could he not eat this...

498

499
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,230
Director Kim, go ahead and eat too.

500
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,269
I'll scoop up my own food.

501
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,740
Okay, should I make a birthday drink now?

502
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,650
Okay, this is show time.

503
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,059
Happy birthday to you

504
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:32,430
Here is your drink.

505
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:37,130
The next one is for the beautiful, smart, and professional Director.

506
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,440
I'm going to drink a little slowly.

507
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,900
You already spit in front of me.

508
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,609
Just drink. Drink and spit later.

509
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:43,769
I'll accept everything today.

510
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,579
I also have to drive later.

511
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:49,750
No need. We can hire a driver.

512
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,579
Drink. We came all the way here.

513
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:53,579
Let's drink.

514
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,289
Who knew I would be witnessing this?

515
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:57,720
I can't believe you clinked glasses with me.

516
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,220
Just drink.

517
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:01,930
You're so mean to your sister.

518
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:04,759
You should just shut up and drink too.

Are you done being angry?

522
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,119
I wasn't angry.

523
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:35,329
Technically saying, you were throwing a tantrum.

524
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,960
It was the biggest tantrum ever.

525
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:42,799
You were also angry at me. You even called me "You."

526
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,430
I wasn't angry.

527
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,670
You could say I was calming you down.

528
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,269
How could I calm down when she says she has a boyfriend...

529
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:50,410
when it hasn't even been three years since Dad passed away?

530
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,339
Not even three years?

531
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,910
It's already been three years.

532
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:57,049
How could you mention a three-year mourning period in this era?

533
00:27:57,049 --> 00:27:59,119
I was kind of disappointed in you when you said that.

534
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:00,519
You're supposed to be an aware variety show writer,

535
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:02,119
but how could you be so old-fashioned?

536
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,619
If you keep doing that, I'll get out of the car.

537
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:05,289
Get out. I won't stop you.

538
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,160
I put up with you because of your mother.

539
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:09,490
I wanted to throw you in the rice field earlier,

540
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:12,029
but I barely stopped myself.

541
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,500
Ms. An, to be honest,

542
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,500
you haven't been to your mother's house in two years.

543
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:22,309
While you were staying in the mountain with your friends,

544
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:24,009
time must have flown by. But what about your mother?

545
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,839
She has lived in that house with your father for over 30 years.

546
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,250
I'm sure it wasn't easy for her to be alone...

547
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,450
without your father for two years.

548
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,819
Do you want me to stop the car?

549
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,789
I can pull over anytime and anywhere.

550
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:38,119
I can just drive away...

551
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:40,019
without looking back.

552
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:41,220
Who cares if you go or not?

553
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,829
I'm being serious.

554
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:44,130
I will really leave you here.

555
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,460
Do you know why?

556
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,099
I can stand everything,

557
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:49,299
but I can't stand people who are rude to their parents.

558
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,869
Who cares if they're polite to older people?

559
00:28:51,869 --> 00:28:53,140
They must be nice to their parents.

560
00:28:53,769 --> 00:28:56,309
Yes, I'm a rude undutiful piece of trash.

561
00:28:56,309 --> 00:28:57,509
Stop the car.

562
00:28:57,509 --> 00:28:59,440
Just abandon me.

563
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,559
Don't get out of the car right now.

564
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,390
It's dangerous.

565
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,880
I stopped the car because you told me to,

566
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,980
but I have no intention to abandon you.

567
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,809
So calm down.

568
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,920
I'm sorry for talking too harshly.

569
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,230
Stay here for a second.

570
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:50,890
I'll come back after I smoke.

571

You said it was dangerous.

Yes, Ji Goo.

00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:25,799

574
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:27,759
She still hasn't answered your call?

575
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,970
Okay.

576
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,769
I'll call her.

577
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:33,240
What's wrong with your voice? What are you doing?

578
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:35,910
I was sleeping.

579
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,140
I'm going back, so see you at home.

I'm hungry.

581

You'll obviously be hungry after throwing that tantrum.

Wear your seatbelt. Let's go.

Can't you get in touch with her?

That's surprising.

Yes.

I wanted to be a happy person.

I remember my mom being surprised by that.

like a kindergartener.

655
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:54,199
What do you mean?

656
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,030
Let's see.

657
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:58,630
That sofa.

658
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:01,969
That isn't the sofa your husband sat on.

659
00:35:02,139 --> 00:35:03,769
It's simply a sofa made of cloth.

660
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:06,210
But it's so old that it's worn out.

661
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:08,079
Take this chance and replace it with a new one.

662
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:12,150
And this? It's just a bowl made of brass.

663
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,920
You won't even get one dollar if you resell it at a junk shop.

664
00:35:15,219 --> 00:35:17,150
No, you can't. My husband...

665
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,519
No, ma'am. Don't put meaning into it.

666
00:35:19,889 --> 00:35:22,059
It's just a brass bowl.

667
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,960
Your husband isn't inside it.

668
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,929
Even if his soul is somewhere on this earth,

669
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:29,699
I doubt it's inside a mere brass bowl like this one.

670
00:35:29,929 --> 00:35:32,340
He must be somewhere nicer. Don't you agree?

671
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,099
This small gong.

672
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:37,110
That one? My husband...

673
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,309
No, ma'am.

674
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,309
This is just brass.

675
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,210
You don't need this, do you?

676
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,920
You're not going to hug this to bed, are you?

677
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:47,750
You should get rid of it.

678
00:35:49,789 --> 00:35:53,289
(Dongho Resources)

679
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:05,070
Ma'am. What do you see right now?

680
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:07,800
There's nothing in here.

681
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:11,969
That's not true. To be exact, we're inside a room.

682
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:14,679
What would a tenant who just moved in...

683
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,750
think of this room?

684
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,219
"Let's put this here and that there."

685
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,750
"Let's cover the walls with that."

686
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,449
They'd think something along those lines.

687
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,050
It's a space where you can do anything.

688
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:28,219
More precisely, it's an empty room.

689
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:31,559
Look at what's actually here.

690
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,530
How about fitness equipment? You could make this a workout room.

691
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,090
Gosh. Right here?

692
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:02,119
Yes. By the way, how are you this strong?

693
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,630
Geez, my back is killing me.

694
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,519
How cute.

695
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,550
Why did you leave that? You should've changed everything.

696
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,960
I couldn't get myself to erase baby An So Hee.

697
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:37,489
Gosh. You're a bigger baby than me.

698
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,659
Let's go.

699
00:37:41,429 --> 00:37:42,969
Apologize to your mother tomorrow.

700
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,199
I'll take care of it.

701
00:37:46,269 --> 00:37:47,900
Look after her more.

702
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,170
I'll take care of it, okay?

703
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,110
I...

704
00:37:58,679 --> 00:37:59,780
kind of like you.

705
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,349
Oh, my gosh.

706
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,250
But I don't like women.

707
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,519
I know that.

708
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:08,659
But don't hit on my brother, okay?

709
00:38:08,659 --> 00:38:10,659
- Kim Seon Jung. - Quiet.

710
00:38:11,929 --> 00:38:13,699
You should shut it.

711
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:16,170
- Ms. Han. - Yes?

712
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,230
You know what I mean, right?

713
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,940
Of course, I do.

714
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,840
Your brother is precious to you. So I know how you feel.

715
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,940
No. It's not about him being my brother.

716
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,440
This is between us as women.

717
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:32,110
Don't go for my brother.

718
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:35,650
Honestly, he's not that great.

719
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,619
Seriously?

721
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,789
Your phone has been ringing since earlier.

722
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,190
(Ji Goo)

723
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,760
You're ignoring it on purpose, right?

724
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:47,829
If you're avoiding it on purpose,

725
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,070
it must be a guy. I'm right, aren't I?

726
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:53,269
My gosh. If I had a boyfriend, I would be with him right now.

727
00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:54,969
Don't you agree?

728
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,780
Fine. I'll listen to Director Kim.

729
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,210
You're out.

730
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,250
Cheers.

731
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,380
- Cheers! - Yes.

732
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:10,050
- You looked stupid right now. - That's why you lose.

733
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,989
This is a wine bar currently hot on social media.

734
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,690
But honestly, their beer is better than wine.

735
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:19,300
But the queue is too long.

736
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,630
We're going to use the back door using my connection.

737
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:23,570
Hey, but...

738
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,539
You don't like places like this one, do you?

739
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:28,940
No, I do.

740
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:31,269
But you see...

741
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,920
Excuse me for a bit.

742
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,690
Yes, it's me. We're in front of the shop.

743
00:39:46,289 --> 00:39:47,760
But I don't think we can make it today.

744
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,630
Something urgent came up.

745
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,360
I'll call you again. Okay. Bye.

746
00:39:56,469 --> 00:39:58,369
He's the only friend I can use as my connection.

747
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:01,199
But using him today will be a waste.

748
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,039
With the state you're in.

749
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:07,309
I couldn't get in touch with my friend since morning.

750
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,079
Then you should get going.

751
00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:12,650
- Are you sulking? - More than that,

752
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:15,579
I can't understand anymore.

753
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,889
I know why you're using your friend as an excuse...

754
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:21,489
to cancel every plan we make.

755
00:40:21,489 --> 00:40:22,559
Excuse?

756
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:27,760
Frankly speaking, shouldn't you like dating more than your friends now?

757
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:29,829
You're not a teenager.

758
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:37,170
I should at least greet my friend in the shop.

759
00:40:37,409 --> 00:40:38,440
Be careful on your way.

760
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,079
Geez.

761
00:40:46,179 --> 00:40:47,179
Darn it.

762
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:48,679
Try this.

763
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,190
- Mr. Hwang. - Hey, Ji Goo.

764
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,820
- Oh, my. - Did Ji Yeon stop by?

765
00:40:51,889 --> 00:40:53,059
Are you still looking for her?

766
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:55,690
Why do you ask? She called me earlier.

767
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,860
- She called you? - She asked which one was better...

768
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,059
at the Paldang place right now, spicy fish stew or mandarin fish.

769
00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:01,199
- When? - Earlier in the day.

770
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:03,230
- Who was she going with? - I don't know.

771
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,599
Darn it. This is bad.

772
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,900
- I'm off. - Okay.

773
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:09,969
What was that?

774
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:24,289
What?

775
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,329
I have never lost contact with her for this long.

776
00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:31,329
Please track her location.

777
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,599
She was last in Paldang.

778
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,429
Yes. Okay. I'm on my way to the police station.

779
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:43,340
Yes, So Hee. I heard Ji Yeon went to Paldang during the day.

780
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,909
But I'm having a bad feeling.

781
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,340
So I filed a missing person's report...

782
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,840
A missing person's report? Why?

783
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,250
So Hee. Did you not understand a word I said today?

784
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,280
I told you countless times...

785
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,750
I couldn't get in touch with Ji Yeon the whole day.

786
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:56,650
What are you saying? I talked to her on the phone an hour ago.

787
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,190
What?

788
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:07,460
I had a great time, Director Kim. Get home safely.

789
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:12,969
Yes, So Hee?

790
