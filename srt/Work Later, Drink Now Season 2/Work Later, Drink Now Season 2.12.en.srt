6
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:25,600
- Really? - Yes.

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,199
It is interesting.

8
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,070
- But do you get it? - I know what you mean.

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,440
I still can't understand.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,100
Tell me how that is even possible.

11
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,469
How do you recognize your father from an arm...

12
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:36,979
without even looking at his face?

13
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:38,409
She must have seen his face too.

14
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:40,950
I saw his face when the car took off.

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,320
The shape of his head, forehead, nose, cheeks, and jawline...

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,990
were all a match.

17
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,590
It's the exact face that I imagined...

18
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,119
from his voice when I was little.

19
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:54,090
Why are you wearing my clothes as if they're yours?

20
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,759
I'll bring my clothes tomorrow.

21
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:58,000
This is so comfy. Ji Goo, can I borrow your toothbrush?

22
00:00:58,359 --> 00:00:59,759
So, you didn't follow the car?

23
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,469
Interestingly enough,

24
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,439
we stopped at the next red light at the same time.

25
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,239
Seriously?

26
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:07,469
I bet he's your dad.

27
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:10,180
And he was on the phone at that moment.

28
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,980
I got to listen to his voice too.

29
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,280
The little path through...

30
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,480
Sung Soo, quiet.

31
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,189
It must be if I remember it correctly.

32
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:21,989
I'm on my way to school,

33
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:24,620
so I'll review it and get back to you.

34
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:26,620
"Remember" and "school."

35
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,859
Those two were the only words that I could make out.

36
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,329
But of all words,

37
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:32,530
why "remember" and "school?"

38
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,200
Say his wife called and asked,

39
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,129
"Where did you put it?"

40
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,200
He says, "I don't remember."

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,370
She says, "I told you to come home early."

42
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,939
He says, "I don't remember that."

43
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:42,370
Maybe that was the conversation.

44
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,409
Or it could have been his child.

45
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,079
"How was school?"

46
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,750
"Did anything happen?"

47
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,549
Or he's a professor.

48
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,650
Yes, he works at a school.

49
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,519
"Remember" must have been a word...

50
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,890
his current research topic.

51
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,359
That's what it leads to?

52
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,760
He could be a professor.

53
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:03,290
Right? Don't you think so?

54
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,500
You've got good ears.

55
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,560
When you think about it,

56
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,069
Ji Goo has always believed Ji Yeon's stories.

57
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:11,469
I could tell that he was intellectual.

58
00:02:11,469 --> 00:02:12,900
Professors are intellectual.

59
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:15,939
Here's the most critical part. The wind blew at that time, and...

60
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:17,539
- Did you smell something? - Yes.

61
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,020
Paper and a hint of steel...

62
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,889
that comes from a father?

63
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,490
You're taking it way too far.

64
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,389
Come on. What is that?

65
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:33,889
- Gosh. - Yuck.

66
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:39,159
And Ji Goo is the most thoughtful.

67
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,469
That's when I realized.

68
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:44,099
We stopped at the same red light twice.

69
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,870
He was on the phone next to me with the window rolled down.

70
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,669
And the wind blew at that moment.

71
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,680
His face, voice, and smell all came to me...

72
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,680
in that split second.

73
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,050
It meant that I'd already met him.

74
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,080
My only job is...

75
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:00,550
to embrace it.

76
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:04,060
I get it. Go and rinse your mouth already.

77
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:06,219
- Go and rinse it. - Okay.

78
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:12,800
So, she didn't follow him, right?

79
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,030
She knows the plate number or has dashcam footage.

80
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,699
It's either of the two. Otherwise, she can't be so sure.

81
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:17,939
I see.

82
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:21,439
And Ji Goo is the one who knows Ji Yeon best.

83
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,210
So, were you happy without me?

84
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,409
Sure.

85
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,319
When did you start washing your hair before bed?

86
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,020
Don't get me started.

87
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,620
I didn't wash my hair.

88
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,759
I was trying to wash my feet, and water dropped from the ceiling.

89
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,830
The showerhead is acting weird these days.

90
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:41,930
Right.

91
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,699
The water started spraying from the hose, not the ceiling.

92
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:45,699
What are you saying?

93
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:47,770
It's always been the hose, not the ceiling.

94
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,639
No, it hasn't. I've always used the ceiling showerhead.

95
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,300
I guess you switched it to the hose.

96
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,069
- Why would I? - Well, it wasn't me.

97
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,680
Wait. Was it you?

98
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:01,379
Right. I started getting water on my head when she moved out.

99
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:02,379
Why, you...

100
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:05,219
Didn't the TV start acting weird after she left?

101
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:06,419
Oh, right!

102
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:09,949
I get annoyed every time I turn it on nowadays.

103
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,360
Yes. The receiver turns off when you turn the TV on,

104
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,789
and the TV turns off when you turn on the receiver.

105
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:16,089
Yes! They used to turn on at the same time before.

106
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:18,860
Why are you looking at me again?

107
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:21,829
It was her.

108
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,399
She's been keeping the TV and the shower in line.

109
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,269
I don't have that much time, guys.

110
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,040
Let's say that I did it because I was too bored.

111
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,480
How would I know...

112
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,879
who's taking a shower next to switch it every time?

113
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:36,310
Am I a fortune-teller? Do you think I live in the bathroom?

114
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,980
She has a point.

115
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,689
Isn't it strange, though?

116
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:43,319
I bet a ghost did it.

117
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,660
Whatever.

118
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,129
This feels so nice. My house is the best.

119
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:50,360
- So, are you happy that I'm back? - No.

120
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,660
We still haven't unraveled the mystery...

121
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,269
- of the shower and the TV. - How could you say that?

122
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:57,339
What's for sure is that the shower and the TV...

123
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:01,069
both came back to normal the day Ji Yeon returned.

124
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:04,339
How could this be?

125

(Part 12, Three Hours and One Year)

126
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:38,110
Am I in the wrong, ma'am?

127
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,180
Don't say that. It was Ji Goo's fault.

128
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,720
It's about time you cut her off from your life.

129
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,519
She needs to realize what it's like to be lonely.

130
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:48,949
Anyway, I was so fed up with her...

131
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,860
that I packed all my stuff and moved out.

132
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:54,329
I even took the side dishes that you made.

133
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:56,060
Well done.

134
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:58,360
Do you want me to make you some more?

135
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,699
That's fine.

136
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:11,740
What are you doing?

137
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,779
There are a lot of side dishes.

138
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:15,480
Ji Goo's mother came by.

139
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,120
She brought a bunch of them when Ji Goo doesn't even eat them.

140
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,689
Because she's a mom.

141
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:23,889
Why are you up so early?

142
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:25,790
My makeup products and clothes are all at Director Kim's house,

143
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,329
so I'll drop by and go to work.

144
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:28,589
- See you. - Bye.

145
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:35,370
Director Kim!

146
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,750
I'm the one who did this to you?

147
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,180
You don't have to remind me. I'm so sick of everything now!

148
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,189
Hey!

149
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:00,459
Try and take one step further.

150
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,800
They must have fought hard.

151
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,370
It's not like they're going to see it through.

152
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,209
What?

153
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,350
You scared me.

154

Hey, there.

155
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:32,089
You look so shabby.

156
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:33,459
Don't you have a razor?

157
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:36,589
Well, I know it's somewhere here.

158
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,959
Don't eat ramyeon. I packed you some food.

159
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,800
Why is your instant rice in the shoe rack?

160
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,509
What's wrong with that?

161
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,180
- Are you moving? - No.

162
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,750
How long has it been since you moved in here?

163
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,610
About a year?

164
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,620
Gosh.

165
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:01,990
Gosh, your stuff is still all over the place.

166
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,519
Your TV is still on the floor?

167
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,589
Can you hang the clock on the wall?

168
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:06,790
I know it's weird,

169
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,560
but I feel relieved when you yell at me in that tone.

170
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,259
Let me continue eating.

171
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,800
Is this your mother's food?

172
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,399
My friend's mother.

173
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,839
I knew it wasn't from Jeolla Province.

174
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:22,610
But when a mother cooks food, it's always good.

175
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,810
Can you be more classy when you eat?

176
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,480
- How do you do that? - Gosh.

177
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,350
Seriously.

178
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,519
It's like there's a hole in your jaw.

179
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,220
Gosh.

180
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,059
I hear you're coming back to work next month.

181
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:43,960
We're on different teams now.

182
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:46,559
- Sorry. - Why would you feel sorry?

183
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,200
I failed to discipline the youngest writer.

184
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,600
Anyway, I'm glad that you don't seem angry anymore.

185
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,269
- About that FW or something... - Stop!

186
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:55,940
Stop bringing that up.

187
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,340
It's upsetting.

188
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,509
I also want to stop talking about it,

189
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:02,250
but you seem to be deeply mistaken.

190
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:05,950
I won't be mistaken anymore,

191
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,889
so...

192
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,519
It means friends who benefit from each other, right?

193
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,789
Do you want to see...

194
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:16,789
what the benefit is?

195
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,529
She was right, you know.

196
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:24,139
The people at work, my friends,

197
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,639
my mom,

198
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,370
and even my deceased dad...

199
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:32,309
all knew that I was into you.

200
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:35,279
Well, I did know that I was.

201
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,179
But it was embarrassing that I was physically attracted,

202
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:42,519
and I didn't want to admit it.

203
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,850
I told you so.

204
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,259
It's more accurate to follow your body, not your brain.

205
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:49,129
But how could you call it sexual partners?

206
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:50,190
What else should I call it?

207
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,330
Do I have to teach you every single thing?

208
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:56,169
Forget it.

209
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,539
I'll just teach you.

210
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:59,870
Do exactly as I teach you for the rest of your life.

211
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,970
That's a good idea.

212
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:01,970
Teach me.

213
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,769
I'm a pretty good learner.

214
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,879
No, just...

215
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:09,710
You know what it is.

216
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,179
"At some point,"

217
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,789
"I could only see you."

218
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:16,990
Or,

219
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,059
"I think I'm into you."

220
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,690
"Will you..."

221
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:23,529
"Will you..."

222
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,830
Will you?

223
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:27,669
Will you...

224
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,870
That's it.

225
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:34,210
have sex with me?

226
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,539
What?

227
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:42,950
(Shikpang Delivery)

228
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,320
You're...

229
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,960
- It's me. - Where are you going?

230
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,090
To you.

231
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,960
Back in the day, I only saw people...

232
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,169
who were as lazy as me at the park.

233
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:06,539
Now, I feel like all the diligent people in the world...

234
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:08,070
come here.

235
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:10,809
They make time to work out,

236
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:12,679
walk their dogs,

237
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,549
and go on dates.

238
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,720
It makes me think that people like me...

239
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,820
don't deserve to be here.

240
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,120
I know, right?

241
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,019
Where have the homeless gone?

242
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,759
I wasn't homeless, though.

243
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:31,230
I'm sorry, but I'm busy right now.

244
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,730
My bike is right there.

245
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,799
Sorry.

246
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,029
I was only thinking of myself.

247
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,470
What are you up to these days?

248
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:40,340
Why don't you make videos again?

249
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,710
"Mr. Kind Paper" was quite popular, wasn't it?

250
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,309
There's a new channel called "Mr. Kinder Colored Paper."

251
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:50,409
He's kind,

252
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,480
and he's more diligent than I am.

253
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,120
I've been losing constantly.

254
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,019
Do you want to deliver stuff with me?

255
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:02,830
You know,

256
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,830
I wanted to do something with you.

257
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,330
Do you...

258
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,299
want to go to London with me?

259
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,580
I had been doing something for years,

260
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:19,610
but I'd always failed.

261
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:21,809
But that day,

262
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,720
my first guest visited that alley.

263
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,090
And that was you, Ji Goo.

264
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,690
My paper blossom using static electricity...

265
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,460
floated for the first time.

266
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:44,370
Not long after, I was able to make it fly from the ground.

267
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,509
Coincidentally, they all happened when you were there.

268
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:49,909
And some time ago, that happened...

269
00:12:50,909 --> 00:12:52,210
in my studio.

270
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,210
Things that I had failed at for years...

271
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,409
all started working out.

272
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:00,679
The fragments of my doubts...

273
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,549
found their places at once.

274
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:05,220
I can't even remember how I submitted my work,

275
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:09,059
and I guess it astounded some people overseas.

276
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,629
Dear Mr. Han.

277
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:12,799
Your art, "From Earth to the Earth,"

278
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:15,899
has been selected as the Art of the Year 2022.

279
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:18,340
We would like to exhibit your work in our museum,

280
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,639
and we're going to support...

281
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:21,970
everything about your paper work activities in London...

282
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,039
for a year.

283
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,379
We're looking forward to meeting you in London.

284
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,110
Sincerely, Mark.

285
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,610
PS, I hope you can see your "Earth" work together.

286
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,250
The award doesn't mean much to me.

287
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,750
What motivated me more were your words...

288
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:40,190
that made me realize I could also achieve something.

289
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:43,659
So, I wanted to go with you.

290
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:46,299
I want to be with you in everything.

291
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,929
The receiver cannot be reached.

292
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,340
- They're both not picking up. - Please leave a message...

293
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,269
But this has never happened before.

294
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,370
Is something going on?

295
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,779
Do you want to go and watch the ocean with me?

296
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,490
It's natural!

297
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,330
Are you okay?

298
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,960
Hold my hand.

299
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,610
They're so fresh! I love it.

300
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,139
- What kind of sashimi do you like? - Sorry?

301
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,179
What's your favorite sashimi?

302
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,250
Oh, my gosh!

303
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,809
Look at that thing!

304
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,850
That's so funny.

305
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,559
I'm in trouble. This soju is...

306
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,960
too sweet!

307
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:51,600
This is bad. I'm off to such a smooth start.

308
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,899
Let's have another.

309
00:14:56,769 --> 00:14:58,669
All right.

310
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:01,340
Cheers.

311
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:11,019
When I eat two slices of sashimi and a shot of soju,

312
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:12,519
there's still hope.

313
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:14,389
But if I eat one slice of sashimi and one shot of soju...

314
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:17,049
Then that night is bound to be crazy.

315
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:18,419
I'm doomed.

316
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,620
Cheers!

317
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,330
Bottoms up.

318
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,460
Drink the whole thing.

319
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,029
Drink!

320
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:39,639
In exactly ten minutes, I'll fall flat on my face...

321
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:42,909
What?

322
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:53,990
You didn't tell me he was here.

323
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,659
Come on. I didn't need to tell you.

324
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:59,399
Of course, he's here, considering the fight between you two.

325
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,600
Take a shot.

326
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,070
Then, we'll talk.

327
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,570
He's knocked out.

328
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,669
Here you go.

329
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:15,779
Drink up. To the end of the night!

330
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,049
I'm not even married,

331
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:25,559
and now I'm old.

332
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,690
I have my own life,

333
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,789
you know?

334
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:33,129
Hold on.

335
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:34,669
Spit it here.

336
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:42,039
Get up. Have something to eat.

337
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,480
- What... - I want to go home.

338
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,480
What?

339
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,909
Where do you think you're going? Sit.

340
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,049
You're not going anywhere.

341
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,950
Can you imagine how betrayed I felt back then?

342
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,590
How could she hate me so much?

343
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,569
All right. Wake up, both of you.

344
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,730
Sit up.

345
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,539
Director Kim.

346
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:19,410
Your younger brother...

347
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,980
never cared about being a superstar as the prodigy.

348
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,650
His happiest moment was playing hopscotch with you.

349
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,450
He liked you even more than his mom and dad.

350
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,490
And when he was preparing...

351
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,390
to compete with other prodigies in a global contest,

352
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:38,630
he saw you burning his passport so that he wouldn't take the plane.

353
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,700
How shocked would he have been?

354
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,230
You knew about that?

355
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:48,539
What's the point of being a gifted child?

356
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,140
He got lower grades than normal students,

357
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,339
and people talked about him behind his back for being dumb.

358
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:57,109
Who cares what they say about you?

359
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,920
They speak because they all have mouths.

360
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,490
You can't take note of everything they say.

361
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,819
That's why your beautiful ears are unwell.

362
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,359
You're so frustrating.

363
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,759
Ms. Han, this is...

364
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,529
not that simple.

365
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:15,930
You're right. It's not that simple,

366
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,569
so you take the simple approach.

367
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:19,769
Look at her. She was trying to take care of you,

368
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:22,210
and she couldn't even get married in her old age.

369
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,910
Does she lie around in front of the TV at home,

370
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,609
or blow-dry her hair at ease?

371
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:28,980
She's struggling for no reason.

372
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,750
Your sister is not your mom or dad.

373
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:32,750
Director Kim.

374
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,789
You haven't been so wronged that you should be crying like this.

375
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,420
What's so bad about your one and only brother...

376
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,119
having a great life?

377
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:42,589
Were you that jealous of your mom complimenting him...

378
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:43,930
for eating fish well?

379
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,700
Was that why you gulped down that fish with all those bones?

380
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,900
That's why...

381
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,069
you're hawking up phlegm at your age just because you're a little drunk.

382
00:18:50,069 --> 00:18:52,269
You'll never get married now.

383
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:54,809
And if you're going to hawk up phlegm,

384
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:56,509
you should do it properly.

385
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:58,579
You don't even know how it's done.

386
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:01,880
Seriously, the pair of you are exactly alike.

387
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:03,349
No wonder you're related.

388
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:06,349
You're both so frustrating and lack reconciliation skills.

389
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,779
There's no communication whatsoever.

390
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,920
You're like a divided country.

391
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,220
It's frustrating to watch you. How will you live together?

392
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,720
Look at me.

393
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,930
I had a huge fight with my friends,

394
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,359
but I had a dramatic reconciliation in a week.

395
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:21,269
This is all about having conversations.

396
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:22,700
Conversational skills.

397
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,769
Communication. You know what I'm saying?

398
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,109
What will you do?

399
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:31,980
Will you be at each others' throats like little kids at this age?

400
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,910
- Kim Sun Guk! - No, I don't want that.

401
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:35,750
Then you're fine. Kim Seon Jung.

402
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,980
I mean, Director Kim.

403
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,420
Hey.

404
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,119
Since your hands are already outstretched,

405
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,420
why not make up?

406
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:49,759
You could shake hands, do a love shot, or hug.

407
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:51,160
- Not that. - Come on.

408
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:56,869
Let's get it over with and go home already.

409
00:19:56,869 --> 00:19:58,500
I'm getting tired too.

410
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:01,140
I have a lot to do, you know.

411
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,640
Will you stay here all night?

412
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:08,579
Good.

413
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:11,319
Okay, cut. That's a wrap for today.

414
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,730
What time is it?

415
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:26,400
Let's sleep more.

416
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:30,630
Shall we?

417
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:34,369
The smell of your hair is so nice.

418
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,710
What are you saying?

419
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,140
Don't go.

420
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,210
You hung the clock on the wall.

421
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,380
I'll put everything in its place.

422
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:48,920
Finding one's place...

423
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:51,390
makes me feel excited but scared too.

424
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:53,259
Why is that?

425
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:55,190
Three years ago,

426
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,589
I made a spot for you, but you disappeared.

427
00:20:58,529 --> 00:20:59,700
I'm sorry.

428
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:01,869
I had my reasons for that.

429
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:08,769
Wait, this position is kind of embarrassing.

430
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:11,210
Let's make this your spot from now on.

431
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,250
Well, this is...

432
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:17,309
a little too provocative.

433
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,849
So who told you to hang up the clock?

434
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:21,049
You already stepped foot in it. There's no backing out.

435
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,849
Don't go anywhere now.

436
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,589
Do you mean you want to live together?

437
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,960
I didn't mean it like that.

438
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,029
Sweetie, you sure take things fast.

439
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:32,099
Let's move in together!

440
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:33,400
- Move in? - Yes!

441
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,430
Shall we start things off with a kiss?

442
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,529
Hang on!

443
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,569
I'll go brush my teeth.

444
00:21:38,569 --> 00:21:39,670
No, you don't have to.

445
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,509
I love the smell of your breath.

446
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,210
- I love dirty things. - Come on!

447
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,470
You must be crazy!

448
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,480
Stop going overboard.

449
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,579
Gosh.

450
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:51,980
What?

451
00:21:56,289 --> 00:21:57,549
Who are you?

452
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:05,230
It's me.

453
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:08,130
What is it?

454
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,500
Darn it. Seriously?

455
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,680
Within five minutes of agreeing to move in together,

456
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,119
his father with dementia came to see him.

457
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:30,990
Oh, my goodness.

458
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,059
What did Director Kang say?

459
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,119
He wasn't in his right mind.

460
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,390
I think it's because of the trauma from his childhood.

461
00:22:36,829 --> 00:22:38,200
He opened up the fridge...

462
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,059
and started stuffing his face with whatever he could grab.

463
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:41,160
And I...

464
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,200
couldn't watch that anymore, so I just left.

465
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,559
Look at this.

466
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:09,230
If this is developed,

467
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,359
a cultural complex will be built here.

468
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:13,900
Long story short,

469
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,630
it's been so long since your mom died.

470
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,829
What use is it for her to be buried in that valuable land?

471
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,839
If we sell the land without moving her grave,

472
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:26,579
the time she spent lying there would be worthwhile, wouldn't it?

For dying in front of her own son.

I'll sign it.

lost weight, and did his best to live his life.

493
00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:01,470
He is still his dad after all.

494
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,250
Gosh, why do all the pitiful things in the world belong to An So Hee?

495
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,849
Just go and work for UNICEF.

496
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:13,920
Gosh. I'm not in the mood to joke around.

497
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,220
Neither are we. Listen carefully.

498
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,819
If his son can't take care of him his whole life,

499
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:19,390
neither can you.

500
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,160
This is outside of your control.

501
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,960
Don't take the bait. This isn't yours.

502
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:25,960
That's why I think I need a family.

503
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:27,900
We're a family.

504
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,329
We're not a family, technically.

505
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:30,670
Be honest.

506
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,400
Why won't you eat the side dishes that your mom makes?

507
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,210
Darn it. That's because...

508
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:36,910
It's your own vanity.

509
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,309
You're a family by blood.

510
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:41,710
You don't feel desperate,

511
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,309
even if you don't eat those side dishes.

512
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:47,049
You don't feel anxious, even if you fight like crazy.

513
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,549
It's because you share the same DNA, which is an undeniable truth.

514
00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:54,220
You know you can always trust that fact.

515
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,730
I do admit it to a certain degree,

516
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,059
but even if you're family...

517
00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:00,630
Forget it. She's just protesting right now.

518
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,170
She wants to go see her dad.

519
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,470
- No, I'm not. - Come on.

520
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,869
By the look on her face, she's the one who has something to trust.

521
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,569
You're right. I was right.

522
00:26:10,339 --> 00:26:12,880
He's some big shot professor...

523
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,579
in life sciences or something.

524
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:16,579
He's worked at NASA before...

525
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:18,380
and did a bunch of interviews too.

526
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,519
Hey... Gosh.

527
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,450
There was a reason for her IQ.

528
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,789
So will you go meet him?

529
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:27,759
Let's drink.

530
00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:31,490
- Let's drink. - Let's drink.

531
00:26:38,069 --> 00:26:40,200
He hasn't played the guitar in a while.

532
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,500
He asked a girl out but got rejected.

533
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,309
- By Hyun Ju? - Yes.

534
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:45,440
Unbelievable.

535
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,549
But didn't he get rejected once before too?

536
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:49,980
That's why he went on a trip.

537
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,950
Hey, he can't go on another trip.

538
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,579
I don't have anyone

539
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:00,789
Even if you say it's okay

540
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:02,960
I want to give you everything

541
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:08,329
That's just not how I feel

542
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:11,529
By the way, this song is so sad. Is it just me?

543
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,539
Ms. An. I'm sorry.

544
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:17,970
My situation right now...

545
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,880
I don't think I can be dating in peace.

546
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:23,880
Gosh. That's just how I am.

547
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,319
I'm sorry.

548
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,960
You said you weren't a good fit for this world, right?

549
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:36,430
But you haven't been to the other side of the world yet.

550
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:39,099
You might be a good fit there...

551
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:41,660
if we go together.

552
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:48,170
From what I can see,

553
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,309
you are like a balloon.

554
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:54,009
People don't know that, so they think you're cheerful.

555
00:27:54,109 --> 00:27:57,180
But you fly around and get caught here and there.

556
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,079
You can't settle down anywhere.

557
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:02,849
That's how it is for people with weak ties to their families.

558
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,619
Hey, you know...

559
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,930
Do you remember when we went to Laos?

560
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:12,359
Of course, I do. It was so much fun.

561
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:16,569
We were taking a picture in front of that arch when we fell backward.

562
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,440
And at the temple, she was touching that statue in the...

563
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,500
The private parts.

564
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,509
- Right. - We got yelled at for an hour.

565
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:23,910
Why is it always me?

566
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,779
Hey, you should be glad we only brought that up.

567
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:27,839
She was going crazy in front of a hotel...

568
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,750
with a guy she just met at a club, saying she'll marry him.

569
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:33,450
Do you remember that?

570
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:37,289
I totally remember those three hours.

571
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:39,220
Those three hours were really something.

572
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:41,930
I think those three hours keep becoming clearer...

573
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,630
as time goes on.

574
00:28:54,869 --> 00:28:56,269
(2 weeks later)

575
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,109
How did two weeks go by?

576
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,180
I'm off.

577
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,250
Okay.

578
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,079
Ji Goo, who seemed like she'd never leave,

579
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,420
was the first one to leave our side.

580
00:29:07,819 --> 00:29:10,349
She didn't even turn back once. Mean wench.

581
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:11,789
I knew she'd be like that.

582
00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:13,920
That's why I didn't lend her my dress.

583
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:17,230
Don't cry.

584
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,539
I think those guys are crazy.

585
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,740
That was how Ji Goo left our side.

586
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,049
And a little later,

587
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:38,009
this girl packed her bags too.

588
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,119
Can you keep the house safe?

589
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:41,579
The house should keep me safe.

590
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:44,690
I don't know where I'll be once you guys get back.

591
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:46,859
It's all good, but just don't go to Director Toe.

592
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:48,960
Get going.

593
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:50,130
I'll be going.

594
00:29:56,269 --> 00:29:57,369
Bye.

595
00:29:57,769 --> 00:29:59,640
She wouldn't do that by herself, would she?

596
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,940
What? What is she doing?

597
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,480
Please start driving, sir. I feel quite embarrassed.

598
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,980
Ji Goo must've been really embarrassed too.

599
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,930
It was when we went to Laos together.

600
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:26,130
Ji Yeon made a fun suggestion.

601
00:30:26,829 --> 00:30:31,170
She said we should spend three hours apart and meet up here again.

602
00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:33,599
What are a measly three hours?

603
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,539
That was how we parted ways.

604
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:39,740
The memory of those three hours is still so vivid.

605
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:43,950
Being alone after always being together...

606
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,980
made everything feel strange and scary.

607
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:51,019
It was as if I had become a little kid all of a sudden.

608
00:30:52,089 --> 00:30:54,259
But as some time passed,

609
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,890
I started noticing things that I didn't get to see...

610
00:30:58,059 --> 00:30:59,930
when we had been together.

611
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,369
I started developing muscles that I had no need for...

612
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:04,369
when we had been together.

613
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:08,140
And when we met up again,

614
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:10,410
we had grown a lot more.

615
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,940
But why did the memory of those three hours...

616
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,710
come to us that night?

617
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:24,950
The owner of Obok House always told us.

618
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:28,829
That we couldn't get married because we were together so much.

619
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:32,500
That nothing would work out if we stuck together so much.

620
00:31:33,829 --> 00:31:36,700
We were finally given the chance to see...

621
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,430
if that was really true.

622
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,710
And the world...

623
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,609
was quieter than it ever had been before.

624
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,690
(1 year later)

625
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:09,700
I'm sorry that I look shabby before you

626
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:15,039
I have so little to my name

627
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,210
He's finally getting married.

628
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,079
I know. I thought he'd never get married.

629
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:22,279
I know, right?

630
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:24,680
Gosh, I'm jealous.

631
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:29,750
I want to protect you

632
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,660
Do you know?

633
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,160
Gosh, he's so good.

634
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,529
When I sometimes make you cry

635
00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:43,170
How much I cry on the inside

636
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,569
- Hey, you're here. - Hey.

637
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,400
If I had

638
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,069
- He dyed his hair. - Yes.

639
00:32:48,069 --> 00:32:49,970
Met you at a better time

640
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,769
He's cool.

641
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:59,250
I could give you all the happiness in the world

642
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:05,420
Having met you

643
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:10,890
My life has changed

644
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:13,259
- I have never wanted - You're so cool!

645
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:16,470
Anyone so much before

646
00:33:16,569 --> 00:33:20,440
This is the first time

647
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,910
I'm so grateful

648
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:31,809
That you are that one person for me

649
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,890
You're so cool!

650
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,819
- You're so pretty! - You're beautiful!

651
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:38,990
Hello.

652
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:44,690
I'm Kim Jung Bae, the best friend of the groom, Hwang Dong Bae.

653
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:49,730
First of all, I'd like to thank everyone who joined us...

654
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,099
Hey, why are you so tan?

655
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,700
Isn't it really cloudy in London?

656
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:55,039
I know, right?

657
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:58,410
That tan isn't from London.

658
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:00,579
- She had a little detour. - What are you saying?

659
00:34:00,579 --> 00:34:02,380
Hey, did you see "The Phantom of the Opera?"

660
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,450
If you go to London, you have to go to the West End.

661
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,680
Fine, I had a detour.

662
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:09,050
But you know...

663
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:12,159
London is such an expensive city.

664
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,960
The place where we'll be staying is really cramped.

665
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,159
That could happen.

666
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:20,400
And I'm the first person from Asia to receive the Art Award.

667
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,369
So I'd have to put up with some racism as I work.

668
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,800
Do you not want to go?

669
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,599
Well, I just wanted to go with you.

670
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,239
I didn't want to go to London.

671
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,079
Then you should've told me.

672
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,309
We've been going from place to place.

673
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:39,719
Wherever our feet take us, like vagabonds.

674
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,719
We were in Africa until a little while ago.

675
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,789
I knew it. That tan can't be from London.

676
00:34:43,789 --> 00:34:46,289
Hey, but that's so romantic.

677
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,289
I've always wanted to do something like that...

678
00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:49,530
- if I got a boyfriend. - What?

679
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:52,159
Why does that sound so sad to me?

680
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,599
If you are perhaps...

681
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,199
taking care of a man who isn't even your father-in-law...

682
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,440
- I'm right. - For real?

683
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,409
He was just stuffing his face all day long.

684
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:11,250
How could I just watch him do that?

685
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,789
Hello, Father.

686
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:23,960
I'm the girl who almost became Director Kang Book Goo's girlfriend,

687
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,030
but then totally got kicked to the curb when you showed up...

688
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,900
out of the blue. I'm An So Hee.

689
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,530
Your son who is in that room...

690
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:31,929
is full of flaws. You know that, right?

691
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:34,500
He's a loser who is lazy, dirty, and small-minded.

692
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,269
And it turns out he even has so many wounds and a victim mentality too.

693
00:35:37,409 --> 00:35:39,409
Honestly, there's no one else who'd ever love him.

694
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,480
If not for my mom, no parent would agree to a son-in-law like that.

695
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,579
But...

696
00:35:42,579 --> 00:35:45,480
I've decided not to get hooked by pitiful guys anymore.

697
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,550
I've stopped being the UNICEF for pitiful men.

698
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:51,550
I'm sick and tired of mistaking sympathy for love.

699
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,260
Did you get what I just said?

700
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,219
What is she saying?

701
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:59,929
I will make you a nice, cold drink.

702
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,699
Here. Drink.

703
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:12,070
Drink that,

704
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,280
and get treatment.

705
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:14,639
Then,

706
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,019
I will take care of you until the day you die.

707
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:21,550
I will cook you three meals a day, clean up after you,

708
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,750
and do everything I couldn't do for my late dad.

709
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,920
I'll do it.

710
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:28,119
Will you get treatment?

711
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,739
Will you join me...

712
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:49,909
for the last chapter of your life?

713
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,949
Gosh, she really is something.

714
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:58,619
She's completely different from your mom.

715
00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:01,460
Are you having your last drink?

716
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,329
Yes, let's have it.

717
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:05,360
Okay!

718
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,400
I'll take care of you comfortably until death.

719
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,500
Salute!

720
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,239
Ms. An.

721
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,159
Book Goo.

722
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:39,300
You better keep her.

723
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,800
I'll stop drinking.

724
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:50,869
Don't act cool.

725
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:53,010
You're just doing UNICEF work.

726
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,510
She's right.

727
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,110
She sent us home...

728
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,909
to take care of him comfortably.

729
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:01,219
What do you say? Shall we have soju?

730
00:38:01,219 --> 00:38:02,349
It's broad daylight.

731
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,019
Pour it in the wine glass.

732
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:06,460
What's the matter? They gave us to drink.

733
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,690
Don't be timid and pour it confidently.

734
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:10,829
Confidently like wine.

735
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:12,960
Confidently.

736
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,329
- Let's drink. - Let's drink.

737
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:28,610
It's tastier in a wine glass.

738
00:38:28,909 --> 00:38:30,809
Tell us how it went with your father.

739
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,280
We know you met him before taking your flight.

740
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,349
Maybe she took the flight to meet him.

741
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:38,719
To brag.

742
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,190
I have to get on the plane soon.

743
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:46,159
But I came to say something before leaving.

744
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:49,570
I thought you would come one day.

745
00:38:50,969 --> 00:38:52,670
To tell you about me,

746
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,969
I'm not good at riding a bicycle.

747
00:38:56,269 --> 00:39:00,539
It's what I had to learn from my dad as a kid.

748
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:02,179
I missed my time to learn.

749
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:05,650
And I fall in love easily.

750
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:08,780
I fall for people fast and easily.

751
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,150
I want to marry a person that I met five minutes ago.

752
00:39:11,989 --> 00:39:13,420
There's a high possibility that...

753
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,989
a child from a family without a father will be like this.

754
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,760
Despite these two points,

755
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,429
I grew up well despite the absence of a father figure.

756
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:30,440
If you feel sorry,

757
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,809
can you hold my hand during my wedding?

758
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,179
Are you getting married?

759
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:37,980
No.

760
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:39,849
I actually...

761
00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:42,250
wanted to marry early and depend on my husband.

762
00:39:42,489 --> 00:39:44,389
But one man told me...

763
00:39:44,789 --> 00:39:47,920
that the reason why I get dumped and can't settle down...

764
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:50,230
is because I don't have core muscles.

765
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:55,429
I have to build up my strength to grow my roots and live on my own.

766
00:39:56,969 --> 00:39:58,730
So my wedding...

767
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,769
can be much later than expected.

768
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,980
Make sure to be healthy and live a long life.

770
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:15,820
And thank you...

771
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,960
for bringing me into this world.

774
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:36,369
From that day onwards,

775
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:39,880
I felt like I had rooted deeply under the ground.

776
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:44,679
It seems like I gained some knowledge in India, right?

777
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:46,219
What if I shave my head and be a monk?

778
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:48,920
- You said you came here with a man. - Right. He's over there.

779
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:51,989
Hey, Lochien and Philbus.

780
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:53,289
- Hello. - Hey.

781
00:40:55,489 --> 00:40:57,530
Oh, gosh. You brought two?

782
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:59,599
Why? Is that a problem? Why not?

783
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,360
Did you settle down to two men?

784
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,769
I can't take this anymore.

785
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,239
Isn't it surprising?

786
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:10,309
How can they be sitting at the same table as if they'd promised?

787
00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:19,320
One is late.

788
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,980
- Who? - There's another one?

789
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:23,789
Hey!

790
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:25,519
Oh, my.

791
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,960
Hello.

792
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:31,329
Are you crazy? Three men?

793
00:41:31,329 --> 00:41:32,630
Are you a polygamist?

794
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:35,699
It's diverse.

795
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:38,699
- Are you crazy? - Why?

796
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:41,599
My love is not one-third, but three times bigger.

797
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,510
Isn't this a happy thing? Why not?

798
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:45,409
Pour all the soju. Bring it all.

799
00:41:45,409 --> 00:41:46,480
Oh, gosh.

800
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,719
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

801
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:56,820

- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

803
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:00,190
- Congratulations. - Live happily.

804
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,559
Why is the wind so strong?

805
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,079
Why did the bouquet...

806
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:22,849
fly to that crazy brat?

807
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,179
Life is unpredictable.

808
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:36,590
Oh, my. You're so gorgeous.

809

You're amazing!

Oh, yes!

Rock and roll!

813
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:14,360
To be honest, I don't know if we're better than before.

814
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:19,230
We don't know if our future is better or not.

00:43:19,769 --> 00:43:21,039
One thing is for sure.

816
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:25,139
We're the best to enjoy this moment.

817
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,079
Here, right now,

818
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:32,010
the person who's not crazy is the craziest.

819
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:19,800
I remember what my friends said when I came out of the house.

820
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,929
Hey, your heels are unstable. Wear something else.

821
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:27,239
Let her wear it. She wants to open the beer with it.

822
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:28,639
This opens beers the best.

823
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:31,139
Don't open so much. You're not in your 20s anymore.

824
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,340
She'll come to her senses only if something big happens.

825
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:36,780
This is why I should listen to my friends.

826
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,849
Ms. An!

827
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:41,780
But I met him thanks to these heels.

828
00:44:42,219 --> 00:44:44,090
And we had an enjoyable time.

829
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:48,019
I'll be here even if I turn back time.

830
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:52,530
So I think it's fine even if this is my last living moment.

831
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:55,900
My loving friends are just next to me.

832
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,800
He who saves joy for tomorrow saves for the cat.

833
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:01,639
We should always play as if there will be...

834
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:04,440
no tomorrow as if this is the last time.

835
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,840
What would I've done if I didn't?

836
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,440
I won't be able to close my eyes thinking that it's unfair.

837
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:13,019
It's a good day to drink and fall.

838
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:16,519
(Work Later, Drink Now 2)

839
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:18,050

840
