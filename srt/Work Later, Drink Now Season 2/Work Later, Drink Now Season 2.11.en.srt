00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,259
I thought you worked well.

169
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,929
Broadcasting isn't a joke.

170
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:18,539
You should bend a little in such a situation, kid.

171
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,970
You're being scolded now.

172
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,639
I can read people's emotions when I see their eyes.

173
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:30,549
This team...

174
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,950
might just be for an additional line in your resume.

175
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,220
But to me,

176
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,620
it's a show that Director Kang and I launched...

177
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,059
after months of sleepless nights.

178
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:42,860
You dating the assistant director is none of my business,

179
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,799
but this team isn't a joke...

180
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,000
where you can just make such stupid acts.

181
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,970
Do you think it was easy to bring a top star...

182
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,940
who got divorced 30 years ago decided to get together on screen?

183
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,309
We visited him every day, begging him...

184
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:56,710
and persuading him. We worked so hard...

185
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,809
I like this show as well. I want to do well too.

186
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:00,809
And still you did that?

187
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,779
My friends really liked that preview.

188
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:06,480
Gosh.

189
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,320
You still don't know what's wrong.

190
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,559
What do I do with her?

191
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,220
I'll leave.

192
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,159
Anyway, I'm sorry I troubled you because of this.

193
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:20,059
I also apologized to Director Kang through text.

194
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,330
You texted him?

195
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,600
Yes. He said he also watched the clips on YouTube too.

196
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,740
He laughed, saying it was ridiculous.

197
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:30,470
You're all mad, aren't you?

198
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,039
I'm just saying.

199
00:14:32,909 --> 00:14:36,149
Anyway, I'll work until you find my replacement.

200
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:37,149
I'll get going.

201
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,220
Are you mad, Ms. An?

202
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:50,230
I feel like there's a big misunderstanding.

203
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,299
First answer my call.

We'll end today's training here.

207
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:09,679
Namaste.

Good job, everyone.

- Thank you. - Well done.

211
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,690
Enjoy your lunch, and I'll see you in the afternoon training.

212
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,830
Thank you.

213
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,399
- Thank you. - Thank you.

214
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:33,740
I thought you were listening to music...

215
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,639
since you always had your earphones plugged in.

216
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,039
But you were just ignoring me when you heard everything.

217
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:42,210
I don't have curtains in my room. Can I sleep in your room today?

218
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:43,679
What?

219
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,620
I thought you couldn't hear me.

220
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,450
I don't think I said anything.

There you go.

224
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,409
This is a little unnatural, don't you think?

225
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,649
We drank five bottles of soju.

226
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,309
It's quite natural.

227
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,580
Then shall we get up naturally?

228
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,220
Okay.

229
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,559
Or...

230
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,730
Or something else, in a natural way?

231
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,190
What?

232

When will we ever do it if we don't do it now?

233

Let's try it.

Okay.

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,720
That's right.

Ms. Han.

Ms. An, please answer the phone.

Hello?

Why do you keep sending packages here when you've left home?

Hello?

255
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,630
I ordered that before I left home.

256
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,839
How could it take a week for a piece of cloth to come? Don't lie.

257
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:43,309
Overseas delivery takes a long time. You don't even know anything.

That's enough.

259

I'll put this on the shelf next to the recycling bin, Take it with you.

- So Hee! - Why?

261
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:51,049
How could you put that there when it's so expensive?

Wear some makeup.

so it was drooling.

It has high standards.

293
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,960
His lizard is so cute.

294
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,240
What did I do?

295
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:26,670
Yes, Sung Soo?

296
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:29,710
Today? I'm not doing anything.

297
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,039
Ji Yeon, do you like chicken feet?

298
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,509
I love it.

299
00:24:33,509 --> 00:24:35,910
I know a place that makes really good chicken feet.

300
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,609
- What do you think? - I also know a good place.

301
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,819
- Is it Obok House? - It's Obok House.

302
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:42,420
This is unbelievable. Do you know Obok House?

303
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,150
I have been a regular since college.

304
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,859
The owner and I are like brothers.

305
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,390
Really? This is unbelievable.

306
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:53,759
I'm sorry, Sung Soo. I'm in the car right now.

307
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,500
I'll see you at Obok House later.

308
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,599
I'm sorry. Wasn't I too loud?

309
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:04,980
The man who I went on a blind date...

310
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,779
asked me out on a chicken feet date.

311
00:25:08,579 --> 00:25:09,950
You didn't want to know this.

312
00:25:16,589 --> 00:25:18,150
So you have a lizard?

313
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:21,829
Did you let Ms. Han in your room?

314
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:23,630
Can't I do that?

315
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,430
You don't even let me go near your room.

316
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,430
I haven't even watched...

317
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:32,299
TV properly all my life because of you.

318
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:34,269
I've never even made a sound because of you.

319
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,569
But you're okay with Ms. Han...

320
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:39,039
even if she snores or makes a loud phone call.

321
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,750
I'm okay.

322
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,609
- What? - I'm not annoyed by her sounds.

323
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:46,519
And you're annoyed by my sounds?

324
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,789
Do you really like her?

325
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,519
Why? Are you going to threaten her not to meet me again?

326
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:57,130
When did I threaten her?

327
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:00,059
Do you think she would listen to me...

328
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,059
even if I threatened her?

329
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,630
Ms. Han isn't even interested in you...

330
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:04,900
no matter what I say.

331
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:07,400
Why would she like a sick person when she doesn't lack anything?

332
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,740
Darn it, it's all because of you.

333
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,039
Don't you really know him?

334
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,779
He said you and him were like brothers.

335
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:17,049
An Sung Soo...

336
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:18,549
Who is that?

337
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,119
People who come here always say we're like brothers.

338
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,089
How can I describe him?

339
00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:25,160
He has a high-toned voice and...

340
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,789
- Ji Yeon. - Sung Soo.

341
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:30,329
- Brother. - Teddy.

342
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:31,329
Teddy?

343
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,430
Hug me.

344
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:34,529
Teddy, you punk!

345
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:38,130
You're Sung Soo?

346
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,640
No, I'm Teddy to you eternally.

347
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,670
You punk! Do you know how long I've been waiting for you?

348
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,980
He really is my younger brother.

349
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,150
I wouldn't be here if it weren't for him...

350
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,150
when I was traveling.

351
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,019
I rented a car in Sapporo,

352
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:55,049
and I was leaving the airport.

353
00:26:55,049 --> 00:26:56,819
I was waiting for the signal to turn left.

354
00:26:56,819 --> 00:26:57,950
But the car in front of me suddenly...

355
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:02,559
I was like, "No!"

356
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,630
- Did it turn right? - Yes.

357
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:07,059
The car was standing slanted,

358
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:09,170
but I thought, "It can't be turning right, can it?"

359
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:12,339
It really turned right. The driver was completely crazy.

360
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,369
That was me.

361
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:15,069
Oh, no!

362
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:17,009
There was a car coming from over there.

363
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:20,279
I honked 0.00001 seconds faster than that car.

364
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,680
I instantly put on the brake.

365
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,579
A five-ton truck passed by immediately after that.

366
00:27:25,579 --> 00:27:28,279
The truck passed by me by a hair's breadth.

367
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,849
My entire body was drenched with sweat.

368
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:33,990
You almost died a purposeless death.

369
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:35,730
If he wasn't behind me,

370
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,059
I would have been gone without leaving a trace behind.

371
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:40,430
Do you know how surprised I was at that time?

372
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,799
The two cars were quiet for a while.

373
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:44,299
I was so curious about the driver.

374
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:46,170
- Yes. - I got out and went to him.

375
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,170
I knocked on the door.

376
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,140
The window went down.

377
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,809
He was completely pale.

378
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,539
Do you know what this punk said to me?

379
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:53,539
What did he say?

380
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,980
Wow, you drive really badly.

381
00:27:56,349 --> 00:27:57,650
Congratulations on being born again.

382
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,579
You should treat us to celebrate your resurrection.

383
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:04,750
Of course, he'll even get free food for life.

384
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:07,059
I'm jealous.

385
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:09,289
Let's be friends. We only get free alcohol.

386
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:10,859
No way.

387
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:12,799
Is she the one you told me about?

388
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:14,299
(Warm soju)

389
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,029
The MS soju trio?

390
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:18,269
Yes.

391
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,039
I can't believe I was on a blind date...

392
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,369
with one of those horrible people.

393
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:24,410
- Horrible people? - Oh my, destiny

394
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,410
This is more surprising.

395
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:27,609
I went backpacking with him, and I said,

396
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:30,980
"There is a girl who is just like you in Korea."

397
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,980
I said I would introduce her to him.

398
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,880
- Was that Ji Yeon? - What?

399
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,650
Oh my,

400
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,519
- destiny - Destiny

401
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:38,960
Double cross!

402
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:43,690
Sung Soo, thank you for saving him.

403
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,630
- Cheers. - Cheers.

404
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,900
Oh my,

405
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,599
- destiny - Destiny

406
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:51,069
But...

407
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,599
why aren't Ji Goo and So Hee coming these days?

408
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:00,910
Welcome.

409
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,279
(Obok)

410
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:03,809
Okay.

411
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,289
We'll come back later.

412
00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:13,019
Please give me another drink.

413
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,660
It's flowing.

414
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:16,490
Fortunately, they couldn't see you...

415
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,660
because I came first.

416
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,029
She was with a man.

417
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:22,230
She was still very bright.

418
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,900
I want to focus on this today.

419
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,200
Of course.

420
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,509
We didn't eat properly last time.

421
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:30,339
Thank you.

422
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,640
It must be hot.

423
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,480
It's delicious.

424
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,250
Is this the meat we ate that day?

425
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,920
The meat in this place is really good.

426
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,690
but I think it got a bad reputation that day.

427
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,059
I wanted to treat you again.

428
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,559
This is crazy.

429
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:53,460
This is crazy. Try this kimchi.

430
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:56,130
It was cooked in pork belly fat, so it's crazy.

431
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,869
The mushrooms are also crazy. Try them.

432
00:29:57,869 --> 00:29:59,900
The sesame oil is also crazy.

433
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,240
You say everything is crazy.

434
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:04,140
- Darn it, it's crazy. - Should we order two more servings?

435
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:06,480
Order two more servings and cold kimchi noodles.

436
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,450
Can we have two more servings of pork belly,

437
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,150
cold kimchi noodles, two bottles of Chamisul,

438
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,980
assorted mushrooms, and steamed eggs?

439
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,680
It's hot. Please hurry up and give them to us.

440
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,390
- Are you a rapper? - What?

441
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,990
- You're good. - Go on "Show Me the Money."

442
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:20,119
You're thinking about your friends, right?

443
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,490
They really liked this place.

444
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:32,799
I think your friends are the most important thing to you.

445
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,670
How can I be more important than them?

446
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,039
Should I talk casually to you like your friends?

447
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,980
I don't want you to do that.

448
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,420
Why? You talk casually to everyone.

449
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,450
That's why I don't want to do that.

450
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,490
Do you want me to talk casually to you like the others?

451
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:57,960
Please talk politely to me again.

452
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,799
- Cheers. - Good job today.

453
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:06,799
Good job.

454
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,039
Everyone worked hard shooting today.

455
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,250
This will also be So Ri's farewell party.

456
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,950
- What? - Farewell party?

457
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,849
Main writers around me say they buy Korean beef...

458
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:23,450
for the farewell party of junior writers...

459
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,450
they really disliked.

460
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:27,619
They say they do that because they will never see that person again...

461
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,930
and they're being nice to the people they hate.

462
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,329
But I can't do that.

463
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,029
I'm worried they'll be mistaken...

464
00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:37,000
that I'm buying Korean beef because they did a good job.

465
00:31:37,569 --> 00:31:39,869
If they're upset because of me,

466
00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:41,640
they won't make the same mistake...

467
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,609
wherever program they go to.

468
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:45,039
Did you do something wrong?

469
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,509
I won't say what she did wrong.

470
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,220
I don't want to make it hard for her to work from now on.

471
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,349
I don't care.

472
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,319
I'm not going to be a writer anymore.

473
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,819
- What? - I'm going to prepare...

474
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:00,819
for the level six civil service exam.

475
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,589
I even passed the level seven exam last year.

476
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,029
But I didn't do it because I though it would be fun to be a writer.

477
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,230
I think I had enough fun.

478
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,200
- What is wrong with her? - I don't know.

479
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:14,369
I didn't know either.

480
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:19,109
That's right, So Hee. You told me to apologize a couple of days ago.

481
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:21,809
So Ri.

482
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:25,519
Did you talk about me to Director Kang?

483
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,289
You're so rude to senior writers.

484
00:32:30,289 --> 00:32:32,589
Apologize.

485
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:35,259
You should apologize.

486
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,960
She's such a rude punk.

487
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,200
Did she fall asleep like that?

488
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:45,839
They keep becoming more like me.

489
00:32:46,569 --> 00:32:48,170
I don't think I can apologize.

490
00:32:48,339 --> 00:32:51,269
I said you were friends with benefits, and it's true, right?

491
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,480
Everyone knows that you went to a motel with Director Kang.

492
00:32:55,609 --> 00:32:56,710
Just reveal it.

493
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,579
No one will talk behind your back. Isn't that right?

494
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,380
Stop it.

495
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,220
How dare you?

496
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:06,160
Ta-da!

497
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:10,660
Surprise.

498
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:13,400
This is driving me crazy.

499
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,930
Ms. An, I told him it was okay for him to come...

500
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:18,069
because I didn't know it would be like this today.

501
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:19,599
I'm sorry.

502
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:21,400
I also didn't know it would be like this.

503
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:24,940
Ms. An, how about taking this?

504
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,579
Why would I take that?

505
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,950
Do you know what they're saying about me and you?

506
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,279
F what?

507
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,450
I looked it up, but the meaning isn't that bad.

508
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:37,890
It has a different nuance from sex partners.

509
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:38,990
Ms. An, you have a misunderstanding.

510
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,059
Hey!

511
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:42,930
Are you crazy?

512
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,160
It's a misunderstanding.

513
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,029
I can't stand being here anymore.

514
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:52,339
So Hee, stop being like that.

515
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,440
You also like Director Kang.

516
00:33:55,339 --> 00:33:58,539
The meaning of FWB isn't that important.

517
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,579
If you feel warm when you think of that person,

518
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,349
that's your answer.

519
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,420
Think simply, will you?

520
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:13,960
Should we go to a karaoke?

521
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,389
I told you I called for a driver three seconds ago.

522
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,530
Oh, right. You did.

523
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:21,460
There's a Bluetooth mic in my car. How about a karaoke drive?

524
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,099
It sounds amazing.

525
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:27,400
Then this will be my mic.

526
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,340
I told you I had a mic just now.

527
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,610
Oh, right.

528
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:36,179
By the way, how do you know Director Kim?

529
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:37,250
Director Kim?

530
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:39,019
Oh, you mean Seon Jung?

531
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:40,650
She was my senior in college.

532
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,719
But she had suddenly gone awol, so we didn't graduate together.

533
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,320
Seon Jung's a total wacko, you know?

534
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,389
What do you mean?

535
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:48,260
I heard she was attending college all right,

536
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,460
but one day, she came dead drunk,

537
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,400
cussed, broke everything,

538
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,960
and even held out a knife or something like that.

539
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,170
I wonder if she's still like that.

540
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,610
Who knows?

541
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,239
We promised to leave...

542
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:08,480
a return path no matter how much we drank.

543
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:12,579
She should be coming back one way or another.

544
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:20,059
On the way back home

545
00:35:20,989 --> 00:35:26,699
Leave your heart to the setting sun

546
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:31,829
When I remember what you went through

547
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:44,849
(Only Seon Jung can come in.)

548
00:35:44,849 --> 00:35:48,179
(Only Seon Jung can come in.)

549
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:20,880
I desperately wish for it

550
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:26,920
I sing this song on my way home every now and then.

551
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,559
Can't you feel the love of the siblings...

552
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:31,429
who lived in the same era?

553
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,860
Yes, I can.

554
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,530
In this barren world, whether rented monthly or yearly,

555
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:37,130
though not many own a house,

556
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,639
isn't it great that we have a home...

557
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,869
- to return to? - It sure is.

558
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:43,909
My warm house. My comfy house.

559
00:36:43,909 --> 00:36:46,510
Even if I get invited to fun places,

560
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:49,750
the only place I can relax is my small sweet home.

561
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:51,949
To continue this mood,

562
00:36:51,949 --> 00:36:54,650
may I sing "Home Sweet Home?"

563
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:55,820
Yes, please!

564
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,250
Then here it is. "Home Sweet Home."

565
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:06,599
Even if I get invited

566
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,199
To fun places

567
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:12,599
- Welcome home. - I'm back.

568
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:15,670
Hurry. The sundaeguk came just now.

569
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,969
It looks good.

570
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:18,239
Let me wash up first.

571
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,280
Goodness.

572
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:29,090
Starting today, stay here.

573
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:32,960
You know how to do push-ups, right?

574
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,090
You know what?

575
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:37,929
With Han Ji Yeon, we couldn't drink while watching movies.

576
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:39,199
She wouldn't stop chatting.

577
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,800
Exactly.

578
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:47,139
There's no hair on the floor with just one less person.

579
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,670
She had a lot of hair fallouts.

580
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,309
I never realized the room was that big until now.

581
00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:53,480
She had loads of clothes.

582
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,349
- But... - But...

583
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:03,389
You go first.

584
00:38:03,389 --> 00:38:04,849
No, mine's no biggie. You can go first.

585
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:07,119
It's okay. Mine isn't all that important.

586
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,119
But...

587
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,429
the small stuff does remind me of her.

588
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,699
Kang Ji Goo. You didn't know...

589
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:18,969
your left leg was longer than your right, did you?

590
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,710
Even the smallest of the smallest stuff does.

591
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:28,780
An So Hee.

592
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,380
You didn't know that your right jaw muscle is more developed...

593
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,980
than your left, did you?

594
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,449
Honestly, it's really trivial, isn't it?

595
00:38:35,449 --> 00:38:36,449
Yes.

596
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,190
- What do I do now? - Same here.

597
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,719
What do you do now? It's simple.

598
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,360
For 30 years, I've always had...

599
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,230
my right leg up whenever I ate.

600
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:47,260
So for the next 30 years, I'm going to have my left leg up.

601
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,369
- What? - So starting today,

602
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:50,699
chew from your left, So Hee.

603
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:52,539
And Ji Goo, lean on your left leg.

604
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:53,969
Okay? Simple, right?

605
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:57,170
Well, it was sort of scientific...

606
00:38:57,539 --> 00:39:00,409
No, not scientific. More like, she had a point.

607
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,750
With nothing to lose, we gave it a shot.

608
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:05,880
It was better than not doing anything.

609
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,789
Don't get soft-hearted and say that you're okay now...

610
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:11,550
and can understand her. Got it?

611
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,489
Friends are friends only when they are friends.

612
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,460
She's no longer one of us now.

613
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:16,860
I'm not letting you do that.

614
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:20,099
But never once did I really hate her.

615
00:39:20,699 --> 00:39:22,230
I do hate her in my head.

616
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,730
But we don't live solely with our heads.

617
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:28,199
I guess I don't really hate her.

618
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:33,610
If you feel warm when you think of that person,

619
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,550
that's your answer.

620
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:38,449
Think simply, will you?

621
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,380
- Goodness. - Are you angry?

622
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:43,849
No. I just recalled what someone said.

623
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:47,920
What an extraordinary girl.

624
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,429
- She'll make a great civil servant. - Civil servant?

625
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,630
Yes. It's someone I know.

626
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,329
She kicked my butt today.

627
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:57,230
I see. I'm off for a smoke.

628
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,969
I'm tagging along. Wait for me.

629
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,010
The moon's really bright.

630
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:09,280
It's winter now.

631
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,150
It would've been freezing cold in the woods, right?

632
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,780
We would be cutting wood like crazy.

633
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,219
Hey. Aren't you slowly starting to smoke again?

634
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:19,789
I should change to e-cigs.

635
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:21,360
As if you will.

636
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:27,630
Hey, isn't that Han Ji Yeon?

637
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,730
What? Who?

638
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:32,840
Han Ji Yeon.

639
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,940
Han Ji Yeon?

640
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:44,980
What? Did the booze bring you to the wrong place?

641
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,420
I came to get my package.

642
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,119
- What package? - We have one.

643
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,590
You should go to the recycling bin.

644
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,389
- It's still there. - You really left it there?

645
00:40:52,389 --> 00:40:53,960
I told you I was leaving it there.

646
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,489
If it's gone, you're dead meat.

647
00:40:55,489 --> 00:40:56,730
It was super expensive.

648
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,860
- That was none of my concern. - You're annoying.

649
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,369
Seriously.

650
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:10,840
Oh, right. I met my dad today.

651
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,239
- What? - What? Really?

652
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:13,809
- Yes, from the car. - How?

653
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:15,539
He was in the car next to ours at the stoplight.

654
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:16,710
How did you know he was your dad?

655
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:19,320
- I just knew. - Come on.

656
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:22,989
- For real? - Yes. It was Dad for real.

657
00:41:22,989 --> 00:41:24,989
So tell us how you knew he was your dad.

658
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,420
The car next to us stopped at the red light.

659
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,960
Someone suddenly rolled down the window...

660
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,489
and leaned on their elbow.

661
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:31,789
I knew it at that moment.

662
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:35,230
- Is that possible? - There must've been something else.

663
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,329
I just knew it was that arm.

664
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,099
Remember what I told you every day?

665
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:40,969
That if I meet my dad by chance,

666
00:41:40,969 --> 00:41:43,710
"I will know at a glance." Yes, you did. It was your dad.

667
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,070
You actually believed that?

668
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,179
You lack the most belief among us.

669
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,840
So what did you do?

670
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,409
It's cold. Come inside and talk.

671
00:41:50,409 --> 00:41:51,980
- Anyway, - Yes?

672
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,550
you should've seen his arm.

673
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,750
But how did you know just from his arm?

674
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,420
I didn't. I had to see his elbow.

675
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,360
Did you know everyone's elbow is unique,

676
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,829
- just like fingerprints? - Really?

677
00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:04,489
We didn't really apologize to each other.

678
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:06,429
- But how did you know... - Like that,

679
00:42:06,429 --> 00:42:07,599
- from his elbow? - we returned home.

680
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,670
- Because he was my dad. - And very...

681
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:12,130
- naturally at that. - A single glance was all I needed.

682
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,340
Seriously?

683
00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:16,239
