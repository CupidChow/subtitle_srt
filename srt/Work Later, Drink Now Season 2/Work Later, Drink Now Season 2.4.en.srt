Didn't your director come and pick us up?

Director Kang?

00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,338
- Your Director Toe... - No, don't tell me.

6
00:00:41,339 --> 00:00:43,639
I have to go to work.

7

Hang on.

8
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,080
But we didn't drink that much, did we?

9
00:00:48,209 --> 00:00:50,150
I know, right? We got drunk so fast.

while you were in the mountains.

12
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,088
- In a word... - I'm a lightweight.

13
00:00:57,089 --> 00:00:58,260
Bingo.

By the way, So Hee.

Do you remember that we peed in front of Director Toe?

16
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:14,439
That was in front of Director Toe?

17
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,008
Do you want to meditate with me?

18
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,739
It works when you feel like crap.

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,909
You're finished now.

20
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,979
Just drive the boat with me.

21
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,149
No way!

22
00:01:25,179 --> 00:01:26,619

Good morning.

Did you pick this place?

31

- Yes. - Very well done.

32
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,509
This is why you can't take a break in this line of work.

33
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,319
They say that you're out of touch only after a short break.

34
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,090
Awkward.

35
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:08,729
I don't hear anything.

Who on earth is Pureumae now?

Hey.

What did you say his name was?

Pureumae. He's a rock artist who sings about everyday life.

Group chatrooms are great, right?

61

I'm not sure if it's necessary that we cast him...

62

just because all the other teams are contacting him.

You don't have to whisper, though.

Ms. Han, I'm starting to realize...

77
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,638
that you're not moderate in anything. Right?

78
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,740
That's true!

79
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:02,609
That's true.

80
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,910
People have told me that it wouldn't harm me to stay quiet.

81
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:09,048
But I learned that I would rather live as I wanted...

82
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,220
than stay quiet and keep from harming myself.

83

Can I watch them film it?

84

- Sure. - Thanks.

86
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,009
Yes, I did.

87
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,470
Who was it for?

88
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,478
I met eyes with the director,

89
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,880
so I used my reflexes to wink at him.

90
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,489
Ms. Han, I told you last time, didn't I?

91
00:04:50,859 --> 00:04:54,289
That I don't want you to inconvenience my brother.

92
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,460
Also, I asked you to refrain from unnecessarily using...

93
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,260
too many English words.

94
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,499
I forgot again. I'll fix it.

95
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,599

96
00:05:06,369 --> 00:05:07,609
- Ms. An. - Yes?

97
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,108
Just go to the restroom if you're in a rush.

98
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:11,579
You look like you're about to pee.

99
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,939
That's not what this is.

100
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,678
- There he is. - Pureumae!

101

She was part of "2 Days 1 Night," "Mom's Diary"...

We'll wait in the back. If you could give us ten minutes...

115
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,590
I'm afraid I'll have to talk to Ms. An first.

- What? - What?

117

- Awesome! - It's almost lunchtime.

118
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,390
Why don't we have lunch?

119
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,459
We have to eat lunch, anyway. I'll eat with them.

120
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,159

Oh, no.

124
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,710
I forgot to bring my company credit card.

It's on me.

why don't you try writing a song...

about the laundry, washing dishes, or cleaning?

It's simple and fun.

I'd like a glass of beer.

151

That's a bit inappropriate.

No, go ahead.

you wouldn't believe how sexy she was.

Whenever she drank,

158
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:50,840
she got all sensual and came on to me so hard.

159
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,098
It was like a mixture...

of an angry cat and a whimpering dog.

161

The mixture of a dog and a cat...

162
00:07:59,609 --> 00:08:00,609
sounds a bit grotesque.

163
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:02,349
It was lethal.

164
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,748
She ran into my arms like a puppy...

165
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:07,280
and acted all coyly like a kitty.

166

What's wrong, Ms. An?

167
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:12,789
Are you all right?

168
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,130
I was merely talking about my third ex.

169
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,929
You said it was the fourth ex earlier.

170
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,869
I don't care. Let me get straight to the point.

171
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,239
You've watched our show, right?

172
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,570
We want to invite you to our show.

173
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,669
Would you like to?

174
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,110
If not, I don't see the point of this meeting.

175
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,910
You see, Ms. An is...

176
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,349
quite hot-headed.

177
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,319
Then, why don't you date her?

178
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,020
Excuse me?

179
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,250
It's a joke.

180
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:45,719
In fact, I heard that she still hasn't been in a relationship...

181
00:08:46,219 --> 00:08:48,530
since she broke up with me.

182
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,429
So, my heart aches for her.

183
00:09:00,469 --> 00:09:02,410
I'm so sorry!

184
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,678
I was trying to get up to go to the restroom...

185
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,538
and pushed the table instead of my chair.

186
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:09,078
It was my mistake. This is my fault.

187
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:12,979
I deeply apologize with my head on the floor.

188
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,589
Did you sleep with him?

189
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,620
What?

190
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,730
You know, my hand is bored.

191
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,929
Would you like it to help you up?

192
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,130
May I?

193
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:33,600
Listen, you perverted scumbag.

194
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,909
I don't care if she was your 4th or 2nd ex.

195
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,640
And I couldn't care less about what you say.

196
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,679
But not to So Hee.

197
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,949
She's not someone you can run your mouth to.

198
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:47,948
I know that, I'm just her colleague.

199
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:51,020
You ought to know if you were her ex, punk.

200
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:52,559
Got it?

201
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,559
One last thing.

202
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,900
Pay for the food before I make a fist,

203
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,459
and go quickly.

204
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:01,699
You did sleep with him.

205
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,669
Who lasts longer? Me or him?

206
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,569
Now, I'm finally excited.

207
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:11,140
I was so sick of you always obsessing over me!

208
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,449
- Peace! - I should teach you a lesson.

209
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:40,439
Hi.

210
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,250
Aren't you getting on?

211
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,548
My mom told me not to take the elevator...

212
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:55,350
with someone who has a helmet on.

213
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,120
I see.

214
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,260
Okay.

215
00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:04,059
Then, I'll take the next one. You can go first.

216
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:09,069
Bye.

217
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,730
Thank you.

218
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:26,350
You couldn't even eat pho.

219
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,919
Do you want me to buy you a sandwich?

220
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:31,260
Or we can go and have lunch.

221
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,160
No, thanks.

222
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,558
We have a meeting waiting for us.

223
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,990
We still need a guest for the show.

224
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,900
Right.

225
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:42,069
So Hee!

226
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:43,329
Hi.

227
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:44,539
Hi, Director Kang.

228
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:48,140
I was going to call you. Perfect timing.

229
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:51,309
About your youngest writer...

230
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,249
Youngest? It's Kim Se Mi. What about her?

231
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,250
Right.

232
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,219
She sent in a resume to our team.

233
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,448
I wasn't sure if I should take it.

234
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:02,789
I heard that she was competent.

235
00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:05,359
- Did you get it? - No.

236
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,688
- It's so hard. - It is.

237
00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:09,629
- Tell me about it. - But doesn't he resemble a singer?

238
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,759
I'm not sure.

239
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,259
- Hi. - Hi.

240
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,530
So Hee, how did it go?

241
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:18,299
It didn't work out.

242
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,500
I see.

243
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,870
Okay.

244
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,110
It's cold.

245
00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:27,039
- Let's start the meeting. - Shall we?

246
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:31,579
You know,

247
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,120
instead of a voice actor...

248
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:38,260
Why don't we try filming it in a studio?

249
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,660
What do you say?

250
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,139
Ms. An is so out of touch.

251
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,438
She can't even cast a celebrity.

252
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,239
Should we move teams now?

253
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,438
Oh, gosh.

254
00:12:55,439 --> 00:12:56,439
What are you guys doing?

255
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:57,809
- Sorry? - What?

256
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,938
I was writing down what you just said.

257
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:01,949
Let me see it.

258
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:09,819
You were.

259
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:12,419
Sorry.

260
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,660
Se Mi.

261
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:19,829
Yes?

262
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,900
Don't you have something to tell me?

263
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Well...

264
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:27,339
Our team dinner at the pork belly place was cancelled.

265
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:29,770
- Should we do it tonight? - Should we?

266
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,179
I'd like that. Let's do it.

267
00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:33,510
Pork belly sounds good.

268
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,828
Please get me a pack of cigarettes at a convenience store.

269
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:48,829
I'll give you the money.

270
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:56,030
- There it is. - Right on time.

271
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,740
What took you so long? I was starving.

272
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,010
What about our cigarettes?

273
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,380
It was 4.5 dollars.

274
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:12,319
Keep the change.

275
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,419
You keep the change.

276
00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:21,289
Is that the best cigarette?

277
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,030
What is she saying?

278
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:25,959
It's 32 dollars.

279
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,400
Here.

280
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,140
You have to tell me in advance if you're going to use coupons.

281
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,369
If we tell you in advance, you give us smaller portions.

282
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,939
Didn't they even take out the wings last time?

283
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,679
Hey, sis. We're students. Can't you go easy on us once?

284
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,548
Coupons can't be computed in the system,

285
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,120
so it'll seem as if we're short on cash when we close the till.

286
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:49,020
But that's none of our business.

287
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,390
Darn it. I'm hungry.

288
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,559
Then give it to me.

289
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,130
Oh, really? Thanks.

290
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,760
Not this.

291
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,530
The cigarettes.

292
00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:05,240
- This? - Yes, that.

293
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,079
Are you crazy?

294
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,880
Give me the cigarettes.

295
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,750
What is she saying? Darn it.

296
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,449
What are you, a teacher?

297
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:23,750
I'm sorry, but even teachers don't take our cigarettes these days.

298
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:25,990
Darn it, we'll just smoke them again.

299
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,259
Just go along with her.

300
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,660
She wants to play the teacher.

301
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,929
But you know, miss, if you won't take our coupons,

302
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,699
you shouldn't ask for our cigarettes.

303
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,038
It's a good thing we're such nice kids.

304
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:39,769
If not, you would've taken a beating.

305
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,510
- That's funny. - Seriously.

306
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,110
Darn it, that's why...

307
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:49,309
I'll pay for your 32-dollar chicken if you give me those cigarettes.

308
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,660
Hey. What will you guys do?

309
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,088
The cigarettes are 4.50 dollars,

310
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:04,189
and the chicken is 32 dollars. Right?

311
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,870
This chance doesn't come around often. Think wisely.

312
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:12,500
Hey, forget it. She says she wants to pay.

313
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:17,140
Here. Take the cigarettes. Are you satisfied?

314
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,809
That's all I need.

315
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,549
- I like your hair colour. - Thank you.

316
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:29,850
Did I bleach it for you? Why are you thanking me?

317
00:16:31,789 --> 00:16:33,660
Oh, right. Don't you need something to drink?

318
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,360
Gosh. Beer goes perfectly with chicken.

319
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,860
Darn it. She's so intense.

320
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,809
But why did we just get scared?

321
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:50,410
Were you guys scared?

322
00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:52,808
You were the most scared, you idiot.

323
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:54,808
What did I do? Then should I have fought with her?

324
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:57,150
- Come on, guys. Just eat. - Darn it.

325
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:00,219
Hi, ma'am.

326
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:04,488
- Where are you going? - To the science building.

327
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:06,489
- Let's go. We have to go there too. - Really?

328
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,939
Breathing and meditation.

329
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,949
We will begin today's training.

330
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:34,080
Wait a moment.

331
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,819
- Ms. Ji Yeon? - Yes?

332
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,160
Is there anything bothering you today?

333
00:17:41,219 --> 00:17:45,459
Perhaps something like the scent of the incense like yesterday.

334
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,300
If you tell us in advance,

335
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,830
we'll be sure to consider your opinion.

336
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:54,910
If anyone has any suggestions, please let us know whenever.

337
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,039
I will focus really hard today.

338
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,140
Focus.

339
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:04,150
Everyone, focus on your own breathing.

340
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,390
Is everyone eating dinner before coming home?

341
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,830
Gosh. I have a team dinner.

342
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:21,968
I guess something happened again.

343
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:24,100
(So Hee: Crying)

344
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:30,939
Snake... There's a snake.

345
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,989
Ms. Ji Yeon.

346
00:18:49,189 --> 00:18:50,590
Listen to me very carefully.

347
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,459
There's a snake in front of us!

348
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,570
It's a viper.

349
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,040
We shouldn't move, right?

350
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:02,540
Right.

351
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,938
Vipers can feel the heartbeats of their prey.

352
00:19:05,939 --> 00:19:08,850
The moment your heartbeat gets faster, they attack.

353
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:11,349
Close your eyes.

354
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,478
Make your inhales longer than your exhales.

355
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:15,989
Inhale comfortably.

356
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:18,489
Exhale completely.

357
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,600
I think the director is hyperventilating.

358
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,728
It's moving!

359
00:19:30,729 --> 00:19:32,070
Oh, my. Ms. Ji Yeon.

360
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,350
Oh, my gosh!

361
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:56,789
- No. - It's a snake!

362
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,130
That's bad.

363
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,870
It's knocked out. Everyone, don't worry.

364
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:09,810
Oh, my. Director.

365
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,580
Are you okay, Director?

366
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:17,580
Should we get you some anti-anxiety medicine?

367
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:19,880
I'm okay...

368
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:24,219
If it hadn't been for Ms. Ji Yeon, it could've been really bad.

369
00:20:24,449 --> 00:20:26,719
Where is Ms. Ji Yeon?

370
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,928
Pork belly is the best for team dinners.

371
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:30,129
What are you having, Ji Goo?

372
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,830
It'll take me over an hour to get back.

373
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,560
Are you okay?

374
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,468
Gosh, Director.

375
00:20:35,469 --> 00:20:36,899
I told you I wasn't a director.

376
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,570
Oh, right. Then what should I call you?

377
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,469
My name is Kim Sung Guk.

378
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,370
Oh, my. What a great name.

379
00:20:44,469 --> 00:20:45,610
Here. Have a seat.

380
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,749
There was a guy in my class in elementary school with that name.

381
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,018
And that kid used to be so good at soccer.

382
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,448
- Aren't you good at soccer? - I'm really bad at it.

383
00:20:56,449 --> 00:20:59,059
Gosh, how nice is it that you're answering me right away?

384
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,060
It's great.

385
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,129
How did you catch the snake?

386
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,130
The snake?

387
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,799
Well, when I was in the mountains,

388
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,329
I ran into wild boars, snakes, and bees at all times.

389
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,499
I've become so used to it.

390
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:13,699
When you meet a viper, the best thing to do is not move.

391
00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:15,569
But if you think it's going to strike,

392
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:18,008
you should hit it with a thin stick like a whip,

393
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:20,040
and it just gets knocked out. Isn't that so funny?

394
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,150
You must've been scared when it was on your lap.

395
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,620
Actually, the thing is...

396
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:32,120
I've been struggling to hold something else back.

397
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,689
- What is that? - What's going on?

398
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,299
Oh, my. Isn't that Sung Guk's laughter?

399
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,498
What is going on?

400
00:21:42,499 --> 00:21:45,600
I think this is the first time I've heard your brother laugh.

401
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:51,110
(Listen to what women say!)

402
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,560
The main writer next door got a writer's award...

403
00:22:05,989 --> 00:22:07,860
and laughs so often during meetings.

404
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:11,599
But our main writer can't even get a handle on things,

405
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,929
let alone cast people. It was a total mess. I get it.

406
00:22:15,229 --> 00:22:16,300
I would've done the same.

407
00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:17,630
It's not like that.

408
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,370
So Hee.

409
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,310
What you told me when I was a rookie...

410
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:23,939
I still remember that.

411
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,640
"Hye Kyung, you could write the promotional material now."

412
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,449
"I'll find a new rookie for you."

413
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:32,449
All I ever did was write down our meeting minutes.

414
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:35,688
And I was so happy that I could finally write something...

415
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:36,949
on my own.

416
00:22:38,689 --> 00:22:40,620
That was when I was in my second year.

417
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,429
Thanks to you bringing me up,

418
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:44,999
I've made it this far.

419
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,130
But...

420
00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:49,429
Se Mi?

421
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,699
She's in her fifth year.

422
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:53,999
But...

423
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,239
she's still our team's rookie.

424
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,610
If she goes to other teams,

425
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,339
there are writers with less experience...

426
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,779
who aren't team rookies anymore.

427
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,110
They get to write out shooting plans and stuff like that.

428
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:07,120
But Se Mi is probably the only one with her experience...

429
00:23:07,479 --> 00:23:08,989
who is still the team rookie.

430
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,820
We had a drink by ourselves last night.

431
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:14,929
And Se Mi told us this.

432
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,790
She said that if she stayed here,

433
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,360
she feels as if she will be the rookie forever.

434
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,729
That's why I filled out her resume for her.

435
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:24,699
I'm sorry.

436
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,239
Hold on.

437
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:30,739
And I told the others...

438
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,840
to go too if they wanted to go someplace else.

439
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:35,910
I shook them up.

440
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,620
I'm sorry.

441
00:23:47,489 --> 00:23:48,489
So that's how it happened.

442
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,459
I'm sorry.

443
00:23:52,729 --> 00:23:54,299
No, you guys shouldn't be sorry.

444
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,130
Still, we shouldn't have done it like this.

445
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:59,069
And it looks like you're having a hard time too.

446
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,199
We just couldn't say that we wanted to switch teams...

447
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,040
to your face.

448
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,040
But it's not that we wanted to go to a different team.

449
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:09,850
- So Hee. - So Hee.

450
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,439
What is that?

451
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:09,910
Oh, gosh.

452
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,140
What?

453
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,650
Ji Goo.

454
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:18,650
What are you doing?

455
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:23,120
What brings you here?

456
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,160
Well, I just saw...

457
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,589
something big and white moving around here.

458
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,029
But why are you here...

459
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,830
So...

460
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,529
Did you finish your beer?

461
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,469
I really did lose my touch.

462
00:25:41,699 --> 00:25:42,709
To be honest,

463
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:46,110
I thought you guys were talking about me behind my back.

464
00:25:46,739 --> 00:25:47,880
I got angry on my own.

465
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:52,979
It's totally understandable that you'd talk smack about me.

466
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,290
I'm the absolute worst.

467
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,320
For two years,

468
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,060
why would you guys have stuck around on a team without a main writer?

469
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,389
(Listen to what women say!)

470
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,630
With your talent,

471
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,259
you could've easily gone to different teams.

472
00:26:09,729 --> 00:26:11,939
And you could've gotten better treatment there...

473
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:14,939
and bigger paychecks too.

474
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,310
You waited for me.

475
00:26:21,979 --> 00:26:24,079
You were like kids who were scared the house would blow away...

476
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,150
when mom was away, so you couldn't leave.

477
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:29,120
And I couldn't even thank you for that.

478
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,059
Instead, I was worried about myself,

479
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,360
thinking I'd be criticized for losing my touch.

480
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,860
It's not like that, So Hee.

481
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:39,400
I'm sorry, guys.

482
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:43,469
Actually, we're doing this because we like it.

483
00:26:44,699 --> 00:26:47,238
Until now, we didn't have anyone to complain to...

484
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,669
even if we wanted to.

485
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,969
So we just gritted our teeth and stuck it out.

486
00:26:51,739 --> 00:26:53,439
But now that you're back,

487
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,550
we were happy but sad about what we went through.

488
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:57,579
And we felt upset in some way too.

489
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,620
I know.

490
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,249
I know that.

491
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:02,890
Come here.

492
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,620
I'm sorry.

493
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,028
So Hee. We're your babies.

494
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:13,099
Where would we go?

495
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,999
Gosh, seriously.

496
00:27:15,999 --> 00:27:17,199
Come here, my babies.

497
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:24,939
I'm sorry. Don't cry.

498
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:27,979
She's back.

499
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:32,419
I didn't know!

500
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,900
Actually, I saw you...

501
00:27:46,229 --> 00:27:48,130
yesterday and earlier today too.

502
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:50,130
You were eating a triangular gimbap.

503
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,840
I see.

504
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,310
I missed my chance to say hi yesterday.

505
00:27:58,739 --> 00:27:59,739
And today,

506
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,419
I noticed you drinking beer instead of eating gimbap.

507
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:09,550
So I missed my chance again.

508
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,189
I thought you didn't really like it when I said hi to you.

509
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,060
You seemed that way at the hospital too.

510
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,300
But, you know...

511
00:28:23,499 --> 00:28:25,599
How did you come and find me in my area?

512
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,769
It's fascinating.

513
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,669
I see. Is this your area?

514
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,840
Oh, it's not like that.

515
00:28:34,209 --> 00:28:36,080
The first floor of this building is my studio.

516
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,850
It's really hot, so I stay out here pretty often.

517
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:41,718
I'm the only one who comes here,

518
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:43,290
so it naturally became my area.

519
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:53,630
After I saw you at the hospital,

520
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:56,199
I called you but you didn't answer.

521
00:28:56,529 --> 00:28:57,999
So I roughly guessed.

522
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,070
But I didn't know you'd come here like this.

523
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,139
I didn't come here on purpose.

524
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,478
I was looking for a place to smoke.

525
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:11,150
It's hard to find a smoking area these days.

526
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,279
- I see. - Yes.

527
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,550
You've found the right place.

528
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:20,120
It's shabby but enjoy your cigarette.

529
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,949
Were you always like this?

530
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:44,679
Sorry?

531
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:49,189
You seem different from the day you autographed the books.

532
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,219
The same applies to you.

533
00:29:56,259 --> 00:29:57,830
But you look prettier outside of work.

534
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:06,600
It's been a while since I felt dizzy.

535
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:15,140
You don't do origami anymore?

536
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:20,380
Yes, I don't want to do it again.

537
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,719
I'll go now.

538
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,019
I finished one cigarette well thanks to you.

539
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,360
Oh, yes.

540
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,330
Wait.

541
00:30:32,229 --> 00:30:33,560
You don't have to stand up.

542
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:37,070
Well, this isn't my house. So I should get going too.

543
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,969
I see. Okay.

544
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:43,070
But you know the thing...

545
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,279
that was flapping earlier,

546
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,850
what was that for?

547
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,410
Oh, that...

548
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,689
It's not going to be in use at the moment.

549
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:03,259
Well, we don't have to be doing only the things that are promising.

550
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:07,400
If I get lucky, I'll get to experience a change.

551
00:31:09,969 --> 00:31:10,999
You're right.

552
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:13,769
I better get going.

553
00:31:13,939 --> 00:31:16,439
Yes. Excuse me, Ji Goo.

554
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:20,508
- Let's go. - Go!

555
00:31:20,509 --> 00:31:22,550
- Go! - Go!

556
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,109
Let's go home now.

557
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,849
- Thanks for your efforts. - Goodbye.

558
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:30,289
- Goodbye. - Goodbye

559
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,790
- Go home safely. - Thank you.

560
00:31:31,949 --> 00:31:33,060
Thank you.

561
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,729
Go straight home and call me.

562
00:31:36,989 --> 00:31:39,499
- Director Kang. - Yes.

563
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,199
Thanks for today.

564
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,600
For what?

565
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:47,239
The pho restaurant in the afternoon...

566
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,669
and for refraining from drinking just now.

567
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:53,979
Don't drink too much.

568
00:31:54,739 --> 00:31:56,310
You don't seem to drink well.

569
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:59,279
All right. I'll go home now.

570
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:02,390
- Ms. An. - Yes?

571
00:32:03,449 --> 00:32:04,689
Our show...

572
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,590
You made it before leaving.

573
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:10,259
There's nothing to worry about reading the trend.

574
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,160
What you want to do is the answer, right?

575
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:19,640
I'm sober because of you, do you want to go have another drink?

576
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,100
Oh, right. You can't drink.

577
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,109
I can drink if I want to now.

578
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,580
Liar.

579
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,380
It is a lie, but I can't drink with you.

580
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:31,778
You were too hideous yesterday.

581
00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:34,449
- Did you talk informally just now? - You're talking informally too.

582
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,988
You are too!

583
00:32:35,989 --> 00:32:37,319
This is violence.

584
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,120
- You seem to hit well. - You're crazy.

585
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,860
Why are you like this? Are you a pervert or what?

586
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:45,290
What?

587
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,699
Hey.

588
00:32:52,499 --> 00:32:53,499
Hey.

589
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,140
What is it?

590
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:59,310
Did I hear you laughing earlier?

591
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:02,509
Did I?

592
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,279
What was so funny?

593
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:14,590
- Hey! - Calm down before you burst a vein.

594
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,998
Actually, the thing is...

595
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:22,300
I've been struggling to hold something else back.

596
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,999
Honestly, I've been holding in my fart.

597
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:28,169
As soon as the snake climbed up to my knee...

598
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:39,380
I assume the snake fainted at that moment.

599
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,570
Don't drink beer alone next time.

600
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,410
It's shabby, but let's drink together here.

601
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,549
That's not even his house.

602
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:14,120
I'm not sure if I'm frightened or fluttered...

603
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,949
or if this is the spring breeze or the fall breeze.

604
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,719
Another strangely confusing day passes by.

605
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,099
- Hey. - Where are you?

606
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,259
I'm almost there.

607
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,770
Me too.

608
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,858
Hey, what's going on?

609
00:35:00,859 --> 00:35:02,670
It's fall, but why are there cherry blossoms falling?

610
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,299
Is it only me?

611
00:35:04,429 --> 00:35:05,529
You're right.

612
00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:08,500
I smell spring from the fall breeze.

613
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:20,920
(Work Later, Drink Now 2)
