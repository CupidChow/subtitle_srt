Icheon soju goes down more smoothly.

It went below 20 degrees.

00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:50,710
You aren't drinking, are you?

495
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:14,559
Is that a rabbit pounding on a mortar?

496
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:21,140
Is that a camel?

497
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,440
Why does it have so much stuff on its back?

498
00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:35,720
Kang Ji Goo, listen carefully.

499
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:37,720
Do you know what was on the news yesterday?

500
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:40,990
It was a story about a freshman who studied hard...

501
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:42,559
to get into a top school, but died...

502
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,859
because their seniors made them drink by force.

503
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,299
I won't let you become like that.

504
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,170
I didn't work hard...

505
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,599
to send you to college to do that.

506
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,269
But Mom,

507
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,900
when I was young,

508
00:28:55,539 --> 00:28:57,109
you told me to drink...

509
00:28:57,339 --> 00:29:00,079
at an ancestral rite.

510
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:01,910
Are you a fool?

511
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,349
You had to receive that alcohol...

512
00:29:04,349 --> 00:29:06,650
to protect our positions.

513
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:09,390
You must never drink alcohol...

514
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,619
to protect yourself.

515
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,359
Can't I decide...

516
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,059
whether I want to protect myself or not?

517
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:18,559
What did you just say?

518
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:21,130
Are you drunk? Did you drink?

519
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:23,700
If I don't want people to make me drink by force,

520
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,769
can't I just say that I don't want to drink?

521
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,970
Punk, do you think they would listen to you?

522
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:33,009
You won't say you don't want to drink.

523
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,250
I hate this.

524
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,720
Did the full moon really change at that time?

525
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,720
Yes, it definitely looked like a camel,

526
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:49,329
but it changed into a lion.

527
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,589
I'm sure of it. It was a lion.

528
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:54,529
You said you drank three glasses of soju with beer bottoms up.

529
00:29:54,529 --> 00:29:55,799
You were just drunk.

530
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,500
Zombie, be quiet.

531
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:12,619
Gosh.

532
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,390
Darn it. That surprised me.

533
00:30:33,869 --> 00:30:36,869
I feel good from being tipsy.

534
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:51,450
It was the historical day when Ji Goo drank...

535
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,920
and smoked for the first time.

536
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:57,160
A historical day has started for me too.

537
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,970
Gosh. I want water.

538
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:12,980
Water? Hold on a second.

539
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:26,220
Geez. This is booze.

540
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,690
Really? I'm sorry.

541
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,660
Gosh. Where did you get this from?

542
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,630
- Over there. - Geez.

543
00:31:34,329 --> 00:31:36,430
Hey. Isn't this homemade wine?

544
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,440
What? It used to be full.

545
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,599
Geez. Who on earth drank it?

546
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,910
I did when I woke up. I thought it was water.

547
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:48,309
What? But it has an ABV of over 40 percent.

548
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:51,180
You're crazy. You really are. Are you okay?

549
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:54,480
No wonder I feel happy.

550
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:58,420
Hey. Didn't you say drinking will kill you?

551
00:31:58,789 --> 00:32:00,759
- Yes, she's right. - Oh, my.

552
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,630
My mom must have lied.

553
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,829
Can you believe her? Oh, my gosh.

554
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,630
- Goodness. The booze. - Oh, my goodness.

555
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,740
- So this is 40 percent ABV. - Oh, no.

556
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,170
Hey, grab me a cup.

557
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,940
Death must be just around the corner.

558
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:19,579
My mouth feels dry like a desert.

559
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,349
It would be really nice to leave after drinking...

560
00:32:25,349 --> 00:32:28,650
a cup of tequila that'll warm up the pit of my stomach.

561
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,490
I might be able to be born again...

562
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:36,890
as hot as the sun in Mexico.

563
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,599
- Mom. - Yes?

564
00:32:40,029 --> 00:32:41,700
You were right, Mom.

565
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:43,500
There's soju with only 14 percent ABV.

566
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,700
I'm choosing to die so that I don't have to see that.

567
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,839
Selling 14 percent ABV booze is embarrassing.

568
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:52,940
If it doesn't taste bitter, what's the point of drinking?

569
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,509
Mom.

570
00:32:55,579 --> 00:32:58,680
Gosh. Will you stop it? I'm already tired as is.

571
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:00,319
Why did you lie to me?

572
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,349
You told me I didn't have the genes to break down alcohol.

573
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:05,119
Were you sure about it?

574
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:07,119
Stop playing dead.

575
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:09,890
Ji Yeon. Did you really drink?

576
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:14,200
Gosh. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, does it?

577
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,700
The booze tasted sweet.

578
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,269
Look at you.

579
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,200
If I hadn't lied to you,

580
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,970
you would've started drinking in high school.

581
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,039
That's not true.

582
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,769
Do you know why it tasted sweet?

583
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,480
Because it's meant to be sweet.

584
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:28,509
It's supposed to taste bitter.

585
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:30,910
Most people say it tastes bitter.

586
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:35,750
But I didn't raise you like that.

587
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:39,619
No matter how bitter life was,

588
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:43,259
I raised you so it would feel sweet.

589
00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:49,829
I brought you up like cotton candy.

590
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:51,529
Geez.

591
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:57,640
After being bedridden for years,

592
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,079
Mom left the world.

593
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:16,360
With a request to scatter her with a 25 percent ABV Toad Soju...

594
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,260
that had the same birthday as her.

595
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,380
And...

596
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,920
It was the only thing I was good at.

597
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,389
So the only real legacy I can leave you is this.

598
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:55,630
Use it whenever good things, sad things,

599
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,570
hard things, big or small things,

600
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,099
or whatever happens.

601
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,949
Now then. It has just been sold.

602
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,119
Seventy thousand dollars per barrel.

603
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:17,219
For 70,000 dollars? Goodness.

604
00:35:17,219 --> 00:35:20,119
I'm saved. Thank you, Mom!

605
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,360
Gosh. So those are...

606
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,730
what we couldn't buy in 2019, no matter what we tried.

607
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,869
Yes, it's the Ilpoom Jinro.

608
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:32,539
So the poop dream I had in the morning was this.

00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,670
You're right.

610

Gosh.

The stronger the booze, what about the side dish?

- The milder and fattier. - The milder and fattier.

And the rare the booze is?

618

- The gentler and subtler. - The gentler and subtler.

619

Good. Dig in.

So this is the original Toad Soju...

that has the same birthday as your mom, right?

Gosh. It's the very Toad that sells...

626

more than ten times on the auction website.

627
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,590
So your mom knew this would happen.

628

Yes, most likely.

629

I cancelled an instalment savings account after hearing your story.
