00:00:30,234 --> 00:00:32,103
or did the ceiling get lower?

4
00:00:32,104 --> 00:00:33,364
It's the mother nature effect.

5
00:00:33,365 --> 00:00:36,975
It still has flowers and a forest.

6
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,273
You could call it nature.

7
00:00:38,274 --> 00:00:40,743
That's right. We have our forest animal friends here.

Hi, friends.

How are we going to share the two rooms?

10
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:45,483
You two can use the rooms. I don't need a room.

I also don't need a room.

12

The living room is the least stuffy.

00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:50,155
What? I was going to use the living room.

14
00:00:50,855 --> 00:00:52,724
Let's all use the living room then. When did we ever use separate rooms?

15
00:00:52,725 --> 00:00:55,094
True. We have way too many rooms for nothing.

Well, we can start earning from now.

I sent you so many writers, but you've rejected them all.

I'm sorry. I was kind of talking to myself.

102

It's like an old habit of mine.

103
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,885
Most of all, you speak quite fast.

- Thank you. - No.

105
00:04:46,154 --> 00:04:48,224
You'll get hyperventilation if you do that.

106

Hyperventilation rapidly decreases oxygen saturation,

That's right. Make it more fun after you know, editing it?

129
00:05:56,894 --> 00:05:59,163
You could also put subtitles.

130
00:05:59,164 --> 00:06:01,234
Why would you need to shoot so much...

131

and add so much?

132
00:06:03,235 --> 00:06:06,734
We don't make videos for the number of views or fame.

133
00:06:06,735 --> 00:06:10,273
So we also don't need fancy edits.

134
00:06:10,274 --> 00:06:13,744
We also don't want instructors...

135

who only have a fancy appearance.

136
00:06:16,774 --> 00:06:18,515

166
00:08:09,854 --> 00:08:12,565
They were good. They must be busy since they're good.

167
00:08:13,524 --> 00:08:14,794
Darn it!

168
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:18,505
How about pairing Ji Seung Kyu and Ha Eun Soo?

169
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:21,833
I heard some things when I met Ji Seung Kyu's manager in the past.

170
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,004
I think that might be a good idea.

171
00:08:23,005 --> 00:08:24,074
- Ms. An. - Yes?

172
00:08:24,075 --> 00:08:25,703
Ji Seung Kyu is...

173
00:08:25,704 --> 00:08:28,214
in prison because he did drugs and gambled.

174
00:08:28,344 --> 00:08:29,914
Did he do drugs?

175
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,183
Do you remember the idol singers who used to fight?

176
00:08:35,184 --> 00:08:37,454
Choi Seon Yeong and Lee Yeon Ji. Those two will be amazing.

177
00:08:37,455 --> 00:08:39,423
They will be a hot topic and we can make them make up.

178
00:08:39,424 --> 00:08:40,523
- Don't you think so? - Ms. An.

179
00:08:40,524 --> 00:08:43,324
Choi Seon Young had cancer last year, and...

180
00:08:43,424 --> 00:08:45,424
We can't go to the afterworld.

181
00:08:46,164 --> 00:08:47,294
We can't go...

182
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:49,364
and she can't come either.

183
00:08:49,365 --> 00:08:50,794
Is that so?

184
00:08:51,005 --> 00:08:53,164
I really didn't know that. I'm sorry.

185
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:54,904
- That could happen. - That's right.

186
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:58,944
I'll get some coffee and come back.

187
00:08:59,304 --> 00:09:00,914
- I'll go and buy coffee. - It's okay.

188
00:09:01,044 --> 00:09:02,715

00:09:10,154 --> 00:09:11,284

196

203

Where in the world did you disappear?

204
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,553
Everyone was really worried.

205
00:09:44,554 --> 00:09:46,154
Something just happened.

206

Yes.

You know I became a main writer, right?

209
00:09:51,194 --> 00:09:53,324
I'm in charge of Producer Seong's program.

212
00:09:59,235 --> 00:10:01,904
Did you get that job?

213
00:10:02,174 --> 00:10:04,705
I didn't know because I was away from the world until now.

214
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,944
What in the world did you do?

215
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:09,643
I was upset to hear the news that the Great An So Hee was...

216
00:10:09,644 --> 00:10:12,385
completely lost after returning after a long time.

217
00:10:13,385 --> 00:10:16,084
That's why you can't take time off in this field.

218
00:10:16,085 --> 00:10:19,324
People say you've lost your touch even if you take a short time off.

219
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:21,794
It's just our fate.

Why are people talking already? Where did you hear that from?

223

Okay.

That's right.

Hello.

234
00:10:54,524 --> 00:10:55,923
I haven't seen a man in a long time.

235

What? I'm happy to see him.

239
00:11:01,865 --> 00:11:03,235
He's my younger brother.

Oh, my. No wonder.

I look forward to your help, Producer.

243
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:09,135
I'm not a producer.

244
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,204
What are you then?

245
00:11:10,205 --> 00:11:12,105
He just came to help us film.

246
00:11:12,174 --> 00:11:13,673
Aren't you going to change?

247
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,574
That's right. I'm so forgetful.

248
00:11:19,784 --> 00:11:23,414
I accepted her because I heard she trained in the mountains.

249
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:27,455
She won't work with us for long, so don't put in a lot of effort.

250
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:28,793
I never put in a lot of effort.

251

You know we have a group training in the afternoon, right?

252
00:11:31,164 --> 00:11:33,024
Can you please film that too?

253
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,903
I also only wore beggar-like clothes in the mountains.

254
00:11:37,904 --> 00:11:39,265
I can't believe I'm wearing these here too.

Okay.

from using English.

Take it easy, and just film for about 20 minutes.

263
00:12:01,324 --> 00:12:03,755
Producer, why don't you answer her?

264
00:12:04,465 --> 00:12:07,595
Your sister kept talking to you, but you never answered her.

I wish you would just focus on the class.

I'm sorry.

If someone doesn't give answers when other people are talking,

269

it feels like I haven't wiped after going to the bathroom.

270
00:12:19,804 --> 00:12:22,244
My younger brother usually doesn't give answers.

Who does that?

272
00:12:23,444 --> 00:12:25,245
You must answer other people when they talk to you.

if you don't have the skills.

336
00:16:03,735 --> 00:16:05,364
Let's just eat it then.

338

The food is cold.

I thought you went abroad because I couldn't reach you.

You were here.

A doctor? A pharmacist?

He doesn't look like one.

You greeted him enough.

Ms. Han, this candle...

376
00:19:17,854 --> 00:19:20,494
is an eco-friendly scented candle from India...

377

called fig and wine made with natural plant oil.

It has a soft and refreshing forest wood scent...

379
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:31,004
which is rarely found in Korea.

380
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:33,245
I guess that's why you're not used to it.

381
00:19:33,475 --> 00:19:36,244
It's a handmade product...

382

Sorry about this.

Is this the cypress water you sprayed?

This cypress water...

Look! It has water mold.

395
00:20:20,584 --> 00:20:22,593
I guess this is why it smelled rotten.

396
00:20:22,594 --> 00:20:24,523
And this scented candle...

397
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:27,195
doesn't smell like it's from India.

Of course! It's made in China.

Actually, my nickname was ostrich...

405
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,444
because I have great eyesight.

406
00:20:41,445 --> 00:20:43,644
But my eyes became even better after living in the mountains.

407
00:20:43,645 --> 00:20:44,843
It's like I have a telescope in my eyes.

408
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,843
I can see all sorts of things.

Goodness. "Made in China."

Oh, dear.

No way.

413
00:21:00,765 --> 00:21:02,834
This was so expensive.

414
00:21:03,134 --> 00:21:04,765
You were scammed, Director.

415
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,404
Of course, not all Chinese products are bad.

416
00:21:09,405 --> 00:21:11,133
But it's been on the news before.

417
00:21:11,134 --> 00:21:12,704
They found harmful substances in the scented candles...

418
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,343
and humidifiers. It created a commotion.

419
00:21:14,344 --> 00:21:15,813
I think we shouldn't use it.

420
00:21:15,814 --> 00:21:17,214
It smells bad, so I'm 100 percent sure...

421
00:21:17,215 --> 00:21:19,485
that it's not natural and used cheap chemical ingredients.

422
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:24,754
My sense of smell has become so keen since I was back from the mountains.

423
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:27,754
I can even guess what they're making in the market 100m away.

424
00:21:27,755 --> 00:21:29,694
I even guessed what kind of pancakes they made this morning.

425
00:21:29,695 --> 00:21:31,324
They were making perilla leaf pancakes.

426
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,494
I even guessed what kind of ramyeon our neighbours were making yesterday.

427
00:21:34,495 --> 00:21:35,965
They were making Samyang ramyeon.

428
00:21:36,034 --> 00:21:37,833
My friends told me not to lie, so I went downstairs and asked them.

429
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:39,235
They were really making Samyang ramyeon.

430
00:21:40,364 --> 00:21:42,205
Should we put these out?

431
00:21:44,235 --> 00:21:45,544
Let's open the door...

432
00:21:45,844 --> 00:21:48,145
and start over.

433
00:21:49,814 --> 00:21:50,975
She's saying we should put these out, right?

434
00:21:52,015 --> 00:21:53,715
- Put them out. - Put them out.

435
00:22:03,895 --> 00:22:05,564
I can finally breathe now.

436
00:22:07,725 --> 00:22:10,034
I think they're grilling pork belly somewhere. It smells so delicious.

437
00:22:11,834 --> 00:22:13,665
Don't we do get-togethers?

438
00:22:18,874 --> 00:22:21,915
Don't your writers use messengers?

439
00:22:22,814 --> 00:22:24,874
Rumours circulate fast in this field.

440
00:22:25,185 --> 00:22:26,914
Let's wrap up...

441
00:22:26,915 --> 00:22:28,144
and go home.

We have a lot of changes today,

so I made Se Mi summarize the meeting and give it to you.

450

Se Mi didn't do anything wrong.

Seriously,

452
00:22:59,844 --> 00:23:01,245
don't you think our writers could become comedians?

453

Why are you so funny?

454

Mom, is the fried chicken here?

I'm really sorry.

474
00:23:50,834 --> 00:23:53,664
I must have forgotten to write it because I'm out of my mind.

475

I'm really sorry.

476

Let's eat fried chicken.

479
00:24:00,604 --> 00:24:02,014
I shouldn't have said that.

Did we come to a Korean restaurant?

490

I wanted to serve you a hot meal...

00:24:54,725 --> 00:24:56,494
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

493
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,593
Why didn't Ji Goo come?

494
00:24:57,594 --> 00:24:58,863
She will come.

495
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,504
- I'm here. - Ji Goo.

496
00:25:00,505 --> 00:25:02,273
Hurry up. This tastes like our moms' food.

497
00:25:02,274 --> 00:25:03,435
She probably doesn't like her mom.

498
00:25:04,705 --> 00:25:06,745
Oh, my!

499
00:25:06,975 --> 00:25:09,145
I wanted to eat Korean food today.

500
00:25:10,374 --> 00:25:12,044
- Oh, my. - Eat up.

501
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,844
- Thank you. - This is it.

502
00:25:20,084 --> 00:25:21,324
- Isn't it delicious? - Yes.

503
00:25:22,094 --> 00:25:24,094
Eat slowly.

504
00:25:24,395 --> 00:25:25,824
You all had a hard time today, right?

505
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:33,803
Was it hard today?

506
00:25:33,804 --> 00:25:35,005
A little bit.

507
00:25:35,435 --> 00:25:37,304
It's so delicious.

508
00:25:37,374 --> 00:25:40,274
I love bulgogi with some soup on the bottom like this.

509
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:47,014
I'm full.

510
00:25:47,015 --> 00:25:48,214
I feel better now.

511
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:49,415
Me too.

512
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,225
Shall we have a drink now?

513
00:25:58,895 --> 00:26:00,064
Let's drink.

514
00:26:00,824 --> 00:26:03,435
- Let's drink. - Let's drink.

515
00:26:16,544 --> 00:26:17,814
Gosh.

516
00:26:19,584 --> 00:26:20,715
Do you want another drink?

517
00:26:23,084 --> 00:26:25,725
I think I will get in trouble if I drink more today.

518
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:28,793
I'm kind of scared of Ms. An getting in trouble after a while.

519
00:26:28,794 --> 00:26:30,224
You're right.

520
00:26:30,225 --> 00:26:32,523
Since it's the first day of our return,

521
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,123
should we stop now?

522
00:26:34,124 --> 00:26:35,833
Yes, we have more time to drink later.

523
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:37,133
- That's right. - That's right.

524
00:26:37,134 --> 00:26:38,334
That's right.

525
00:26:38,735 --> 00:26:41,505
- Let's drink. - Let's drink.

526
00:26:43,405 --> 00:26:45,674
City equals fried chicken and...

527
00:26:45,675 --> 00:26:47,043
fried chicken equals city.

528
00:26:47,044 --> 00:26:48,444
- City equals soju and... - Good one.

529
00:26:48,445 --> 00:26:49,813
soju equals city.

530
00:26:49,814 --> 00:26:52,685
Good job.

531
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,154
- What? - Oh, my.

532
00:26:57,155 --> 00:26:58,925
She's doing a talent show.

533
00:26:59,024 --> 00:27:00,854
It's our loss if we take time off. Let's not do that anymore, okay?

534
00:27:01,354 --> 00:27:02,654
- Do you want one more bottle? - Okay.

535
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:04,725
Okay. Can we have one more bottle?

536
00:27:08,524 --> 00:27:09,664
- Cheers. - Here.

537
00:27:09,665 --> 00:27:11,434
Good job.

538
00:27:11,435 --> 00:27:12,665
Ji Yeon taught me how to do this.

539
00:27:12,735 --> 00:27:13,764
I taught you.

540
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,905
- Cheers. - Cheers.

541
00:27:18,675 --> 00:27:20,144
Coming back isn't easy.

542
00:27:20,145 --> 00:27:22,274
Why? Did someone make you mad?

543
00:27:22,915 --> 00:27:25,784
It's obvious that her punk junior writers made her mad, right?

544
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,283
How could you...

545
00:27:27,284 --> 00:27:29,053
- call them punks? - Why?

546
00:27:29,054 --> 00:27:31,313
They're all punks if they gave a hard time to my friend.

547
00:27:31,314 --> 00:27:34,024
- You're already calling them punks. - Punks.

548
00:27:34,155 --> 00:27:35,184
Let's drink.

549
00:27:35,185 --> 00:27:36,695
- Let's drink. - Let's drink.

550
00:27:41,925 --> 00:27:44,434
I heard our team only drinks tea...

551
00:27:44,435 --> 00:27:47,465
at get-togethers. Do you think this makes sense?

552
00:27:48,804 --> 00:27:50,773
Tea? The tea you drink?

553
00:27:50,774 --> 00:27:52,144
- Tea. - Just quit.

554
00:27:52,145 --> 00:27:53,474
Are you serious?

555
00:27:53,475 --> 00:27:55,974
Everything is fine except that.

556
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:57,614
Are you sure they also like you?

557
00:27:58,445 --> 00:27:59,843
Do I have to know that?

558
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:00,915
No.

559
00:28:00,985 --> 00:28:02,084
Ji Yeon.

560
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:03,854
You're the best.

561
00:28:04,655 --> 00:28:07,084
- Let's drink. - Let's drink.

562
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,824
- Let's drink. - Did the city make us drink,

563
00:28:10,024 --> 00:28:12,465
or did our hard day make us drink?

564
00:28:12,765 --> 00:28:15,534
We never thought about alcohol in the mountains,

565
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:18,494
I wondered what we would have done without alcohol...

566
00:28:18,495 --> 00:28:19,804
because we drank so much today.

567
00:28:20,034 --> 00:28:24,073
Cheers!

568
00:28:24,074 --> 00:28:26,074
- Cheers. - Cheers.

569
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:31,843
Now that we're in the city,

570
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:35,084
cussing has become a daily thing, no?

571
00:28:36,685 --> 00:28:37,813
Aren't I right?

572
00:28:37,814 --> 00:28:41,654
Back in the mountain, we never used bad words like heck or darn.

573
00:28:41,655 --> 00:28:42,894
Did you?

574
00:28:42,895 --> 00:28:44,925
- What about you? - I used heck.

575
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:47,623
Right. You did,

576
00:28:47,624 --> 00:28:50,563
but not as much as when you were here. Right?

577
00:28:50,564 --> 00:28:53,434
In other words, cussing equals city,

578
00:28:53,435 --> 00:28:55,404
and the city equals cussing.

579
00:28:55,405 --> 00:28:56,405
Darn.

580
00:28:57,175 --> 00:28:59,303
This topic reminded me of what happened today.

581
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:03,674
Today, I delivered to this woman three times.

582
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:05,145
- Three times? - Listen.

583
00:29:05,415 --> 00:29:07,614
In the morning, she ordered fried chicken...

584
00:29:07,844 --> 00:29:10,383
at a motel with the guy she was having an affair with.

585
00:29:10,384 --> 00:29:12,225
During lunch,

586
00:29:12,554 --> 00:29:16,394
she ordered fried chicken again with that same guy, who was also...

587
00:29:16,395 --> 00:29:18,124
her co-worker, at her office.

588
00:29:18,995 --> 00:29:21,995
And in the afternoon, she ordered...

589
00:29:22,395 --> 00:29:26,333
the same fried chicken with her husband at her house.

590
00:29:26,334 --> 00:29:28,034
Oh, my gosh.

591
00:29:30,774 --> 00:29:32,343
Isn't it darn sad?

592
00:29:32,344 --> 00:29:34,273
That woman sure loves fried chicken.

593
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:35,344
Why not?

594
00:29:35,715 --> 00:29:37,543
Fried chicken equals love,

595
00:29:37,544 --> 00:29:40,185
and love equals fried chicken.

596
00:29:40,685 --> 00:29:42,353
- You're right. - Yes.

597
00:29:42,354 --> 00:29:45,014
Gosh. Back in the mountain, the only light we had...

598
00:29:45,015 --> 00:29:47,353
was when we started a fire.

599
00:29:47,354 --> 00:29:50,853
But this place is filled with lights.

600
00:29:50,854 --> 00:29:52,093
Get lost!

601
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:55,064
- Take this! - "Take this!"

602
00:29:59,104 --> 00:30:02,904
Goodness. Is it me that's wobbling...

603
00:30:02,905 --> 00:30:05,874
or the floor that's wobbling?

604
00:30:06,044 --> 00:30:10,113
If we're all wobbling, the floor must be what's wobbling.

605
00:30:10,114 --> 00:30:12,073
- Bingo. - I want to sleep.

606
00:30:12,074 --> 00:30:13,644
I need to pee.

607
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,784
Pee?

608
00:30:16,384 --> 00:30:18,113
No, stop it.

609
00:30:18,114 --> 00:30:19,454
You need to pee inside a toilet.

610
00:30:19,455 --> 00:30:20,924
- Get up. - A toilet?

611
00:30:20,925 --> 00:30:23,053
- Yes. Stand up. - The toilet.

612
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,624
- The toilet. - Yes.

613
00:30:26,695 --> 00:30:28,264
- Hey. - Come on.

614
00:30:28,265 --> 00:30:29,265
Darn it.

615
00:30:29,266 --> 00:30:30,793
- Are you okay? - It hurts.

616
00:30:30,794 --> 00:30:32,803
- Are you okay? Answer me. - Are you asking me?

617
00:30:32,804 --> 00:30:34,004
- Are you? - Talk to me.

618
00:30:34,005 --> 00:30:35,005
- Okay. - Hey.

619
00:30:35,006 --> 00:30:37,573
- We became dead drunk. - Ji Goo, wake up.

620
00:30:37,574 --> 00:30:39,103
- And it was only after... - Hey, are you okay?

621
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,644
- two bottles of soju. - Hey.

622
00:30:40,645 --> 00:30:42,574
- Stand up. - Stand up.

623
00:30:52,854 --> 00:30:54,624
Is it going to rain?

624
00:30:55,284 --> 00:30:56,624
Did you bring in the laundry?

625
00:30:57,925 --> 00:31:01,793
Oh, gosh. I'm freezing cold.

626
00:31:01,794 --> 00:31:02,895
Me too.

627
00:31:04,465 --> 00:31:06,235
Did you not get the fire going?

(Director Kang Book Goo)

629
00:31:07,965 --> 00:31:10,704
I did. That's why it's so bright here.

630
00:31:10,705 --> 00:31:13,004
But I'm still freezing cold.

631
00:31:13,005 --> 00:31:14,803

632
00:31:14,804 --> 00:31:16,344
Who are you?

This can't be real.

No, it can't be. No way.

Goodness, Ms. An!

What on earth is this?

For goodness' sake. Seriously.

641

Don't throw up. Get up.

Stop acting coy. Get up.

Get in the car first. This isn't some tourist home.

655
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:08,765
- Ms. An, put on the seatbelt. - Why?

656
00:32:10,765 --> 00:32:11,994
Ms. Kang.

657
00:32:11,995 --> 00:32:14,665
Don't do that, please. Just sleep.

658

(Valet Parking)

659
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:21,244
No, don't.

660
00:32:21,245 --> 00:32:23,245
That's not something to grab. Hold on.

661
00:32:23,515 --> 00:32:24,675
Whatever.

662
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,084
You wackos!

663
00:32:30,384 --> 00:32:32,425
What if I hadn't called?

664
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,884
At this rate,

665
00:32:34,584 --> 00:32:36,053
none of them can get married.

666
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,995
Who would take them as their bride?

667
00:32:41,925 --> 00:32:42,965
Is that...

668
00:32:43,794 --> 00:32:46,604
an eye booger or a nose booger?

669
00:32:49,405 --> 00:32:50,574
It's dirty.

670
00:33:05,854 --> 00:33:07,455
You're back, so everything's good.

671
00:33:31,215 --> 00:33:32,274
I need to go.

672
00:33:35,755 --> 00:33:36,814
Go?

673
00:33:37,455 --> 00:33:38,515
Me too.

674
00:33:39,725 --> 00:33:41,823
- Go where? - To pee.

675
00:33:41,824 --> 00:33:43,195
I need to pee.

676
00:33:44,395 --> 00:33:46,823
- You're lying, right? - I need to go.

677
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:47,994
No, you don't.

678
00:33:47,995 --> 00:33:49,533
I'm about to burst.

679
00:33:49,534 --> 00:33:51,694
- I need to pee. - Where are you going?

680
00:33:51,695 --> 00:33:53,234
If you need to pee,

681
00:33:53,235 --> 00:33:55,603
- use the toilet indoors. - I'm about to pee.

682
00:33:55,604 --> 00:33:57,234
- No, don't go yet. Wait. - I can't hold it.

683
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:58,273
- Oh, no. - Wait.

684
00:33:58,274 --> 00:34:00,445
- My zipper got stuck. - Gosh.

685
00:34:02,445 --> 00:34:04,344
- It's not coming out now. - Hold on!

686
00:34:04,645 --> 00:34:05,945
Darn it.

687
00:34:08,444 --> 00:34:09,854
- That feels good. - No, wait.

688
00:34:09,855 --> 00:34:11,014
I told you to wait.

689
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:12,524
It's thorny. Getting it in your skin will hurt.

690
00:34:12,525 --> 00:34:13,884
No, it's not.

691
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:16,455
I can't stop peeing.

692
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:17,955
- Gosh. - Hey.

693
00:34:17,956 --> 00:34:21,564
In the past, my dog used to pee like this...

694
00:34:21,565 --> 00:34:24,033
when he was in an unfamiliar place.

695
00:34:24,034 --> 00:34:27,464
- It's cold. - Your dog wasn't used to the place.

696
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:31,304
I don't hear anything.

697
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:34,903
- Hey, that's my house. - Why are they peeing for so long?

698
00:34:34,904 --> 00:34:36,274
- Seriously. I'm going crazy. - It's nasty. Don't shake it.

699
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:38,815
Whether it was because the city felt unfamiliar...

700
00:34:39,045 --> 00:34:42,455
or because of our biorhythms used to our long mountain life,

701
00:34:42,984 --> 00:34:46,025
we peed together for quite a long time.
