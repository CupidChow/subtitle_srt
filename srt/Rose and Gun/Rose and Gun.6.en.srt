18
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,240
Hang on a sec. I'll be quick.

19
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,426
(Let's meet an hour later.)

20
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,410
(Zone C, second floor of Wenzhou Mall.)

21
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,950
(Do you have time?)

22
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,590
(Yes.)

23
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,690
(I'm wearing a black baseball cap)

24
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,320
(and carrying a white tote bag.)

25
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,850
Hai, something urgent came up.

26
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,893
Let's push the task back.

27
00:02:26,915 --> 00:02:28,010
What's so urgent?

28
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,671
- Want me to come with you?
- It's fine.

29
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,090
(I got here ten minutes early.)

30
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,010
(Where are we meeting?)

31
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,480
(Send me the exact location.)

32
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,850
(I'm in front of Zhenyu Restaurant.)

33
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,130
(Come up and meet me there.)

34
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:01,850
(On my way.)

35
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,010
Hello?

36
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:06,970
You guys arrived?

37
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,410
I'll come down and get you.

38
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,410
All right. Got it.

39
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,880
(I'm at the restaurant entrance.)

40
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,050
(I don't see you.)

41
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,320
Wu Si?

42
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,930
Tang Xin?

43
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:51,760
Black baseball cap?

44
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,440
White bag?

45
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:56,960
Do you know

46
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,004
how many people in the mall
fit that description?

47
00:04:59,337 --> 00:05:00,370
He's just an ordinary guy

48
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,250
with a sense of justice.

49
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,810
Of course, he's not a pro.

50
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,160
Not everyone gets
professional military training

51
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:07,170
like you do.

52
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,930
Why did he ask to meet?

53
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,280
He said he had more leads

54
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,440
and some salvaged artifacts.

55
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,640
That's why I agreed to meet him.

56
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,080
With the artifacts,

57
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,130
we can estimate the value
of the sunken ship.

58
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,050
Every new clue
gives us new possibilities

59
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,440
to stop the smuggling.

60
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,840
If he's telling the truth,

61
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,400
customs are strict.

62
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,930
Don't be discouraged.

63
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,250
Perhaps he ran into trouble

64
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:36,930
and had to lie low.

65
00:05:41,204 --> 00:05:43,200
The person I was supposed to meet
never showed.

66
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,080
But the one I wasn't looking for

67
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,840
keeps popping up in the strangest ways.

68
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,180
(Oatmeal, Bee Farmer)

69
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,930
Captain Wu,

70
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,200
I didn't know you were the healthy type.

71
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,490
That's for my mom.

72
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,490
Since joining the army,

73
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,137
I hardly get to spend time with her.

74
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,640
Honestly, I've been meaning to ask.

75
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,730
Why did you join the military?

76
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,840
My dad passed away when I was a kid.

77
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,200
My mom raised me on her own.

78
00:06:46,204 --> 00:06:48,010
She had to juggle work
and taking care of me.

79
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,382
It was overwhelming.

80
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,490
Later,

81
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,370
one of my dad's comrades suggested

82
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,200
I join the army to toughen up.

83
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,382
At first, I couldn't get used to it,

84
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,170
but later,

85
00:06:59,448 --> 00:07:00,760
I couldn't live without it.

86
00:07:05,982 --> 00:07:07,400
I happened to run into you today.

87
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,810
Here's your recording pen.

88
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,490
Wang Chen listened to it.

89
00:07:10,537 --> 00:07:11,610
She asked me to thank you.

90
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,960
No problem.

91
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,490
What is this?

92
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,960
Previously, I only
introduced myself verbally.

93
00:07:26,115 --> 00:07:28,160
This time, I'm giving it to you
in writing.

94
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,880
It's the resume

95
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,400
I submitted to the military,

96
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,690
so every word

97
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,690
is 100 percent authentic.

98
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:38,760
And?

99
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,520
I want you to know more about me

100
00:07:41,115 --> 00:07:42,671
so we can get along better from now on.

101
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,690
You don't expect me to give you
my resume too, do you?

102
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:57,490
You can if you want.

103
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,690
You must be kidding, right?

104
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,490
Fine, fine.

105
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,690
I've met

106
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,200
all kinds of people as a journalist,

107
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,520
but I've never seen anyone
bring a resume to a date.

108
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:15,760
But I'll say this now,

109
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,320
ordinary folks like me

110
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,930
don't carry resumes along.

111
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,320
So I'll send you a digital copy later.

112
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,640
Keep your word.

113
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,330
We met by chance today.

114
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,970
The recording pen makes sense.

115
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,920
But why are you carrying a resume

116
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,160
that's meant for me?

117
00:08:56,182 --> 00:08:57,400
I should return to the base.

118
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,370
Enjoy your food.

119
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,370
I've already paid.

120
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,640
Got to go, bye.

121
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,640
Don't forget the resume.

122
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,610
Is Dad back?

123
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,610
Lan Yangyang!

124
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,920
Dad, you're back.

125
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,610
You've graduated for a while now.

126
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,471
How much longer
do you plan to keep drifting?

127
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,160
Come outside with me.

128
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,760
I don't want to work in a hospital.

129
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,450
Why not?

130
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,880
Is the job too tough for you?

131
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,760
I just don't like it at all.

132
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,040
Wait.

133
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,090
You studied medicine for seven years

134
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,730
and even got your master's,

135
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,400
and now you say you don't like it?

136
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,160
I just don't think
I'm cut out for medicine.

137
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,400
Then what are you cut out for?

138
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:03,920
I don't know.

139
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:05,640
When I was applying to university,

140
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,330
I told you.

141
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,250
Did you listen?

142
00:11:07,448 --> 00:11:08,850
In the seven years of your school,

143
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:12,210
did you ever talk to us
about the career you desire?

144
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,560
Now you've finally graduated,

145
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,760
and say you don't like it.

146
00:11:16,848 --> 00:11:18,426
You plan to sit at home and do nothing?

147
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:20,730
You studied medicine for seven years.

148
00:11:21,004 --> 00:11:22,450
You should put your learning to use

149
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,400
and save lives.

150
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,250
As my daughter,

151
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,040
you should be strong and capable.

152
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,010
Yangyang, your dad just wants
what's best for you.

153
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,210
A career is a big decision in life.

154
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,850
It's not child's play.

155
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,090
Miss this chance,

156
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,560
and it's gone for good.

157
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,010
Then so be it.

158
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,210
I'm still young.

159
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,130
Someone once told me

160
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,330
that I can follow my heart

161
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,330
and choose my life.

162
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,970
Follow your heart in life decisions?

163
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,210
Who told you that nonsense?

164
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,380
(Big Big Wolf)

165
00:12:01,782 --> 00:12:03,070
Why aren't you answering it?

166
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,640
It's just a friend.

167
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,850
- Dad.
- I won't look.

168
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,400
Who is it?

169
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,450
First, tell me who this is.

170
00:12:11,515 --> 00:12:12,560
Is this your boyfriend,

171
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,160
or is this the person
who all put these ideas in your head?

172
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,370
No one put ideas in my head.

173
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,450
These are my own thoughts.

174
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,450
Listen.

175
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,610
- If you keep thinking this way...
- Weiguo.

176
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,040
Calm down.

177
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,640
Look, talk to her calmly.

178
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,040
How do you expect me to stay calm?

179
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:25,920
Come. You're patient.

180
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,210
You talk to her.

181
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,850
Why are you yelling again, Weiguo?

182
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,450
Mom, what's wrong with Dad?

183
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,250
Enough.

184
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,450
You've gone too far this time.

185
00:12:35,782 --> 00:12:37,182
We've given you everything you want

186
00:12:37,204 --> 00:12:38,560
since you were little.

187
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,730
You can't be this willful
over something so important.

188
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,800
It's not just your dad,

189
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,040
I don't agree either.

190
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,970
Everything I said just now
came from the heart.

191
00:12:47,048 --> 00:12:48,610
I've been holding it in for seven years.

192
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,250
I thought long and hard
before saying it.

193
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,370
Thought long and hard?

194
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,880
You studied medicine.

195
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,090
What else can you do

196
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,210
if not be a doctor?

197
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,970
Anything.

198
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,130
If all else fails,

199
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,640
I'll work with Xin as a journalist.

200
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,640
You? A journalist?

201
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,250
What's wrong with that?

202
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,130
Even a blind bird finds a worm.

203
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,250
Where's my phone?

204
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,940
(Enter Password)

205
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:18,680
Dad!

206
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,090
Dad, why are you checking my phone?

207
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,250
Give it back!

208
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,010
Why do you have this guy's photo?

209
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,250
What? None of your business.

210
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,582
- Don't grab it.
- Give it back.

211
00:13:26,604 --> 00:13:28,250
Tell me who this guy is first.

212
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,040
Chen.

213
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,680
Chen?

214
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,890
I made a simple meal.

215
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,160
Soup's in the pot.

216
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,780
(White Bunny: My wife's finally back.)

217
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,040
(It feels like home again,
even without her in the house.)

218
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,140
(You have received a new email.)

219
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,490
(Sorry, I didn't mean to stand you up.)

220
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,730
(After I got to the mall,)

221
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,271
(I felt like someone was following me.)

222
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,640
(I'll contact you)

223
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:28,760
(once I feel safe.)

224
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:09,880
Yangyang?

225
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,970
Why don't you go up?
Why are you sitting out here?

226
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,850
Xin,

227
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,090
I'm homeless.

228
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,800
Can you take me in?

229
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,490
Come on.

230
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,640
Close the door.

231
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:40,370
Xin,

232
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,730
is that you?

233
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,610
Yeah, I'm home.

234
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,280
Don't worry, Mom. Rest up.

235
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,490
You sleep early too.

236
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,840
Who's calling?

237
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,040
Hello?

238
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,120
Captain Tang,

239
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,600
this is Wang Cong.

240
00:17:22,004 --> 00:17:23,650
You didn't shower and got into my bed.

241
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,520
No. I'm sleeping now.

242
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,360
Gross.

243
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,250
Get up now.

244
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,280
Hurry. Get up.

245
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,250
Shower.

246
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,250
This is my bed. Go.

247
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:37,890
Hurry up.

248
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:38,800
Go.

249
00:17:45,145 --> 00:17:46,010
Xin.

250
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,093
Please come in.

251
00:17:49,738 --> 00:17:50,520
Xin.

252
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:51,760
Mom.

253
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:54,080
Madam Wang just called.

254
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,170
She said Yangyang ran away from home.

255
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,010
Has she contacted you?

256
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,280
No idea.

257
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,170
Well.

258
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,890
I'll call her back.

259
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,010
You kids

260
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,890
always make us worry.

261
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:21,890
Mom.

262
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,650
I'm not the one causing trouble.

263
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,320
Rest up early.

264
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,120
You too.

265
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,360
Spill it. What happened?

266
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,730
I'm too tired. Let's talk tomorrow.

267
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,360
Xin, your blanket smells nice.

268
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:54,970
From today on,

269
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,840
this bed is mine.

270
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,360
You stink.

271
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,250
Yes, I stink.

272
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,080
Xin, it's late!

273
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,170
Stop making noise.

274
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,280
I'm so sorry.

275
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,760
Yangyang's causing you trouble.

276
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,890
All right. Bye.

277
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,730
She's at Tang's place.

278
00:19:29,893 --> 00:19:31,250
I'll bring her home tomorrow.

279
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:31,840
Don't.

280
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,800
If she dares to run away,

281
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,320
then she'd better not come back.

282
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,760
Give it a rest.

283
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,080
You were worried sick just now,

284
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,080
and now you're being like this?

285
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,170
What's wrong with that girl?

286
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,760
Run away from home, huh?

287
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,380
(Wu Si: Your resume?)

288
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,120
Captain Wu, you were serious?

289
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,120
Fine.

290
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,450
(Wu Si: Received.)

291
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,300
(Resume)

292
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,560
Dumb guy.

293
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,410
Now that's cuter.

294
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,100
(Resume)

295
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,540
(People's Liberation Army Navy)

296
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,800
Eyes right.

297
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,560
Eyes front.

298
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,840
All squads, 3 km run for warming up.

299
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,890
Double time, move.

300
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:41,170
One, two, one.

301
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:50,890
One, two, three, four.

302
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:59,730
One, two, three, four.

303
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,410
Little princess.

304
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,930
Get up now. When are you going home?

305
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,890
I'm not going back.

306
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,450
Don't joke around.

307
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,170
Your parents must be worried sick.

308
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,490
And let me tell you.

309
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,890
My parents are home all day.

310
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,226
You can't always hide in my room.

311
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,730
Don't lie to me.

312
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,890
You already sold me out, didn't you?

313
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,560
Listen. You're not driving me away.

314
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,170
From now on, I'm Tang Yangyang.

315
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,730
Tang?

316
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,671
If you don't leave,
you'll make me an accomplice.

317
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:40,600
I'm telling you, if you don't go home,

318
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,337
we'll both be nailed to the shame pillar
for running away from home.

319
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,560
Like that's the first time

320
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,115
we've been nailed to the shame pillar.

321
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,010
Have some pity on me.

322
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,320
If I go home now,

323
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,320
we'll fight about

324
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,600
my career again.

325
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,170
I'd rather stay here

326
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,170
and be your maid.

327
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,890
Running away is shameful.

328
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,600
As long as I run far enough,
the problem isn't a problem.

329
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,010
Fine.

330
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,080
You want to be a maid here?

331
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,120
That's not an easy job in my house.

332
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,120
After you get up,

333
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,320
mop the floor,

334
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,600
do the laundry in the basket,

335
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,360
prepare lunch,

336
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,970
and listen to my dad's war stories
for two hours.

337
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:20,890
That's your job.

338
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:23,930
Can you give me some time
to think about it?

339
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,080
Report.

340
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:26,890
Come in.

341
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,730
Yes, Sir.

342
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,410
Wang Lang.

343
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,170
Yes, Sir.

344
00:23:35,871 --> 00:23:37,410
You've trained some good soldiers.

345
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,120
Who are you referring to?

346
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,450
Tall nose, big eyes, and oval face.

347
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,410
His height...

348
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,010
How tall are you?

349
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,840
1.80 meters.

350
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,410
Then he must be 1.9 meters.

351
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:52,010
Even if not, he's 1.88 meters.

352
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,560
Tall nose, big eyes...

353
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,840
1.88 meters...

354
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:58,930
That's not Wu Si.

355
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,690
I know him.

356
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:01,730
Not him.

357
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,600
But the guy's close to him.

358
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,893
Graduated from National University
of Defense Technology.

359
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,410
Do you mean Zong Qing?

360
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:08,840
The squad leader in Wu Si's team.

361
00:24:08,893 --> 00:24:11,026
Communications Engineering major.
He's a captain.

362
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,250
How's his performance?

363
00:24:13,448 --> 00:24:14,804
Graduated from a military academy.

364
00:24:14,826 --> 00:24:15,690
His professionalism,

365
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,560
physical strength,

366
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,410
discipline,

367
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,170
and tactical skills are outstanding.

368
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,650
And also good at
winning over girls' hearts?

369
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:25,690
Zong Qing

370
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,170
and Yangyang?

371
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,360
What about his political conduct?

372
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,320
Like, does he have

373
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:35,760
any strange ideas

374
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,170
or negative thoughts?

375
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,690
Sir,

376
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,930
his thinking and conduct are sound.

377
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:44,120
He's seeking progress politically.

378
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,730
He's also one of the best soldiers
I've trained.

379
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:54,320
Chief,

380
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,170
should I call him in?

381
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,600
Nothing's confirmed yet.

382
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,730
If you interfere,

383
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,760
he might just end up
becoming my son-in-law.

384
00:25:02,582 --> 00:25:04,170
Let's talk about the drill first.

385
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:04,970
Yes, Sir.

386
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,690
Go!

387
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,560
Go!

388
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,010
Bravo!

389
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:24,280
Yangyang.

390
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,840
How can we let you do this here?

391
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,250
Come.

392
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,760
- Give it to me.
- Mrs. Tang, let me do it.

393
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,337
If not, I'll really become Lazy Goat.

394
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,010
You're a guest.

395
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,560
I can't let you do housework. Come on.

396
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,490
Go rest in the room.

397
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:42,010
Quick. Answer your phone inside.

398
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,040
All right.

399
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,010
Hello?

400
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,093
Hello, Yangyang? What are you doing?

401
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,730
Is everything okay?

402
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,280
You heard?

403
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,170
Are you in trouble? Don't scare me.

404
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,250
Tell me what happened.

405
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,690
Zong Qing,

406
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,520
my parents found out about us.

407
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:10,490
They also know you're the one
who stopped me from becoming a doctor.

408
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,010
When did I say that?

409
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,010
You were the one who told me

410
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,650
to follow my heart.

411
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,040
- Yes, what I meant was...
- Well, I know.

412
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,280
No matter what you meant,

413
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,320
I've made my stance clear
to my parents.

414
00:26:23,404 --> 00:26:25,170
I won't become a doctor,
no matter what.

415
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,490
What did they say?

416
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,650
Of course they disagreed,

417
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,490
and we got into a fight.

418
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,690
So I ran away from home.

419
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,490
You ran away?

420
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,490
Don't worry.

421
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,650
I'm at Xin's place. I'm happy now.

422
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:43,520
Zong Qing,

423
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,560
are you mad?

424
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,040
Why would I be mad?

425
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,010
Since you've decided not to be a doctor,

426
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,560
of course, I'll support your decision.

427
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,800
It's just that...

428
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:55,970
What is it?

429
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,137
Just that I won't be seeing you
for checkups anymore.

430
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,010
Can you ever be serious?

431
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,080
Ugh. I'm hanging up. Bye.

432
00:27:10,271 --> 00:27:11,937
When did I ever say that?

433
00:27:21,448 --> 00:27:22,737
Let's synchronize our watches.

434
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,170
It's 1:57 PM now.

435
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,690
Parachute drop in four minutes.

436
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:32,426
Link up with Squad B
at the pre-assigned ambush point

437
00:27:32,448 --> 00:27:33,560
before 2:40 PM.

438
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:35,650
Understood?

439
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:43,840
Yi Nanwang,

440
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,490
you're now part of Blue Blade.

441
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,970
Show us what you've got as a marine.

442
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,210
Yes, Sir.

443
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:45,410
Speed up.

444
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,760
Link up with Squad A before 2:30 PM.

445
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,970
Have you figured out
the kidnappers' positions?

446
00:29:37,004 --> 00:29:38,250
I can see there are 13 of them,

447
00:29:38,293 --> 00:29:40,210
and adding those hidden,
they may be around 20.

448
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,320
They're spread out.

449
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,010
That's about what I saw too.

450
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:45,360
But the internal structure
of this building is complicated.

451
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,760
We can't confirm the exact locations
of the hostages and kidnappers.

452
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,960
There's an opening on the roof.

453
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,471
We can breach the building from there.

454
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,690
In this operation,

455
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,410
not only must we ensure
the hostages' safety,

456
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,490
but also capture the leader,

457
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,080
codenamed A, alive

458
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:02,930
as a key witness.

459
00:30:09,695 --> 00:30:11,490
To complete the mission in 15 minutes,

460
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,080
we can't allow the enemy to regroup

461
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,490
and find protection.

462
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,120
We must hit them separately.

463
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,650
Based on their layout,

464
00:30:19,871 --> 00:30:21,360
the four of you will each lead a team

465
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,650
and execute a multi-dimensional
breach-and-rescue.

466
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,450
My team will enter from the roof.

467
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,210
You, Li Xu, Zhou Keyang, form one team.

468
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:29,840
Yes, Sir.

469
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,560
Wang Chen, Yi Nanwang,

470
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,982
and Ye Haiyang.

471
00:30:34,004 --> 00:30:35,960
You'll breach from the left side
of the second floor.

472
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,400
Understood.

473
00:30:36,404 --> 00:30:37,410
Zong Qing, Cheng Yuan,

474
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:38,650
and Peng Tiechao,

475
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,560
you'll breach from the right side
of the second floor.

476
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,250
If necessary,

477
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,730
use your sniper advantage.

478
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,490
But without Cheng Yuan,

479
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,490
your team's firepower

480
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:48,690
will be limited.

481
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:49,490
Understood.

482
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,360
Understood.

483
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:53,490
Everyone else,

484
00:30:53,493 --> 00:30:55,690
follow me in through
the main entrance on the first floor.

485
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,648
Synchronize our watches.

486
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:03,490
Move out.

487
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,690
Go check it out.

488
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,410
Teams, report in.

489
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,370
Sniper, in position.

490
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,370
Team One, in position.

491
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,930
Team Two, in position.

492
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:49,560
Team Three, in position.

493
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,810
Go.

494
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:37,600
Here you go.

495
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,720
Thanks.

496
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:39,693
Take this.

497
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:40,930
Here.

498
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,720
Get one.

499
00:38:44,382 --> 00:38:44,770
Here.

500
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:45,160
Show me.

501
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:45,848
I'll put it here.

502
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:48,520
Here you go.

503
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,810
Zong Qing, how long did it take?

504
00:38:52,471 --> 00:38:54,120
Fourteen minutes and thirty seconds.

505
00:38:54,693 --> 00:38:56,240
Fourteen minutes and thirty seconds?

506
00:38:57,648 --> 00:38:59,770
Just thirty seconds
ahead of the time limit.

507
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,010
Captain Wu,

508
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,450
your special ops team is impressive.

509
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,200
It was a drill, and they went all out.

510
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,720
Since it's a combat drill,

511
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,200
we must take it seriously.

512
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:14,720
Didn't you also

513
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,490
set up a bunch of traps and obstacles?

514
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:17,850
Yeah.

515
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,600
But none of them could stop you.

516
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:23,290
The special ops team is something else.

517
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,330
We should learn from you.

518
00:39:26,293 --> 00:39:27,410
Let's learn from each other.

519
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:28,520
Report.

520
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,080
Captain,

521
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,680
I didn't hold the team back, didn't I?

522
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,290
Yi Nanwang,

523
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,640
you did very well this time.

524
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:40,240
Fall in.

525
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,600
Chief,

526
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,770
Blue Blade rescued the hostage

527
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:48,720
and captured A alive.

528
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:49,970
Drill complete.

529
00:39:50,271 --> 00:39:52,200
It took fourteen minutes
and thirty seconds.

530
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,271
Please advise, Sir.

531
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,410
Every one of you

532
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,560
has performed quite remarkably

533
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,330
in this drill.

534
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,370
From deployment tactics

535
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,770
to individual combats,

536
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:05,770
you've all demonstrated

537
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,290
exceptional teamwork and coordination.

538
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,370
I must say,

539
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,120
you're brave and tactical.

540
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:12,490
This deserves recognition.

541
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:16,810
A's team also did a great job.

542
00:40:17,471 --> 00:40:19,240
To keep the drill
as realistic as possible,

543
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,040
you didn't wear face protection.

544
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:23,290
You nearly defeated

545
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,810
Blue Blade.

546
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,850
You completed the mission
thirty seconds early.

547
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:29,890
Are you satisfied?

548
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,080
No, Sir!

549
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:32,450
Then what should you do?

550
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:33,770
Chief,

551
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,640
we must continue to push harder

552
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,680
and train even harder.

553
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,080
A chief from Marine Corps

554
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,680
was observing this drill.

555
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,520
He's on his way from the command center
to visit you all.

556
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,680
Attention!

557
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,600
Straighten your uniform.

558
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,970
You're off work early today.

559
00:41:03,293 --> 00:41:05,671
My dad has a follow-up checkup.
I need to pick him up.

560
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,370
Anything?

561
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:08,893
It's the jewelry store case.

562
00:41:08,893 --> 00:41:10,800
We've reached a deal
on the secret footage incident.

563
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:11,850
They agreed not to appeal,

564
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:14,370
but they want us to stop
all forms of covert filming

565
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:16,200
and investigation.

566
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,200
Isn't that admitting guilt?

567
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:19,810
Let them be.

568
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,582
At least we saved
a hundred thousand yuan.

569
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,160
What did Mr. Tian say?

570
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:25,850
He doesn't want
to make things complicated,

571
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:26,890
so he agreed.

572
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,450
All right. Accept it, then.

573
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,600
Remember the colleague

574
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,410
who helped us submit the bravery news?

575
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,850
My buddy.

576
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,160
Hand over all our materials to him,

577
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:39,720
including the secret footage...

578
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,290
Wait.

579
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,680
If you do this,

580
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:44,080
will they take revenge on you?

581
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:46,520
Revenge doesn't need a reason.

582
00:41:47,026 --> 00:41:48,600
They just don't want me filming them.

583
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,200
Fine, I'll have someone else do it.

584
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:52,890
Oh, come on.
I just got officially hired.

585
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:55,010
Can you not sacrifice me for the news?

586
00:41:55,271 --> 00:41:57,240
I transferred here
from the broadcasting station.

587
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,640
We'll go down together.

588
00:41:58,770 --> 00:41:59,410
Bye.

589
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:00,810
Wait.

590
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:04,010
Xin, please.

591
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,080
