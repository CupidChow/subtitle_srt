19
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:23,600
Hello?

20
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:24,600
Mr. Han.

21
00:02:24,715 --> 00:02:26,970
Someone just laid flowers
at Xu Genshui's parents' grave.

22
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:28,760
Do you recognize them?

23
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,090
No, I don't.

24
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,780
What do they look like?

25
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,900
A man, in his fifties.

26
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,540
Nothing else noticeable.

27
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,100
Follow him, then.

28
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,060
Find out where he lives

29
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,460
and who he's been in contact with.

30
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,540
Don't lose him.

31
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,900
Got it, Mr. Han.

33
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,020
I really didn't expect

34
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,900
you'd ask me out for coffee.

35
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,660
I'm honestly a bit flattered.

36
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,140
Truth be told, Mr. Han,

37
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,140
I do have a few questions
I'd like to ask you.

38
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,260
Go ahead.

39
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,700
Here's the thing.

40
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,500
Regarding my abduction
in the Roman Islands,

41
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,900
you said you thought
it was the work of traffickers.

42
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,260
But there's one thing
I never figured out.

43
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,260
If they really were traffickers,

44
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,060
why didn't they just take us
straight to the boat

45
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,820
after kidnapping us?

46
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,060
Why lock us up somewhere else?

47
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,700
Maybe they wanted to

48
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,420
catch a few more people
before sending us all together.

49
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,700
One more thing.

50
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,060
That day, I saw the waiter

51
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,580
take the drink from the bartender

52
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,060
and personally serve it to my table.

53
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,180
Logically speaking, traffickers

54
00:05:35,248 --> 00:05:37,226
shouldn't have had any chance
to tamper with it.

55
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,580
Well, could it be that

56
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,500
both the bartender and the waiter

57
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,300
were already bribed by the traffickers?

58
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,180
This kind of joint crime

59
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,180
is actually quite common overseas.

60
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,940
The waiter and bartender

61
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,820
could indeed have been bought off.

62
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,700
But probably not by traffickers.

63
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,060
Because the person who bribed them

64
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,260
knew all of my whereabouts clearly.

65
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,500
And they knew I often visited that café.

66
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,740
So this definitely wasn't
a random kidnapping.

67
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,420
You mean

68
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,060
there's a third party involved?

69
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,420
At such a sensitive time

70
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,820
and sensitive location?

71
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,940
I can't help but think so.

72
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,300
I think
this was a premeditated kidnapping.

73
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,300
I understand how you feel

74
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,700
and the logic behind what you're saying.

75
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,060
But based on the evidence
we currently have,

76
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,060
there's no way to prove

77
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,060
this wasn't a random incident.

78
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:42,820
Right?

79
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,260
Besides,

80
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,940
if all they wanted

81
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,180
was to shut you up,

82
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,260
they could've taken

83
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,580
far more direct methods.

84
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,300
There was no need
to play games like this.

85
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,260
I think the reason they didn't

86
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,580
take more direct action

87
00:07:03,226 --> 00:07:05,060
is that they're afraid
of exposure too.

88
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,300
But they want me to stay abroad

89
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,060
forever.

90
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,180
Is this what Wu Si analyzed for you?

91
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,060
Do you think his analysis makes sense?

92
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,380
Hello?

93
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,940
How's it going?

94
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,260
Mr. Han, we found his home.

95
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,300
Where?

96
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,500
It's a place called Hongya Village.

97
00:07:33,604 --> 00:07:35,115
There aren't many households here.

98
00:07:35,115 --> 00:07:36,337
It looks almost deserted.

99
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,260
Hongya Village?

100
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,180
Yes.

101
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,820
What should we do next?

102
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,940
Go to his house and detain him.

103
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,580
Then look for his ID card.

104
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,860
Find out his real name and who he is.

105
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,940
Got it, Mr. Han.

106
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,300
Hello?

107
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,940
Bring a few men to Hongya Village now.

108
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,300
If we simply analyze it

109
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,940
from a logical standpoint,

110
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,300
this is indeed possible.

111
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,180
Yet like I said,

112
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,820
with the evidence we have,

113
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,740
we still can't prove
it wasn't just a random event.

114
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,700
But regardless,

115
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,180
this whole thing happened

116
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,700
because you were investigating
the artifact smuggling.

117
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,700
So I still think

118
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,060
you should give me all the information.

119
00:08:26,115 --> 00:08:27,560
Let me help with the investigation.

120
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,060
I'll help you uncover the truth, okay?

121
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,980
Even if you know the truth,

122
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,540
what then?

123
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,020
Are you going to betray your own family?

124
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,380
Betray my family?

125
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,220
I could never do that.

126
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,540
But if there's enough evidence to prove

127
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,540
that the ones behind the smuggling

128
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,260
are my dad and my brother,

129
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,140
I have my own way

130
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,500
to make them stop.

131
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,540
What's it?

132
00:08:57,982 --> 00:08:59,340
You'll know when the time comes.

133
00:09:02,137 --> 00:09:04,260
If you're really serious
about this investigation,

134
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,860
you indeed

135
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,260
have more opportunities than I do.

136
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,500
Yes.

137
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,140
All the food's gone.

138
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,740
Who are you looking for?

139
00:09:46,671 --> 00:09:47,620
We're here for someone.

140
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,500
Who?

141
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,220
(Wei Jiangnan)

142
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,780
Buddy.

143
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,140
Look,

144
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,260
I don't even know you.

145
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,380
Maybe you've got the wrong person?

146
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,860
Who exactly are you people?

147
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,020
Why don't you tell me first

148
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,340
who you really are?

149
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,020
You've got my ID, right?

150
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,740
Your name is Wei Jiangnan?

151
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,500
That's right.

152
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,020
Then why did you
go to Xu Genshui's parents' grave

153
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,900
to lay flowers?

154
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,260
Well...

155
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,540
They're my uncle and aunt
on my mother's side.

156
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,140
I haven't been there in years.

157
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,780
I've only been there once lately.

158
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,380
Is that a problem?

159
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,500
Well, what's your computer password?

160
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,100
What computer password?

161
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,260
Bro, can't we just talk this out?

162
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,740
Why hit me?

163
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,860
Alright. I'll tell you, okay?

164
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,780
Well...

165
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,020
I stole this computer.

166
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,740
What's the password to the email?

167
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,860
I don't have an email.

168
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,740
Mr. Han.

169
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,120
Here are all the inventory lists

170
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,471
for the first and second batches.

171
00:11:57,471 --> 00:11:58,404
Please take a look.

172
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,500
Hello? What's the situation?

173
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,260
Mr. Han, we checked the ID.

174
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,860
His name is Wei Jiangnan.

175
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,860
We also checked the computer and email.

176
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,100
There are indeed exchanges
with Tang Xin.

177
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,380
We can confirm

178
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,620
he's the one who emailed

179
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,260
Tang Xin with the leads.

180
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,500
Wei Jiangnan?

181
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,100
Does our group have this guy?

182
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,860
It doesn't ring a bell.

183
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,620
I never heard of him before.

184
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,780
I'll go check.

185
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,020
Keep pressing him.

186
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,020
Make him spill everything.

187
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,140
Where did this Wei Jiangnan come from?

188
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,500
And how does he know so much about us?

189
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:55,860
Xin.

190
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,130
You came here today

191
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,100
not just to cook for me, right?

192
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,500
Tell me about your plan
to become a doctor.

193
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,490
How's it going?

194
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,360
I've even picked the hospital.

195
00:13:05,626 --> 00:13:06,782
Is it the military hospital?

196
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,100
The special recruitment
for the military has ended this year.

197
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,450
If I want to apply again,
I'll have to wait until next spring.

198
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,100
Instead of waiting,

199
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,540
I want to start right away.

200
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,100
So

201
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,260
I'm planning to go to

202
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,380
the hospital where Lin Lan gave birth.

203
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,140
I'll start as a resident doctor

204
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,260
and slowly move toward
the anesthesiology department.

205
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,900
I've heard anesthesiology
is really tiring.

206
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,100
They're extremely short-staffed
in anesthesiology.

207
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,860
If I can join them,

208
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,937
then when emergencies
like Lin Lan's happen again,

209
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,020
I can step in and help.

210
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,620
Why are you staring at me like that?

211
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,260
How did you suddenly become so grown-up?

212
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,100
I also asked Qiu Xiao for advice.

213
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,780
She said good doctors
don't pick hospitals.

214
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,540
As long as you can save lives,
it's worth it.

215
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,100
Mr. Han, I double-checked.

216
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,493
There really was no one
named Wei Jiangnan in the company.

217
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,900
Forget who he really is for now.

218
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,260
What we can confirm is

219
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,140
Wei Jiangnan

220
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,900
is the one who gave Tang Xin the leads.

221
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,380
From the emails between them,

222
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,620
Tang Xin knows way too much.

223
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,380
I have to talk to her in person.

224
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,100
Use Wei Jiangnan's email address

225
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,340
to send Tang Xin an email.

226
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,340
Tell her there's new evidence.

227
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,260
Only a face-to-face meeting will do.

228
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,740
After that, lure Tang Xin
to Wei Jiangnan's place.

229
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,100
And then?

230
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,740
Detain her.

231
00:14:54,776 --> 00:14:56,260
I want to talk to her myself.

232
00:14:56,537 --> 00:14:58,500
(Minghua News)
Everyone, please look at this image.

233
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,340
This is the East Sea Route.

234
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,140
It's also known as
the Maritime Silk Road on the East Sea.

235
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,620
Let's look at the next image.

236
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,729
This one shows
the South Sea Maritime Silk Road,

237
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,500
which is also known as
the South Sea Route.

238
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,860
As you can clearly see,

239
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,860
its starting points
are Guangzhou and Quanzhou.

240
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,160
It passes through

241
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,979
(Miss Tang, I didn't manage)
Southeast Asian countries

242
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,269
(to reply to your email)
and China's southern peninsula.

243
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:26,382
(because something came up. I'm safe.)
It crosses Indian Ocean, enters Red Sea,

244
00:15:26,448 --> 00:15:28,860
(Got more leads on the smuggling gang.)
and reaches East Africa.

245
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,226
(Got time? I'll give you the materials.)
Through over 100 countries and regions.

246
00:15:31,271 --> 00:15:32,860
That makes it one of China's

247
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,404
most important maritime routes

248
00:15:34,448 --> 00:15:36,860
(I'm available. Tell me the location.)
for trade and cultural exchange.

249
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,260
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Bai.

250
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,540
My informant asked to meet.

251
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,100
He said there's urgent info to share.

252
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,780
Want me to go with you?

253
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,540
It's alright.

254
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,860
If there's a stranger around,

255
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,900
it might spook him.

256
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,140
Be careful, then.

257
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,100
Do stay safe.

258
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,020
I will.

259
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,340
(Tang Xin:
Wu Si, the informant wants to meet.)

260
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,715
(I just left, and I'm heading out.)

261
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,860
(Are you free?)

262
00:16:09,871 --> 00:16:12,004
(Want me to pick you up
and meet him together?)

263
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,460
Hurry! Move!

264
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,260
Quick!

265
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,100
Speed up!

266
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,780
Can you go faster?

267
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,140
Quick!

268
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,140
Run! Run!

269
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,140
Speed up!

270
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,060
(Wu Si)

271
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,340
(Hongya Village Committee)

272
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,500
Stop.

273
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,020
The terrain ahead is complex.

274
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,500
Advance in two-column formation.

275
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,260
Stop.

276
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,300
The terrain ahead is tricky.

277
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,020
Advance in triangle formation.

278
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,260
(I've arrived at a village,)

279
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,660
(but I feel like I might be
in the wrong place.)

280
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,300
(This doesn't seem like
where we agreed to meet.)

281
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,500
(Can you send me your location?)

282
00:18:29,248 --> 00:18:30,580
(You're not in the wrong place.)

283
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,820
(This is it.)

284
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,100
(I'm staying here for safety reasons.)

285
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,260
Mr. Han.

286
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,580
I'm here. What's it?

287
00:18:52,115 --> 00:18:53,826
You should see this for yourself.

288
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,740
(Mr. Han, I double-checked.)

289
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,150
(There really was no one
named Wei Jiangnan in the company.)

290
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,300
(Forget who he really is for now.)

291
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,740
(From the emails between them,)

292
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,740
(Tang Xin knows way too much.)

293
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,740
(I have to talk to her in person.)

294
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,500
(Use Wei Jiangnan's email address)

295
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,500
(to send Tang Xin an email.)

296
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,420
(Tell her)

297
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,580
(there's new evidence.)

298
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,500
(Only a face-to-face meeting will do.)

299
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,420
(After that, lure Tang Xin
to Wei Jiangnan's place.)

300
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,780
(And then?)

301
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,740
(Detain her...)

302
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,020
Hello?

303
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,260
I'd like to file a police report.

304
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,580
(Which house is yours?)

305
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,300
(Just keep going straight.)

306
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,180
(Pass through a narrow path,)

307
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,020
(and you'll see my house.)

308
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,100
Give chase!

309
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,740
Stop right there!

310
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:25,980
Don't run!

311
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,700
Stop!

312
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,780
Go after her! Quick!

313
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,540
Stop!

314
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,700
Stop right there!

315
00:21:55,871 --> 00:21:57,100
Let me give you all a brief.

316
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,580
Today's mission

317
00:21:58,648 --> 00:22:00,509
is to rescue the hostage
and the reporter.

318
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,626
- Understood.
- Understood.

319
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,220
Move out.

320
00:22:16,426 --> 00:22:17,740
- Don't move!
- Stop right there!

321
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,760
The police are here! Run!

322
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,580
- Follow me!
- Yes!

323
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,260
Are you hurt anywhere?

324
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,580
My neck.

325
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,180
Don't move!

326
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,740
Stop! Don't run!

327
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,740
Stop running!

328
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,740
Freeze! Stop running! Don't move!

329
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,700
We're the police.

330
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,020
You're Wei Jiangnan, right?

331
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:49,500
Untie him.

332
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,180
Yes, Sir.

333
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,180
Thank you. Thank you so much.

334
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:01,940
You're safe now.

335
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,980
(Tang Xin)

336
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,980
My goodness.

337
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,260
Hello?

338
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,260
Hello, Tang Xin?

339
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,660
Did you meet him?

340
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,220
Where are you now?

341
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,420
Yeah, I met him.

342
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:49,300
But now I'm gloriously hospitalized
with injuries.

343
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,260
You got hurt?

344
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:51,980
Is it serious?

345
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,020
I'm fine. It's already treated.

346
00:23:57,762 --> 00:23:58,340
Reporting.

347
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:58,980
Come in.

348
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,700
What's the rush? Why so flustered?

349
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,420
Brigadier,

350
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,582
I'd like to request leave.

351
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,780
Leave?

352
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,500
Why?

353
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,740
Tang Xin is in the hospital.

354
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,740
I need to check on her.

355
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,740
Hospitalized? What happened?

356
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,020
She said it was work-related.

357
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,180
I was in training and missed her call.

358
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,420
By the time I called back,

359
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,715
she said she was at the hospital.

360
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,940
Don't panic.

361
00:24:19,337 --> 00:24:21,220
Head to the hospital
and check on her first.

362
00:24:22,226 --> 00:24:23,020
How about this?

363
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,420
I'll grant you
a few days of recovery leave.

364
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,740
You've got your own injuries,

365
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,937
and it's time to tend to them.

366
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,020
Get a checkup, take a break,

367
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,780
and keep Tang Xin company.

368
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,060
Thank you, Brigadier.

369
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:46,700
- Mr. Han Jr., what are you...
- Get out!

370
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,660
Han Yutian.

371
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,580
I've warned you plenty of times.

372
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,340
I told you to stay away from Tang Xin.

373
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,220
Are you really trying
to push me this far?

374
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,420
Are you here to cause a scene

375
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,315
because of your
precious journalist again?

376
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,300
You really think I won't expose

377
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,180
all the dirty deeds you've done, huh?

378
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:23,700
Fine.

379
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:26,660
Alright.

380
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,180
Well, tell me

381
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,580
what I have done.

382
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,700
You used Wei Jiangnan's email address

383
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,460
to lure Tang Xin out.

384
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,060
You then had your men kidnap her.

385
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,660
Isn't that a dirty deed?

386
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,220
Wei Jiangnan?

387
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,660
Kidnapping?

388
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,060
What are you talking about?

389
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,940
You've got the guts to do it,
but not admit it?

390
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,500
Here's another thing.

391
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,100
Tang Xin and Wei Jiangnan

392
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,340
were rescued by the police.

393
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,260
Nervous now?

394
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,980
Are you going to drop the act now?

395
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,220
You called the police?

396
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:15,820
Yes.

397
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,940
Han Yuhang.

398
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,540
What are you trying to do?

399
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,820
I want to save you!

400
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,500
I don't want a future

401
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,500
where I have
to visit my brother in prison.

402
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,020
Han Yuhang!

403
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,540
Mr. Han.

404
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,020
Looks like your brother

405
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,660
knows quite a bit about us.

406
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,180
How did he find out?

407
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,180
Mr. Han.

408
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,500
Now isn't the time to worry about that.

409
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,500
Think about it. If what he said is true,

410
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,780
and Tang Xin and Wei Jiangnan

411
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,660
were both rescued by the police,

412
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,100
they probably have
a lot of evidence on us.

413
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,660
Dad.

414
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,020
We're in trouble.

415
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:42,500
(The People's Republic of China, Police)
Who kidnapped you, Wei Jiangnan?

416
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,740
Do you know them?

417
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:47,980
I don't.

418
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,220
It must have been Han Changzhou
who ordered it.

419
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,180
Well, how did you know

420
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,500
about them salvaging
sunken national artifacts?

421
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,660
Because I used to be

422
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,700
a mid-level employee at Changzhou Group.

423
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,740
I then became an executive.

424
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,500
So...

425
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,980
I know quite a lot

426
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,820
about what they've been doing.

427
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:13,940
Wei Jiangnan.

428
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,540
We've verified your identity
and information.

429
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,180
What exactly is your real name
and identity?

430
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:24,780
That's right.

431
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,180
My name isn't Wei Jiangnan.

432
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,780
My real name is Xu Genshui.

433
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,100
I had no choice but to hide my identity.

434
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,100
When I saw Han Changzhou and the others

435
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,460
stealing more and more relics,

436
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,580
getting bolder each time,

437
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,260
I decided to quickly collect evidence

438
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,180
and hand over their criminal evidence

439
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,760
to the public security authorities.

440
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,100
They found out

441
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,500
I was collecting evidence against them,

442
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,580
so they tried to get rid of me.

443
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,700
Luckily, fate spared me.

444
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,540
I survived it.

445
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,940
After you escaped,

446
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,537
why didn't you report it right away?

447
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,660
Because I had no evidence.

448
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,700
Once Han Changzhou found out
I was still alive,

449
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,660
he definitely wouldn't let me go.

450
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,540
To avoid being recognized by them

451
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,260
I got plastic surgery,

452
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,820
and used the name Wei Jiangnan

453
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,780
to make a fake ID
and conceal my identity.

454
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,700
To my surprise,

455
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,060
they still managed to find me.

456
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,060
Sir.

457
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,300
Sure, understood.

458
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,740
Xu Genshui.

459
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,260
Your case involves a wide scope.

460
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,820
Regarding the artifact theft,

461
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,537
the municipal police have filed a case.

462
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,020
We'll need you to go to HQ

463
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,580
and explain the situation in detail.

464
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,500
Sure.

465
00:30:04,626 --> 00:30:06,100
Thank you for your cooperation.

466
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,020
Thank you for providing our department

467
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:11,180
with leads
on this criminal organization.

468
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:11,740
Thank you.

469
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,180
Don't mention it.

470
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,220
It's what any conscientious citizen

471
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,660
should do.

472
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,500
Anyway,
that's pretty much what happened.

473
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,300
I was in training all day today.

474
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,820
I didn't see your messages

475
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,500
because I left my phone in the dorm.

476
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,100
You endured so much alone.

477
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,660
I feel terrible about it.

478
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,660
It's okay.

479
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,340
Look at me now.

480
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,060
I'm all fine, right?

481
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,500
Thankfully the police arrived in time.

482
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,260
If they'd been any later,

483
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,500
it could've ended very badly.

484
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,740
Speaking of which,

485
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,980
I have a question.

486
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,340
Analyze this for me.

487
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,740
What's it?

488
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,500
This time,

489
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,500
it seemed like
the police came well-prepared.

490
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,540
So I'm wondering

491
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,540
who called the police.

492
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,340
The officer who rescued me said

493
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,740
someone made

494
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,340
an anonymous report.

495
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,740
Not only did they know
a kidnapping would happen,

496
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,660
but they also knew the exact location.

497
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,180
This person

498
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,980
must have known those men
were planning to kidnap you.

499
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,540
Who do you think it was?

500
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,220
Han Yuhang.

501
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,540
No matter what,

502
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,500
I still need to thank you

503
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,660
for saving me.

504
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,220
Why thank me?

505
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,100
I didn't do anything.

506
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,260
Thank you for that harsh reprimand.

507
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,340
You said, when I go to investigate,

508
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,060
I must report my whereabouts.

509
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,940
Well,

510
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,180
since I humbly accepted your criticism,

511
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,980
don't you owe me some praise?

512
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,260
Some praise, huh?

513
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,500
Xin, what's it?

514
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,740
Mom, my company suddenly asked me
to go on a business trip.

515
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,020
I have to leave now.

516
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,180
I'll be back in a few days.

517
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,780
Inform Dad of it too.

518
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,660
Don't worry.

519
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:51,300
Why... Why are you leaving so suddenly?

520
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,580
Have you packed your luggage?

521
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,500
There's no time for that.

522
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,182
I'll just buy
whatever I need over there.

523
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,300
I have to board now.
I'm hanging up, Mom.

524
00:32:59,300 --> 00:32:59,940
Bye.

525
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,820
Sure. Be safe.

526
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,660
How sudden.

527
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,460
Xin!

528
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,300
Oh my.

529
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,580
This is a hospital.
Keep your voice down.

530
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,580
Why are you hospitalized again?

531
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,740
How's your neck?

532
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,660
It's fine. It's just a minor injury.

533
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,940
I'm tough after all.

534
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,300
Stop joking.

535
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,100
What happened? Is it serious?

536
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,820
It's investigative journalism.

537
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,420
I caught them in the act,

538
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,020
and I almost got myself kidnapped.

539
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,260
Since I survived it,
that means I'm nothing but lucky.

540
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,220
Come on. What about your neck?

541
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,820
Can't you be more careful?

542
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,260
My poor heart can't take it.

543
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,020
You scare me to death all the time.

544
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,100
I knew you'd be scared.

545
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,715
That's why I didn't tell you about it.

546
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,020
But here you are.

547
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,420
Who told you?

548
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,660
Zong Qing.

549
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,260
I heard Captain Wu
rushed to the hospital

550
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,500
in a haste.

551
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,100
I was terrified.

552
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,820
How's your neck? Does it hurt?

553
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,500
I'm all good. Look.

554
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,860
I'm totally fine.

555
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,620
Alright.

556
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,780
You've seen me now. It's time to...

557
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,660
Why are you staring at me?

558
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,420
Didn't Zong Qing tell you Wu Si is here?

559
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,180
My boyfriend

560
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,420
is finally doing something sweet for me.

561
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,620
Read the room
and don't be a third wheel here.

562
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,540
Seriously, Tang Xin?

563
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,540
Are you abandoning me
over your boyfriend?

564
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,060
I was so worried about you.

565
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,580
I know you love me and care about me.

566
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,860
And I thank you for that.

567
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:43,980
You may leave now.

568
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,220
Are you kicking me out for real?

569
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,980
Seeing how lovestruck you look,

570
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,540
I must be a third wheel

571
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,826
ruining your hospital honeymoon.

572
00:34:53,848 --> 00:34:54,782
Exactly.

573
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,700
Go now.

574
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,660
He'll be back with food soon.

575
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,020
Young Lady Tang Xin is ready to dine.

576
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:06,660
Fine, two more minutes and I'm out.

577
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,220
Peel me some fruit?

578
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,100
Fruit?

579
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,460
Just enjoy your sweet moment.

580
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,140
I will.

581
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,420
Stay at this hotel for now.

582
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,700
Don't worry. We'll protect your safety.

583
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,420
Thank you, Sir.

584
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,300
But there's something

585
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,140
that still worries me.

586
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,300
Say,

587
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,500
Han Changzhou and Han Yutian

588
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,500
must know I've been rescued.

589
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,220
Well,

590
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,300
do you think they'll flee the country?

591
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,420
Rest assured. We know what to do.

592
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,460
Ms. Zhou.

593
00:35:58,715 --> 00:36:00,020
I came to get Mr. Han's signature.

594
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,100
Where is he?

595
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,100
Mr. Han went abroad.

596
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,060
Dad.

597
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,220
You really need to do something
about Han Yuhang.

598
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,820
You can't let him keep messing around.

599
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,500
I think you're the one messing around.

600
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,860
You saw in that man's email

601
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,420
that the police had opened a case.

602
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,315
And you still went after
that female reporter?

603
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,020
Now look what happened.

604
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,100
Both of them were rescued by the police.

605
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,804
How is that my fault?

606
00:36:28,826 --> 00:36:31,115
If he hadn't installed the camera
in the conference room

607
00:36:31,137 --> 00:36:32,460
and called the police,

608
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,980
none of this would've happened!

609
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,060
You've spoiled him.

610
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,220
How about sending him abroad?

611
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,820
Get him out of our way.

612
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,500
If he wants to cause trouble,

613
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,100
he'll do it anywhere.

614
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,580
Wouldn't he come back

615
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,820
if you sent him away?

616
00:36:54,493 --> 00:36:56,220
Are we going to let him stay here

617
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,580
and cause more chaos?

618
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,300
I think...

619
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,580
He just found out about our business.

620
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,500
Emotionally,

621
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,580
he probably can't accept it right away.

622
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,140
No matter what,

623
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:18,100
he's my son and your brother.

624
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,020
Dad.

625
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,420
I'm telling you.

626
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,580
If he keeps acting like this,

627
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,220
don't blame me

628
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,420
for disowning him.

629
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,300
Slowly. No rush.

630
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,940
Easy, easy.

631
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,300
Do you need a break?

632
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,420
It's okay.

633
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,940
Hold steady before stepping. Slowly.

634
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,820
I'm fine.

635
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,820
Look who's here.

636
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,460
Captain Chen.

637
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,540
It's been a while. How's your leg?

638
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,540
Pretty good. What brings you here?

639
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,900
I came to visit you.

640
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,420
Let me step down first.

641
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,420
Slowly.

642
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,540
Don't help her. Don't.

643
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,980
Why so fierce?

644
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,820
She's doing rehab. I'm not scolding you.

645
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,300
Alright, I'll practice on my own.

646
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,660
You two go chat elsewhere.

647
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,820
I really came to visit you.

648
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,460
Is that so?

649
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,020
Or are you using me as an excuse

650
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,620
to see someone else?

651
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,060
Of course I came to see you

652
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,180
and him.

653
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,500
Did you hear that?

654
00:38:56,982 --> 00:38:57,940
Get back to training.

655
00:39:07,426 --> 00:39:09,900
The doctor said you no longer
have to wear this all the time.

656
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,940
Do some rehab exercises occasionally.

657
00:39:14,093 --> 00:39:15,140
Thank you, Captain Wu.

658
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,660
Here's a heart for you.

659
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,060
Give me one.

660
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,460
Give you what?

661
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,460
A heart.

662
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,420
What are you doing?

663
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,660
They say the heart and the fist

664
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,540
are the same size.

665
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,980
That's not it.

666
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,620
Like this.

667
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,300
Like this.

668
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,140
Cheng Yuan.

669
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,140
Cheng Yuan.

670
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,620
Am I a bit too much of a third wheel?

671
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,560
- Yeah.
- Not at all.

672
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,940
I'll leave, then.

673
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,340
Do you know how to make a heart?

674
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,020
Him? A heart?

675
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,900
He's better at making a target.

676
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,420
Captain.

677
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,420
Here's a heart.

678
00:40:11,226 --> 00:40:12,226
Here's another one.

679
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,460
Here's a heart.

680
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,660
Here's another one.

681
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,820
You're trained, huh?

682
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,340
Wu Ke'er's always taking selfies.

683
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,820
I've seen enough to pick that up.

684
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,460
Look, Captain Wu,

685
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,820
you should learn from Cheng Yuan.

686
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,540
Cheng Yuan.

687
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,140
Here.

688
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:30,140
Take a few photos for us.

689
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:30,940
Yes, Sir.

690
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,500
Captain, how many do you want?

691
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,900
Well...

692
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,460
Just one set. One set of photos.

693
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:39,900
Got it.

694
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,340
Wait... Wait a second, Cheng Yuan!

695
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,660
- No...
- Three, two, one.

696
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,140
I'm not wearing makeup, Cheng Yuan!

697
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,020
Another one. Three, two, one.

698
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,300
No, stop it!

699
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,660
I'm not wearing makeup! Stop it.

700
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,140
- Can't you wait till I put some on?
- Three, two, one. Okay.

701
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,060
Can't you tell him to stop?

702
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:53,780
Close-up.

703
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,780
Captain, give me a firm, steely look.

704
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:58,300
- Three, two, one.
- You...

705
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,460
Wu Si!

706
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,420
What's that?

707
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,660
Is there really something in this world

708
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,460
that you can't aim at?

709
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,340
Impossible.

710
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,620
Who are you calling "something"?

711
00:41:20,582 --> 00:41:21,804
How about this, Captain?

712
00:41:22,426 --> 00:41:23,580
You hold Miss Tang in place.

713
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,020
I'll take a fixed-position shot.

714
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,460
No way.

715
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,300
This is a military hospital.

716
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,340
You can't do that here.

717
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,020
We know what to do. Come on.

718
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,940
Take a good one.

719
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,820
Three, two, one.

720
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:39,540
Tang Xin!

721
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,460
Tang Xin!

722
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:44,940
Tang Xin.

723
00:41:46,226 --> 00:41:47,248
Which room is it?

724
00:41:47,248 --> 00:41:48,160
Right here.

725
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,540
That's right.

726
00:41:51,204 --> 00:41:52,380
Where's that little monkey?

727
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,860
Where's that little monkey?

728
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,100
Keep your voice down.

729
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,020
Don't scare Xin away again.

730
00:41:59,020 --> 00:41:59,620
Well...

731
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,500
Where is she?

732
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,620
Answer me.

733
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,860
Ma'am is talking to you. Where is she?

734
00:42:18,515 --> 00:42:19,900
Wait, what do you mean by that?

735
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,620
Reporting in!

736
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,300
I just heard you mention the heart,

737
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,220
so I'll be giving you a heart.

738
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,020
What heart? I'm looking for Tang Xin!

739
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,700
That girl is unbelievable.

740
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,420
She's kept her hospitalization from us.

741
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,020
What a wild child she is.

742
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,700
