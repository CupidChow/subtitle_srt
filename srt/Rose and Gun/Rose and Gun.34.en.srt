18
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,800
Sir, enemy intel is basically clear.

19
00:01:52,093 --> 00:01:53,570
Come with me to report to command.

20
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,870
You guys,
take a break in the tents.

21
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:55,804
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

22
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,850
There are about thirty mercenaries
on the island.

23
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,050
This is the outpost.

24
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,130
Two men here.

25
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
The cave is here.

26
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:04,399
In the outpost and inside the cave,

27
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,737
there are at least six mercenaries.

28
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,290
There's also a four-man patrol
around the island,

29
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,293
rotating every two hours.

30
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,290
Are the remaining
twenty or so mercenaries

31
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,760
all inside the cave?

32
00:02:13,137 --> 00:02:15,404
The cave on the left
is the mercenaries' camp.

33
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:18,160
Many crates are inside,
likely holding cultural relics.

34
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,160
The cave on the right

35
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,600
is where Han Changzhou,
his son, and William live.

36
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,730
We don't know much
about the daytime activity.

37
00:02:23,737 --> 00:02:25,200
At night they have mercenary guards.

38
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,410
Based on our aerial footage,

39
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,920
mercenaries also come and go
during the day.

40
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,040
What's the general environment
of the island?

41
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,760
The deeper inland you go,
the denser the vegetation.

42
00:02:36,404 --> 00:02:38,370
It'd be very hard
to spot anyone hiding inside.

43
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,410
Captain Wu, based on
your Navy Special Operations Brigade's

44
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,570
combat experience,

45
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,160
would daytime or nighttime
be better for this mission?

46
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,530
I think it's daytime.

47
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,600
Deputy Commander Liu, your opinion?

48
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:51,970
Director Qu.

49
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,090
I agree with Captain Wu.

50
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,570
Through drone reconnaissance,

51
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,570
we found the island covered in jungle.

52
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:58,850
Although in daylight,

53
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,090
it's hard for us to spot

54
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,880
mercenaries coming out of the cave,

55
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,850
likewise,

56
00:03:02,871 --> 00:03:04,320
they also can't find us easily.

57
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,410
With equal concealment conditions,

58
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:07,880
we have the upper hand

59
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,600
because we came prepared.

60
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:10,570
Exactly.

61
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,920
Once we locate their outposts,

62
00:03:11,937 --> 00:03:13,130
we must suppress them covertly.

63
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,471
That way, we can reduce
the pressure of storming the caves.

64
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,160
Any other opinions?

65
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,410
I agree with you
and Deputy Commander Liu.

66
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,760
They agree
with the two captains' proposal.

67
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:23,760
Good.

68
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,040
Since we're all on the same page,

69
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,920
we'll move during the day.

70
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,410
All units, prepare in advance.

71
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,370
Our operation begins
at ten o'clock sharp.

72
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:33,582
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

73
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,130
Mr. Han.

74
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,690
I checked the boats and warehouses
you asked about,

75
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,130
and I didn't find anything unusual.

76
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,640
Alright. Thanks.

77
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,440
However,

78
00:03:44,048 --> 00:03:46,090
while the Finance Department
was moving a cabinet,

79
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,515
they found a hidden compartment.

80
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,410
A compartment?

81
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
We opened it

82
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,640
and found a bunch of relics inside.

83
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,370
They must've belonged
to the former chairman,

84
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,960
who didn't get a chance to take them.

85
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,410
Show them to me.

86
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,690
This was two months ago. Two months.

87
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,010
William.

88
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,430
Look at these guys. That's it.

89
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,050
Move! Move!

90
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,490
What are they doing?

91
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,610
Are they rotating shifts?

92
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,520
These guys aren't in good shape.

93
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,520
He's taking them to training

94
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,200
to make them stronger.

95
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,250
They haven't been doing well lately,

96
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,471
so Johnson's taking them out
for intensive training.

97
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:45,610
Yeah.

98
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,760
This rascal is unbelievable.

99
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,520
Police!

100
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,730
Run!

101
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,520
Oh my god!

102
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,050
Look at this guy.

103
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,010
You really know how to have fun.

104
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,280
Fine.

105
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,000
You all win.

106
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:38,960
Are you okay?

107
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,370
You're something.

108
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,570
You, as a father,

109
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,960
really know
how to have fun with your son.

110
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,930
Did you see him run?

111
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,520
He was like a bullet. Like a tiger.

112
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:07,440
Director.

113
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,080
SWAT has landed successfully.

114
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,930
We've sabotaged
the suspects' rubber boat.

115
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,490
After taking the outpost,
link up with Blue Blade.

116
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,250
Understood.

117
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,520
Captain, SWAT is in position.

118
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,570
Captain. Ready.

119
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,760
Copy that.

120
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,160
Move out.

121
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,770
Attack! Attack!

122
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:38,970
Follow me!

123
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,400
Go! Go!

124
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,690
Go! Go!

125
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:52,010
- No! Go! Go! Hurry!
- My money!

126
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,490
Come! Come! Go!

127
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,640
Go! Go!

128
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,880
Over there. Everyone, come.

129
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,980
Move! Move!

130
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,440
Boss, we're in position.

131
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,090
Yi Nanwang, cover us!

132
00:11:12,893 --> 00:11:14,210
Here's an order from Director Qu.

133
00:11:14,337 --> 00:11:16,640
Even after landing,
wait for the signal to proceed inland.

134
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,450
Let's rest up ahead for now.

135
00:11:18,737 --> 00:11:21,040
By the time the battle's over,
what's left for us to film?

136
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:23,289
There's nothing we can do about it.
Rules are rules.

137
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,619
We hope you can cooperate with us.

138
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,493
- Officer Chen, a quick word...
- Understood.

139
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
We follow orders.

140
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,450
Captain Zheng.

141
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,730
What's the situation?

142
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,071
Han Changzhou and his men
escaped through a hidden tunnel.

143
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:36,880
The command's drone

144
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,410
spotted them on the island's west side,

145
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,620
linking up with another group.

146
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,715
There are around eight
or nine mercenaries with them.

147
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,210
Boss, they'll be here very soon.

148
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,640
Stop them.

149
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,330
Okay.

150
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,250
Bunaya, go!

151
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,280
William.

152
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,130
We've only got a few men left here.

153
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,610
Can they protect us?

154
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,920
William, they're going
to protect us, right?

155
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,280
I guarantee you.
You'll leave the island.

156
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,450
He guarantees your safety.

157
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:12,760
Go.

158
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,730
Go! Go! Go!

159
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,610
Captain.

160
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,800
Target spotted at 2 o'clock.

161
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,610
They're moving southwest,

162
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,450
three hundred meters from us.

163
00:13:59,010 --> 00:13:59,920
Move out!

164
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,426
There's a firefight up ahead!

165
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,490
Let's rush out!

166
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,640
No, we're outnumbered.

167
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,370
We can't take that risk.

168
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,160
He says we can't risk it now

169
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,520

Why aren't Jia Nan
and the rest here yet?

188
00:16:23,537 --> 00:16:25,090
They're landing from another direction,

189
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,315
accompanied by other comrades.

190
00:16:26,382 --> 00:16:28,130
We'll regroup after the battle ends.

191
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,490
The battle is over.

192
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,582

enter the island to film.

193

on the island is complex.

Please ensure proper guidance.

195
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,280

196
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,330
Alright, let's move.

Xin.

198
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,800
Isn't that Marine Corps gear?

199
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,080
I think so.

200

There you are.

209

You saw the news?

210
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,800
I warned them long ago.

211
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,626
They just wouldn't listen.

These are flower cakes from Yunnan.

222
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,980
Yunnan?

223
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,660

224
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,740
tell that hiker friend
of yours named Cheng Yuan

225
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,980
to take a break.

226
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,426

228
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,500
He's my best friend.

I thought since Wu Si's mom is coming
for Chinese New Year for the first time,

246
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,660
everything should be spotless.

- Oh, no...
- What?

- I was cleaning your place.
- Don't go.

Wait! Come back!

257
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,200
And I forgot my gloves here.

258
00:20:56,204 --> 00:20:57,580
May I grab them?

259
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,580
Of course. Come.

260
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,140
Thank you.

261
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,004
Where did you put them?

262
00:21:01,004 --> 00:21:01,820
Right over here.

263
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,180
Here they are.

264
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,820
Sorry about that.

265
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,620

why you've been acting unusually.

269
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,100
You're something, huh?

270
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,180
Well, Tang...

271
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,620
Tang Xin suggested that idea.

272
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,620
And she just...

273
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,340
I told you it was a bad idea.

274
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,820
That it wasn't appropriate at all.

275
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,820
Look at you.

276
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,340
You're sweating so much.

277
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,380
No, I'm not.

278
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,540
No, I'm not.

279
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,300
What's it?

280
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,380

281
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,140
Well, I'm grateful to have you

282
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,980
spending the day with us.

283
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,180
I feel blessed

284
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,740
and delighted.

285
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,620
It's my day off today.

286
00:21:49,915 --> 00:21:51,893
Don't worry.
I'm definitely spending it with you.

287
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,380
I'll watch the sunrise
and sunset with you.

288
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,780
You promise?

289
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,315
If not, you'd turn into a puppy.

290
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,980
That would be impossible.

291
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,820
Alright, baby.

292
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,820
Let Mommy check your diaper.

293
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,540
Looks good.

294
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,820
Don't wake her yet.

295
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,340
Why are you staring at me?

296
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,300
Take it.

297
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,340
It's me.

298
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:31,860
Got it.

299
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,580
Go ahead.

300
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:46,020
Take good care of Mom and your sister.

301
00:23:05,315 --> 00:23:06,340
Mommy will play with you.

302
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,620
Daddy's off to work.

303
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,340
Captain Chen.

304
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,300
Back already?

305
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,471
Didn't you stop by home?

306
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,340
No.

307
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,180
That was the chance for me

308
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,380
to admire the beauty of our country.

309
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,580
Along the way,

310
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:34,100
I thought through

311
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,180
what I'd planned

312
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,420
and what I hadn't.

313
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,180
Back to Blue Blade?

314
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,860
They really miss you.

315
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,540
Especially Yi Nanwang.

316
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,380
I know.

317
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,550
Once I'm settled, I'll go see him.

318
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,420
What's your plan this time back?

319
00:23:49,515 --> 00:23:50,960
Are you still planning to leave?

320
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,340
I'm going

321
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,780
to start over

322
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,780
as a veteran.

323
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:11,820
Mr. Han.

324
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,540
Have a seat.

325
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,020
I asked you here today

326
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,820
because I need a favor.

327
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,540
A few days ago,
I found a hidden compartment

328
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,820
in the company finance room.

329
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,820
There were many cultural relics

330
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,180
and some documents inside.

331
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,620
I've taken pictures of all the relics.

332
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:48,180
Mr. Han, what are you trying to say?

333
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,420
I'd like you to turn in these relics

334
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,420
and those documents

335
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,140
to the relevant authorities.

336
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,340
I'd like to know

337
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,100
if there's any chance

338
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,620
of reducing their punishment

339
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,180
a little.

340
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:15,740
Mr. Han.

341
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,980
Regarding this,

342
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,180
I can go with you.

343
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,420
I think it would be better

344
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,740
if you handed these in yourself

345
00:25:23,804 --> 00:25:25,071
to the relevant authorities.

346
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,420
My presence there

347
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,740
might not be appropriate.

348
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,980
Besides...

349
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,260
Besides, I don't even know

350
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,980
what I'd say

351
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,100
at the police station.

352
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,340
Thus,

353
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,980
having thought it through,

354
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:48,980
I still decided

355
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,500
to ask for your help.

356
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,260
Not bad.

357
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,860
Seven-to-one elimination rate.

358
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,380
You're tougher than Cheng Yuan.

359
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,580
Brigadier, that is
a tri-service competition.

360
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,740
We only aim for first.

361
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,540
No rush for that.

362
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,780
Here's the latest.

363
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,860
A patrol mission is coming up soon.

364
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,860
Go back and wrap up the training prep.

365
00:26:27,448 --> 00:26:29,071
After that, get ready for the new task.

366
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:29,860
Yes, Sir.

367
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,020
What's the mission?

368
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:32,620
Sir.

369
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,500
Come in.

370
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:35,860
Captain?

371
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,540
Alright.

372
00:26:40,071 --> 00:26:41,620
Let's get down to business for now.

373
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,380
First, I'll announce

Take your seats first.

402
00:28:25,893 --> 00:28:26,980

Please sign here.

404
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,420
Okay.

405
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,180
Sergeant Cheng. Mrs. Cheng.

406
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:42,980
Mrs. Cheng.

407
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,500
Too soon for that.

408
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,420

You need to be there for my wedding.

Next, let's invite the parents to speak.

447
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,860
First of all, thank you all

448
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,740
for taking the time

449
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,260
to attend our children's wedding.

450
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,900
I'm Wu Si's mother.

451
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,660
People often say

452
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:35,500
raising a child
is one of the hardest things.

453
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,740
But to be honest,

454
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:40,380
Wu Si has never made me
feel it was hard.

455
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,540
He is the most beautiful gift

456
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,140
in my life.

457
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,380
Today,

458
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,300
I'm going

459
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,420
to hand over my most precious gift

460
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,660
to

461
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,140
my daughter-in-law.

462
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,580
Tang Xin.

463
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,300
From now on, Wu Si

464
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,100
belongs not only to this country,

465
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,500
but also to you.

466
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,300
And I'd like to express my gratitude.

467
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,100
Thank you

468
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,380
for choosing to be a soldier's wife.

469
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,300
Si.

470
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,140
You must be happy.

471
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,740
My name is Tang Yuanchao.

472
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,300
I'm a retired Navy veteran.

473
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,250
During my youth,
I was busy guarding the sea,

474
00:33:55,337 --> 00:33:56,980
and I didn't take care
of my family well.

475
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:01,040
I spent half of my life in barracks,
and half on the battlefield.

476
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,580
In the Navy unit,

477
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,540
I was just a brick.

478
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,420
Yet

479
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,180
Wu Si and his comrades are the wall.

480
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,700
A wall of iron and steel.

481
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,420
To give my daughter

482
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,100
to such a soldier,

483
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,100
I feel nothing but proud.

484
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,900
- Good!
- Great, well said!

485
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,420
My little princess.

486
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,580
Dad...

487
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,580
Tang Xin.

488
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,700
To me, you are

489
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,380
the greatest,

490
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,260
most beautiful medal

491
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,180
I've ever received.

492
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,260
I didn't take good care of you, but...

493
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,420
From now on...

494
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,580
Wu Si!

495
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,100
Please take good care of my daughter.

496
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,060
I'm done.

497
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,620
Bravo!

498
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,620
Bride and groom, please exchange vows.

499
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,060
Miss Tang.

500
00:35:27,204 --> 00:35:29,580
This is the second time
I've seen you in a wedding dress.

501
00:35:30,471 --> 00:35:31,700
And you're as beautiful as ever.

502
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,060
Thank you for marrying me.

503
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,460
Thank you.

504
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,020
Actually, during my hasty proposal,

505
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,060
I already said my vows to you.

506
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,540
My vows remain the same.

507
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,860
I've never changed my mind.

508
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,740
We've been together

509
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,460
for 661 days now.

510
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,780
These days,

511
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,580
I always feel

512
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,740
I love you more and more.

513
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,020
I'm a soldier.

514
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,260
I don't know how to be romantic.

515
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,500
I just want

516
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,660
to add one more line to my vows.

517
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,940
If there's another life,

518
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,780
I still want to spend it with you.

519
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,382
Please grant your permission.

520
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,580
Captain Wu.

521
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:35,380
First of all, congratulations

522
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,260
on successfully marrying

523
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:40,780
a woman who swore
she'd never marry a soldier.

524
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,700
And secondly, congratulations to myself

525
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:47,271
for doing what I swore I would never do

526
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,460
and proudly becoming a military wife!

527
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:55,700
Nice!

528
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,580
From Dayan Reef

529
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,740
to this wedding,

530
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,060
it's taken us two years.

531
00:37:09,782 --> 00:37:11,093
In the long river of life,

532
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,380
two years

533
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,220
is just a tiny mark on the timeline.

534
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,420
But from this day forward,

535
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,100
in the long years ahead,

536
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:27,020

sorrow, or happiness,

537
00:37:27,737 --> 00:37:29,060

538
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,540
or setbacks,

539
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,700
I will go through it all with you.

540
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,380
I will always love you,

541
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,020
be by your side,

542
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,700
and watch over you.

or away for the time being,

from now on,

546
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,337
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

547
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,540
