Start with a fire strike.

00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,382
It's expected to neutralize

destroy the enemy's

42
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,600

to the incident area?

dock landing ship.

You should go.

127
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,130
Hang in there.

129
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,250
go.

I'll go get the tools.

136
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:00,880
Wait for me.

140
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,920
Don't panic. Grab my hand.

141
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,737
Give me your hand.

Calm down.

145
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,130
Let's go.

146
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:03,850

- Are you okay, Mr. Han?
- Sit.

149
00:14:06,404 --> 00:14:07,204
Sit! It's dangerous.

150
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,226
Hold on. It's dangerous.

151
00:14:08,226 --> 00:14:09,115
Where's Xin?

152
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,130
Did she go looking for you?

153
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,880
Wasn't she with you?

154
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,130
She was, but...

155
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,970
She didn't come to find me.

has completed

161

All civilians in danger
have been rescued.

163
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,450
Please advise.

164
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,090
Good job, everyone.

165
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,520
Return your unit.

169
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:45,337
Yi Nanwang fired

170
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:46,850
before reaching the launch position,

171
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,090
which exposed the team.

172
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,210
How do you explain?

173
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:50,250
Brigadier,

174
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,010
Yi Nanwang was just transferred,

175
00:16:52,404 --> 00:16:54,115
and it's his first time joining a drill.

176
00:16:54,137 --> 00:16:55,560
That's why he isn't familiar

177
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,760
with the team cooperation yet.

178
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,210
It's not his fault.

179
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,280
I didn't train him well.

180
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,680
Blue Blade

181
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,450
is doing tri-domain operations.

182
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,250
Do you think Yi Nanwang

183
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,730
can carry out a mission like that
on his own?

184
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,210
Aside from marksmanship,

185
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,450
frogmen operations,

186
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,490
high-altitude parachuting,

187
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,560
or covert infiltration,

188
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,320
what can he actually handle?

189
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,970
This was his first drill,
and he made a mistake like that.

190
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,320
It shows he can't handle pressure.

191
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,080
Let's deal with this on the facts.

192
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,760
Do you think

193
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,280
he's qualified for Blue Blade?

194
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,320
Brigadier,

195
00:17:31,515 --> 00:17:33,170
Yi Nanwang has been on the reserve team

196
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,280
for a while.

197
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,690
It's true his training has weak points,

198
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,760
and he didn't do well in the drill,

199
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,730
but he does have
the ability and potential.

200
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,080
I want to keep him and train him well.

201
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,093
I'll surely bring him up to par.

202
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,210
You want to keep him?

203
00:17:53,693 --> 00:17:55,410
Do you have any idea
how much the country

204
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,970
invests in resources and effort

205
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:57,800
to build

206
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,650
a special ops team like Blue Blade?

207
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,690
Brigadier...

208
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:01,280
Enough.

209
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,450
Whether he stays or not,

210
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,004
the organization will make the decision.

211
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,450
Listen up,

212
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,360
if he doesn't pass the assessment,

213
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,010
no one can plead for him.

214
00:18:19,271 --> 00:18:20,460
(Minghua: Be A Journalist Who Cares)

215
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,360
You're back.

216
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,280
Hai.

217
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,690
How may I help you, Mr. Tian?

218
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,730
Where's Tang Xin?

219
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,490
Um...

220
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,690
Xin had a minor injury.

221
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:49,970
She's in the hospital now.

222
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:50,800
Is it serious?

223
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,250
Mr. Tian,

224
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,890
you didn't see the scene.

225
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,280
It was terrifying.

226
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:57,650
Luckily, Xin

227
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,040
had great luck.

228
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,730
That was close.

229
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,250
Xin.

230
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,520
You're awake?

231
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,170
You're awake.

232
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:13,800
Where...

233
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,970
Why am I in a hospital?

234
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,490
Oh, girl.

235
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,040
You're the one to talk.

236
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,320
Why did you try to play hero?

237
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,760
Why did you take the boat
and go out to sea?

238
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,010
It was dangerous.

239
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,250
Come.

240
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,040
Do you know?

241
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,210
If the navy squad hadn't arrived
in time,

242
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,600
you would be dead.

243
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,690
You know?

244
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,210
Are you okay?

245
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,890
Mom, where's the soldier who saved me?

246
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,890
Where is he?

247
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,626
He's returned to the army.

248
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,382
You think he'd stay here
to look after you?

249
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:01,500
When did he leave?

250
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,300
No, I have to find him.

251
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,820
What are you doing?

252
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,100
Put your shoes on.

253
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,980
You stood up too fast.

254
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,660
Low blood sugar.

255
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,060
You barely ate anything.

256
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,100
Well done, Tang Xin.

257
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,420
Of course.

258
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,820
Xin is the best.

259
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:21,980
She's brave.

260

Re-edit

261
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,140
this video.

262
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,420
Zoom in on the part where Tang Xin

263
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,820
saves the person.

264
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,300
Got it.

265
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,248
(Protect Our Motherland)
We have this short meeting

266
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,660
mainly to talk about

267
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,580
Yi Nanwang's performance in this drill.

268
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,340
First, I'll reflect on myself.

269
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,980
Yi Nanwang wasn't doing well
in the drill.

270
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,900
As the captain,

271
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,100
I take the responsibility.

272
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,580
Captain,

273
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,220
why are you blaming yourself

274
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,500
for his poor performance?

275
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,740
Captain's worried
about him passing the assessment.

276
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,020
It can't be.

277
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,020
Back in our time,

278
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,820
one failed drill didn't decide on that.

279
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,420
It isn't just about this drill.

280
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,260
Captain,

281
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,020
I didn't perform well, and that's true.

282
00:21:06,626 --> 00:21:08,540
I haven't done well
in regular training either.

283
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,700
This time,

284
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,020
it was my mistake

285
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,300
that exposed everyone.

286
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,500
I'm sorry.

287
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,020
Knowing your shortcomings
is also progress.

288
00:21:18,582 --> 00:21:19,900
Train harder when you get back.

289
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,260
Don't overthink it.

290
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,020
I'm only a backup member
temporarily transferred here.

291
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,093
If I don't pass,

292
00:21:27,115 --> 00:21:29,130
I'll just go back to my old unit
and keep training.

293
00:21:29,137 --> 00:21:29,780
One day,

294
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,020
I'll return to Blue Blade.

295
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,900
Why keep thinking about going back?

296
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,500
If you're training, do it here.

297
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,460
Blue Blade never fails
to train a soldier.

298
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,260
Exactly.

299
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:38,980
Cheng Yuan,

300
00:21:39,693 --> 00:21:41,820
does anyone in Blue Blade
ever fail an assessment?

301
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,780
Never.

302
00:21:42,893 --> 00:21:45,100
Hear that? If you're doing this,
pull it off in one go.

303
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,360
Don't give yourself a way out.

304
00:21:46,404 --> 00:21:47,026
Yes, Sir.

305
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,020
Louder.

306
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,780
Yes, Sir!

307
00:21:51,048 --> 00:21:52,020
Go back and train harder.

308
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,980
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

309
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,740
Excuse me.

310
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,500
May I ask

311
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,020
which ward is the injured
female reporter from Dayan Reef

312
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,460
staying in?

313
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,100
I'm from the Marines. I'm checking
on her on behalf of the unit.

314
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:06,780
Miss,

315
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,180
I paid for the bill.

316
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,100
Captain.

317
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,460
Wang Lang.

318
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,340
Good.

319
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,540
So good to see you.

320
00:22:13,626 --> 00:22:14,540
It's been a long while.

321
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,740
It really has.

322
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,100
My bad. I should've visited you.

323
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,820
Why are you running?

324
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,780
Wait.

325
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,500
Come back.

326
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,090
Oh, my.

327
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,060
- Go back.
- Dad.

328
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,260
- Go back.
- Dad.

329
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,300
Dad!

330
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,500
I have something urgent.

331
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,500
Don't stop me.

332
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,470
What's so urgent?
I don't care what it is.

333
00:22:33,471 --> 00:22:34,260
You don't...

334
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,020
Hello, Mrs. Tang.

335
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:35,980
Dad.

336
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,260
Xin,

337
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,740
don't you recognize me?

338
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,820
Hello, Mr. Wang.

339
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:40,780
Get inside.

340
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,340
- I heard about Xin's heroic story.
- I...

341
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,100
Well done.

342
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,100
Mr. Wang,

343
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,740
I didn't publish the fake news.

344
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,300
I was just about to go deal with it.

345
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,004
I tried to help but failed.

346
00:22:50,004 --> 00:22:52,071
The one who really saved people
was the Marines...

347
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,060
What heroic story?

348
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,980
Mr. Wang,

349
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,740
aren't you from the Marine Corps?

350
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,020
You must know who saved me,

351
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,740
right?

352
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,020
The military has rules.

353
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,580
I don't have the right
to disclose the information.

354
00:23:03,937 --> 00:23:04,740
What is all that?

355
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,500
I'll arrange an interview.

356
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,260
Is that okay?

357
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,820
You can apply,

358
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,300
but it needs to be approved.

359
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,780
Also, it depends
on the soldier's personal will.

360
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,780
If he doesn't agree,

361
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,900
I can't force it.

362
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,220
Wait. What did she do?

363
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,460
You've been talking,
and I can't even get a word in.

364
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,700
This.

365
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,500
It's too close.

366
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,340
- What's that? Hurry.
- I can't read it.

367
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,300
(Minghua News Female Editor
Played Heroine In Real Life)

368
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,260
You saved someone?

369
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,100
I failed. I told you I failed.

370
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,820
It was the Marine Corps who did it.

371
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,300
That's fine.

372
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,180
As expected of my daughter.

373
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,740
Now isn't the time to brag.

374
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,260
Let me see.

375
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,060
No, Dad.

376
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:45,740

00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,740
can you let go first?

378
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,671
It'll be too late
if I don't take the new down.

379
00:23:48,715 --> 00:23:50,780
Let go. You're hurting me.

380
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,500
Bye, Mr. Wang.

381
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,500
I should get going.

382
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,780
Be careful.

383
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,220
Bye, Mrs. Tang.

384
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,700
Slow down.

385
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,260
Captain,

386
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,020
is Xin all right?

387
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,340
My wife is taking care of her.
She's fine.

388
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,260
Besides,

389
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,060
it's late now.

390
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,020
There won't be anyone at the office.

391
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,580
She's going for nothing.

392
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,500
Was it your soldier
she was talking about?

393
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,780
Is he all right?

394
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,740
Did he get hurt?

395
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,580
Don't worry.

396
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,020
He's a tough soldier.

397
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,340
Xin's not bad either. She's brave.

398
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,220
She's kind-hearted

399
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,020
but reckless.

400
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,020
She's still young.

401
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,100
She'll grow mature
once she gets married.

402
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,780
Exactly.

403
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,580
This girl really needs to settle down.

404
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,900
She's all over the place all day.

405
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,582
She needs someone to keep her in check.

406
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,780
You have many good soldiers.

407
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,020
Any suitable one?

408
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,020
Captain,

409
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,100
I remember Xin said

410
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,540
she'd never marry a soldier.

411
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,500
She didn't really mean it.

412
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,740
I know my daughter well.

413
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,100
With her personality,

414
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,780
a soldier is exactly what she needs.

415
00:25:01,486 --> 00:25:02,900
You can try to set her up with one.

416
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,020
Captain, well...

417
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,260
Actually, there's someone.

418
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:13,980
Who?

419
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,020
You should get

420
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,820
a tetanus shot.

421
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,740
I already did. I'm fine.

422
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,310
What's wrong with
that female journalist?

423
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:25,626
We're the ones who saved that man,

424
00:25:25,648 --> 00:25:26,580
but she's making herself

425
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,300
look like a heroine in the news.

426
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,300
She was trying to help.

427
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,500
I'm annoyed because you got hurt.

428
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,260
Hey, shouldn't you control
your facial expression?

429
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,580
Look at that.
Look at those forehead wrinkles.

430
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,500
You look just like Brigadier Wang.

431
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:45,980
Zong Qing.

432
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,820
Yes, Sir.

433
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,220
Sir.

434
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,500
Repeat what you just said.

435
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,260
The brave heroine.

436
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,500
Who's got forehead wrinkles?

437
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,020
You're teasing me, huh?

438
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,740
You don't know

439
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,980
where those wrinkles come from?

440
00:26:01,982 --> 00:26:02,420
Report.

441
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,500
They were caused by us.

442
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,540
Glad that you knew.

443
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,100
Brigadier,

444
00:26:07,271 --> 00:26:08,780
have you checked on that journalist?

445
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,700
How's she?

446
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,100
She's fine. Already discharged.

447
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,580
Wu Si, what do you usually wear
when you go out?

448
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,020
Brigadier,

449
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,500
I only have a few sets of clothes.

450
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,026
Not sure which you're referring to.

451
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,020
Something that looks sharp.

452
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,300
Brigadier,

453
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,700
all his clothes look the same.

454
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,020
But different material.

455
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,260
Brigadier,

456
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,540
are we going on a business trip?

457
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,260
Something serious.

458
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,220
You're coming with me tomorrow at 6 PM.

459
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,780
To request leave.

460
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,700
Yes, Sir.

461
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,020
A blind date?

462
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,900
Why are you making such a fuss?

463
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,260
It's such an old-fashioned game.

464
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,820
How did you even come up with it?

465
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,100
Old-fashioned?

466
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,580
Your mom and I met on a blind date.

467
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,900
Exactly. How can you call it a game?

468
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,660
Don't be facetious.

469
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,660
Dad, Mom,

470
00:27:12,137 --> 00:27:14,271
if you're tired of me
eating your food at home,

471
00:27:14,293 --> 00:27:15,271
just say it directly.

472
00:27:15,293 --> 00:27:17,337
No need to kick me out
in such a roundabout way.

473
00:27:17,382 --> 00:27:19,660
I just had a narrow escape.

474
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,020
Cut it out.

475
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,260
I know too well

476
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,300
how strong you are.

477
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,100
Are you going or not?

478
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,460
Just give me a clear answer.

479
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,900
Of course not.

480
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,420
Two strangers

481
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,900
meeting for the first time

482
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,940
with the goal of dating and marriage,

483
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,900
and two matchmakers tagging along.

484
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,900
What could be sillier than that?

485
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,940
If you don't want to do something
that silly, fine.

486
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,980
Bring a guy home

487
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,100
and show us.

488
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,660
I'm not even in a rush.

489
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,700
Why are you two so anxious?

490
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,100
Why do you think?

491
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,580
You're a journalist,

492
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,420
always flying everywhere.

493
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,100
We're worried about you.

494
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,540
How can we not find someone
to look after you?

495
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,060
Right.

496
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,660
And how old are you now?

497
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,420
Well...

498
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,420
I'm not old, okay?

499
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,820
Besides, love is about

500
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,180
finding the right person.

501
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,940
You can't force two people
to be together.

502
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,460
By the time you find the right one,

503
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,060
we'll be in a nursing home.

504
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,940
Don't jinx yourself like that.

505
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,700
Stop being alone,

506
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,700
and just go on a blind date.

507
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,820
Follow orders.

508
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,700
Fine.

509
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,900
Well, then.

510
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,980
Since you two raised me this far,

511
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,293
tell me, how are we doing
with this blind date? With whom?

512
00:28:31,315 --> 00:28:33,260
What does he do? Is he in the military?

513
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,420
No need to fish something out of me.

514
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,180
He's more

515
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,500
than worthy of you.

516
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,500
If you really want me to date a soldier,

517
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,940
why don't you ask Mr. Wang Lang

518
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,740
to bring over the man
who saved me at the Dayan Reef?

519
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,780
Who knows...

520
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,137
You think this is grocery shopping?

521
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,460
Picking and choosing?

522
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,500
Be serious.

523
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,540
Hold steady.

524
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,580
If it drops,

525
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,740
hold it for two more hours.

526
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,420
Steady.

527
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,660
How's it?

528
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,540
He's practicing.

529
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,500
Mind the distance
of the sight alignment.

530
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,100
What's with that look? Got scolded?

531
00:29:27,337 --> 00:29:29,737
I want to sign up
for a combat competition for Yi Nanwang,

532
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,820
but all the spots are full.

533
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,820
Full? Give him mine.

534
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,060
Don't you want your score?

535
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,100
Then what?

536
00:29:40,826 --> 00:29:42,226
What about the training camp?

537
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,300
I don't think he can make it
to the training day.

538
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,460
Yangyang, wait for me.

539
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,740
Why are you walking so fast?

540
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,780
I saw you just now.

541
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,230
You were throwing up in the restroom.

542
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,500
What are you talking about?

543
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,900
I didn't throw up. Who said I did?

544
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,460
We've been classmates this long.

545
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,900
You think I don't know you?

546
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,420
We're having

547
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,460
a supraspinatus muscle dissections
this afternoon.

548
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,740
Well, I won't say anything more.

549
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,020
You've been throwing up
from regional anatomy

550
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,260
to complete anatomy,

551
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,780
then back to regional.

552
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,580
We're about to graduate,

553
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,580
and you still haven't made it through.

554
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,740
Honestly, I feel bad
for those cadavers.

555
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,300
I want milk tea.

556
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,020
How about coming to the milk tea shop
with me?

557
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,340
No. I have a class this afternoon.

558
00:30:47,071 --> 00:30:48,826
Let me show you a video
to cheer you up.

559
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:49,660
Here.

560
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,220
Watch this.

561
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,940
(Minghua News Female Editor
Played Heroine In Real Life)

562
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,900
Whoa!

563
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,420
Xin.

564
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,020
Not so loud.

565
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,540
(Minghua News)
Why were you out at sea?

566
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,740
You saw the news?

567
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,580
Not just me, the whole city saw it.

568
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,260
What happened?

569
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,500
The news said

570
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,500
you were pulled out of the sea.

571
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,980
Watch what you say.

572
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,460
Anyway, I'm relieved that you're fine.

573
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,060
Why did you go out there?

574
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,020
I got a tip.
It's a routine investigation.

575
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,420
But a fire broke out halfway.

576
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,820
Luckily, the Marine Corps
came to the rescue.

577
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,740
Came to the rescue?

578
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:37,780
Are you in love now?

579
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,540
Well, I'm hanging up.

580
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,460
Work on your thesis.

581
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,740
We'll talk at graduation.

582
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,300
Bye.

583
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,840
Our hero got disgraced so soon?

584
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,900
(Heroic Journalist)
Mr. Tian, did you approve the news?

585
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,940
I did. What's wrong?

586
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,660
Look.

587
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,404
Views, shares, and those comments.
It's on the trending search.

588
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,248
Whether it's trending or not,
it's a fake story without authorization.

589
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,100
Take it down.

590
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,260
How's that fake?

591
00:32:00,604 --> 00:32:01,693
You did save the man, right?

592
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,340
You did run into the flame, right?

593
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,060
Yes, but

594
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,660
I was also saved by someone else.

595
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,360
It's not like you didn't try to save.

596
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,700
Our report is true.

597
00:32:10,737 --> 00:32:12,740
How the public interprets
it is their own business.

The Planning Department
has the copy ready.

599
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,230
We'll start the big push soon.
Get ready to be a celebrity, Miss Tang.

600
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,540
You can't be serious, Mr. Tian.
You picked the wrong person.

601
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:22,220
You should be promoting the Marines.

602
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,660
They're the ones who saved the man.

603
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,980
I can't take that honor.

604
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,100
Tang Xin,

605
00:32:26,715 --> 00:32:28,180
you've been in this industry this long.

606
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,580
How are you still so clueless?

607
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,980
Military topics are sensitive.

608
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,020
Who can guarantee the timeliness?

609
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,300
Fine.

610
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,260
I will.

611
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,540
Leave it to me.

612
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,260
Mr. Han,

613
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,100
take this.

614
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,020
Don't worry, Mr. Han.

615
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,500
I won't leave you here alone.

616
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,980
I'll go get the tools.

617
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,540
Wait for me.

618
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,580
Yuhang.

619
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,500
I just heard

620
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,020
the ship caught fire.

621
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,180
Are you all right?

622
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,100
In one piece.

623
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:15,900
Have a seat.

624
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,180
I went for a checkup yesterday.

625
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,180
The doctor said I'm okay.

626
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,740
Just choked on some smoke.

627
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:26,660
That's a relief. I was scared to death.

628
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,540
You should've told me

629
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,493
you were heading out to sea to have fun.

630
00:33:33,515 --> 00:33:34,940
I could've lent you my yacht.

631
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,460
Why did you take a fishing boat?

632
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,100
It wasn't for fun this time.

633
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,300
I had something to do.

634
00:33:39,848 --> 00:33:40,900
You had something to do?

635
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,020
What business could you possibly have
at sea?

636
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,100
A friend of mine

637
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,300
heard that someone

638
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,540
had been illegally digging relics
from a sunken ship

639
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,020
near Dayan Reef.

640
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,540
She wanted to investigate

641
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,580
but didn't have a boat,

642
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,020
so she asked me for help.

643
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,020
It's just hearsay,

644
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,900
and you went out just like that?

645
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,060
Where did she hear it from?

646
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,500
Someone sent her

647
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,060
a bunch of leads by email.

648
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,620
They also hoped

649
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,060
our local media of Wenzhou

650
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,540
could look into this.

651
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,100
And my friend

652
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,020
is a journalist.

653
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,420
That's her job.

654
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:19,980
Tang Xin.

655
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,500
I'm reminding you,
as Director of Menghua News,

656
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,980
why didn't you submit the topic

657
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,940
and go out to sea and film
without approval?

658
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,620
You're not

659
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,540
an on-the-scene reporter anymore.

660
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,980
You're now the Editor
of the Media Convergence Center.

661
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,100
If you find a good topic,

662
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,940
you should let me know first.

663
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,580
It wasn't even confirmed yet.

664
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,660
If I didn't find anything,

665
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,460
wouldn't that be lying to you?

666
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:47,460
Yes, I'll definitely report to you
if I do find something.

667
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,940
And then I hope you will support me.

668
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,100
Then support me first.

669
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,820
Don't take the report down yet.

670
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,820
If it goes viral,
it'll be a good opportunity.

671
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,020
If you don't take it down,

672
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,060
I'll have to report the truth
in my own way.

673
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,580
Fine, fine.

674
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,060
I'll take it down.

675
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,220
Captain.

676
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,500
Brigadier Wang.

677
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,471
It's been a long time.

678
00:35:13,471 --> 00:35:14,620
Yeah, a really long while.

679
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,420
Let me introduce you.

680
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,940
This is Wu Si.

681
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,860
Captain of Blue Blade Special Ops Team
in the Marine Corps.

682
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,020
He's the best soldier I've ever trained.

683
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,300
Nice to meet you, I'm Tang Yuanchao.

684
00:35:25,426 --> 00:35:26,893
Nice to meet you, too, Captain Tang.

685
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,140
Have a seat.

686
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,660
Just sit when you're asked to.

687
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,020
Yes, Sir.

688
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,580
Mrs. Tang isn't here?

689
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:34,980
Well,

690
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,020
she's not coming.

691
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,420
She was worried

692
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,580
I'd get into a fight

693
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,500
with my daughter again,

694
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,580
so she ran off.

695
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:42,980
Please sit.

696
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,540
Pretty good.

697
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,460
How are you doing?

698
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,820
I'm good.

699
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,500
You've spent half your life
on a warship,

700
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,700
and now you've transferred out.

701
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,140
Your wife must be happy.

702
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,700
Happy?

703
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,380
I was always away back then,

704
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,660
and now I'm always home
after the transfer,

705
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,100
but she tells me to go out.

706
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,460
Well, you see.

707
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,220
How about you?

708
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,500
Have you brought Lin Lan back yet?

709
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,340
Not yet.

710
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,500
It's fine. Both of you are still young.

711
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:18,860
Right.

712
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,060
You have time.

713
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,020
Enough about me.

714
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,580
Where's Xin?

715
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:24,940
She's coming.

716
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,540
She's been very busy these days.

717
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,020
Well, you sit here. I'll make a call.

718
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,380
Sit.

719
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,140
Relax.

720
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,100
Brigadier,

721
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,500
what's going on?

722
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,220
I'm setting you up with someone.

723
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,900
Captain Tang's daughter.

724
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,420
This is too sudden.

725
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,500
What?

726
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,140
I told you earlier

727
00:37:04,248 --> 00:37:06,220
so you'd have time to think about
how to dodge it?

728
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,100
But...

729
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:07,980
No buts.

730
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,100
Sit.

731
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,500
(Tang)

732
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,980
Mr. Tang, why are you rushing me?

733
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,100
I'm almost there.

734
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,020
I didn't forget the blind date.
Don't worry.

735
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,020
You're so cooperative.

736
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,660
Something's wrong with you.

737
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,620
I'm just actively responding

738
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,420
to your call, right?

739
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,300
Well, see you later. Don't rush me.

740
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,900
Okay. Don't hang up.

741
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,420
She's in the parking lot. Coming up now.

742
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,900
Listen,

743
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,420
Mr. Wang brought him here.

744
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,940
Here. Hang on.

745
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:51,700
Say hi to her.

746
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,540
Say hi.

747
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,380
Hi, Mr. Wang.

748
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,900
You're already there?

749
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,980
This place is so hard to find.

750
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,820
I circled around three times
and still couldn't get a parking spot.

751
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,420
Say something.

752
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,980
You...

753
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,580
Your destination, Momo Coffee Shop,

754
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,500
is 200 meters ahead.

755
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,860
All right, Mr. Wang, I'll go park first.

756
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,580
I'm hanging up.

757
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,382
You all go ahead and eat.
Don't wait for me.

758
00:38:20,404 --> 00:38:20,937
(Tang)

759
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,860
Come on.

760
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,580
Hello,

761
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,020
I'm Wu Si.

762
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,660
See you later.

763
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,900
Good. That's good.

764
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,020
Easy, easy. Sit.

765
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,060
Hello?

766
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,900
Your hand's hurt?

767
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,580
I'm Wang Lang.

768
00:38:47,737 --> 00:38:49,050
It's nothing. Just a small injury.

769
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,500
Is the bone all right?

770
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,448
- It's fine.
- Got it.

771
00:38:51,471 --> 00:38:51,980
Good.

772
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,420
Captain, I'm sorry.

773
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,500
I just received a call.

774
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,820
I have to report back early.

775
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,060
Go on.

776
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,580
Leave this person...

777
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,140
No.

778
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,300
Leave Wu Si here

779
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,980
for me.

780
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,540
Okay. I'll head off then.

781
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,300
Go on.

782
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,500
I'll walk him out.

783
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,340
Go ahead.

784
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,060
Go back.

785
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,860
Brigadier, since I'm already here,

786
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,300
I won't back out.

787
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,540
I just want to see you off.

788
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,500
Button this.

789
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,820
Brigadier,

790
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,540
I left it undone on purpose.

791
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,700
Zong Qing taught you this?

792
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,380
I put a lot of good words
for you this time.

793
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,460
Show some spirit.

794
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,540
When she arrives,

795
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,460
take the initiative.

796
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:43,940
Yes, Sir.

797
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,060
I'll report back to you once I return.

798
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,860
Have some water.

799
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,620
Did she spark all the way to Hainan?

800
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,540
Hello, Dad?

801
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,300
Xin,

802
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,860
are you parking or building a car?

803
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,780
What took you so long to come upstairs?

804
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,420
What? I'm already up here.

805
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,860
I'm meeting the guy.

806
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,300
What?

807
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,500
Hold on.

808
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,780
I didn't see you.

809
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,580
You...

810
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,900
Who are you meeting?

811
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,500
Isn't this the guy you set me up with?

812
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:44,980
You know what?

813
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:47,540
Dad, you have really good taste.

814
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,180
Maybe it'll really work out.

815
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,700
What do you mean?

816
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,940
The guy is sitting here.

817
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,826
Who do you think
is going to work out with you?

818
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,500
I met the wrong person?

819
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,020
Oh, that's funny.

820
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,540
This guy seems nice too.

821
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:05,980
Xin.

822
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,180
I see, you're pulling a trick on me.

823
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,020
I don't care where you are right now.

824
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,804
Get over here this instant.
You hear me?

825
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,220
I can't come now.

826
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,300
Maybe

827
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,500
this is my Mr. Right.

828
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,860
Well, I'll keep chatting with him.

829
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,500
We'll talk when I'm home. Bye.

830
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,380
