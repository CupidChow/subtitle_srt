(This isn't a drill.)

25
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,780
(Happy birthday, my dear)

26
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,900
Captain,

27
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,540
you're really

28
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,820
an exceptional genius.

29
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,220
You really get me.

30
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,340
Do you think

31
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,900
Tang Xin has seen it yet?

32
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,220
My respected captain,

33
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,100
if you don't tag her,

34
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,780
she won't be able to see it.

35
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:54,820
Captain,

36
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,500
maybe delete it?

37
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,540
It's been up for a while.

38
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,620
Deleting it now won't help.

39
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,660
She's already seen it.

40
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,180
Captain,

41
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,620
will you tell me what you were thinking?

42
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,060
Zong Qing taught me.

43
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,500
I taught you this?

44
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,582
I told you to make
the relationship public,

45
00:03:08,582 --> 00:03:09,940
not a public execution.

46
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,700
What did you post her passport photo?

47
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,940
Trying to get her a job, huh?

48
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,660
This isn't a relationship announcement.

49
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,220
It's a wanted notice.

50
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,500
Yeah.

51
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,780
If you add a caption,

52
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,271
it'll make it Level-One Kill Order.

53
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,820
So what now?

54
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,380
You answer it.

55
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,100
No, don't give it to me.

56
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,340
Why are you giving it to me?

57
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,500
Take it.

58
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:46,900
Answer it.

59
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,340
Captain, should I answer it or not?

60
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,180
Don't panic.

61
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,660
I've prepared for this.

62
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,660
Put her on speaker.

63
00:04:00,804 --> 00:04:03,293
If anything goes wrong,
I'll blow the assembly whistle, okay?

64
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,782
Yes, that's right.

65
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:09,660
Let's do this.

66
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,780
(Tang Xin)

67
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,660
Captain Wu,

68
00:04:12,982 --> 00:04:13,820
are you free now?

69
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,900
Can you talk?

70
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,100
Yeah, sure.

71
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,340
Nothing much.

72
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,700
I sent you a parcel.

73
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,700
Make sure you check it later.

74
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,460
Good night.

75
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,420
(Tang Xin. Call ended)

76
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,020
Nothing happened.

77
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,380
Nothing happened.

78
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,100
She sent me something. That's all.

79
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,700
- Nice.
- She likes that.

80
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,404
Nothing happened.

81
00:04:45,448 --> 00:04:46,900
You live up to your name as a genius.

82
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,340
You've got charm.

83
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,820
Miss Tang is so kind.

84
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,137
You can tell Miss Tang values him.

85
00:04:51,137 --> 00:04:52,690
Don't worry. She likes the honest type.

86
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:53,260
Right?

87
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,560
Miss Tang really cherishes you.

88
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,020
Pretty good. I was so anxious just now.

89
00:04:56,026 --> 00:04:56,700
Good.

90
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,100
(To Wu Si. Wu Si, an iron-blooded man.)

91
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:01,380
(Thanks for making it official.
From your girlfriend.)

92
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,460
Full concentration.

93
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,380
Raise the whip.

94
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,780
Charge forward.

95
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,260
Everyone must deliver results.

96
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,580
Keep up the strong performance.

97
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,100
Hit the baseline KPIs.

98
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,580
Very well.

99
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,260
Go.

100
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,820
Let's go!

101
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,871
Back to your position.

102
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,100
Ladies,

103
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,100
would you like to try

104
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,500
our latest Little Purple Bottle,

105
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,893
the Niacinamide Whitening Essence?

106
00:05:43,915 --> 00:05:44,940
What brand is it?

107
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,700
Meiduo.

108
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,871
It's an international
premium cosmeceutical product.

109
00:05:47,937 --> 00:05:50,580
Meiduo? That cheap brand
pretending to be a foreign product?

110
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,500
Didn't your niacinamide formula

111
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,340
cause skin issues?

112
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,140
No.

113
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,700
Our products

114
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,580
are certified with
national cosmetic licenses.

115
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,560
The reaction you're talking about

116
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,580
is because our essence formula
is so effective

117
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,260
that it draws out toxins from your skin.

118
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,020
Enough said.

119
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,700
You think people will still
fall for that?

120
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,460
At least watch King Lan's videos

121
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,940
and learn some proper jargon.

122
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,260
You watch King Lan, too?

123
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:12,580
Yes.

124
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,340
I'm obsessed with her lately.

125
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,260
Me too.

126
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,020
Her videos are all solid info.

127
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,260
Did you see that video?

128
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,580
Hold on. I'll pull it up.

129
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,660
Miss Xu,

130
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,820
with King Lan around,

131
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,100
forget hitting KPI,

132
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,260
we'll be lucky to keep our jobs.

133
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,580
Focus on your work.

134
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,340
The company will handle the rest.

135
00:06:30,582 --> 00:06:31,560
Back to your work.

136
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,020
Why did you set up your own son-in-law
like this?

137
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,700
When has Xin ever liked

138
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,260
going to military museums?

139
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,340
You don't understand.

140
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,020
I specifically asked Lin Lan
to get those tickets.

141
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,340
It's the Navy's 70th anniversary
exhibition.

142
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,140
It's just an exhibition.

143
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,900
What's the big deal?

144
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,260
It's not just an exhibition.

145
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,660
You know that.

146
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,140
I've spent most of my life
serving in the Navy,

147
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,140
and I've never once regretted it.

148
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,020
The only regret I have
is not being there enough for you two.

149
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,700
Xin is a soldier's daughter.

150
00:07:21,871 --> 00:07:23,826
She has to understand
what it means to be one.

151
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,900
If she wants a future with Wu Si,

152
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,580
she has to come to terms with this.

153
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,140
She's a soldier's daughter.

154
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,226
Of course,
she knows what it means to be one.

155
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,340
The reason she was against

156
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,220
the blind date

157
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,700
wasn't because she didn't like Wu Si.

158
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,140
It's because he's a soldier like me.

159
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,460
Back when I was still in the army,

160
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,340
you had to hold everything together

161
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,220
at home on your own.

162
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,900
I wasn't there
when you two needed me most.

163
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,020
That's why

164
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,900
Xin doesn't feel secure

165
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,140
about marrying a soldier.

166
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,020
It's not the profession she resists.

167
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,340
It's the childhood

168
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,340
she feels

169
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,900
was incomplete.

170
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,460
That's on me. I know.

171
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,340
Why are you bringing this up now?

172
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,020
We've never blamed you.

173
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,140
I don't want our daughter

174
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,100
carrying this concern into her marriage.

175
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,340
Wu Si is the only one

176
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,580
who can help her let it go.

177
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,340
I admit I had my reasons

178
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,740
for sending them to the Navy Museum.

179
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,340
Don't laugh.

180
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,620
I really want her to see

181
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,580
what we had done back then.

182
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,620
I want Xin to understand

183
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,940
the weight that comes with
being a soldier.

184
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,460
Only then can she truly accept
this relationship.

185
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,740
I know I'm being selfish.

186
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,300
This warship

187
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,300
looks like the one
my dad used to serve on.

188
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,820
Captain Wu, aren't you going to give me
an introduction?

189
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,620
Sure.

190
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,100
Jinan,

191
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,540
hull number 105.

192
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:45,300
It's the first domestically developed

193
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,300
Type 051 Destroyer.

194
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,420
Built in 1968,

195
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,540
commissioned in 1971,

196
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,620
and retired in 2007.

197
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,820
There have been three warships

198
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,820
in our navy named Jinan.

199
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,060
This is the second.

200
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,460
It carried out major missions

201
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,540
like Pacific voyages

202
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,700
and patrols in the Spratly Islands.

203
00:10:01,737 --> 00:10:03,540
Captain Tang had probably been
on this warship

204
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,940
while guarding the island.

205
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,700
This is the famous line.

206
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,820
"We must build

207
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,300
a powerful navy
with modern combat capability."

208
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,820
It was written for this ship.

209
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,540
Impressive.

210
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,300
This is a decorated warship.

211
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,620
Those three Jinan warships

212
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,820
also symbolize the rise
of the Chinese Navy.

213
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,100
From its founding at Baima Temple
in 1949

214
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,300
to today's modern fleet,

215
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,820
H-6Ks, carrier battle group,
and nuclear-powered submarines,

216
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,100
China's Navy

217
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
has advanced by leaps and bounds

218
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,220
in both size and capability.

219
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,580
With over 18,000 kilometers
of coastline

220
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,620
and 300 million square kilometers
of territorial waters,

221
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,420
no one can trample on us anymore.

222
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,420
Seventy years

223
00:10:56,937 --> 00:10:58,180
and generations of dedication,

224
00:10:58,804 --> 00:11:00,937
that's what built the Chinese Navy
we see today.

225
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,580
When we joined the army,
we swore an oath.

226
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,300
We are the maritime force
of the people.

227
00:11:09,826 --> 00:11:12,100
We will forever defend
this flag and this title of honor

228
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,340
as we would defend the dignity
of our nation.

229
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,620
That oath

230
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,940
isn't just for the flag,

231
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,220
it's also for the warships.

232
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:32,940
Later,

233
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,580
we must catch King Lan.

234
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,540
She has to clear our company's name.
Got it?

235
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,420
- Yes.
- Yes.

236
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,420
Come on. Hurry.

237
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,540
Who are you?

238
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,820
Are you King Lan?

239
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,420
Yes, I am. Why?

240
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,540
We're from Meiduo.

241
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,100
We want you

242
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,300
to clear our company's name.

243
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,060
Why did you smear

244
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,420
our products on the internet?

245
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,100
Right? She discredited our product
on the internet, didn't she?

246
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,940
Yeah.

247
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,300
Discredit? Everything I said was true.

248
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,580
Your company is selling

249
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,540
outdated formulas

250
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,419
at outrageous prices.

251
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,580
Why shouldn't I call that out?

252
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,300
How's our formula outdated?

253
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,060
Our products are legitimate.

254
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,620
You're being unreasonable.

255
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,100
King Lan,

256
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,940
we're just employees.

257
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,820
It's not easy for us
to feed our families.

258
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,860
We all have struggles.

259
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,940
Look at them.

260
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,220
Not easy?

261
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,620
And what about the people

262
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,860
who used your products?

263
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,540
They're suffering from
scarring and disfigurement. You know?

264
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,100
How can they blame our products
for that?

265
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,604
You can't say it was definitely
our product that caused it.

266
00:12:35,604 --> 00:12:36,860
Can you prove it?

267
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,060
I'm done talking to you.

268
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,448
- You can't leave.
- Come back.

269
00:12:40,471 --> 00:12:42,004
Clear our company's name and apologize.

270
00:12:42,004 --> 00:12:42,820
If not, compensate us.

271
00:12:42,826 --> 00:12:43,700
Compensate?

272
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,700
You're not going anywhere.
You must clear our company's name.

273
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,820
Or compensate us

274
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,100
and apologize.

275
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,515
Either apologize or pay for damages.

276
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,220
You're finally back.

277
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,248
- What has happened?
- They're ganging up on me.

278
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,100
Who is he?

279
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:56,940
My husband.

280
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,700
What does he do?

281
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,060
He's in the military. Why?

282
00:13:00,204 --> 00:13:01,740
- See? Military?
- What's wrong?

283
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,060
Since you're a soldier,

284
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,420
you should stand up for us.

285
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:04,700
Right.

286
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,426
Tell your wife to apologize

287
00:13:06,426 --> 00:13:07,820
and clear our company's name.

288
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,060
Stop smearing Meiduo's products.

289
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,340
I'm not apologizing.

290
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,420
You have to.

291
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,940
Clear our company's name. Come back.

292
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,300
Let go!

293
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,271
Clear our company's name.

294
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:15,330
- Let go!
- Apologize to us.

295
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:16,160
If not, compensate us.

296
00:13:16,182 --> 00:13:17,180
Let go of my wife.

297
00:13:19,068 --> 00:13:19,948
Here, Wu Si.

298
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,382
- Eat it while it's hot.
- Come.

299
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,420
One more piece.

300
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,580
Dad.

301
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,700
Aren't you going to serve me anything?

302
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,700
Serve you what?

303
00:13:28,826 --> 00:13:30,580
Serve you ungrateful child
with pork ribs?

304
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,580
If you like ribs, have more.

305
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,460
See?

306
00:13:37,604 --> 00:13:39,100
They all end up in my bowl anyway.

307
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,220
Wu Si,

308
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,340
you can't spoil Xin.

309
00:13:44,248 --> 00:13:44,980
Hurry and eat up.

310
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,340
Not at all.

311
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,100
That's enough.

312
00:13:52,893 --> 00:13:55,093
Go ahead and answer it.
Don't let it hold things up.

313
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,340
You have one too.

314
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:02,740
Hello?

315
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,220
I'm Wu Si.

316
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,940
(Chinese People's Liberation Army)

317
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,300
When did you get back?

318
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,460
Captain, I have something to report.

319
00:14:19,648 --> 00:14:20,379
Apologize.

320
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,700
- Let go of my wife.
- Clear our company's name.

321
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,820
Who posted this video?

322
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,060
It started from Weibo and Moments.

323
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,700
But it's hard

324
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,940
to trace the source.

325
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,860
This video is shaky.
They're using this as evidence?

326
00:14:34,937 --> 00:14:37,060
Were there any witnesses
who saw him push the woman?

327
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,060
People just

328
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,060
love the drama.

329
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,537
No one sees this news as evidence.

330
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,700
How bad is the impact?

331
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,220
It didn't spread widely.

332
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,420
But some trolls

333
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,220
have tagged official accounts.

334
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,060
Still no response from them yet.

335
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,220
Keep an eye on the public sentiment.

336
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,620
Also, dig up

337
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,180
the news of Zong Qing rescuing people.

338
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,580
Repost it through other channels.

339
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,540
Understood.

340
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,420
Dad,

341
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,300
Zong Qing was trying to protect me.

342
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,580
I swear he didn't push that woman.

343
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,460
Yangyang,

344
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,300
saying it to me doesn't help.

345
00:15:16,604 --> 00:15:18,340
Once there are complaints
from the public,

346
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,940
the military has to investigate.

347
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,340
This is the rule.

348
00:15:21,426 --> 00:15:22,493
There's nothing more to say.

349
00:15:22,582 --> 00:15:24,580
But Zong Qing didn't do anything wrong.

350
00:15:24,604 --> 00:15:26,271
The army shouldn't wrong a good soldier

351
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,960
just because of
some baseless accusation.

352
00:15:27,982 --> 00:15:28,560
Lang Yangyang,

353
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,460
watch your words.

354
00:15:30,737 --> 00:15:32,300
Until the matter is fully investigated,

355
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,820
you have no right to accuse anyone.

356
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,300
And as a soldier, he should
be held to higher standards

357
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,340
and must accept oversight
from all aspects.

358
00:15:39,537 --> 00:15:42,070
If he's innocent, there's no need
to worry. What are you afraid of?

359
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:43,960
They're clearly trying to frame him.

360
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,710
If Zong Qing gets punished
because of this,

361
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,200
are you going to
do nothing about it?

362
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,340
I can't and I won't interfere.

363
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,860
As a soldier,
he should be aware of this.

364
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,737
He has to cooperate
with the investigation.

365
00:15:54,782 --> 00:15:56,940
And that's the end of this conversation.

366
00:15:59,300 --> 00:15:59,940
Dad.

367
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,580
Eat some more.

368
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,340
I'm full.

369
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,820
Yangyang,

370
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,220
give it a rest.

371
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,340
Your dad can't interfere.

372
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,060
You have to sort this out yourself.

373
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,420
How am I supposed to do?

374
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,700
Whether it's a misunderstanding

375
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,940
or a false accusation,

376
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,580
you have to find your own way

377
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,620
to communicate with them
and solve the conflicts.

378
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,860
Were you acting
all high and mighty before?

379
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,460
What now?

380
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,740
What's with all of these?

381
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,220
Just say what you want to say.

382
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,820
I overreacted before

383
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,220
and spoke to you harshly.

384
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,340
I'm sorry about that.

385
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,100
What good is "sorry"?

386
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,540
She's lying in the hospital now.

387
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,220
Yes, this started because of me.

388
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,340
I take responsibility.

389
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,300
But my husband has nothing
to do with this.

390
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,860
I hope you won't drag him into this.

391
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,580
What do you mean,
"nothing to do with him"?

392
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,580
Is it not a crime
for a soldier to assault a civilian?

393
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,380
But my husband never even touched her.

394
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,260
Look what you just said.

395
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,820
Never even touched me?
Then why am I lying here?

396
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,020
Am I crazy

397
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,260
that I just tripped and fell
for no reason?

398
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,780
Did you see the medical report?

399
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,780
Lumbar spine fracture.

400
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,020
Exactly. How could you say that?

401
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,500
All of the staff saw

402
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,500
your husband

403
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,982
shove our store manager to the ground.

404
00:17:27,048 --> 00:17:28,500
Everyone witnessed it.

405
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,100
We've got video, too.

406
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,300
The army

407
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,100
isn't blind, is it?

408
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,980
I'm willing to cover

409
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,780
all your medical bills, nutrition,

410
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,860
and lost wages.

411
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,500
But please withdraw the complaint.

412
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,020
No way. You think just
some compensation is enough?

413
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,100
You dragged us
through the mud online before.

414
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,780
What do you want?

415
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,180
Five hundred thousand

416
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,260
for monetary damages.

417
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,100
Not a dime less.

418
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,380
And a public apology online

419
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,100
to clear Meiduo's name.

420
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,780
My reviews are all factual.

421
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,980
Why should I apologize?

422
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,260
If you don't,

423
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,780
your husband will have to suffer.

424
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,340
I wonder
how the military handles an officer

425
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,380
accused of assault.

426
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,820
He didn't assault anyone.

427
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,340
I'm not apologizing,

428
00:18:23,404 --> 00:18:25,515
and I'm not giving in
to your blackmail either.

429
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,500
Young lady,

430
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,340
take my advice.

431
00:18:32,471 --> 00:18:34,340
You don't want to ruin
your husband's career

432
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,820
over your little pride.

433
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,260
Think about it.

434
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,780
If an officer gets reported
and investigated,

435
00:18:42,026 --> 00:18:43,340
what future would he still have?

436
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,740
Getting punished
over something so trivial,

437
00:18:47,071 --> 00:18:48,100
it's just not worth it.

438
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,620
All right.

439
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,860
I'll delete my account

440
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,820
and quit live-streaming.

441
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,100
But I'm asking you

442
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,740
to withdraw the complaint.

443
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,620
Whether you stream or not

444
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,980
means nothing to me.

445
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,780
Our demand is clear.

446
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,100
Compensation

447
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,020
and a public apology.

448
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,100
That's non-negotiable.

449
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,100
I have trust in the military.

450
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,100
They wouldn't wrong a good soldier

451
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,620
over a false accusation.

452
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,100
He did nothing wrong.

453
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,860
As for the truth,

454
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,860
I believe
they'll get to the bottom of it.

455
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,100
So I won't accept your terms.

456
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:43,860
Still acting tough?

457
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,380
Fine.

458
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,100
See you in court.

459
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,580
See you in court.

460
00:19:55,715 --> 00:19:57,020
No way we're accepting the terms.

461
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,100
This is blackmail.

462
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,850
I know.

463
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,340
But they're insisting it was you
who pushed her,

464
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,540
and they won't withdraw the complaint.

465
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,020
We can never compromise.

466
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,540
Otherwise, I'd be a disgrace
as a soldier.

467
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,580
I'm sorry, Honey.

468
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,500
I've dragged you into the mess.

469
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,860
Honey,

470
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,780
my conscience is clear. Believe me.

471
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,100
Zong Qing,

472
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,404
I now announce the decision
of Brigade Safe and Security Department.

473
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,860
We received a public report

474
00:20:30,915 --> 00:20:33,340
alleging that Captain Zong Qing
of Blue Blade Special Ops Team

475
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,780
was involved in a conflict
with a civilian during your leave,

476
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,300
resulting in a woman being hospitalized.

477
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,537
The Safety and Security Department
has decided

478
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,860
to open an investigation

479
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,780
into the personnel involved
from your unit.

480
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,340
You're back. How did it go?

481
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,260
Just like you said,
I tried talking to them.

482
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,340
But all I got was blackmail.

483
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,620
I told you
they were trying to extort you.

484
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:12,671
Being polite won't work
on people like them.

485
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,260
I've got this. I'll handle it.

486
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,580
Don't worry, Mr. Lan.

487
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,300
I'll follow the law.

488
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,780
Everything will be resolved
fairly, reasonably, and legally.

489
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,020
Don't worry. I'll bring you good news.

490
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,300
Mr. Lan, Ms. Wang, I'm off.

491
00:21:33,337 --> 00:21:34,337
All right. Take care.

492
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,620
Dad,

493
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,020
Zong Qing is now under investigation.

494
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,740
I want to ask...

495
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,980
I'm not involved in it.

496
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,020
I don't know anything.
There's no point asking me.

497
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,580
That's not what I meant.

498
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,900
I'm asking

499
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,060
what kind of impact

500
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,660
this investigation

501
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,780
would have on Zong Qing?

502
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,180
The military wouldn't wrong
a good soldier.

503
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,580
The truth will come out.

504
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,900
If he's innocent,

505
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,540
it won't affect him.

506
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,740
But if he's responsible,

507
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,980
then there's no argument.

508
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,540
I've said it many times.

509
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,060
He didn't do it.

510
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,760
Whether he did or didn't
doesn't matter.

511
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,540
What matters is that he's a soldier.

512
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,780
As soldiers,

513
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,293
they must strictly follow the rules.

514
00:22:22,293 --> 00:22:24,204
They can't get into conflicts
with civilians.

515
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,420
That's an iron rule.

516
00:22:29,426 --> 00:22:31,582
Discipline is like iron.
It shapes the right attitude.

517
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,340
Only then can a real army be forged.

518
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,610
Especially for young leaders
like Zong Qing,

519
00:22:36,804 --> 00:22:38,240
they must have strong self-discipline

520
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,150
to set a good example
for their soldiers.

521
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,060
Discipline is
the foundation of the army.

522
00:22:44,271 --> 00:22:47,270
Supporting the government and caring for
the people are the basic rules.

523
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,580
That's what he must uphold in uniform.

524
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,380
As for military spouses like you,

525
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,340
you should learn to bear all of this.

526
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:57,820
Yangyang,

527
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,820
your dad has explained it clearly.

528
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,100
Worrying won't help.

529
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,980
Have faith in the military.

530
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,180
I have trust in my son-in-law.

531
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,820
But discipline is discipline.

532
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,060
Since you've married a soldier,

533
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,780
you should follow it too.

534
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,100
Brigadier, I swear

535
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,660
I have not violated any discipline.

536
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,140
Leave the rest to the organization.

537
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:23,820
Yes, Sir.

538
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,300
Zong Qing,

539
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,060
don't pressure yourself.

540
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,500
We believe in you.

541
00:23:29,693 --> 00:23:31,450
You should believe
in the organization too.

542
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,340
Brigadier,

543
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,580
Captain,

544
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,060
I'm sorry

545
00:23:36,093 --> 00:23:37,660
for causing trouble for the brigade.

546
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,740
Enough with the apologies.

547
00:23:39,893 --> 00:23:40,740
Let them investigate

548
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,580
and find out the truth.

549
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,380
We won't bully others,

550
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,740
but we won't let anyone bully us either.

551
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:52,980
Hai.

552
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,100
Xin.

553
00:23:54,204 --> 00:23:55,620
The story about Zong Qing's rescue

554
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,620
will be published today.

555
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,180
All right.

556
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,820
Look.

557
00:23:58,915 --> 00:24:00,500
Investigate the Meiduo store manager

558
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,820
who was injured and hospitalized.

559
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,140
You think something's off?

560
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,580
Don't you?

561
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,020
Also,

562
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,540
I remember we received quite a few

563
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,420
complaints from consumers
about harmful cosmetics.

564
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,500
- Check if any of them are involved in Meiduo.
- Okay.

565
00:24:12,515 --> 00:24:13,060
Anything else?

566
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,780
Focus on these two things for now.

567
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,820
How's the task I gave you doing?

568
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,340
Oh, come on.

569
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,660
It's only been a little while,
and you're rushing me now.

570
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,620
Just tell me, did you do it?

571
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,810
Did you find anything useful?

572
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,540
Don't worry when I'm handling it.

573
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:32,580
All right.

574
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,100
I'm counting on you.

575
00:24:34,115 --> 00:24:35,537
Let me know when it's done.

576
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,380
Bye.

577
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,100
Hai.

578
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,471
This is an accident report

579
00:24:43,493 --> 00:24:45,100
from the municipal traffic department.

580
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:45,820
Take a look.

581
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,620
Thank you.

582
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,180
No problem. Go ahead and check.
I'm heading off.

583
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,980
(Traffic Accidents Report)

584
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,620
Hello?

585
00:25:07,804 --> 00:25:10,493
Is this the No. 2 General Hospital
Medical Record Department?

586
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,340
I'm calling from Minghua News.

587
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,660
Here's the thing.

588
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,115
We need your help with something.

589
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,340
Hello?

590
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,900
How's Zong Qing? Is he all right?

591
00:25:29,271 --> 00:25:30,820
He's preparing for the investigation.

592
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,340
He's under pressure.

593
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,380
Captain Wu,

594
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,820
I don't think your standard procedures

595
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,740
will work on people like that.

596
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,740
Just wait. I've got another way.

597
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,820
In what way?

598
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,260
Don't worry about it. Bye.

599
00:25:52,263 --> 00:25:53,540
Don't stress too much.

600
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,020
The military has its own process.

601
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,820
(Breeder)
Tang Xin said she'd help us.

602
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,900
Zong Qing will be all right.

603
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,260
Don't skip meals. Get some rest.

604
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,740
Don't overthink it.

605
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,980
Mom, don't worry.

606
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,020
I'm eating.

607
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,540
I'm hanging up.

608
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,300
You...

609
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,100
Oh, this girl.

610
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,480
Hello, I'm Wu Si.

611
00:26:23,626 --> 00:26:25,660
I'm here to visit you
on behalf of the military.

612
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:26,900
Visit us for what?

613
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,380
King Lan openly discredited Meiduo.

614
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,420
Our staff were insulted and assaulted

615
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,871
when they tried to defend their rights.

616
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,420
It was her husband who hit our staff.

617
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,740
If you don't punish him,

618
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,740
I'll go public with this again.

619
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:39,900
Yes, exactly.

620
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,780
Let me introduce myself.

621
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,180
I'm a journalist with Minghua News.

622
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,580
My name is Tang Xin.

623
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,580
Nice to meet you.

624
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:50,620
You too.

625
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,860
This is our producer, Tan Hai.

626
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:53,620
Hello.

627
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,860
Soldier,

628
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,580
we saw a video online

629
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,100
that appears to show a soldier
is involved with an assault.

630
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,060
We came to find out
what really happened.

631
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:04,980
Do you mind?

632
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,900
Not at all.

633
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,660
Finally, someone would report this.

634
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,860
Thank you, Miss.

635
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,300
Not at all.

636
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,300
You're Miss Xu Ning, right?

637
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,100
Yes, I am.

638
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,540
You're seriously injured.

639
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,820
Yes.

640
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,540
Miss, look at this.

641
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,340
Vertebral compression fracture.

642
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,380
It was caused by that soldier.

643
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,860
Before I came,

644
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,420
I consulted the doctor.

645
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,620
This report shows

646
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,860
vertebral wedging.

647
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,340
But it's strange.

648
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,180
The fracture line is burry,

649
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,580
the outline is intact,

650
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,100
and there's no sign of displacement.

651
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,060
But there are calluses.

652
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,980
Looks like an old injury.

653
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,100
Take a look here.

654
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,660
This is a medical report from
Orthopedics at No. 2 General Hospital

655
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,900
for someone with the same name and age.

656
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,580
Xu Ning, female, 33 years old.

657
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,420
That's you, right?

658
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,860
On May 17, 2017,

659
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,380
you were admitted for a bone fracture.

660
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,980
What a coincidence.

661
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,860
It's also a lumbar compression fracture.

662
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,300
Look. Here I have an accident report

663
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,340
from the traffic police.

664
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,420
Filed on the same day, May 17, right?

665
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,380
Driver at fault, Xu Ning.
Vertebral fracture.

666
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,380
Sent to No. 2 General Hospital.

667
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,100
Based on this,

668
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,900
we believe your accusation

669
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,100
that Mr. Zong Qing,
as a military soldier,

670
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,340
intentionally assaulted a woman,

671
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,780
causing injury and hospitalization,

672
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,340
is false.

673
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,140
Uh...

674
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,580
Do either of you

675
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,340
have anything to add?

676
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,100
That's great.

677
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,980
It didn't take us long to agree.

678
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,380
Good. We've cleared up
Mr. Zong Qing's matter.

679
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,380
Now, let's talk about the argument
between Meiduo

680
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,660
and Lan Yangyang.

681
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,100
Close-up on the manager.

682
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,620
May I ask,

683
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,900
the live streamer, Lan Yangyang,

684
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,580
posted a review video

685
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,140
claiming that Meiduo's essence
contains fake ingredients.

686
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,420
Is that true?

687
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,340
No.

688
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,340
That's completely untrue.

689
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,100
King Lan is slandering us.

690
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,100
Our product

691
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,100
is internationally certified.

692
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,420
All right.

693
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,100
Let's hear

694
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,780
what the victims have to say.

695
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:31,980
What do you mean?

696
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:32,820
Actually,

697
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,540
our show has always received

698
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,340
consumer complaints about Meiduo.

699
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,100
Before we came here today,

700
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,340
we happened to find some of them.

701
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,780
Let's hear

702
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,980
their firsthand experience

703
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,380
using Meiduo's essence.

704
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,100
Please come in.

705
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,140
You...

706
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,340
What are you doing?

707
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,100
Is this the miraculous effort

708
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,380
Meiduo advertises?

709
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,380
Look at my face.

710
00:29:58,404 --> 00:29:59,079
Wait, you...

711
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:01,240
This is false advertising,
and your prices are ridiculous.

712
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,440
Please calm down. Let's talk nicely.
What's going on here?

713
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,780
Medicinal effect?

714
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,820
King Lan's product review

715
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,140
was already mild.

716
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,340
If I were her,

717
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,900
I'd sue you for intentional harm.

718
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,540
Exactly. I used it just once.

719
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,580
Look at my face.

720
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,380
Large pores and red pimples all over.
How am I supposed to go out like this?

721
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,300
Please calm down.

722
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,671
I have an allergic reaction

723
00:30:20,671 --> 00:30:21,980
after using Meiduo's essence.

724
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,100
My face broke out in rashes.

725
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,204
It's itchy and painful.

726
00:30:25,226 --> 00:30:27,580
I had to undergo laser treatment
just to improve it a little.

727
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,740
- Sue them!
- Wait...

728
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,300
- Hiding out in the hospital will help?
- Please calm down.

729
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,740
Hold on. Please calm yourselves.

730
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,780
Patience.

731
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,760
Let's go somewhere else.

732
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,020
This isn't the right place for this.

733
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,980
Calm down.

734
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,020
Come back. Don't run away.

735
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,340
Wait.

736
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,580
She's injured.

737
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,100
She's a patient.

738
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,820
She's injured.

739
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,300
We've recorded

740
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,860
the consumers' accounts.

741
00:31:01,071 --> 00:31:02,330
If they decide to press charges,

742
00:31:02,337 --> 00:31:04,871
we're obligated
to submit this footage to the court

743
00:31:04,871 --> 00:31:06,100
as evidence.

744
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,140
This is

745
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,582
a certified test report

746
00:31:08,604 --> 00:31:10,715
from the Municipal Institute
of Biological Sciences.

747
00:31:10,782 --> 00:31:12,340
(Test Report)
According to this,

748
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,300
Meidup's products only have

749
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,740
basic cosmetic approval.

750
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,470
They don't meet the standards
of medical-grade skincare.

751
00:31:19,471 --> 00:31:20,782
This matches the review results

752
00:31:20,826 --> 00:31:21,604
by Lan Yangyang.

753
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,620
Who are you exactly?

754
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,860
What's your deal?

755
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,860
Speak nicely.

756
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,580
I...

757
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,620
We have portrait rights.

758
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,580
They can't

759
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,380
just record us

760
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,300
like this.

761
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,340
We won't publish the video.

762
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,340
We'll hand it directly to the army.

763
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,580
Right.

764
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,210
Sir, you see.

765
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,860
Can you speak with her, Sir?

766
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,980
You can't ruin our job.

767
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,780
This isn't part of our duty.

768
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,540
Understand?

769
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,260
Sir,

770
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,820
this is all just a misunderstanding.

771
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,340
We can talk it out,

772
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,380
right?

773
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,620
It's not that serious.

774
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,020
Yeah, it's not that serious.

775
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,040
This is a misunderstanding.

776
00:32:10,048 --> 00:32:11,580
Misunderstanding?

777
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,300
You almost ruined

778
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,780
the career of a young officer.

779
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:16,780
You think a few words
like "not that serious"

780
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,060
can fix it?

781
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,340
Look at you.

782
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,020
Why are you so serious?

783
00:32:21,071 --> 00:32:23,010
Let me tell you
why I'm taking this so seriously.

784
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,020
Because I come from a military family.

785
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,100
My father is a soldier.

786
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,340
My boyfriend is a soldier.

787
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,340
His father is a soldier, too.

788
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,860
I grew up under their protection.

789
00:32:31,915 --> 00:32:33,340
Now that I'm capable of giving back,

790
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,820
it's my turn to protect them.

791
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,860
I hate making deals,

792
00:32:43,715 --> 00:32:45,100
but I'll make an exception today.

793
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,500
And it's not for you.

794
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,340
Fine.

795
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,820
We can negotiate, right?

796
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,580
Everything's negotiable.

797
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,100
First, withdraw your complaint.

798
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,740
Then, publicly apologize
to the military,

799
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:02,580
to Mr. Zong Qing,
and to Miss Lan Yangyang.

800
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,100
Captain Zong Qing
of Blue Blade Special Ops Team.

801
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:18,420
On behalf of the Brigade
Safety and Security Department,

802
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,020
I now announce the closure
of your investigation.

803
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,540
Honey.

804
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,580
I have great news.

805
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,060
They've cleared everything up.

806
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,893
I'm in the clear.
The charge has been dropped.

807
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,580
That's good.

808
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,980
That's good?

809
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,780
Aren't you happy I'm okay?

810
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,260
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

811
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,300
Your stomach feels off?

812
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,140
I'm pregnant.

813
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,260
You're pregnant?

814
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,860
I'm going to be a dad?

815
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,540
I'm going to be a dad!

816
00:34:24,426 --> 00:34:25,700
Zong Qing, do you really think

817
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,300
we're ready to be parents?

818
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,700
We just got married.

819
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,260
I'm still figuring out
how to be a good wife.

820
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,780
How am I supposed to be a mom now?

821
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,780
Besides, my mom also says

822
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,260
I'm still acting like a kid.

823
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,140
How am I going to take care of a child

824
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,580
when I haven't grown up yet?

825
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,300
Honey, don't say that.

826
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,020
You're not alone.

827
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,300
You have me.

828
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,220
We'll face
whatever comes our way together.

829
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,900
Are you sure?

830
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,737
I can't even find you
if something happens.

831
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,220
That's not what I meant.

832
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,780
I'm just scared.

833
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,500
Honey.

834
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,380
I know raising a child

835
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,780
won't be easy.

836
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,260
I also know

837
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,580
we're going to face

838
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,100
all kinds of challenges.

839
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,740
But please believe me.

840
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,580
I'll try my best to take care of you,

841
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,460
to protect you.

842
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,580
Why am I saying all that?

843
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,060
It's dinner time, Honey.

844
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:00,060
What would you like to eat?

845
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,620
Little one, tell me what you want.

846
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,220
Sour, sweet, bitter,

847
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,260
or spicy?

848
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,360
Sour means boy, and spicy means girl.

849
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,380
I wish to be alone.

850
00:36:19,693 --> 00:36:21,020
Her parents probably don't know

851
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,700
Yangyang is pregnant yet.

852
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,420
But there's something
I need to tell you.

853
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,300
Yangyang was pampered growing up.

854
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,580
I really can't imagine

855
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,100
how you two are going to raise a child.

856
00:36:35,582 --> 00:36:37,580
There's no way the three of you
live on takeout.

857
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,300
So,

858
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,580
what's your plan?

859
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,860
I don't think

860
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,540
Yangyang wants to keep the baby.

861
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,500
She must still be shaken.

862
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,020
If...

863
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,700
If she's scared,

864
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,740
I can try to understand her.

865
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,940
And?

866
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,500
Try to understand her?

867
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,660
That's your whole plan?

868
00:37:23,604 --> 00:37:25,980
Captain Wu, how are you going to
deal with this ostrich?

869
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,100
Let him figure it out himself.

870
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:30,940
Fine.

871
00:37:31,671 --> 00:37:33,871
I'll take him somewhere
and help him think it through.

872
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,540
I don't need that.

873
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,380
It'll help you relieve stress.
Everyone experiences pain differently.

874
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,960
The scale goes from level one to ten.
It lasts eight minutes.

875
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,660
You can stop anytime.

876
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,180
Thank you.

877
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,020
Ready when you are.

878
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,100
Nurse,

879
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,700
can you show me how to use this?

880
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,940
Please come over here.

881
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,860
Level five.

882
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:29,780
Level nine.

883
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,140
Level ten. Ready.

884
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,020
Okay.

885
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,740
Morning sickness, and labor pain.

886
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,380
What you just went through

887
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,604
is only the tip of the iceberg.

888
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,220
Yangyang studied medicine.

889
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,580
She knows exactly
how painful childbirth is.

890
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,860
That's not what she's afraid of.

891
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,100
If you wish to understand her,

892
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,260
you need to find out
what she's actually afraid of.

893
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,100
This baby belongs to both of you.

894
00:39:09,648 --> 00:39:11,826
You should let her know
what you're thinking.

895
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,660
And more than that,

896
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,060
show her your resolve.

897
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:46,220
The number you've dialed
is currently unavailable.

898
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,860
Please try again later.

899
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,380
Excuse me, can I help you
with something?

900
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,140
No thanks. I'm just browsing.

901
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,100
Why are you sulking?

902
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,140
Yangyang isn't picking up.

903
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,860
I don't know where she is.

904
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,580
Look at you. All down in the dumps.

905
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:24,940
Forget Yangyang,

906
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:26,740
even I don't feel like talking to you.

907
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,540
Captain Wu.

908
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,900
