Yuhang.

19
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,010
Yuhang?

20
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:05,490
Dad.

21
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,440
Yutian.

22
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,920
You're back.

23
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,160
When did you come back?

24
00:02:12,004 --> 00:02:13,290
Where have you been these days?

25
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,970
Why couldn't we reach you at all?

26
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,130
I was in the Roman Islands.

27
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,010
I did tell you about that.

28
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,370
What happened after that?

29
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,010
Why couldn't we reach you?

30
00:02:27,737 --> 00:02:29,040
What are you laughing about?

31
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,370
Say something.

32
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,570
Dad and I
were looking for you everywhere.

33
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,880
Did you know?

34
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,200
We even thought of going to ICPO

35
00:02:36,204 --> 00:02:37,693
if we had failed to find you.

36
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,010
Was that even necessary?

37
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,200
You two had never cared much about me.

38
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,290
What's it?

39
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,850
Why are you being emotional?

40
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,410
What's happened?

41
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,320
Tell us about it.

42
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,626
You're overthinking, Dad.

43
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,850
I'm not being emotional.

44
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,570
And you need not worry about me.

45
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,570
I'm back home after all, right?

46
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,690
Tell me. Where have you been?

47
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,600
What exactly happened?

48
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,410
Here's the thing.

49
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,040
Well, I bumped into a former classmate

50
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,570
whom I hadn't seen in years

51
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,690
back in the Roman Islands.

52
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,920
I then went out to sea

53
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,600
with them for several days.

54
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,970
Well, you do know

55
00:03:30,026 --> 00:03:31,570
that cell phones don't work at sea.

56
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,970
When we were back,
I had too much to drink.

57
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,130
I accidentally threw my phone
into the water, so...

58
00:03:36,426 --> 00:03:37,480
you couldn't reach me.

59
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,782
Couldn't you have borrowed
your former classmate's phone?

60
00:03:39,826 --> 00:03:41,150
You should've informed us of that.

61
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,715
Yutian.

62
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,690
My phone couldn't work at sea.

63
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,410
Of course
my classmate's couldn't either.

64
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,290
Am I right? Think about it.

65
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,440
Wait a second.

66
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,440
You've been using that weird tone
on us since your return.

67
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,880
Tell us what happened.

68
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,040
Perhaps I had too much fun

69
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,040
at sea.

70
00:04:05,093 --> 00:04:06,880
It was exhausting. And now I feel tired.

71
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,090
But it's nothing serious.

72
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,515
I'll be fine after a two-day rest.

73
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,440
(Hi, I'm back from Roman.)

74
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,010
(Thank you so much for the clue.)

75
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,960
(I know the influential figure
you were talking about.)

76
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,490
(I had no idea
why you've been so cautious.)

77
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,170
(But now I know
what you've been facing.)

78
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,048
(Changzhou has a profound
and influential position in the field.)

79
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,400
(Without solid evidence,)

80
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,280
(it's certainly no easy feat
to expose them.)

81
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,426
(Congratulations.
Looks like I've got you wrong.)

82
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,490
(You're indeed a resourceful reporter.)

83
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,170
(You must protect yourself.)

84
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,010
(The closer we are to the truth,)

85
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,610
(the more dangerous we would be.)

86
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,050
(Do keep in touch.)

87
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,810
(You take care too.)

88
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,760
(Hopefully, we will find evidence)

89
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,640
(to file a lawsuit)

90
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,370
(and bring them to justice soon.)

91
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,700
(Outpatient Department)

92
00:05:25,915 --> 00:05:27,604
- You're awake, Chen.
- Why are you here?

93
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,730
I'm here to visit you.

94
00:05:33,871 --> 00:05:35,320
Where are Captain and Qiu Xiao?

95
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,280
They left.

96
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,840
And I've asked their permission

97
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,170
to be here with you alone.

98
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,960
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,610
Don't apologize to me.

100
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,570
There's nothing to be sorry about.

101
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,370
- I should sit myself up.
- Stay still.

102
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,400
Don't move...

103
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,250
Does it hurt?

104
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,400
It's good to see you.

105
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,130
Let me tell you

106
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,840
what I've been up to

107
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,080
when you were away.

108
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,570
Apart from work,

109
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,320
I would be thinking about you

110
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,010
at night.

111
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,760
I couldn't see you,

112
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,080
so I just texted you.

113
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,440
I knew you wouldn't respond to my texts,

114
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,640
but I still did it.

115
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,400
There was this one time

116
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,640
when I was home

117
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,960
watching those videos you took then.

118
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,320
Mom then ran out of her room

119
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,690
and asked if you were home.

120
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,530
I said no.

121
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,320
And she wondered why she heard you.

122
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:01,640
I was amused

123
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,570
and told her I was watching your videos.

124
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,540
Also, in case you came home
all of a sudden,

125
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,860
I even bought a bouquet home

126
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,700
every day.

127
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,180
I even learned to make a few dishes.

128
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,860
I'll make them for you when you're home.

129
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,820
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,140
There, there.

131
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,420
Stop saying that.

132
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,420
Your return

133
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,300
is more than enough.

134
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,140
You'll get well eventually.

135
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,700
I'm actually afraid.

136
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,980
What if I don't get well?

137
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,180
That won't happen.

138
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,180
Even if you didn't get well,

139
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,500
nothing would change.

140
00:08:06,804 --> 00:08:08,300
If your leg condition didn't improve,

141
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,540
I'd be your leg after this.

142
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,140
If your hand didn't work,

143
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,700
I'd be your hand.

144
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,180
If any of your inner organs didn't work,

145
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,300
you'd rely on me.

146
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,500
If your brain didn't work,

147
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,860
I'd be your brain.

148
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,140
No matter what,
you can always count on me.

149
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,860
It'll be alright.

150
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,980
Dear.

151
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,340
Captain Wu

152
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,660
told me

153
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,340
everything about you.

154
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,100
And I'm proud of you.

155
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,580
Get some rest now.

156
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,660
Take a nap.

157
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,660
Close your eyes.

158
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,740
Do you want to lie down?

159
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,380
It's okay.

160
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,740
I'll sit here for a bit.

161
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,620
Honey.

162
00:09:29,826 --> 00:09:32,100
The unit specially approved
ten days of leave for me,

163
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,560
so I could come home and be with you.

164
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,860
It's all my fault.

165
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,100
I don't want to cause you more trouble.

166
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,980
Why don't you go back?

167
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,380
I can manage it.

168
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,140
What are you even saying?

169
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,220
How is this your fault?

170
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,620
I just got back, and you're trying
to send me away?

171
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,340
What is your deal?

172
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,100
I never said I was driving you away.

173
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,100
Look,

174
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,740
we only got two days
for our honeymoon back then.

175
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,400
The unit called me back
for duty right after.

176
00:10:01,404 --> 00:10:02,493
So we're making up for it

177
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,260
with this ten-day leave, right?

178
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,860
You can make up a honeymoon?

179
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,340
Of course we can.

180
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,500
Tell me, what do you want to do?

181
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,740
Whatever it is, I will make it happen.

182
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,220
I want to stay in.

183
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,204
You do not want to go out
for all ten days?

184
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,220
Got it.

185
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,380
Then we'll stay in

186
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,460
and have our honeymoon here.

187
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,660
How about that?

188
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,740
Do you think the kids have made it home?

189
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,740
Should I give them a call?

190
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,140
Pass me the phone.

191
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,220
Don't call them.

192
00:10:50,204 --> 00:10:51,780
Let them deal with it on their own.

193
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,860
It's such a big deal.

194
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,460
How can they handle it themselves?

195
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,740
I'm still worried.

196
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,100
Worrying won't help.

197
00:11:00,582 --> 00:11:02,850
No matter how big the problem is,
they'll get through it.

198
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,980
Even if it hurts,

199
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,860
they have to learn
to process it themselves.

200
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,620
A husband's absence

201
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,340
is something every military wife
has to deal with.

202
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,740
Yangyang needs to learn

203
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,740
to slowly get used to such a life.

204
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:23,340

00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,920
(Captain Wu, you must be exhausted
all the time. Rest well.)

218
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,100
Wu Si, have you eaten yet?

219
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,980
Hai was seeking a croissant shop

220
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,740
that was two blocks away.

221
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,100
But honestly, it was pretty good.

222
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,220
Too bad you can't have any.

223
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,660
What now?

224
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,340
I'll chew it so you can hear it.

225
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:02,980
Wu Si.

226
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,100
Every time I call home,

227
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,340
my dad always asks me,

228
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,860
"How is Wu Si doing lately?"

229
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,860
How would I know?

230
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,620
Where are you guys now? Are you seasick?

231
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,340
Wait. No, you wouldn't get seasick.

232
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,460
I'm telling you, Wu Si.

233
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,740
I bought a little sailor outfit

234
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,780
for the baby today.

235
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,100
Check out the photo.

236
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,740
Isn't it adorable?

237
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,340
When he wears it,

238
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,100
it's going to feel so soft to the touch.

239
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,460
How am I doing as a godmother?
Not bad, right?

240
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,980
Wu Si.

241
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,620
Wu Si...

242
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,980
What if

243
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,580
I say your name a hundred times?

244
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,460
Will you

245
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,220
start sneezing

246
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,460
like a peashooter?

247
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,460
Day 32 without Captain Wu.

248
00:14:00,982 --> 00:14:02,293
I'm still waiting for you.

249
00:14:07,204 --> 00:14:09,220
(Are you filming another video
for Captain Wu?)

250
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,900
(Is it true
that when girls fall in love,)

251
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,782
(they just really
need to share everything?)

252
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,460
(Captain Wu,
I'd like to file a formal complaint.)

253
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,960
(When she was asleep in the car,)

254
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,240
(she kept murmuring your name.)

255
00:14:20,248 --> 00:14:20,960
(Go away.)

256
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,860
(Check out this ice cream.)

257
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,020
(It's huge!)

258
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,380
(I waited in line forever to get it.)

259
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,620
(You can't eat it,)

260
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,604
(so I'll try it for you.)

264
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,780
Chen.

265
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,500
How could you

266
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,780
keep this from us all the while?

267
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,260
Well, how are you?

268
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,340
Does it still hurt?

269
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,740
Not at all. I'm fine.

270
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,900
I just didn't want you to worry,

271
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,660
so I told them not to let you know.

272
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,620
I'm your mom.

273
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,980
How long did you think
you could keep this from me?

274
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,780
Remember.

275
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,620
No matter what happens in the future,

276
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,340
you have to let me know.

277
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,380
Home is your safe haven.

278
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,330
If anything happens,

279
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,060
we'll face it together.

280
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,140
Mom, I'm sorry

281
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,500
for making you worry.

282
00:16:48,848 --> 00:16:51,093
Just drop the subject.
You should eat now.

283
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,020
I brought all your favorites.

284
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,540
I've worked in the hospital all my life.

285
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,020
I'll help you

286
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,540
with your leg condition.

287
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,260
Right face.

288
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,100
Front face.

289
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,020
At ease.

290
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,100
Attention!

291
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,260
At ease.

292
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:11,820
Captain!

293
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,100
Captain.

294
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,715
Can't you just take me
to visit Captain Chen?

295
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,700
No.

296
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,060
Why not?

297
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,980
You'll get to see her after this.

298
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,740
Focus on your training for now.

299
00:17:33,537 --> 00:17:35,515
Do something that Captain Chen
would want to see.

300
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,260
Yes, Sir.

301
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,540
I really owe this to you.

302
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,780
If Mom starts
sending you food every day,

303
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,860
I'll get to sneak a few bites of it.

304
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,580
Zijian.

305
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,500
I want to start rehab.

306
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,620
You want to start rehab? Fine.

307
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,580
But, Honey,

308
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,860
you're rushing things here.

309
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,260
It's still too soon for that.

310
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:15,100
My injury is already hard enough
to recover from.

311
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,260
If I don't work on it now,

312
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,580
even if I return to Blue Blade,

313
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,740
I won't be able to keep up

314
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,380
with the Marine Corps training schedule.

315
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,740
Look,

316
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,700
Dr. Qiu said

317
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,860
this kind of thing

318
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,340
has to be done gradually.

319
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,940
Dr. Yang said the same thing.

320
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,460
If you want to walk normally again,

321
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,380
well...

322
00:18:34,915 --> 00:18:36,700
that would take at least six months.

323
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,300
So

324
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,780
we have to be rational

325
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,260
and realistic about it.

326
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,860
Besides,

327
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,500
even if you fully recover,

328
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,740
it'll be hard for you to return

329
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,300
to the high-intensity training
you used to do.

330
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,260
I want to see Dr. Yang.

331
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,540
You still don't believe me?

332
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,060
I'm not making this up.

333
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,460
Dr. Yang told me all this.

334
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,620
So I know your condition very well.

335
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,260
Even if you make a full recovery now,

336
00:19:12,782 --> 00:19:14,982
you still won't be able
to return to the front line.

337
00:19:15,004 --> 00:19:17,048
What do you mean by that?

338
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,980
Are you telling me to retire?

339
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,620
I'm not against
you going back to the unit.

340
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,780
But we have to face the facts.

341
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,740
Enough about that.

342
00:19:28,271 --> 00:19:29,740
I want to be alone for a while.

343
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,460
I'm not leaving.

344
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,500
I'm staying here with you.

345
00:19:43,471 --> 00:19:45,671
Well, I'll get the doctor here
to explain it to you.

346
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,580
Big Big Wolf.

347
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,140
Big Big Wolf.

348
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,220
Is something bothering you?

349
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,340
What could be bothering me?

350
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,700
Drop the act already.

351
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,940
You think I can't tell
something's on your mind?

352
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,580
You haven't
visited Wang Chen yet, have you?

353
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:38,660
Yes.

354
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,340
Go visit her now.

355
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,060
I'll wait for you to come back.

356
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,140
Can I do that?

357
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,380
Go on.

358
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,780
Come home soon.

359
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,940
You're the best, Honey.

360
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,700
I need a favor, Yutian.

361
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,180
Sure, go ahead.

362
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,020
From now on,

363
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,620
stay away from Tang Xin.

364
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,860
Who's been messing with Tang Xin?

365
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,220
What are you talking about?

366
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,300
I know everything you've done.

367
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,060
I just chose not to confront you.

368
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,340
But if you dare hurt Tang Xin again,

369
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,460
well,

370
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,940
I won't be as forgiving

371
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,180
as I am now.

372
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,460
Yuhang.

373
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,860
I've told you many times.

374
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,140
You two aren't a good match.

375
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,060
Just stay out of their business.

376
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,660
Well,

377
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,860
have you heeded my advice?

378
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:46,700
Yutian.

379
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,060
Stop acting

380
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,860
like you're the smartest one
in the world.

381
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,900
Remember what I said today.

382
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:04,940
Captain Wang.

383
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,140
Your husband said you want
to start rehab as soon as possible.

384
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,860
But from a medical standpoint,

385
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,660
given your current condition,

386
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,660
we don't recommend starting rehab yet.

387
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,020
I can do it, Dr. Yang.

388
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,420
What are you talking about?

389
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,220
Like Dr. Yang said,

390
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,700
given your condition,
you're not ready for rehab.

391
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,620
How would you know it

392
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,220
without letting me give it a try?

393
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,020
Dr. Yang...

394
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,300
Wang Chen.

395
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,140
- Stop it.
- Let go of me!

396
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,180
Wang Chen.

397
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,620
What are you doing? Stay still.

398
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,700
Captain Wu is here.

399
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,340
Let's hear what he has to say.

400
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,140
Wang Chen wants to get up for rehab.

401
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,220
But the doctor said

402
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,648
she's not ready to be on her feet.

403
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:44,780
Dr. Yang.

404
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,220
Given Wang Chen's current condition,

405
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,700
can she begin rehab?

406
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,420
It's not recommended.

407
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,300
Rehab is a long-term process.

408
00:22:53,382 --> 00:22:54,448
Following medical advice

409
00:22:54,471 --> 00:22:56,315
is the most effective path to recovery.

410
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,020
If you rush things,

411
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,780
it'll only backfire.

412
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,140
Captain.

413
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,620
I...

414
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,493
- I can do it.
- Wang Chen.

415
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,660
You're a soldier.

416
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,180
This is an order.

417
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,620
You must follow the doctor's advice.

418
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,020
Yes, Sir.

419
00:23:21,737 --> 00:23:23,550
I know you're eager
to return to Blue Blade.

420
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,660
I believe you will make it.

421
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,140
And I hope you do.

422
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,940
But I want you to come back
in a healthy state.

423
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:34,900
Blue Blade

424
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,140
will always have a place for you.

425
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,540
But it doesn't have to be right now.
Do you understand?

426
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,580
Captain.

427
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,380
You know I can do it.

428
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,140
Just let me try once.

429
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:55,900
Zijian.

430
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,900
Let me try once.

431
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,460
Dr. Yang.

432
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,100
How about this?

433
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,220
I'll need to evaluate
your current recovery level.

434
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,220
I'll schedule you for a simple test

435
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,900
in the rehab room.

436
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,780
Based on the test results,

437
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,380
we'll determine whether rehab is ideal.

438
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,380
Thank you, Dr. Yang.

439
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,860
Alright, wait here.

440
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,860
I'll go make arrangements.

441
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,460
Thank you.

442
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,220
- Miss Tang.
- Miss Tang.

443
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,300
Wang Chen, Mr. Bai.

444
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,340
I'm here to visit Wang Chen.

445
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,180
And I've brought you these.

446
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,460
Thank you so much.

447
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,820
Mr. Bai.

448
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,300
Wang Chen.

449
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,300
I came today

450
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,380
because I owe you both
a serious apology.

451
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,780
Wang Chen really did

452
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:06,493
get injured saving me.

453
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,340
Please don't say so.

454
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,140
Tang Xin.

455
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,220
We actually know that.

456
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,100
Wang Chen is a soldier after all.

457
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,780
It's her duty.

458
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,940
So you

459
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:19,340
need not beat yourself up.

460
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,060
And don't feel guilty about it.

461
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,020
I'm alright.

462
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,180
Captain. Xin.

463
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,220
What brings you here?

464
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,737
I came to visit Captain Chen.

465
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,700
I should've done so sooner,

466
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,660
but Yangyang needed me.

467
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,020
What a princess.

468
00:25:52,071 --> 00:25:54,660
How could she be exploiting
her privilege as a soon-to-be mother?

469
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,380
Don't worry.
I'll talk to her after this.

470
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,820
What's the matter?

471
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,660
What happened?

472
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,780
We lost the baby.

473
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,540
It was a miscarriage.

474
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,140
When did it happen?

475
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,300
How... How

476
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,620
did that happen?

477
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,100
What kind of accident?

478
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,620
I'm going to visit her.

479
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,300
Tang Xin...

480
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,020
- Xin...
- Let go. I need to check on her.

481
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,820
I know you're worried.
Can you wait a few days?

482
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,580
Wait a few days?

483
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,999
She's really emotionally unstable now.

484
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,415
It's exactly because she's unstable
that I need to see her now.

485
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,340
When she was pregnant,

486
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,239
she was all alone.

487
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,450
She went to every checkup alone.

488
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,850
She waited for you every single day.

489
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,420
- And now you're finally back...
- Xin.

490
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,300
I...

491
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,460
I don't want her to be reminded of that.

492
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,220
Calm down.

493
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,660
Xin.

494
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,020
Wait, Zong Qing.

495
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,220
I just want to know

496
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,660
what exactly happened.

497
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,940
How did you lose the baby

498
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,780
just like that?

499
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,300
Xin.

500
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,460
This is between me and Yangyang.

501
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,060
Please

502
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,780
give us some time.

503
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,100
How are you?

504
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,180
I'm okay.

505
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,940
Take good care of yourself

506
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,220
and Yangyang.

507
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,700
Go home.

508
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,820
I told Yangyang so.

509
00:28:48,337 --> 00:28:49,960
I'll leave after visiting Captain Chen.

510
00:28:50,026 --> 00:28:51,315
Wang Chen is doing rehab.

511
00:28:51,671 --> 00:28:53,071
You should come again another day.

512
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,060
Head back now.

513
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,140
Yangyang needs you more.

514
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,620
Pull yourself together.

515
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,380
Go ahead.

516
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,340
I'm off.

517
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,060
Hello?

518
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,820
Hi, Miss Lan.

519
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,100
Your amniocentesis results are in.

520
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,220
There's nothing abnormal.

521
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,740
You can rest easy now.

522
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,500
The baby's chromosomes are fine.

523
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,860
He's healthy.

524
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,980
There's no risk of Down syndrome.

525
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,100
You don't have to worry anymore.

526
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,300
We just called to let you know.

527
00:30:46,337 --> 00:30:48,880
(Procedure: Uterine evacuation.
Suggested 15-day rest, follow-up in a month.)

528
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,300
(Medical records: Lan Yangyang)

529
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,980
Doctor, may I have your pen?

530
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,100
Make sure to get plenty of rest.

531
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:00,980
Thank you.

532
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,380
2019.

533
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,580
Early morning.

534
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,100
4:23 AM.

535
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,780
Zong Xi.

536
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,060
Miss Lan?

537
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,220
Are you still there? Hello? Hello?

538
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,220
Thank you.

539
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,060
Sure. Goodbye.

540
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:26,820
Honey.

541
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,860
What's it? Who was on the phone?

542
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,560
Nothing, that was a wrong number.

543
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,500
The chicken soup I made today
is really good.

544
00:32:42,671 --> 00:32:43,980
You must have more of it later.

545
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,300
I'll go get the soup ready.

546
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:02,780
Mr. Han.

547
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:03,940
Mr. Han.

548
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,060
Dad.

549
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,060
Why are you in such a rush?
What happened?

550
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,515
Tang Xin is back in the country.

551
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,540
She's back?

552
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,260
She actually came back unharmed,

553
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,540
and she's already back to work.

554
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,060
Are you sure about this?

555
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:22,780
Positive.

556
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,060
Hello?

557
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:40,780
William.

558
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,300
Let me ask you something.

559
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,060
What's wrong with that woman

560
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,260
you took away back in Roman?

561
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,580
How did she end up back in China?

562
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,500
What happened to that person
he asked you

563
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,080
to deal with last time?

564
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,100
That ship was hijacked by pirates,

565
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,250
but it was rescued
by the escorting Chinese Navy.

566
00:33:57,915 --> 00:34:00,648
That freighter was hijacked by pirates
in international waters,

567
00:34:00,693 --> 00:34:02,760
but it was rescued
by the escorting Chinese Navy.

568
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,300
Alright. Got it.

569
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,060
Okay.

570
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,820
Keep in touch. Bye.

571
00:34:20,293 --> 00:34:21,940
I know you've been through a lot lately.

572
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,500
At first,

573
00:34:24,893 --> 00:34:26,709
I wanted to wait
until you felt a bit better,

574
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,600
rested up, before asking you out.

575
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:31,620
Besides, I've been thinking
a lot lately.

576
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,100
So...

577
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,100
There's something

578
00:34:35,715 --> 00:34:37,315
I've been holding in this whole time.

579
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,220
Why so serious all of a sudden?

580
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,020
Do you remember

581
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,300
what I told you

582
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,871
before you left for the Roman Islands?

583
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,060
I said

584
00:34:52,093 --> 00:34:54,093
you should report it
to the relevant authorities.

585
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,060
Do you remember that?

586
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,220
I do.

587
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,100
I did report it.

588
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,220
I even got permission from Mr. Tian.

589
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,026
I only made my way there
with his approval.

590
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,820
And I wasn't alone.

591
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,060
I took Hai with me.

592
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,060
Well, you know what I'm trying to say.

593
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,580
And I'm not joking.

594
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,580
I don't get what you mean.

595
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,500
And I'm not joking either.

596
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,620
Captain Wu.

597
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,940
Let's just get down to business.

598
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,100
You don't have to lecture me like that.

599
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,540
I'm not lecturing you.

600
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,260
I just felt lucky.

601
00:35:33,893 --> 00:35:36,170
It was lucky that I ran into you
on that stretch of ocean.

602
00:35:36,226 --> 00:35:37,937
Did you know how many merchant ships

603
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,140
need a naval escort
through that sea every day?

604
00:35:41,671 --> 00:35:43,620
Just one minor accident
and we'd have missed you.

605
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,340
What if we had?

606
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:51,940
It really was a coincidence
you met the warship.

607
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,540
However, I really can't guarantee

608
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,220
I'll be there by chance

609
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,620
when you're in danger.

610
00:35:58,137 --> 00:35:59,540
Nor can I guarantee to be there

611
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,220
whenever you need me.

612
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,980
I'm not blaming you.

613
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,420
I just hope that you
give it a good thought

614
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,820
before you act after this.

615
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,580
I know you're worried about me.

616
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,460
But I need you to believe

617
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,340
that I know exactly what I'm doing.

618
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,780
I've been an investigative journalist
for years.

619
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,660
I'm willing to accept
the risks that come

620
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,940
with the profession of my choice.

621
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,140
But what you did was irresponsible.

622
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,340
I'm aware of the nature of your work.

623
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,900
And I know what your intentions are.

624
00:36:46,448 --> 00:36:48,337
I have great respect
for your professionalism.

625
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,700
But only by

626
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,340
ensuring your safety

627
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,660
can you do your job better.

628
00:36:55,293 --> 00:36:56,820
If you report it to the authorities,

629
00:36:57,071 --> 00:36:58,580
you can still operate independently.

630
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,980
And you'll have solid safety backup

631
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,940
for your solo operations.

632
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,420
Do you not understand
what "reporting" means?

633
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,860
Let me explain it to you.

634
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,580
When we're on the front lines,

635
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,340
our backup supplies
are what keep us strong.

636
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,620
They know our exact
coordinates and position, so...

637
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,330
I don't need to know
anything about backup,

638
00:37:22,337 --> 00:37:23,460
supplies, and positions.

639
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,100
I'm an investigative journalist.

640
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,700
Our job

641
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,980
isn't like your beach landings,

642
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,190
which are the more the merrier.

643
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,820
Listen, since I entered this field,

644
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,180
I've completed many investigations
all by myself.

645
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,340
That's how our industry works.

646
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,309
The more people who know,

647
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,804
the more likely things get screwed up.

648
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,340
Fine, Captain Wu.

649
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,620
If you think

650
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,940
I'm being a lone wolf

651
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,260
who tries to show off,

652
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,100
suit yourself.

653
00:37:51,293 --> 00:37:53,115
- I'm really not...
- Thank you for saving me.

654
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,420
Tang Xin.

655
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,180
Fate has certainly played a trick on us.

656
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:23,820
Dad.

657
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,426
I think there's more than meets the eye

658
00:38:28,448 --> 00:38:30,380
with Yuhang's visit
to the Roman Islands.

659
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,260
It wasn't just

660
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,460
about chasing after that reporter
like he said.

661
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,180
Then what do you think?

662
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,340
I think

663
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,980
he found out something about our family.

664
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,020
Dad.

665
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,220
We must stop them
from seeing each other.

666
00:38:50,471 --> 00:38:53,093
What if Tang Xin manages to talk him
into collaborating with her?

667
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,940
You think telling him
to stop seeing her will work?

668
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,220
It's not that serious.

669
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,420
Even if he knows something,

670
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,820
it's just scratching the surface.

671
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,740
Besides, we're a family.

672
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,660
Even if he knows something,

673
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,820
so what?

674
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,460
But this won't hold up for long.

675
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,260
Maybe I should get someone

676
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,340
to...

677
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,500
Right now,

678
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,540
the real danger isn't that woman.

679
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,620
It's whoever has been feeding her leads.

680
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,740
I've been trying
to track that person down.

681
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:34,020
But with just an email address,
it's tough.

682
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:37,900
Look.

683
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,740
Only a handful of people

684
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,180
know our secrets.

685
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,140
Indeed.

686
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,900
Start by screening

687
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,420
the innermost circle.

688
00:39:55,715 --> 00:39:57,004
Are you tired from walking?

689
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,460
A little.

690
00:39:58,715 --> 00:39:59,660
Let's take some rest.

691
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,020
Here.

692
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,220
Let me rub your legs.

693
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,620
Sore?

694
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:21,820
Honey.

695
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,620
Do you remember

696
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,980
the first time we came to this park?

697
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,900
Of course I do.

698
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,580
We had our very first date

699
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,460
right here.

700
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,260
You had an interview that day.

701
00:40:34,493 --> 00:40:36,060
But you started whining to me instead.

702
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,420
And after all that whining,

703
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,500
I still didn't even get the job.

704
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,620
I failed to land the lab,

705
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,140
but I ended up getting married.

706
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,860
That was the smartest decision
you ever made.

707
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,100
Feels like
it all just happened yesterday.

708
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,820
Have some water.

709
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:45,740
Honey.

710
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,620
Let's keep walking a bit more.

711
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,380
Sure.

712
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,500
