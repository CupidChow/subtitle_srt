18
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:22,940
Dr. Qiu.

19
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:24,248
- Miss Tang.
- Please enter.

20
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,820
Dr. Qiu.

21
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,980
Miss Tang.

22
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:29,940
Please sit.

23
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,660
Sure.

24
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,540
How was your rest?

25
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,540
Seasick?

26
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,100
A little,

27
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,220
but manageable.

28
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,500
How's Wang Chen?

29
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,220
Captain Wang Chen
is with another doctor.

30
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,060
I'm your doctor right now.

31
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,620
Brigadier

32
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,220
has already informed your family.

33
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,940
You're not seriously hurt.

34
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,900
You'll recover after some rest.

35
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,220
But Miss Tang,

36
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,460
I'm not a trained therapist.

37
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,940
You need to adjust
your mindset yourself.

38
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,940
Breakfast time for the first batch.

39
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,180
Let me take you to the cafeteria.

40
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,900
The wounded eats first.

41
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,060
Fresh veggies are in short supply here.

42
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:17,940
Well...

43
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,780
Which batch

44
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,220
is special ops unit?

45
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,780
You must be asking about Captain Wu.

46
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,220
He's special ops unit and a commander.

47
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,220
He eats at random times.

48
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,900
I'll wait for him then.

49
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,220
Let the soldiers eat first.

50
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,940
No need to wait for him.

51
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,060
Even on the same ship,
you'll rarely meet him.

52
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,220
He's the busiest one among us.

53
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,380
Dr. Qiu.

54
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,620
While I was asleep,

55
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,940
did he come to see me?

56
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,100
Miss Tang.

57
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,220
This is a warship.

58
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,060
He's on duty.

59
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,780
He can't be with you at all times,

60
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,380
but he asked me

61
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,940
to tell you to eat and rest well.

62
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,780
We'll be home soon.

63
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,820
Yangyang.

64
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,700
You'll catch a cold
from sitting on the floor.

65
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,100
Let me show you my sister.

66
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,460
She's so beautiful.

67
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,700
Yangyang.

68
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,820
Thank you for keeping
my mom and sister company.

69
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,260
I'm not a good doctor.

70
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,020
I didn't help much this time.

71
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,340
But at least, I stayed by your side.

72
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,340
Yangyang, I'm sorry.

73
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,900
Don't apologize.

74
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,340
It's not your fault.

75
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,260
Zhaoyang.

76
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,900
This is our little secret.

77
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,460
Don't tell anyone, alright?

78
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,780
If

79
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,820
your parents ask,

80
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,340
just say

81
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,700
we

82
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,820
went straight home
after I brought you home

83
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,340
to get clothes.

84
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,820
Nothing happened.

85
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,900
Understand?

86
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,460
Why?

87
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,700
Because this is my problem.

88
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,700
It's between Xi and me.

89
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,020
Thank you, Mr. Han.

90
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,140
I'm okay, just a little seasick.

91
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,460
What about you? How are you?

92
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,020
I'm not seasick,

93
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,900
but maybe I didn't sleep well.

94
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,900
Maybe I'm still a bit shaken.

95
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,220
I saw Captain Wu the other day

96
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,820
and even mentioned this to him.

97
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,340
You saw him?

98
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,580
When?

99
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,900
The day before yesterday, I think.

100
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,340
He was changing shifts on the deck.

101
00:07:31,226 --> 00:07:34,071
You still haven't seen Captain Wu?

102
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,700
I heard him say

103
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,460
he didn't know you were going to Roman.

104
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,900
Even if he had known,

105
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,580
he wouldn't have agreed, so...

106
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,660
What I don't get

107
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,900
is why you didn't tell him first.

108
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,020
He was setting off for escort duty
when I left.

109
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,460
How could I tell him?

110
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,900
That's true.

111
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,460
Alright.

112
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,020
Since you're dizzy, rest more.

113
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,660
Eat on time.

114
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,580
Find me if you need anything.

115
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,460
No.

116
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,140
You need to ask Captain Wu here.

117
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,540
Yangyang, what are you doing?

118
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,340
I just got home.

119
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,100
Didn't you say
you'd only stay a few days?

120
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,220
It's been a few days.
Why aren't you back yet?

121
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,700
Zong Qing isn't home. Don't be alone.

122
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,340
Your dad misses you.

123
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,980
Come back soon.

124
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:33,620
Okay.

125
00:09:34,871 --> 00:09:36,580
I'll cook you some delicious food.

126
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,540
Eat more.

127
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,340
Have a good taste

128
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,980
of your dad's cooking

129
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,940
and give me your comment.
What do you think?

130
00:10:19,004 --> 00:10:20,404
Give me your comment. Hurry.

131
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,100
I haven't eaten your cooking
in a long time.

132
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,540
Tastes just like when I was little.

133
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,740
Of course.

134
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,940
Alright.

135
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,180
Your dad's
the master chef in this family.

136
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,460
He rarely cooks,

137
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,340
but when he does... Bam, bam, bam. Look.

138
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,420
Smells amazing.

139
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,540
Today, I'm enjoying this delicious meal

140
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,860
all thanks

141
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,180
to you and my grandson.

142
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,540
Delicious.

143
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,420
No doubt.

144
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,180
Now, I cook for my daughter.

145
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,420
In the future,

146
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,700
my grandchild can start ordering dishes.

147
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,671
They can order anything.

148
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,740
I've been thinking.

149
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,060
My granddaughter

150
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,540
or maybe grandson

151
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,540
must have big eyes

152
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,820
like my daughter's.

153
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,180
She'll be tall

154
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,180
like Zong Qing.

155
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,100
It's definitely a grandson.

156
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,180
He'll be like my daughter.

157
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,100
He'll be as cute as Yangyang

158
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,420
and as smart as Zong Qing.

159
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,340
Her character and temper

160
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,860
should take after Zong Qing,

161
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,420
not like our darling.

162
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:26,740
What?

163
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,100
You spoiled her rotten.

164
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,100
She's my daughter.
Who else would spoil her?

165
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,060
Jeez.

166
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,580
Not like you.

167
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,580
What do you mean?

168
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,700
I'm telling you. I...

169
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,860
I'll spoil my grandson too.

170
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,980
But don't coddle him too much.

171
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,980
I'll raise him right.

172
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,420
By then,

173
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,620
I'll probably be retired.

174
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,740
I'll make sure he becomes

175
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,340
a real man.

176
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,420
Imagine it.

177
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,060
He'll inherit his parents' best traits.

178
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,460
He'll be

179
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,980
at least 1.9 meters tall.

180
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,620
He'll study hard

181
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,826
and get into military school.

182
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,220
Once he graduates,

183
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,820
I'll send him to the navy.

184
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,540
Think about it.
A 1.9-meter-tall young man

185
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,820
who's stronger than Zong Qing

186
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,620
and in full navy uniform.

187
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,220
Standing on deck,

188
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,420
he'll be

189
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,700
the definition of a man.

190
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,580
You...

191
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:26,940
What's wrong?

192
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,340
Yangyang.

193
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,300
What's wrong?

194
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,580
I lost the baby.

195
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,220
I lost the baby.

196
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,740
Captain Wu.

197
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,740
Why are you here?

198
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,180
Dr. Qiu said you might be on deck,

199
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,580
so I came.

200
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,340
Sit.

201
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,060
- Is Wang Chen okay?
- Are you alright?

202
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,460
Wang Chen's injury isn't your fault.

203
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,420
It's my responsibility.

204
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,740
Can I go see her?

205
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,820
She needs rest.

206
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,460
Even we

207
00:14:25,804 --> 00:14:27,226
aren't allowed to visit.

208
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,940
I got you a gift.

209
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,180
You got me

210
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:45,940
a shell casing?

211
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,540
It contains

212
00:14:50,693 --> 00:14:53,404
seawater from our country's
historical territorial boundary.

213
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,220
Carrying it with you

214
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,740
is like
you're following in my footsteps.

215
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,220
I'm sorry, Wu Si.

216
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,220
Coming to Roman this time

217
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,980
made you worry.

218
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,426
What's the matter?

219
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,620
Attention.

220
00:15:33,826 --> 00:15:36,180
We're about to cross
the historical territorial line

221
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,620
and re-enter national waters.

222
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,300
Attention.

223
00:15:39,337 --> 00:15:41,620
We're about to cross
the historical territorial line

224
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,220
and re-enter national waters.

225
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,300
We're going home.

226
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,580
Mom.

227
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,360
Have you ever regretted

228
00:16:24,448 --> 00:16:25,700
marrying a soldier like Dad?

229
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,740
I never really thought about it.

230
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,220
But if I could choose again,

231
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,820
I'd still choose

232
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,340
to be your father's wife,

233
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,100
your mother,

234
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,220
and a soldier's partner.

235
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:47,980
Mom.

236
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,860
Military wives like you

237
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,820
are incredible.

238
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,700
You all deserve half
of their medals of honor.

239
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,860
But I think

240
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,820
I'm not a good military wife.

241
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,260
Dad once said

242
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,820
he worried

243
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,300
I couldn't be a soldier's wife.

244
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,960
Looks like he was right.

245
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,140
Do you regret it?

246
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,660
Military marriage is tough,

247
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,980
but I never imagined

248
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,626
it'd be this hard.

249
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,820
What I want from marriage

250
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,140
is really simple.

251
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,500
Just steady company

252
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,260
and thoughtful care.

253
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,780
But I now understand

254
00:17:51,315 --> 00:17:52,982
my husband's the most adorable

255
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,780
when the country

256
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,180
and the people

257
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,100
need him.

258
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,660
But when I need him most,

259
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,380
he's on TV,

260
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,020
on the phone,

261
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,340
or just out of reach.

262
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:14,820
Mom.

263
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,260
Tell me.

264
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,900
Was my decision back then too rash?

265
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,820
I hadn't even grown up myself.

266
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,340
I can't take on the responsibility

267
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,580
a soldier entrusts to his home and wife.

268
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,060
Yangyang.

269
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,060
Being a soldier

270
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,820
is a profession,

271
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,420
but being a military wife isn't.

272
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,580
I trust you.

273
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,900
And I understand how you feel.

274
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,900
But times have changed.

275
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,780
I just want you to understand

276
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,540
the many choices and challenges

277
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,380
in military marriage.

278
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,260
Soldiers like your dad

279
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,020
and Zong Qing

280
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,340
are remarkable people.

281
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,740
They're the ones

282
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,780
who quietly sacrifice and give

283
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,580
so that others can live in peace.

284
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,300
Someone must do it.

285
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,020
Because of them,

286
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,820
we get to live

287
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,580
in peace and happiness.

288
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,140
(Chinese People's Liberation Army)

289
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:47,460
(People's Liberation Army Navy)

290
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:02,940
(Escort Fleet Returns
After Mission in Gulf of Aden!)

291
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,260
Zong Qing and the others
are coming home.

292
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,660
(Honey, You Worked Hard)

293
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,100
(Daddy, I Missed You!)

294
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:40,820
Cheng Yuan.

295
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,500
Yes.

296
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,420
Once we disembark,

297
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,826
I'll take Wang Chen to the hospital.

298
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,980
You take Tang Xin home.

299
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:45,780
Got it.

300
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,420
(Zong Qing)

301
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,180
Yangyang.

302
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,780
Answer it.

303
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,020
(Zong Qing)

304
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,260
(Zong Qing)

305
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,420
Hello?

306
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,060
Zong Qing.

307
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,820
Hello, Dad?

308
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,580
Why is it you? Where's Yangyang?

309
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,580
She's showering.

310
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,340
Come home first.

311
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,780
Okay, I'm almost there.

312
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,580
See you soon, Dad.

313
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,020
Miss Tang.

314
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,020
Did you talk to Captain on board?

315
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,580
I wanted to,

316
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,380
but he was too busy.

317
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,420
I never had the chance.

318
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,020
Do you want to know

319
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,380
what he's like when he's not busy?

320
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,540
What's he like?

321
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:38,740
Captain

322
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,580
has done escorts before,

323
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,780
but this time, we all noticed

324
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,260
he wasn't like before.

325
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,820
He never went near the phone booths

326
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,380
and fought the others for the phone.

327
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,020
But this time,

328
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,540
we'd see him

329
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,380
every time we queued.

330
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,780
He wanted to call you.

331
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,020
But he got called away for duty twice

332
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,740
before it was his turn.

333
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,300
He recorded videos on his phone.

334
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,340
"Tang Xin, look at this sea.

335
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,420
Look at this sky.

336
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,300
At sunrise,

337
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,900
at sunset,

338
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,340
whenever it was beautiful."

339
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,020
You know,

340
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,780
life on board is very dull.

341
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,540
But he always wanted

342
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,300
to share
every beautiful moment with you.

343
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,980
Usually,

344
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,140
he has many duties on board.

345
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,060
But ever since

346
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,820
he rescued you from pirates

347
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,140
on that ship,

348
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,820
I could feel

349
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,540
that he's constantly
keeping an eye on you.

350
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,820
I really didn't know.

351
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,340
Yangyang.

352
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,820
Yangyang, don't do this.

353
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,260
I know you're upset.

354
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,100
Yangyang, listen to me and come out.

355
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,020
We'll face it together.

356
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:39,900
Yangyang.

357
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,540
Yangyang, don't do this.

358
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,420
Zong Qing keeps calling you.

359
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,100
Yangyang.

360
00:24:45,893 --> 00:24:47,760
(188 Big Big Wolf Forever:
Honey, wait for me.)

361
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,340
Yangyang!

362
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,300
I'll be home soon.

363
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:51,580
Yangyang.

364
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,260
Will you come out? Be good.

365
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,100
- Don't lock yourself in.
- Stop knocking.

366
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:58,900
Look.

367
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,660
He'll be here soon.

368
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,020
What should we do?

369
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,020
Yangyang, you...

370
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,020
Let's go.

371
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,020
Well...

372
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,140
There's no use knocking now.

373
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,260
She won't open the door.

374
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,020
What do we do? He's almost...

375
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,260
He's almost here.

376
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,260
Look at her.

377
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,420
I'm so worried. I...

378
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,580
It breaks my heart.

379
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,780
She's our daughter.

380
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,420
We're both heartbroken,

381
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,100
but...

382
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,500
We have to face this.

383
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,180
How do we face it?

384
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:32,980
Here.

385
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,420
When Zong Qing walks in,

386
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,260
you tell him.

387
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,300
Okay, I'll...

388
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,580
I'll tell him?

389
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,300
Yes.

390
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,420
How can I tell him?

391
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,140
This

392
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,100
is a woman's issue after all.

393
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,980
So it's better that you tell him.

394
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,060
But I really can't tell him

395
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,260
such a thing.

396
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,420
It's a family matter.

397
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,660
Something happened at home.

398
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,780
You're the mistress.

399
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,560
Of course
it's appropriate that you tell him.

400
00:25:57,582 --> 00:25:58,848
You're the head of the family.

401
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,060
You tell him.

402
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:01,820
No, this...

403
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,820
I...

404
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,580
You're here.

405
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:08,820
Dad.

406
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,100
Give it to me. Here. Come in.

407
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:11,660
Mom.

408
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,380
You're back.

409
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:14,960
- Look at you.
- You've lost weight.

410
00:26:15,004 --> 00:26:16,226
He's gotten tanned too,

411
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,540
but he looks stronger.

412
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,740
Hurry. Sit.

413
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,260
You've worked hard.

414
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,540
It's my duty.

415
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,900
How have you been, Dad?

416
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,100
I'm doing just fine.

417
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,260
Is work busy?

418
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,820
The army's never not busy.

419
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,820
Mom, how about you?

420
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,540
I'm doing well.

421
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,060
Look, I bought baby clothes

422
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,340
on the way back.

423
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,180
I don't know if Yangyang will like them.

424
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,060
Where's Yangyang?

425
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,420
Yangyang...

426
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,260
Yangyang went out to buy fruit.

427
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,260
Jeez.

428
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,900
There's plenty of fruit at home.

429
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,020
Why buy more?

430
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,660
She said the fruit here

431
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,900
has been sitting too long.

432
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,300
They're all shriveled and not fresh.

433
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,340
She wanted to get you the freshest.

434
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,780
Well...

435
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,140
Zong Qing, tell me

436
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,780
if anything interesting happened

437
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,180
- on your escort trip.
- Yes.

438
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,740
Something unexpected did happen.

439
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,340
A group of pirates
hijacked a cargo ship.

440
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,300
The ship sent us a distress signal.

441
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:17,780
Look.

442
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,380
Well...

443
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,140
Tell me more. Hurry.

444
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,580
You didn't know, Dad?

445
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,340
I knew.

446
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,060
I just wanted to hear it from you.

447
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,300
Tell me.

448
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,780
Well, what happened

449
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,100
was that the cargo ship
was hijacked by armed militants.

450
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,980
Two hostages were abducted on board.

451
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,300
Mom!

452
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,780
Look at you. What a mess.

453
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,900
Jeez, clean that up.

454
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,540
You're too focused on the story. Jeez.

455
00:27:48,671 --> 00:27:49,620
Yes.

456
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,020
Well, what happened afterward?

457
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,140
Well...

458
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,140
Well... Why is this phone with me?

459
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:12,900
Dad, Mom.

460
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,420
What happened?

461
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,820
Tell me the truth.

462
00:28:20,004 --> 00:28:21,580
Did something happen to Yangyang?

463
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,180
No.

464
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,340
No.

465
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,740
Nothing happened.

466
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,820
Nothing.

467
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,620
Zong Qing.

468
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,780
Here's the thing.

469
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,100
We're sorry.

470
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,820
While you were away,

471
00:28:41,693 --> 00:28:43,340
we didn't take good care of Yangyang.

472
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,540
Your baby

473
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,660
is gone.

474
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,780
Yes.

475
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,580
Mom, where's Yangyang?

476
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:04,780
Yangyang's

477
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,380
in her room.

478
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,780
We couldn't get her to come out.

479
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:10,900
Zong Qing.

480
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,260
Yangyang.

481
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:24,820
It's me.

482
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,260
Open the door.

483
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,540
Yangyang.

484
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,580
No matter what happened, open the door.

485
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,020
Let me see you.

486
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,140
Are you...

487
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,100
Okay?

488
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,900
Can you talk to me first?

489
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,660
We haven't seen each other in so long.
Don't you miss me?

490
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,900
You must be scared.

491
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,420
These days on the ship,

492
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,780
I thought of you every day.

493
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,260
I worried if you

494
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,820
and the baby were okay.

495
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,580
I dreamed of coming home.

496
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,340
I'm sorry

497
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,020
for making you go through this alone,

498
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,100
but I'm back now.

499
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,820
I'll keep you company.

500
00:30:34,604 --> 00:30:36,537
It's okay
if you don't want to open the door.

501
00:30:37,315 --> 00:30:38,826
I'll keep you company right here.

502
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,140
Thanks for sending me home.

503
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,820
No need to be polite with me.

504
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,300
I told you so much

505
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,180
about Captain today.

506
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,980
Don't tell him I told you.

507
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,340
Sure, I won't.

508
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,900
Rest well now that you're back.

509
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,420
After what happened,

510
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,900
you must be exhausted.

511
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,260
It's not too bad,

512
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,300
but it's indeed quite intense.

513
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,980
Alright, go home. I'll head inside.

514
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,660
Okay, bye.

515
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:33,860
Captain.

516
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,420
Don't move.

517
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,580
How are you?

518
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,260
I can't feel anything.

519
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,900
They just don't feel like my legs.

520
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,020
Where's Qiu Xiao?

521
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,980
She's handling my paperwork.

522
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,980
I don't need company.

523
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,500
There are doctors and nurses.

524
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,060
Qiu Xiao was sent by Brigadier.

525
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,420
Before Mr. Bai arrives,

526
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,740
someone must watch over you.

527
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,180
He won't come.

528
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,180
I didn't tell him.

529
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,020
You kept such a big thing from him?

530
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,820
I dare not tell him.

531
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,340
Even when I got minor injuries,

532
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,780
he stayed up all night worrying.

533
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,420
There's no way
I can tell him about this.

534
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,380
My mother-in-law was against

535
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,660
him coming to Wenzhou.

536
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,020
She only agreed reluctantly
for me to get pregnant.

537
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,660
Not having children

538
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,420
is already a sore spot for us.

539
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,500
With my injury,

540
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,180
I can't worry them even more.

541
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,340
But Mr. Bai has the right to know.

542
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,580
I know.

543
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,020
Give it a few days.

544
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,020
Once I get a bit better,

545
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,340
I'll tell him right away.

546
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,780
This kind of injury won't heal fast.

547
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,340
Captain Wu, Captain Chen.

548
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,980
I'm the brigade's doctor

549
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,500
and your comrade.

550
00:32:51,871 --> 00:32:53,071
I believe it's necessary

551
00:32:53,093 --> 00:32:55,180
to tell you the real situation.

552
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,380
The Achilles tendon

553
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,380
is the strongest
in the human lower leg.

554
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,540
Almost all lower-body movement

555
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,140
depends on it.

556
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:04,820
Even a sprain

557
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,660
is hard to fully heal.

558
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,260
Let alone

559
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,460
an injury caused by shrapnel...

560
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,300
Qiu Xiao.

561
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,580
It's okay, Captain.

562
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,260
I'll face it sooner or later anyway.

563
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,500
I want to know the truth.

564
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,260
When we were on the ship,

565
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,620
we treated it immediately.

566
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,580
We'll have a joint consultation
with the military hospital,

567
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,540
but medical help has its limits.

568
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:38,260
Your recovery is up to you.

569
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,900
I believe with strict physiotherapy,

570
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,380
you'll recover

571
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,140
and resume a normal life soon.

572
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,900
But don't rush it.

573
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,060
Face the reality.

574
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,620
I will.

575
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,380
Thank you.

576
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,180
Still won't tell your family?

577
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,100
Tell Zijian first then.

578
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,220
Better keep this

579
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,620
from my mother-in-law first.

580
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,220
I promised her before I left

581
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,140
that I'd return safe and sound.

582
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,860
I made other promises too.

583
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,020
I don't want to break my promise.

584
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,060
Please help me

585
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,220
keep it a secret for now.

586
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,900
Mr. Tian, I'm here to report to you.

587
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,100
You're back.

588
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,620
If you wrote

589
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,900
about your experience,

590
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,300
it'd go viral.

591
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,580
But it can't be reported yet.

592
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,420
I don't want
to affect the investigation.

593
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,740
Don't worry, I know.

594
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,700
I'll remember your merits.

595
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,260
Once the investigation completes,

596
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,540
we'll write a proper feature.

597
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,020
By the way,
you're not allowed to investigate

598
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,860
this matter on your own from now on.

599
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,660
You must report it.

600
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,380
I'm responsible for your safety.

601
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,460
If anything happens,

602
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,140
how do I explain it to the higher-ups

603
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,260
or face your parents?

604
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,420
Alright, I'll be more careful.

605
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,580
Also,

606
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,540
no one ran your column

607
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,780
when you're gone.

608
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,380
It's not what it used to be.

609
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,540
Rest for a few days first.

610
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,380
Choose a good topic

611
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,580
and resurrect your column.

612
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,740
I'm sorry.

613
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,100
I'm sorry. I failed you,

614
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,420
our son

615
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,660
and our daughter. I'm sorry.

616
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,660
Alright, enough with the apologies.

617
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,220
The three of us are doing fine.

618
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,700
I wasn't there when our son was born.

619
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,060
I'm not around
during our daughter's birth either.

620
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,660
Alright.

621
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,580
You don't have to stay with me daily.

622
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,580
Having our son and daughter is enough.

623
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,260
You've lost so much weight.

624
00:36:37,893 --> 00:36:39,180
Take a look at your daughter.

625
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,620
Isn't she cute?

626
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:48,100
The political commissar arranged
everything well while you were gone.

627
00:36:50,848 --> 00:36:52,100
When you go back to the unit,

628
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,180
- remember to thank them.
- Okay.

629
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,620
Alright, baby.

630
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,460
This whole thing happened so suddenly.

631
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,700
If Yangyang hadn't been there,

632
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,740
I still get scared thinking of it.

633
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,300
Dad!

634
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,500
Zhaoyang!

635
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,380
I missed you so much.

636
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,100
Why is your bag so heavy?

637
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,060
Mom's spare clothes,

638
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,540
my sister's diapers,

639
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,940
and Mom's vitamins from the doctor.

640
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,780
Also...

641
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,140
Alright.

642
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,540
While I was gone,

643
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,180
you took care of Mom for me.

644
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,540
Good job.

645
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,220
You're better than your dad.

646
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,860
We should thank Yangyang too.

647
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,100
During my sister's birth,

648
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,900
Yangyang stayed with Mom.

649
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,180
When Mom's discharged, let's visit her.

650
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,420
Sure.

651
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,180
If she had a boy,

652
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,220
let's betroth the babies.

653
00:37:47,826 --> 00:37:49,300
You're already thinking that far?

654
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,740
You really are a brigadier. Jeez.

655
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,540
Come on, see your sister.

656
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,740
Isn't she cute?

657
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,220
From now on,

658
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,420
you're a big brother.

659
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,140
Take care of her, okay?

660
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,100
Got it.

661
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,540
Pinky.

662
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,220
Honey.

663
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,460
I'm sorry.

664
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,940
I don't know

665
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,860
why this happened.

666
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,580
It's all my fault.

667
00:39:01,004 --> 00:39:01,860
It's not your fault.

668
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,700
How could I blame you?

669
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,100
It's my fault.

670
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,380
I know you're already very careful.

671
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,100
Right?

672
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,300
I shouldn't have left you at home alone.

673
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,260
I wanted

674
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:22,060
to wait for you at home with the baby.

675
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,980
I'm home now.

676
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,260
Right?

677
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,540
I'll be by your side

678
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,300
from now on.

679
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:06,780
Mr. Han.

680
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,740
Call Chairman
to let him know you're safe.

681
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,420
He called me every day recently.

682
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,700
He asked where you went.

683
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:14,780
I told him

684
00:40:15,226 --> 00:40:16,380
I'd tell you to call him

685
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,300
as soon as I saw you.

686
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,380
No.

687
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,060
You call.

688
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,540
What should I say?

689
00:40:23,715 --> 00:40:25,140
Just let him know I'm safe, right?

690
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,100
Tell him I came back safe and sound.

691
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,380
You know nothing else.

692
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:30,700
Got it.

693
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,580
She's back. Look.

694
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,380
Hurry.

695
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,740
Yes. What are you doing?

696
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,100
- Don't.
- No.

697
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,580
- I'll call her.
- No.

698
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,740
- What are you doing?
- No.

699
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,740
She's carrying so much stuff. Look.

700
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:58,790
Get her.

701
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,900
I'll get her. Hurry.

702
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,220
Great. She's finally home.

703
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,220
No.

704
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,620
What no?

705
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,140
Sit down.

706
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:09,860
Sit.

707
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,220
Xin, you're home.

708
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:18,060
Dad, Mom, I'm home.

709
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,100
Darling,
why are you carrying so many things?

710
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,220
Is it heavy?

711
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,540
My darling girl.

712
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,380
I missed you so much.

713
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,071
I missed you too, Mom.

714
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,860
Let me see. Are you tired?

715
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,140
No, I'm fine.

716
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,420
Quick. Someone's jealous.

717
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,140
Dad.

718
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:43,900
I'm home.

719
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,540
You called me?

720
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,380
Hurry.

721
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,500
Hello.

722
00:41:59,220 --> 00:41:59,940
Seriously?

723
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,980
I'm home.

724
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,580
I'm home safe and sound.

725
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,182
That's good.

726
00:42:04,204 --> 00:42:06,140
Look, I bought you so many things.

727
00:42:07,826 --> 00:42:09,380
The store downstairs has those too.

728
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,780
Dad.

729
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,700
- She's just being thoughtful. You...
- Wait.

730
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,980
I want to solemnly tell you something.

731
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:17,940
Go ahead.

732
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,580
I was gone for many days.

733
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,100
1 month, 3 days and 13 hours.

734
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,100
A near-death escape.

735
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,620
Yes.

736
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,740
It's also the first time
I've been away this long.

737
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,740
I really missed home.

738
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,700
I used to say you were never home.

739
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,660
I didn't get it as a kid,

740
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,100
but this time,

741
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,180
I understand better now.

742
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,100
It's your years of being away

743
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:55,580
that gave us a peaceful, happy

744
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,740
and carefree life.

745
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,260
Thank you, Captain Tang.

746
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:06,660
