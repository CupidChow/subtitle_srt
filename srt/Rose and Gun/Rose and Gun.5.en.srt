I'll leave that to you.)

Where are we going now?

23
00:02:36,626 --> 00:02:38,182
What time are you heading back to unit?

24
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,320
I think

25
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,690
it doesn't matter

26
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,010
who saved you that day.

27
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,130
What's done is done.

28
00:02:51,448 --> 00:02:53,410
You've seen
the "Superwoman" coverage, right?

29
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,780
My job

30
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,980
is to uncover the truth.

31
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,500
Besides,

32
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,940
you probably don't know

33
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,340
what really happened that day.

34
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,940
I've been on plenty of ships
with my dad since I was little.

35
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,700
But I've never been that afraid
of the sea until that day.

36
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,060
So I can't just brush it off.

37
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,700
I can't just let it go.

38
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,700
If that's what's bothering you,

39
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,500
I can tell you clearly

40
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,940
that he's perfectly fine.

41
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,340
You've been asking me questions.

42
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,700
I've got one for you too.

43
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,100
Why did you go out to sea that day?

44
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:40,700
I...

45
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,100
I actually got an anonymous email.

46
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,900
The sender claimed

47
00:03:49,982 --> 00:03:51,500
that in Wenzhou's territorial waters,

48
00:03:51,737 --> 00:03:53,780
someone was illegally
salvaging sunken artifacts.

49
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:56,310
But there was no evidence,
so it was hard to file a case.

50
00:03:56,315 --> 00:03:58,404
So they hoped I'd help gather proof

51
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,220
to stop the illegal salvaging.

52
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,260
(Maritime Police)

53
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,380
What a coincidence.

54
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,580
Xin went out to sea a few days ago too.

55
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,700
She was in Dayan Reef.

56
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,700
Did you see the news?

57
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,380
She made it onto the national news?

58
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,700
Not that kind of news.

59
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,220
Just online news.

60
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,100
I don't really follow online news.

61
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:16,660
Some of your fellow soldiers
were there too.

62
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,700
Haven't you heard?

63
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,900
We're not really allowed
to talk about that.

64
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,900
Just ask around.

65
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,700
The thing is
I don't like to ask questions.

66
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,071
When my teacher asked me one,
I always refused to answer it.

67
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:39,820
Zong Qing.

68
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,700
Coming.

69
00:05:44,337 --> 00:05:45,340
What can I do for you?

70
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,020
Be honest with me.

71
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,360
Is it because of the rules
that you can't tell me about it,

72
00:05:51,404 --> 00:05:52,760
or did someone tell you not to?

73
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,220
I am being honest.

74
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,315
I've never liked asking questions
since I was a kid.

75
00:05:57,937 --> 00:05:58,929
Do you have a rule like

76
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,900
you can't take the credit
when doing a good deed?

77
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,020
Then why won't you admit you saved Xin?

78
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,820
Saved Xin?

79
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,340
What happened to her?

80
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,900
What happened?

81
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,260
Reporting.

82
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,820

83
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,460
Go.

84
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,100
Quick. Move...

85
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,380

86
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,020

87
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,380
You're improving.

(Chinese People's Liberation Army)

89
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:55,404
Please have a seat.

90
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,260
Thank you.

91
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,140
Please wait a moment.
They'll be here soon.

92
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,380
They?

93
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,140
Yeah, those you're here to interview.

94
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,700
I thought I was interviewing you?

95
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,340
Trying to sneak away again?

96
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,380
No.

97
00:07:12,826 --> 00:07:13,780
The Blue Blade has got

98
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,780
some seriously famous "Iron Roses."

99
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,160
Don't you want to interview them?

100
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,940
"Iron Roses"?

101
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,580
You mean female soldiers?

102
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,140
Yeah.

103
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,140
Reporting.

104
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,700
Perfect timing.

105
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,460
Come in.

106
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,700
Here, let me introduce.

107
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,900
Squad leader Wang Chen.

108
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,500
Political instructor Jiang Yajie.

109
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,515
This is Tang Xin,
a reporter from Minghua News.

110
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,140
- Hello.
- Hello.

111
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:42,940
Hello.

112
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,900
I'll leave you to it.

113
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,460
Miss Tang, please sit.

114
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,580
Captain Wang,

115
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,460
Captain Wu just told me

116
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,820
that you were involved

117
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,260
in the Dayan Reef Rescue too.

118
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,460
Yes.

119
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,900
But I guess

120
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,340
you've probably already interviewed

121
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,580
Captain Wu and Cheng Yuan.

122
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,940
What we know is basically the same.

123
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,900
So let's not talk
about Dayan Reef today.

124
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,260
Let's talk about female soldiers.

125
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,900
There's really nothing special
about female soldiers.

126
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,580
There's no gender on the battlefield.

127
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,820
We're all part of the Marine Corps,

128
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,700
and we receive
the same special ops training.

129
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,460
Wang Chen's professional skills

130
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,780
crush most of our male colleagues.

131
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,100
She's the top female frogman
in Blue Blade.

132
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,580
Captain Wang,

133
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,260
how many years have you served?

134
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,420
Eleven years.

135
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,540
If I don't mind me asking,
are you married?

136
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,100
Yes.

137
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,340
You've served so long,

138
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,460
and you're on the front line.

139
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,940
Is your spouse...

140
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,700
Sorry.

141
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,420
I'd rather not talk much
about my personal matters.

142
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,100
My apologies.

143
00:08:54,426 --> 00:08:55,129
Sorry.

144
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,620
It's a team call. I've got to take it.

145
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,340
Go ahead.

146
00:08:58,671 --> 00:08:59,940
Please don't take it to heart.

147
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,980
Wang Chen isn't avoiding the interview.

148
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,810
The thing is she's reluctant
to talk much about her personal stuff.

149
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,100
She's been stressed lately
because of her family.

150
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,540
(She and her partner live apart.)

151
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,340
(They have a great relationship,)

152
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,460
(but they haven't had children yet.)

153
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:18,940
Miss Tang.

154
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:21,382
You said you wanted to talk
about female soldiers.

155
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,340
Do you want to hear what I really think?

156
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,820
Of course.

157
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,860
Like I said,

158
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,540
there's no gender on the battlefield.

159
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,100
We get the same training as the men.

160
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,940
But I didn't tell you this.

161
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,340
To carry out missions
just as intense as the men,

162
00:09:39,471 --> 00:09:41,940
we female soldiers have
to push through many physical limits.

163
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,180
That's our duty.

164
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,620
No female soldier

165
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,100
feels wronged by the training.

166
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,540
But training

167
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,940
isn't all there is to life.

168
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,340
After training ends,

169
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,420
I miss home

170
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,980
and my husband too.

171
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,100
As a soldier,

172
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,700
giving your all for the mission
is expected.

173
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,940
But I'm also a wife

174
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,540
and a daughter.

175
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,940
Even now,

176
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,220
I still struggle
to balance all those roles.

177
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,540
Captain Wang.

178
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,540
I've never served in the military,

179
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,460
but I'm a woman too.

180
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,060
I really understand your difficulties.

181
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,180
I can't suggest you solutions
about marriage,

182
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,940
but if you ever feel down

183
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,540
and want someone to talk to,

184
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,100
you can call me.

185
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,540
I'll always be available.

186
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,420
Thank you.

187
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,500
(Visitors entering the camp
must present ID.)

188
00:10:47,804 --> 00:10:48,860
Greetings, Captain Chen.

189
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,420
There's a woman outside asking for you.

190
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,180
Miss Tang, I'll step out for a bit.

191
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,540
You can handle the paperwork here.

192
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,580
I'm Wang Chen.

193
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,340
And who are you?

194
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,860
I'm a colleague of Mr. Bai.

195
00:11:12,937 --> 00:11:14,420
I helped him collect something once,

196
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,860
so I had your address.

197
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,820
You must be Luo Tong, right?

198
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,820
Say what you came to say.

199
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,220
Did you know? Mr. Bai came to Wenzhou.

200
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,580
What's that got to do with you?

201
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,700
You've got it wrong, Miss.

202
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,340
I'm not here to cause trouble.

203
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,180
I just wanted to see Mr. Bai.

204
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,340
Mr. Bai is a really good person.

205
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,980
If you truly love him,

206
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,180
you wouldn't let him

207
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,540
live a lonely life.

208
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,820
Whether I love my husband or not
is none of your business.

209
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,340
What goes on between us

210
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,820
isn't something you need to worry about.

211
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,060
Also, loitering near the camp gate
is not allowed.

212
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,220
You should leave now.

213
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,180
Miss Tang, pardon me,

214
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,420
but I won't walk you out.

215
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,460
Do you have a moment to talk?

216
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,220
Who are you?

217
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,860
I'm a friend of Captain Wang Chen.

218
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,940
I know a lot about her.

219
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,220
Don't you want to hear?

220
00:12:17,248 --> 00:12:18,871
- Greetings, Captain
- Greetings, Captain

221
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:21,248
- Greetings, Captain
- Greetings, Captain

222
00:12:21,271 --> 00:12:22,137
Greetings, Captain.

223
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:26,940
Wang Chen.

224
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:30,940
What's the matter?

225
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,580
Did Tang Xin say something out of line

226
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,580
that upset you?

227
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,180
No, it's not about Miss Tang.

228
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,893
She's nothing but nice.

229
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,940
Then what is it?

230
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,270
You look pretty down.

231
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,180
It's nothing.

232
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,150
Answer the question.

233
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,693
I just ran into someone
I didn't want to see at the gate.

234
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:49,890
That put me in a bad mood.

235
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:50,980
Who was it?

236
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,580
A girl who idolizes Bai Zijian

237
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,180
came to see me.

238
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,700
A silly girl, really.

239
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,540
Was Tang Xin there too?

240
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,060
I'd just walked her out

241
00:13:03,093 --> 00:13:04,380
when I bumped into that girl.

242
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,620
What are you trying to tell me
about Wang Chen?

243
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,020
How did you meet Mr. Bai?

244
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,204
How long have you known him?

245
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,060
We're colleagues.

246
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,260
He was the supervisor

247
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,337
for my internship project.

248
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,140
I had no idea he was married at first.

249
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,820
We studied together.

250
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,180
We went out on surveys together.

251
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,420
We worked late and had long discussions.

252
00:13:31,271 --> 00:13:32,915
Mr. Bai is both professional and gentle

253
00:13:32,915 --> 00:13:34,180
when he's at work.

254
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,140
Many of our female colleagues

255
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:36,900
like him.

256
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,420
Well, does he know you're all into him?

257
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,660
How did he react to that?

258
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,420
He was taken aback.

259
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,140
And he even avoided us at our sight.

260
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,540
I didn't even manage to confess to him.

261
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,300
He even told us clearly

262
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,820
that he only loves his wife.

263
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,940
He sees us just as students or kids.

264
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,693
He even advised us
to focus on our studies.

265
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,420
After that,
I didn't see him for a long time.

266
00:14:02,737 --> 00:14:04,020
When he saw me, he avoided me.

267
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,940
Mr. Bai has made himself clear.

268
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,540
So, why'd you still come

269
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,660
all this way to see Wang Chen?

270
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,780
I just wanted to see who Wang Chen is.

271
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,020
I didn't believe it.

272
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,900
Mr. Bai always lived and worked alone.

273
00:14:16,937 --> 00:14:19,300
I thought it was just an excuse
when he said he was married.

274
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,820
Turns out

275
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,380
Mr. Bai didn't lie to me.

276
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,660
Did you know how Wang Chen

277
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,540
and Mr. Bai met?

278
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,599
They took the exam together

279
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,493
for the Professional Association
of Diving Instructors.

280
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,380
Diving is their shared passion.

281
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,060
Later, they both chose

282
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,260
ocean-related careers.

283
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,380
Have you heard of frogmen?

284
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,180
When she was selected
for frogman training,

285
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,900
she and her teammates

286
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,700
were airdropped onto a deserted island.

287
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,900
They had to endure seven days
of extreme physical challenges

288
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,900
and locate the remaining armed weapons
on the island.

289
00:15:09,093 --> 00:15:11,540
In the end, Wang Chen was
the only one who made it back.

290
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,700
No teammates.

291
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,900
No commands.

292
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,780
She swam for seven hours

293
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,260
before reaching shore.

294
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,180
What's the point of telling me all this?

295
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,500
Wang Chen joined the army at eighteen.

296
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,020
It's been eleven years now.

297
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,300
Step by step,

298
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,404
she was promoted
into the special ops team.

299
00:15:43,093 --> 00:15:45,300
There was a female reporter here.
Where did she go?

300
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,620
She went that way.

301
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,420
Alright, thanks.

302
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,140
Combat swimming.

303
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,420
Stealth diving.

304
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,620
Demolition shooting.

305
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,493
She's been serving
in the military for years.

306
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,620
Now you want to hurt a soldier like her?

307
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,060
Do you really think that's okay?

308
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,020
I know Wang Chen has it tough.

309
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,600
But is it easy for Mr. Bai?

310
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,540
He doesn't live
like a married man at all.

311
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,300
It's not just about seeing each other.

312
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,737
He has to work around Wang Chen's
schedule to have a phone call.

313
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,060
He comes home
to an empty house every day.

314
00:16:19,404 --> 00:16:20,700
His job's already so demanding,

315
00:16:20,715 --> 00:16:22,760
and he still has to care
for all their parents.

316
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,420
How is any of that his fault?

317
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,900
I respect Wang Chen.

318
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,660
But I care even more about Mr. Bai.

319
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,900
I want him to be happy.

320
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,180
You don't sound like you respect her.

321
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,540
All I see is you hurting a soldier,

322
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,300
a family, and a military marriage.

323
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,380
She gave the best years of her life

324
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,420
to the military.

325
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,780
She's always at the front line.

326
00:16:40,937 --> 00:16:42,380
Doesn't a soldier like her deserve

327
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,140
our respect and protection?

328
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,420
But if their marriage is unhappy,

329
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,900
what does being a soldier
have to do with it?

330
00:16:48,915 --> 00:16:50,500
Whether their marriage is happy or not,

331
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,540
what's it got to do with you?

332
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,500
Besides...

333
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,780
It's already 2019. I can't believe

334
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,500
I still have to explain this to you.

335
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,660
In our country, military marriages
are legally protected.

336
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,900
Anyone who disrupts
a serving soldier's marriage

337
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,660
can be held criminally liable.

338
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,470
Do you understand
what "serving soldier" means?

339
00:17:05,471 --> 00:17:06,660
Wang Chen is a serving soldier.

340
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,900
A marriage protected
only by law won't last.

341
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,220
Wang Chen just isn't right for Mr. Bai.

342
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,820
Why are you always taking her side?

343
00:17:15,337 --> 00:17:17,248
Because my family member
is in the military too.

344
00:17:17,293 --> 00:17:18,660
Let me tell you, what you're doing

345
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,893
doesn't just affect a soldier.

346
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:21,380
It affects every military family.

347
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,460
Miss.

348
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,140
Have you ever been in love?
Who are you to be lecturing me?

349
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,660
Have you ever loved someone?

350
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,900
Do you even know what love is?

351
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,460
Girl.

352
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,060
Even if I've never been in love,

353
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,140
I can still tell you what love is.

354
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,660
Love is understanding without bias.

355
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,820
It's tolerance.
It's responsibility. It's loyalty.

356
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,620
It's the purest thing in this world.

357
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,180
What you think is love isn't love.

358
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,900
It's simply your curiosity,

359
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,340
possessiveness,
and emotional fantasy. Got it?

360
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,900
Miss, if that's your opinion,

361
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,840
then there's no point
continuing this conversation.

362
00:17:58,848 --> 00:17:59,737
I'll take my leave.

363
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,620
Hello.

364
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,660
Who are you?

365
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,580
I'm Wu Si, Wang Chen's captain.

366
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,580
I'd like to have a word with you.

367
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,420
Please sit.

368
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,700
Why are you here?

369
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,580
Wang Chen told me about it.

370
00:18:22,582 --> 00:18:24,515
I figured
you wouldn't leave just like that.

371
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,820
Miss Luo.

372
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,700
Didn't you want to speak to Wang Chen?

373
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,220
This is her captain.

374
00:18:30,226 --> 00:18:32,271
Why don't you tell him
what's on your mind?

375
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,900
Sorry, Miss.

376
00:18:34,271 --> 00:18:36,420
I wasn't trying to eavesdrop
on your conversation.

377
00:18:36,471 --> 00:18:38,140
But since this concerns my teammate,

378
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,580
I need to understand the situation.

379
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,220
I didn't even do anything.

380
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,900
I just have a crush on Mr. Bai.

381
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,980
Is it a crime to like someone?

382
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,900
That isn't a crime.

383
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,060
But the one you like
is a military spouse.

384
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,460
He built a family with a soldier.

385
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,380
So military spouses can't get divorced?

386
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,180
Well, he's doing just fine.

387
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,980
Why would he get divorced?

388
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,220
Just because of the love story
you made up?

389
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,380
Didn't you say

390
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,426
nothing is going on
between you and Mr. Bai?

391
00:19:03,426 --> 00:19:05,380
If he weren't being kind
because you're young,

392
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,626
he could've reported you
for harassment and defamation.

393
00:19:07,626 --> 00:19:09,420
Don't you try to bluff me.

394
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,820
It's just a crush. What law did I break?

395
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,820
Sir. This old lady is threatening me.
Aren't you going to do something?

396
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,660
Who are you calling old lady?

397
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,060
You're not even a military officer.

398
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:20,671
What gives you the right to lecture me?

399
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,580
Old lady.

400
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,500
Say that one more time!

401
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,500
Sit down first.

402
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,420
Calm down.

403
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,860
She may not be your superior,

404
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,740
but she's a military spouse.

405
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,820
She's my wife.

406
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,660
She's your wife?

407
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:38,900
Yes.

408
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,260
I'm Wang Chen's superior.

409
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,500
She is my family member.

410
00:19:42,671 --> 00:19:44,060
So she has the right to speak up.

411
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,860
You heard that? I have the right to...

412
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,460
Come on.

413
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,537
She called me an old lady.
Didn't you hear that?

414
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,420
We'll deal with that later.

415
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,580
Hold on.

416
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,660
Didn't you say
you've never been in love?

417
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,420
How come you're his wife?

418
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,900
Well...

419
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,740
You've never been in love?

420
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,260
So I can't get married
just because I've never been in love?

421
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,180
We met through a matchmaker.
Is that a problem?

422
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,220
It was love at first sight.
We got married right away.

423
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,660
Is that a problem?

424
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,260
No problem.

425
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,180
See?

426
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,580
You got married
because you loved each other.

427
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,180
Then why can't I be with Mr. Bai?

428
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,730
Bai Zijian loves Wang Chen.

429
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,860
Before they even got married,

430
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,893
he already knew what kind
of soldier Wang Chen was.

431
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,180
And Wang Chen told him

432
00:20:37,248 --> 00:20:38,293
that after marriage,

433
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,248
they'd face all kinds of challenges.

434
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,660
But they still chose to be together.

435
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,180
The military

436
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,420
isn't about denying marriage freedom.

437
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,060
It's about protecting

438
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,900
those brave enough
to walk that path together.

439
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,660
After all,

440
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,860
it's pretty rare for us soldiers

441
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,740
to meet

442
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,340
someone we love.

443
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,180
You're still young.

444
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,100
It's a wonderful future ahead.

445
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,900
Someday you'll meet

446
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,660
someone you love,
and who loves you back.

447
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,580
But it won't be Bai Zijian.

448
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,260
So...

449
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,820
We won't hurt you.

450
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,100
But please don't hurt Wang Chen either.

451
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,420
Okay?

452
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,100
Zong Qing.

453
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,700
Did you always know

454
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,900
what you wanted to do with your life?

455
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,980
Me?

456
00:21:33,737 --> 00:21:35,620
I didn't have it
all figured out back then.

457
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,700
But I liked guns and cannons as a kid.

458
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,460
I guess most boys do.

459
00:21:40,782 --> 00:21:42,700
So I chose to go
to military school for college,

460
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,980
and I majored
in communications engineering.

461
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,700
I made that decision
based on my interests.

462
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,380
By junior year,

463
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,980
I was feeling a bit lost.

464
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,500
Then what happened?

465
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,420
How did you decide

466
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,940
to join the Marine Corps?

467
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,660
It was actually a total coincidence.

468
00:21:57,937 --> 00:21:59,026
At the time, the Marine Corps

469
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,820
was doing special recruitment
at our school.

470
00:22:00,826 --> 00:22:02,260
There was a presentation.

471
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,380
The moment I heard it,

472
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,620
I got goosebumps.

473
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:08,140
Right then I knew
what I wanted to do with my life.

474
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,220
For real?

475
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,700
So you signed up right away?

476
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,140
Well, not that fast.

477
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,500
I hesitated

478
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,860
for a whole night.

479
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,180
It was mainly because

480
00:22:20,204 --> 00:22:21,782
our political commissar kept bugging me.

481
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,620
He kept saying stuff like,

482
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,500
"You'll regret joining for two years,

483
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,220
but you'll regret not joining for life."

484
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,620
I'm telling you,

485
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,660
I was

486
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,860
the president of the swim club.

487
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,380
A national second-level athlete.

488
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,620
Maybe it was all just fate.

489
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,380
That's great. How lucky you've been.

490
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,620
You've got your path figured.

491
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,180
Unlike me.

492
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,940
I have no clue

493
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,900
about my future at all.

494
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,140
Why'd you bring me back here again?

495
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,860
Lights out is soon.

496
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,420
I can't walk you back.

497
00:22:59,626 --> 00:23:01,380
You should call a cab
from inside the base.

498
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,620
It'll be safer.

499
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,980
That's surprisingly thoughtful.

500
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,740
(Choose Wenzhou Taxi)

501
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,740
The cab's taking forever.

502
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,737
Then let's chat a bit while we wait.

503
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,140
Let's start some awkward small talk.

504
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,715
When did you find out
about Wang Chen's marriage?

505
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,100
Well, I came to know about it

506
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:44,980
during the interview.

507
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,220
Also, it happened right at the gate.

508
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,100
Of course, I had to step in.

509
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,980
I knew you would.

510
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,140
But if Luo Tong had refused
to heed your advice,

511
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,140
what would you do?

512
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,740
If she refused to heed my advice,

513
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,740
I'd introduce her to Han Yuhang.

514
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,620
Freeing Mr. Bai would be the priority.

515
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,380
I'm kidding.

516
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,500
Han Yuhang is good-looking,

517
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,180
but he's not right for a young girl.

518
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,380
Is he really that handsome?

519
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,380
He is quite so.

520
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,740
But in my opinion,

521
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,740
you're more pleasing to the eye.

522
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,380
Well...

523
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,220
You didn't know Wang Chen,

524
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,700
but why were you helping her?

525
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,620
Didn't you say
I'm also a military spouse?

526
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,420
Of course I had
to help resolve the issue.

527
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,940
Besides, I've supported the military
since I was a kid.

528
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,220
I just felt like

529
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,260
that was something I ought to do.

530
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,460
Indeed,
I don't know Captain Wang Chen well.

531
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,940
But I really like her.

532
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:11,420
I think she's a very capable soldier

533
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,620
and an outstanding woman.

534
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,900
So,

535
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,980
if I can do something for her,

536
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,940
I'll be happy to.

537
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,900
Pretty touching, isn't it?

538
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,220
Since you're so moved,

539
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,140
let's have a hug, then.

540
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,220
Don't mess around. There are sentries.

541
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,293
Relax, I wouldn't take advantage of you.

542
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,740
Alright.

543
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,620
I'll stop teasing you.

544
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,740
Here's the recorder.

545
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,220
Give it to Captain Wang Chen.

546
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:53,940
About Luo Tong,

547
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,180
Mr. Bai didn't do anything wrong.

548
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,140
I hope they won't
misunderstand each other

549
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,420
because of something so baseless.

550
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,620
After all, it's rare to find true love.

551
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,700
Let's meet one more time.

552
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,420
What?

553
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,980
Today was too rushed.

554
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,180
I haven't fully learned about you yet.

555
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,980
So let's meet again.

556
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,420
Okay.

557
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,700
Sure.

558
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,620
Deal.

559
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,260
I have no clue

560
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,980
about my future at all.

561
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,660
Didn't you study medicine?

562
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,260
That was my dad's choice.

563
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,460
Your dad's choice?

564
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,140
Is he a doctor?

565
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,100
No, he's not.

566
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,620
Then what's his job?

567
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,140
Does your family support you
being a soldier?

568
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,420
I just signed up on impulse at the time.

569
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,660
At first, they didn't understand.

570
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,380
But gradually, they came around.

571
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,140
Now I'm really glad
I joined the military.

572
00:27:08,737 --> 00:27:11,220
Otherwise, I wouldn't have had
such an unexpected gain.

573
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,260
What gain?

574
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,660
You.

575
00:27:15,471 --> 00:27:16,760
You're being cheeky again.

576
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,420
Come on, help me with it.

577
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,220
I really don't know what to do.

578
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,740
Honestly,

579
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,420
I don't think I can help you with it.

580
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,460
Just follow your heart.

581
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,860
We're still young anyway.

582
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,648
We've got plenty of time
to figure it out.

583
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,860
However, in my humble opinion,

584
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,700
I think being a doctor is great.

585
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,220
If you actually graduate and become one,

586
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,220
then I'll get "sick" every few days

587
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,740
just to stay at your place.

588
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,420
Pffft!

589
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,060
Stop saying such inauspicious stuff.

590
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,980
You do care about me, Lazy Goat.

591
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,700
I don't.

592
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,980
No one cares about me. Poor me.

593
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,220
Lights out soon.

594
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,740
I'm hanging up.

595
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,820
Sleep early. Good night.

596
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,180
Okay.

597
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,940
I'm off to bed, then.

598
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,900
Good night.

599
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,500
It's here.

600
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,620
See? A legit taxi.

601
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,404
Alright, you should head back now.

602
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,600
I always travel alone.

603
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,420
Besides, shouldn't the lights
be out by now?

604
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,660
Hurry back.

605
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,180
I'll head back, then.

606
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,900
Text me when you get home.

607
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,180
Got it!

608
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:48,620
(To Protect The Motherland)

609
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,180
Hello?

610
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,580
Hi, Sir, where are you?

611
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,660
Is your GPS accurate?

612
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,740
I've circled around a few times,
but I can't find you.

613
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,460
You can't find me?

614
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,260
Yeah.

615
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,900
But I'm right here.

616
00:28:59,915 --> 00:29:01,380
Forget it. Send me your location.

617
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,220
I'll come to you.

618
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,140
Sure.

619
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,500
Sorry.

620
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,660
Did I scare you?

621
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,620
You've never left, huh?

622
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,340
Okay, thank you.

623
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,180
Where is this?

624
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,900
Just come with me.

625
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,180
Why did you bring me here?

626
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,380
You'll find out soon.

627
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:30,220
(Poly Central Coast, Chun Jing)

628
00:30:32,604 --> 00:30:33,893
Come in and check this out.

629
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,620
What is this?

630
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,620
It's my new apartment.

631
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,740
You rented this?

632
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,060
Yes.

633
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,060
From now on,

634
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,580
this will be our new home in Wenzhou.

635
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,580
Look, it's a sea-view apartment.

636
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,700
Look at how beautiful the ocean is.

637
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,260
As of now, I've already transferred
to work at the Wenzhou Marine Museum.

638
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,100
It's been a week since I joined.

639
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,340
This past week,

640
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,580
I've been busy house hunting
and signing the lease.

641
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,860
I also set up the place.

642
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,380
It's nothing fancy,

643
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,340
just odds and ends.

644
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,500
You should check
if anything is missing here.

645
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,580
We'll buy it soon.

646
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,093
I'll leave this glorious task to you

647
00:31:08,093 --> 00:31:09,820
because you're the mistress
of this place.

648
00:31:13,448 --> 00:31:14,620
You came to Wenzhou to work?

649
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,937
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

650
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,580
I wanted to.

651
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,820
I meant to bring that up
during my last visit here.

652
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,140
You always said
we didn't spend enough time together.

653
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,660
So now, I've come to where you are.

654
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,220
Problem solved, right?

655
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,420
Didn't I say I could fix
all our problems?

656
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,460
Look at this.

657
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,580
Isn't it nice?

658
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,900
You didn't have to do all this.

659
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,140
You're touched, aren't you?

660
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,460
Did you tell Mom
about your job in Wenzhou?

661
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,820
I haven't told her yet.

662
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,820
But don't worry.

663
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,820
She can't stop me.

664
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,560
That's not the point.

665
00:32:02,604 --> 00:32:05,220
Transferring to Wenzhou is a big
decision, but you haven't told her.

666
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,382
What would she think about it?

667
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,660
She might even think
I asked you to come.

668
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,820
I don't think any of that matters.

669
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,500
Chen, what matters most now

670
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,380
is that we can finally be together

671
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,180
and have a real home.

672
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,580
I think you'd better tell Mom soon.

673
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,737
I'm leaving.

674
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,580
Chen.

675
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,420
Hold on.

676
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,060
Wait a second.

677
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,626
If you're going back to your unit, fine.

678
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,700
Then at least take a key.

679
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,260
You rented the place.

680
00:32:40,537 --> 00:32:42,100
It's not right for me to have a key.

681
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,380
I rented the apartment,

682
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,660
but this is our home.

683
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,500
This will be our home
in Wenzhou from now on.

684
00:32:59,293 --> 00:33:00,060
March forward.

685
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,320
Chief. Blue Blade Special Ops Team
is conducting obstacle training.

686
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,004
Awaiting orders.

687
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:09,820
Assemble everyone.

688
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:10,420
Yes, Sir!

689
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,220
Assemble!

690
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,580
Dress right!

691
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,700
Eyes front!

692
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,340
Chief, all assembled.
Awaiting further orders!

693
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,380
At ease.

694
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:26,980
Yes, Sir.

695
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:28,700
At ease.

696
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,580
Yi Nanwang.

697
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,620
Here!

698
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:36,820
Step forward!

699
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,060
Want to know your evaluation score?

700
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,220
Yes, Sir!

701
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:46,820
If you found out

702
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,700
you didn't pass the evaluation,

703
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:49,980
what would you do?

704
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,660
Sir!

705
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,580
Keep training!

706
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,980
Until I make it into Blue Blade!

707
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,740
You want to join Blue Blade that badly?

708
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,820
Yes, Sir!

709
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,860
I will get into Blue Blade!

710
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,180
I absolutely will!

711
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,180
Wu Si.

712
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:14,780
Here.

713
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,760
Private First Class Yi Nanwang.

714
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,980
Evaluation complete.

715
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,260
Now announcing your results.

716
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,060
Combat skills,

717
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,660
pass.

718
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,660
Reporting.

719
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,780
Military tactics, pass.

720
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:28,980
Reporting.

721
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,580
Special reconnaissance, pass.

722
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,300
Reporting.

723
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,620
Sniper specialization, pass.

724
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,660
Sir!

725
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,460
But I only took one evaluation today.

726
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,804
The evaluation isn't just today.

727
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,260
Every single training

728
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,740
has been part of the evaluation.

729
00:34:47,115 --> 00:34:48,340
Private First Class Yi Nanwang!

730
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,220
Here!

731
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,060
Your evaluation score is passing.

732
00:34:51,093 --> 00:34:54,048
You are now officially approved
to join the Blue Blade Special Ops Team.

733
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,260
Fall in.

734
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,540
Yes, Sir!

735
00:35:21,115 --> 00:35:22,260
Awaiting orders!

736
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,500
Resume training.

737
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,100
Yes, Sir!

738
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,740
(Cangyiyi Road)

739
00:35:42,893 --> 00:35:43,780
Yi Nanwang.

740
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,060
Here!

741
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,460
What day is it today?

742
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,580
Reporting, Captain.

743
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,060
Today is the day I joined Blue Blade.

744
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,180
Very good. Happy?

745
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,060
Yes, Sir!

746
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,020
If I'm not mistaken,

747
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,620
it's also your birthday today, right?

748
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,340
Reporting.

749
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,700
Today is the first day of my twenties!

750
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,180
Yang Shuai, hurry up!

751
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,740
Very good.

752
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,460
Today is Yi Nanwang's birthday.

753
00:36:15,982 --> 00:36:17,360
No need to be so serious, everyone.

754
00:36:17,382 --> 00:36:18,426
Take a five-minute break.

755
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,580
Thank you, Captain!

756
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,660
Yi Nanwang.

757
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,460
We've got you a big cake.

758
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,515
Everyone gets a piece.

759
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,340
It's cake time!

760
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,020
Here.

761
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,820
- Everyone gets a share?
- Here.

762
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,580
Everyone gets one! Back there.

763
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,040
You've shared with me before, right?

764
00:36:36,048 --> 00:36:37,140
Pass it to the back!

765
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,580
This cake's pretty good.

766
00:36:38,582 --> 00:36:40,115
Here, pass it to those at the back.

767
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,260
Here. There's plenty!

768
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:43,780
Yi Nanwang.

769
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,271
Yi is already a rare surname.

770
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:46,700
And your name's Nanwang.
[*Unforgettable]

771
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,580
Why is that?

772
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,060
Well...

773
00:36:52,137 --> 00:36:54,300
That name was given to me
by the orphanage director.

774
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,460
It means never forget the country's care
and kindness.

775
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,660
And now, it has a new meaning.

776
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:02,360
Never forget the bond with my workmates.

777
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:02,940
Come on!

778
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,740
The army is my home.

779
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,669
And you are my family!

780
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,560
Thank you, squad leaders!

781
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,220
Good! Well said!

782
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,020
One, two, three!

783
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,060
One, two, three!

784
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,180
One, two, three!

785
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,380
One, two, three!

786
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,340
(I looked into it)

787
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,660
(based on your tip.)

788
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:46,260
(Regarding enterprises in Wenzhou
related to offshore fishing,)

789
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,100
(I've got a lead now.)

790
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,020
(Does it have anything to do
with Changzhou Group?)

791
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,460
(Do you have any other clues)

792
00:37:53,582 --> 00:37:55,740
(that prove someone
is looting underwater relics?)

793
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,820
(I've got fragments of relics)

794
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,180
(that were recovered
from the Dayan Reef seabed.)

795
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,860
(Can we set an appointment?)

796
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,660
(You pick the time and place.)

797
00:38:06,937 --> 00:38:08,426
(I'll be waiting to hear back from you.)

798
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,460
Didn't Mr. Bai transfer to Wenzhou?

799
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,620
Why do you still look so gloomy?

800
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,004
What's going on with you two?

801
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,100
His transfer here was

802
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,940
a really romantic decision.

803
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,660
But I'm not sure

804
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,180
if it was the right decision.

805
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,740
Let's drop the subject.

806
00:38:44,537 --> 00:38:45,780
I listened to the recording.

807
00:38:46,382 --> 00:38:47,780
Please thank Miss Tang for me.

808
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,580
I will.

809
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,300
Mom?

810
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,460
Zijian.

811
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,020
Still at work?

812
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,580
Yes, still at work.

813
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,460
What is it?

814
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,180
Why have you been so busy lately?

815
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,380
You didn't even come home
for weekend dinners.

816
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,220
Work's been hectic.

817
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,180
I even have a business trip coming up.

818
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:17,660
Then after your trip, come and visit me.

819
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,660
Don't worry.

820
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,537
I'll pay you a visit after I get back.

821
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,300
Well, you're busy with work,

822
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,180
but do take care of yourself.

823
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,100
Your wife's not even with you now.

824
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,700
Alright, alright.

825
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,460
I'm not a kid anymore.

826
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,820
I'll be fine. Don't worry.

827
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,940
We're doing well.

828
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,980
You take care of yourself too.

829
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:53,700
Yuhang.

830
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:55,660
Brother?

831
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,540
What brings you here?

832
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,540
I brought you some wine.

833
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,940
I know you love red wine,

834
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,860
so I brought you two nice ones.

835
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,300
Thanks.

836
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,980
What are you reading so intently?

837
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,700
Ancient shipwreck documents.

838
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,180
Since when were you into shipwrecks?

839
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,700
Or is it the female reporter
you're into?

840
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,260
Wait, don't tell me

841
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,580
you're really trying
to find a shipwreck?

842
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,460
Of course not.

843
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,860
I couldn't even figure it out
with coordinates back then.

844
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,860
Exactly.

845
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,860
I told you

846
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,340
not to believe the rumor.

847
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,220
And you didn't believe me.

848
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,380
Well,

849
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,490
perhaps the reporter crossed someone
and got framed.

850
00:40:50,493 --> 00:40:51,648
Someone's messing with her.

851
00:40:52,871 --> 00:40:54,100
I doubt that.

852
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,460
Brother, during this research phase,

853
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,100
I actually found a lot of information

854
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,380
on ancient Chinese shipwrecks,

855
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,980
all verified

856
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,860
by top-level national experts.

857
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,100
It's certified and legit.

858
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,340
And I also found a lot about

859
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,180
so-called treasure hunters

860
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,620
who are illegally salvaging
in Chinese waters.

861
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,500
They're stealing our shipwreck relics.

862
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,660
This isn't just a rumor. It's real.

863
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,660
Well, you've learned a lot.

864
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,820
Let me ask you something.

865
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,300
Didn't you borrow my boat?

866
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,220
Didn't that reporter say

867
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,780
she'd give up if she couldn't find them?

868
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,860
So, did she?

869
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,860
Or is she planning

870
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,540
some new method to keep investigating?

871
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,660
She didn't propose

872
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,260
the idea of giving up on it.

873
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,460
It... It was me.

874
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,660
That was my guess.

875
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,700
I figured she'd give up
if she couldn't find them.

876
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,070
But whether or not she really did,

877
00:41:56,071 --> 00:41:58,180
I can't say for sure.

878
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,293
And I can't exactly ask her.

879
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,540
I'm your big brother.
How could you lie to me?

880
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,260
Fine, I'll ask her in a few days.

881
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,180
Don't bother. Just drop it.

882
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:10,060
The moment you bring it up,
she'll ask you to get her a boat.

883
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,100
And you'll come to me.

884
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,220
Please don't cause me any more trouble.

885
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,460
It's too much for me.

886
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,500
Here's the wine.

887
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,220
Get back to your research.

888
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,620
