00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,360
Where's the rest of your team?

19
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,770
The Captain hasn't been around.

20
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,800
Captain Zong has been
training us like crazy.

21
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,271
Everyone is catching up on sleep.

22
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,690
No pain, no gain.

23
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,290
Don't talk while eating.

24
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,600
Why are you picking on me?

25
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,050
Did Cheng Yuan go back to sleep too?

26
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:05,880
No, he didn't.

27
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:08,200
He went to the hospital
to talk with Captain.

28
00:02:08,204 --> 00:02:09,370
He has been restless lately

29
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,440
because of his girlfriend.

30
00:02:11,782 --> 00:02:14,160
Wu Ke'er even wanted
Sergeant Cheng to leave the service.

31
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,410
Who told you to gossip?

32
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,640
This is grown-up business.
You won't get it.

33
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,570
She's a military volunteer.

34
00:02:23,382 --> 00:02:24,810
It will be fine after she leaves.

35
00:02:25,448 --> 00:02:26,810
You're still going on about that?

36
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,040
That's the problem.

37
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,290
She was supposed to leave in September.

38
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,570
But the injury delayed it.

39
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,160
Cheng Yuan already felt bad
because We Ke'er

40
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,920
joined the army for him.

41
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,071
Things have gotten worse.
He's questioning everything.

42
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,440
No one can talk him out of it.

43
00:02:39,471 --> 00:02:41,137
I hope Captain helps him through it.

44
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,160
Cheng Yuan is not going to quit.

45
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,410
Of course he won't.

46
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,690
But it's not easy to have

47
00:02:48,715 --> 00:02:50,160
both love and career.

48
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,290
Can you look me in the eye?

49
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,600
You're not a kid anymore.

50
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,370
Can't you talk nicely?

51
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,850
People are watching.

52
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,040
Tang Xin, show some respect.

53
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,040
Your father

54
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,640
has been worried sick about you.

55
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,690
Dad.

56
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,290
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

57
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,570
I didn't tell you or Mom.

58
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,640
I'll be more careful.

59
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,160
That's it? Just a sorry?

60
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,810
Are you a wild monkey or what?

61
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,160
You're always
stirring things up out there.

62
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,040
You never stop causing trouble.

63
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,160
That guy was a kidnapper.

64
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,290
Why did you mess with him?

65
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,970
I was the one kidnapped,

66
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,570
not the one doing it.

67
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,160
You can't just blame me for that.

68
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,530
Look at her! She's arguing!

69
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,200
I'm just stating facts
and reasoning with you.

70
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,920
This is a hospital,

71
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,160
so you're not the king here.

72
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,040
I...

73
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,850
Wu Si, you saw that, right?

74
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:49,850
Who would

75
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,530
talk to their parents like that?

76
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,290
She never stops arguing!

77
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,760
You know your daughter
doesn't like hearing it from you.

78
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,250
Then maybe talk less.

79
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,200
You should know

80
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,480
who she listens to now.

81
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,920
Fine. I won't say another word.

82
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,410
Wu Si, go ahead.

83
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,480
Say what?

84
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,930
Didn't Captain Tang just say it?

85
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,200
He wants you to scold me now.

86
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,170
Come here.

87
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,320
Don't be scared.

88
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:26,880
I'm right here with you.

89
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,080
Lecture her.

90
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,170
Yes, you too. Make a heart.

91
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,115
Come on, do the sign.

92
00:04:32,137 --> 00:04:33,070
Say something to her.

93
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,200
Miss Tang only listens to our Captain.

94
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
She will ignore me.

95
00:04:37,337 --> 00:04:38,320
I'll just disappear now.

96
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,320
What do you mean?

97
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,930
You didn't even say anything.

98
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,200
You need to lecture her.

99
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,370
Captain Tang.

100
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,400
Mrs. Tang,
the whole family is here today.

101
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,010
It's been a long time.

102
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,170
Have a proper chat.

103
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,226
Enjoy the time together.

104
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,640
I'll leave you to it.

105
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,804
I'll step outside for a bit.

106
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,610
I think Tang Xin didn't really

107
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,930
make a big mistake this time.

108
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,400
When she messes up next time,

109
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,426
I'll criticize her
and give her a proper talk.

110
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:13,840
You...

111
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,260
Look at you.

112
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,460
You scared the poor guy

113
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,820
so much that he started sweating.

114
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,580
Seriously.

115
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,460
What's going on? Spit it out.

116
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,260
Nothing serious.

117
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,220
We've been comrades for years.

118
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,900
I know exactly when you're troubled.

119
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,700
Just tell me.

120
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,020
It's about Ke'er?

121
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,380
The discharge?

122
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:46,820
Is she pressuring you?

123
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,940
She never pressures me.

124
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,380
Dad.

125
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,580
Dad.

126
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,580
Dad, I was wrong.

127
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,020
Keep scolding me.

128
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,604
I swear I won't talk back this time.

129
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:15,340
Can I even scold you?

130
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,660
Would you even listen?

131
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,380
Dad.

132
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,500
I'm already in the hospital.

133
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,260
Why are you still so mean?

134
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,700
You're hospitalized?

135
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,700
Where are you hurt?

136
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,100
I'm fine now. I'm almost recovered.

137
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,500
Tell me where you got hurt.

138
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,380
Just my neck.

139
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,020
The doctor said I could
take the brace off today.

140
00:06:36,071 --> 00:06:37,020
I don't need it anymore.

141
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,900
Does it still hurt?

142
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:38,940
It's alright now.

143
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,660
Look here, just check for yourself.

144
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,380
Try turning your head all around.
Does it hurt?

145
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,220
See?

146
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,940
Look, wild monkeys heal fast.

147
00:06:49,337 --> 00:06:50,380
Come on, open your mouth.

148
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,100
You see? She can still eat. It's fine.

149
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,700
Really, she's fine. Nothing serious.

150
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,660
It's all good now.

151
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,220
During the entrance exams,

152
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,582
the two of us had planned
to apply to the same university.

153
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,820
But I changed my mind and enlisted.

154
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,220
She went to school on her own

155
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,700
to wait until I was discharged.

156
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,460
But I ended up
loving life in the military.

157
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,020
I never left.

158
00:07:13,315 --> 00:07:14,820
She couldn't handle the long distance.

159
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,340
So, she got impulsive and enlisted too.

160
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,100
Hello? Ke'er, what's up?

161
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,500
Cheng Yuan, guess where I am.

162
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,820
Where are you?

163
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,900
Where else could you be
if not at school?

164
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,260
Listen up.

165
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,470
Your girlfriend, Wu Ke'er,

166
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,340
is currently in Wenzhou

167
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,460
undergoing university

168
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,500
enlistment training.

169
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,100
In Wenzhou, doing military training?

170
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,340
You're in boot camp?

171
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,380
That's right.

172
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,140
I had to beg the squad leader
to let me use a phone.

173
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,380
Aren't we stationed
pretty close to each other?

174
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,580
So does that mean

175
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,820
we'll get to see each other
every day from now on?

176
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,340
Ke'er.

177
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,020
Our units aren't even
in the same place.

178
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,300
We've been together
for nearly ten years now.

179
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,020
I haven't given her anything.

180
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,820
A girl doesn't get
many decades in her life.

181
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,740
That decade belongs to both of you.

182
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,420
When it comes to relationships,

183
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,940
thinking about it alone

184
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,940
won't get you anywhere.

185
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,020
You don't tell her anything,

186
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,500
yet expect her
to understand you completely?

187
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,340
Why should she?
That's way too much to ask.

188
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,580
You and Ke'er have been together
for over a decade.

189
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,540
You don't owe each other a thing.

190
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,980
But she has put in more than you have.

191
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,740
You owe her an answer.

192
00:08:44,071 --> 00:08:45,980
She has some time left
before her discharge.

193
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,220
You must figure it out.

194
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,980
No matter what happens or what you do,

195
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,340
do your best not to hurt her.

196
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,980
Any movement back home?

197
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,980
All is calm.

198
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,580
The police haven't visited the company.

199
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,460
Feels like this whole thing

200
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,980
is just going to fizzle out.

201
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,100
If that's the case,

202
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,340
then Xu Genshui probably

203
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,460
doesn't have anything

204
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,180
actually solid in his hands.

205
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,340
Right, Dad.

206
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,540
We've been away for quite a while now.

207
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,940
When are we going back?

208
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,580
Let's wait and see.

209
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,060
Out of habit, I'll skip the small talk.

210
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,100
Let's get straight to the point.

211
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,100
Our Anesthesiology Department is unique.

212
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,100
We have heavy tasks
and not enough people.

213
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,180
When needed, we must fill in right away.

214
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,580
You won't have much time to adjust.

215
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,060
You lack hands-on experience.

216
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,340
I'm worried you're not
mentally prepared.

217
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,700
Director, when I was an intern,

218
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,100
I assisted in different surgeries.

219
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,060
I'm prepared.

220
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,340
Assisting during an internship

221
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,580
means you were just a learner.

222
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,100
It was your teachers

223
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,340
who were responsible for the patient.

224
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,820
Getting on the table yourself

225
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,620
is a whole different story.

226
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,460
As usual,

227
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,580
I'll have to give you a test.

228
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,100
During epidural anesthesia,

229
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,300
what signs indicate the needle

230
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,604
has entered the epidural space?

231
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,580
List contraindications
for epidural anesthesia too.

232
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,300
How would you manage a laryngospasm?

233
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,060
Three questions. Fifteen minutes.

234
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,580
Here's the first one.

235
00:10:41,604 --> 00:10:43,620
It's a written test.
You'll need to hand it in.

236
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:50,940
(Chinese People's Liberation Army)

237
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,740
The winter combat training plan
has been issued.

238
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,220
The training will be
different this time.

239
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,700
You will be deployed elsewhere.

240
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,820
The destination

241
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,460
is the southern training base,

242
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,700
thousands of kilometers away.

243
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,700
Do you know what that means?

244
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,940
It means that the Marine Corps,

245
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,420
as a traditional amphibious force,

246
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,420
is now evolving

247
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,940
into a force capable of

248
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,940
carrying out missions

249
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,820
in various environments
over long distances.

250
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,340
This time, you'll also have
more joint training

251
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,100
with other service branches.

252
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,700
When needed, a mechanized
infantry brigade in the South

253
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,248
will engage in live combat exercises.

254
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,860
Bring all your best gear with you.

255
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,620
Don't be stingy about it.

256
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,860
Like my daughter always says,

257
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,420
"Go big or go home."

258
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,340
Yes, Sir.

259
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:46,740
Brigadier.

260
00:11:47,137 --> 00:11:48,740
What are you looking at so seriously?

261
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,460
Report.

262
00:11:49,604 --> 00:11:51,540
I've led them in sea-based
shooting drills.

263
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,880
I want to use an effective method

264
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,220
to help them keep their aim steady

265
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,700
on shaky platforms like planes or ships

266
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,220
so they stay accurate under movement.

267
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,100
That's a good idea.

268
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,700
Got any plans?

269
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,620
Not yet.

270
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,599
But I was thinking about

271
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,804
the concepts from camera
stabilizers and locking systems.

272
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,460
Think bold. Act bold.

273
00:12:08,515 --> 00:12:09,700
Let me know if you hit a wall.

274
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,100
But for now, pause that work.

275
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,860
We are visiting Wang Chen.

276
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,860
Bring your Captain with you
while you're at it.

277
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,460
Yes, Sir.

278
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,460
Mom?

279
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,100
Mom?

280
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,700
Hey, Honey.

281
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,700
I went to the interview today.

282
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,420
How did it go? Was it smooth?

283
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,100
You won't believe it.

284
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,940
The person who interviewed me today

285
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,340
was the same anesthesiologist

286
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,940
who operated on Lin Lan back then.

287
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,048
He's the director
of the Anesthesiology Department.

288
00:12:57,093 --> 00:12:59,180
He's nice and friendly.

289
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,540
He gave me a written test,

290
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,060
and I answered every question.

291
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,220
I think it went really well.

292
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,700
See? Told you.

293
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,860
My wife is the best. Am I right?

294
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,940
So then,

295
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,420
shouldn't you treat
your amazing wife to a nice dinner

296
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,820
as a little reward?

297
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,300
Well...

298
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,100
Honey.

299
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,820
There's something I need to tell you.

300
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,100
What now?

301
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,330
I'm about to head out

302
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,100
on a new mission.

303
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,460
How long will it be?

304
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,220
I'm not sure yet.

305
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,048
And soon I may have to
go with Brigadier

306
00:13:37,071 --> 00:13:38,804
to the hospital
to check on Captain Chen.

307
00:13:39,648 --> 00:13:41,420
I might not get the time
to see you later.

308
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,340
It's okay.

309
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,580
You don't have to
make a special trip for me.

310
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,700
I'm staying at my parents' place.
Don't worry.

311
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,300
I'm sorry.

312
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,940
I have to leave again.

313
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,860
It's really alright.

314
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,300
Just come back soon.

315
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,420
And stay safe.

316
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:07,940
Alright then.

317
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,620
Once you hear back

318
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,420
from the interview, text me, okay?

319
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,420
Don't panic. Believe in yourself.

320
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,420
You've got this.

321
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:15,980
Love you.

322
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,460
Love you too.

323
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,100
Come back soon.

324
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,940
This meeting

325
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,700
ends here.

326
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,460
What's wrong?

327
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,700
Looking for me?

328
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,300
Dad.

329
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,700
Yutian.

330
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:07,940
I know

331
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,940
you two came back yesterday.

332
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,300
But I wasn't told
to come to the office until today.

333
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,820
Did you need that day

334
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,220
to figure out

335
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,300
how to deal with me?

336
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,180
What nonsense are you talking about?

337
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,860
We're family.

338
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,700
Why would your brother
and I want to harm you?

339
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,860
Because I know

340
00:15:30,982 --> 00:15:32,220
everything you two have done.

341
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,460
Back when Tang Xin
was kidnapped in Roman,

342
00:15:36,982 --> 00:15:37,980
I knew from the get-go

343
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,340
that it was you.

344
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,820
But I had no proof at the time.

345
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,980
So I held back.

346
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,940
But now I have

347
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,300
a video of my brother

348
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,580
planning the entire kidnapping.

349
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,740
I can tolerate your shady money

350
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,980
and dirty business.

351
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,460
But attempted murder?

352
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,060
I won't let that stand.

353
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,460
Han Yuhang.

354
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,460
What do you want now?

355
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:14,820
Dad.

356
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,940
That Atocha Company on the Roman Islands

357
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,700
is yours too, right?

358
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,460
Did that female reporter

359
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,540
tell you that too?

360
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:26,940
Yutian.

361
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,860
You thought Tang Xin was the only one
digging into you?

362
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,820
Ever since I got that email

363
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,100
while working in your company,

364
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,820
I started having doubts too.

365
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,940
I went to the Roman Islands

366
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,860
not to chase after Tang Xin

367
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,940
but to uncover the truth.

368
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,340
Not bad.

369
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,620
That Atocha Company

370
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,980
is the result
of my partnership with them.

371
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,460
So what?

372
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,460
How else do you think

373
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,580
you got to where you are?

374
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,020
Yuhang,

375
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,260
we didn't tell you about this

376
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,300
because your brother and I

377
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,900
were trying to protect you.

378
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,380
It's not like we didn't know

379
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,380
how dangerous this whole business is.

380
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,580
But we had to leave you a way out.

381
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:25,140
If something ever happened
to your brother or me,

382
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,820
you wouldn't get dragged into it.

383
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,580
You get that?

384
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,980
Believe it or not,

385
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,420
what Dad said came from the heart.

386
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,100
We kept you in the dark

387
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,340
because we wanted to protect you.

388
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,820
Is that clear?

389
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,740
If you really care about me,

390
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,060
then step away from Changzhou Group.

391
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,980
Hand it over to me.

392
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,580
Dad,

393
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,420
did I just hear that right?

394
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,404
What did he just say?

395
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,580
He wants Changzhou Group!

396
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,340
Now I finally get it.

397
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,820
This is what all of it was really about.

398
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,380
I want to restructure Changzhou.

399
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,620
I'll turn this company

400
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,980
into a clean, legitimate business.

401
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,980
No dirty business, no dirty money.

402
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,500
None of that.

403
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,540
Just because we praise you

404
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,020
doesn't mean you're some moral saint!

405
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,340
If it weren't for
this dirty money we made,

406
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,580
you would be a nobody!

407
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,300
Stop using that excuse.

408
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,820
Dad,

409
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,300
let's be honest.

410
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,540
We've got more money

411
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,204
than we could ever spend
in a few lifetimes.

412
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,980
Why are you so obsessed with all this?

413
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,620
While there's still time,

414
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,300
let it go and enjoy your retirement.
Wouldn't that be better?

415
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,100
Changzhou Group is the result
of all your hard work.

416
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,900
Are you really going to be
the one to destroy it?

417
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,340
Good! You've got guts!

418
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,140
I dare you to hand all the evidence

419
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,100
over to the police!

420
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,540
Han Yutian, you think I won't do it?

421
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,300
Go on, then!

422
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:30,900
Enough!

423
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,100
Everyone out.

424
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,380
Dad.

425
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,420
Dad.

426
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,300
Out!

427
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,300
Come in.

428
00:20:02,915 --> 00:20:03,820
- Bai.
- Brigadier.

429
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,580
Thanks for all the hard work.

430
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,020
So? Has she been listening lately?

431
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,060
What you guys say

432
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,860
works ten thousand times better than I.

433
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,620
Right, Sir?

434
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,300
The fact she's recovered well,

435
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,500
it's basically a miracle,
according to Dr. Yang.

436
00:20:16,626 --> 00:20:17,448
That's great.

437
00:20:17,448 --> 00:20:19,540
Don't let Wu Si fool you.
He can't handle Tang Xin,

438
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,580
but when it comes to them,

439
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,515
he's more than enough.

440
00:20:21,515 --> 00:20:22,137
Absolutely.

441
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,540
Brigadier, what brings you here today?

442
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,580
The unit's being deployed.

443
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,100
Came to see you before we go.

444
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,140
Where to?

445
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,100
A big operation.

446
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,580
Wang Chen, I know
it's tough for you right now.

447
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,740
But rehab

448
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,340
is like a special assignment.

449
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,540
Just remember one thing, Wang Chen.

450
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,300
As long as you're willing,

451
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,820
there's always a place
for you in Blue Blade.

452
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,340
I'm just afraid

453
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,380
I'll hold the team back.

454
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,420
Don't say that. Who would you hold back?

455
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,820
A soldier from Blue Blade

456
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,071
is top-tier wherever they go.

457
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,420
Look at me.
I'm Blue Blade from twenty years ago,

458
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,380
but even now,

459
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,300
these two still might not beat me.

460
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,420
Right!

461
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,500
Captain Chen, have patience.

462
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,980
Give us some time to catch up.

463
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,540
Yeah, Captain Chen.

464
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,804
I only managed
thirty rounds around the bars today.

465
00:21:22,404 --> 00:21:24,340
Zong Qing, you're in charge of training,

466
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,580
and he only did thirty rounds?

467
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,900
Brigadier, it was timed!

468
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,100
He almost bested Cheng Yuan.

469
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,500
Still room for improvement.

470
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:32,860
Yes, Sir!

471
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,380
Bai.

472
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,140
We all have to leave this time.

473
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,100
The rehab training from here on

474
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,260
will be up to you and your mom.

475
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,620
If anything happens, contact me anytime.

476
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,580
Brigadier, please don't say that.

477
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,140
This is something
we should do for family.

478
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,980
(Hospital Discharge Instructions)

479
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,020
Comrade Wang Chen,

480
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,020
after a period of rehab training,

481
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,780
you've met the discharge requirements.

482
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,500
You can be discharged soon.

483
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,900
That's great.

484
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,500
That's great.

485
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,900
Alright then.

486
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,340
Be happy.

487
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,620
Still upset about what Yuhang did?

488
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,540
Yutian, let me ask you something.

489
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,300
What do you think

490
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,580
about what Yuhang said that day?

491
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,140
Didn't you always say

492
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,580
we are a family?

493
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,340
He probably just
couldn't accept it in the moment.

494
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,580
I think he'll calm down after venting.

495
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,180
If he doesn't,

496
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,340
bring him into the fold.

497
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,100
Eventually, he'll come around.

498
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,900
No.

499
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,980
We've kept him
out of it for all these years.

500
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,980
You can't drag him into this now.

501
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,980
It's not right.

502
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,860
I've given it some thought.

503
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,340
What Yuhang said that day

504
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,340
does make sense.

505
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,820
Dad,

506
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,100
what do you mean?

507
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,780
Are you really handing the company

508
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,900
to Yuhang?

509
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:22,860
Dad,

510
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,100
you can't lose your mind now.

511
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,540
Have you thought about this?

512
00:23:29,204 --> 00:23:30,780
It's been a while since that happened.

513
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,100
Why do you think
the police still haven't acted?

514
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,980
Isn't it because

515
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,340
whether it's Wei Jiangnan

516
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,860
or Xu Genshui,

517
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,300
or even that reporter Tang Xin,

518
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,820
none of them has

519
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,300
any solid evidence.

520
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,580
It might look like that on the surface,

521
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,580
but do you really think

522
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,300
just because they have no evidence now,

523
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,260
the police will stop investigating?

524
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,580
I actually think

525
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,780
this might be

526
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,100
our best chance to get out clean.

527
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,780
We might as well

528
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,820
do what Yuhang suggested.

529
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,740
Hand the whole company

530
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,980
over to him and go overseas.

531
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,380
Dad,

532
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,260
I'm not

533
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,580
unwilling to give Yuhang the company.

534
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,620
It's just,

535
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,060
if we go overseas

536
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,820
without the company's operations

537
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,300
as a cover,

538
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,900
it'll be harder to operate.

539
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,860
Why would we need a cover overseas?

540
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,500
We wouldn't need one.

541
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,020
Dad,

542
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,860
this is a big decision.

543
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,580
Please think it over.

544
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,100
The thought has been on my mind
for a long time.

545
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,420
It's settled.

546
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,100
Start getting ready.

547
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,300
Tang Xin.

548
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,620
I'm heading back

549
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,820
to the unit tomorrow.

550
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,660
There's a mission.

551
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,340
I'm the captain,

552
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,660
so I have to lead the team.

553
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,980
You don't have to explain.

554
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,340
You never have to explain.

555
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,060
So,

556
00:25:54,093 --> 00:25:55,780
I won't be able
to see you out tomorrow.

557
00:25:57,026 --> 00:25:59,060
Take care of the discharge yourself
and head home.

558
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,020
Get some rest.

559
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,260
Got it.

560
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,340
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

561
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,860
But I do have some good news.

562
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,340
What is it?

563
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,660
Wang Chen's rehab is going really well.

564
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,626
She met the discharge criteria
ahead of schedule.

565
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,100
She can go home tomorrow.

566
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,100
At this pace,

567
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,540
she'll be back on the team soon.

568
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,740
Maybe when the next drill

569
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,740
is over...

570
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,340
Wu Si.

571
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,140
Did it cross your mind

572
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,420
that maybe she shouldn't go back?

573
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,580
She wants to go back.

574
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,860
She definitely will.

575
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:44,780
I know

576
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,580
you all want her to return.

577
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,340
But you've seen it too.

578
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,820
All this time,

579
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,340
Wang Chen

580
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,340
has suffered so much in rehab.

581
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,740
In such a short time,

582
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,060
she's made it back to

583
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,980
the fitness level of an average person.

584
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,580
That alone is a big deal.

585
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,980
Does she have to
return to the front line?

586
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,660
Tang Xin,

587
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,100
I don't think you

588
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,420
really understand Wang Chen

589
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,420
or how soldiers think.

590
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,380
Maybe I don't fully understand soldiers.

591
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,380
But I understand people.

592
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,300
I understand women.

593
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,300
Wang Chen has a family.

594
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,500
She has someone who loves her.

595
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,900
After going through
such a traumatic injury,

596
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,060
even if

597
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,820
she chooses to return to the front line,

598
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,100
it shouldn't be because

599
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,620
any of you expect her to.

600
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,580
She has the right
to choose her own life.

601
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,620
Of course she has the right
to choose her own life.

602
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,340
She can put her
own family first before duty.

603
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,300
No one will blame her for that.

604
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,140
As long as she takes off
the uniform herself.

605
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,420
Sorry.

606
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,740
I just want her to come back.

607
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,380
And I hope she really will.

608
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,620
Before you leave,

609
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,420
shouldn't you go see Wang Chen?

610
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,300
Go ahead.

611
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,140
I'm going to get some rest.

612
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:00,820
Wang Chen,

613
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:02,100
you'll get discharged tomorrow.

614
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,020
Congrats.

615
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,900
You're heading out tomorrow too.

616
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,580
You've done great lately.

617
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,140
Rest up once you're home.

618
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,580
I can't rest anymore.

619
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,620
If I rest again,

620
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,980
I'll fall behind

621
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,300
in the next drill.

622
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:19,820
Cheng Yuan,

623
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,300
do you remember?

624
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,100
Back when Yi Nanwang was being assessed,

625
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,820
the training every day was intense.

626
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,820
None of us could talk sense into him.

627
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,100
He only listened to one person.

628
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,140
Captain Chen told him

629
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,820
that training only lasts a while,

630
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,820
but his body is his for life.

631
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,540
We need to take it slow,

632
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,380
then we'll reap the rewards.

633
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,380
I remember.

634
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,540
You're a role model for Yi Nanwang.

635
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,340
So whatever you say,

636
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,100
you have to do it yourself first.

637
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,300
I'm leaving tomorrow.

638
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:57,060
I can't see you off from the hospital.

639
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,820
I'll see you later.

640
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,380
Captain.

641
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,100
Show them what Blue Blade is made of.

642
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,100
You're back.

643
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,100
Did I wake you?

644
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,580
No.

645
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,100
The meds for your back and legs.

646
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,020
I sorted them all for you.

647
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,380
Make sure you take them on time.

648
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,980
No matter where you're training,

649
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,100
you'll have water, right?

650
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:42,760
(Wu Si: Zong Qing,)

651
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,140
(I'll need your favor tomorrow.)

652
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,980
(I'll send the details later.)

653
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,180
We're home.

654
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,900
Mom?

655
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,100
You're back.

656
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,740
I was just about
to come down to get you.

657
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,115
- Mom, no need.
- That was quick.

658
00:33:07,137 --> 00:33:08,340
- Take it slow.
- Got it.

659
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,100
Glad you're back.

660
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,980
You're home now. Look around.

661
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,340
It's a bit heavy, Mom.

662
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,340
From now on,
we'll do rehab right at home.

663
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,820
See, I even got all this equipment

664
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,820
for you.

665
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,180
It's all set up now.

666
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,100
The equipment won't
be worse than the hospital's,

667
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,980
but definitely more comfortable.

668
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,340
Exactly.

669
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,660
Having rehab gear at home

670
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,340
feels weird no matter how I look at it.

671
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,260
Hold on to me.

672
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,340
Let's go.

673
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,020
If it makes you uncomfortable,

674
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,820
just think of it as

675
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,340
one more big toy in the house.

676
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,180
That's all it is.

677
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:45,820
Come on.

678
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,980
Yeah, exactly.

679
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,900
During the day,

680
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,420
Zijian will be at work.

681
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,100
I'll stay home with you for rehab.

682
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,740
Okay, Mom.

683
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,340
I'll go make you two some food.

684
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,500
Thanks, Mom.

685
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,340
Don't mention it.

686
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,500
It's alright, Honey.

687
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,100
Don't be upset.

688
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,340
From now on,
I'll work out with you every day.

689
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,700
It's great
that we can stay fit together.

690
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,460
I want some water.

691
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,500
I'll get it for you.

692
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,660
That's about it. Look.

693
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,220
If we

694
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,980
move this scene to the front,

695
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,860
wouldn't it be better?

696
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,380
This music should go right here.

697
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,100
I'm making a call.

698
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,700
Okay.

699
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,100
Don't make a sound. No talking.

700
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:33,780
Got it.

701
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:35,980
This one's good.

702
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,980
Hey, Xin, it's me.

703
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,780
Hey, Zong Qing. What's up?

704
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,220
Are you busy right now?

705
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,580
I was discharged and I'm heading home.

706
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,300
Can you come over for a bit?

707
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,648
I need to tell you something.

708
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,100
Can't you just say it over the phone?

709
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,700
This isn't something
I can explain over the phone.

710
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,900
I need to tell you in person.

711
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,100
I'll send you the address now.

712
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,460
Cheng Yuan and I will wait for you.

713
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,980
Head over right away.

714
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,580
I think maybe

715
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,980
we should change the music.

716
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,660
Don't mess it up.

717
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,980
I already set it up.

718
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:27,700
This...

719
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,700
What? It's stuck?

720
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,980
Why is it frozen?

721
00:35:36,915 --> 00:35:37,700
What? You didn't

722
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,380
test this machine before bringing it?

723
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,300
You think I didn't?

724
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,700
It worked fine before I came.

725
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,300
What?

726
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,100
Did you bump something?

727
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,580
It's fine, Captain Zong.

728
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,660
We have time.

729
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,360
(Destination)

730
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,220
The number you dialed
is not answering right now.

731
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,670
- I'm almost there. Pick up the phone.
- Please try again later.

732
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:57,180
Sorry, the number you dialed
is currently unavailable.

733
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,580
Calling Wu Si.

734
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,940
Strange, why isn't anyone answering?

735
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,380
This is just a homestay.

736
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,620
What am I doing here?

737
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,900
Zong Qing, Cheng Yuan, I'm here.

738
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,940
Where are you?

739
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,060
Hurry up.

740
00:37:14,404 --> 00:37:15,540
Don't rush. Take it easy.

741
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,620
Anyone here?

742
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,100
I'm here. Where are you?

743
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,180
