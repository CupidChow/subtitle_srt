Zong Qing.

Stop scrubbing
or your skin's going to peel off.

20
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,320
No way.

21
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:51,850
What if this smell

22
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,360
ends up chasing Yangyang away?

23
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,600
Captain Zong, the smell on you now

24
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,210
is already chasing us away.

25
00:01:57,226 --> 00:01:59,560
Can't you tell the difference
between fragrant and stinky?

26
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,590
The problem is it's too fragrant.

27
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,640
It's sickly sweet.

28
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,271
You can smell it from way over here.

29
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,210
Yi Nanwang.

30
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:05,850
Here.

31
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,010
Is it fragrant?

32
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,130
It smells like bubblegum.

33
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,480
Captain.

34
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,570
That pilot today

35
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,420
shouted so loudly
that my ears are still ringing.

36
00:02:18,426 --> 00:02:19,440
Are you guys okay?

37
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,160
We're fine.

38
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,850
Next time you parachute,

39
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,730
remember to turn the volume down
on your earpiece.

40
00:02:23,737 --> 00:02:24,448
Got it.

41
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,410
As long as you're okay.

42
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,480
Yi Nanwang.

43
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,130
Here.

44
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,040
This is your first lesson as a recruit.

45
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:31,810
Let me tell you,

46
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,204
every bit of experience comes
at a price, in blood and tears.

47
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:35,370
Right, Cheng Yuan?

48
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,320
Well...

49
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,315
Who was that chief who came

50
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:44,720
to watch our exercise today?

51
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,920
You didn't recognize him?

52
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,010
That's Deputy Commander Lan.

53
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,600
Good thing I didn't run my mouth today.

54
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,880
If I had messed up,

55
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,970
they'd make me
eat the machine gun mount.

56
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,426
What are you afraid of?
He's not your future father-in-law.

57
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,690
Are you hurt?

58
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,480
No.

59
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,690
I'm really not.

60
00:03:47,582 --> 00:03:49,826
I've been watching you for a while.
Still pretending?

61
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,920
I've had a sprain.

62
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,129
Come with me to the hospital.

63
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,471
There's no need for that, Captain.

64
00:03:55,915 --> 00:03:58,480
It's just a minor injury.
Forget about visiting the hospital.

65
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,640
Whether it's minor
is for the doctor to decide.

66
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,480
Let's go.

67
00:04:02,226 --> 00:04:04,093
- Captain, there's no need for that.
- Hurry up.

68
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,250
Look, I'm all fine.

69
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,690
I'm alright.

70
00:04:09,137 --> 00:04:11,848
It's nothing serious,
so there's no need for a medical note.

71
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,040
Well, Miss,

72
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,480
my arm really hurts.
I can't even lift it.

73
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,960
Your arm hurts?

74
00:04:18,915 --> 00:04:20,400
Go back and tell your squad leader

75
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,050
to assign you extra training sessions.

76
00:04:22,204 --> 00:04:24,360
A few more reps on the slide ropes
should do it.

77
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,050
Captain Wu.

78
00:04:30,315 --> 00:04:31,982
Didn't you say you couldn't lift it?

79
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:33,250
Looks like you're just fine.

80
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,130
These rookies

81
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,930
really love faking injuries lately.

82
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:43,050
What a surprise to see you two here.

83
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,050
What happened?

84
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,490
Cheng Yuan hurt his leg.

85
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,050
Which one?

86
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,200
Does it hurt?

87
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,570
Does it hurt here?

88
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,440
No.

89
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:05,737
You've got a high pain tolerance.

90
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,200
It's probably a ligament strain.

91
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,599
He needs to go to the hospital
and get an MRI first.

92
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,871
Then we'll assess the condition.

93
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,137
(Outpatient Department)

94
00:05:18,138 --> 00:05:19,940
(928 Hospital of PLA
Joint Logistics Support Force)

95
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,782
Sit here and rest a bit.

96
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,810
I'll go get your report.

97
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,490
Thanks.

98
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,610
Captain Tang.

99
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,520
Wu Si? What a coincidence.

100
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,490
What are you doing here?

101
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,010
My chronic condition's acting up again.

102
00:06:06,137 --> 00:06:07,520
- No worries.
- Your leg's hurt?

103
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:08,640
I'm alright.

104
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,010
Please have a seat over there.

105
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,840
Why are you here?

106
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,250
My teammate got injured.
I'm here with him.

107
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,810
Bear this in mind, all of you.

108
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,440
The license plate is WEN V67321.

109
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,050
Split up and search.

110
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,130
You look beautiful today.

111
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,640
I'm always beautiful.

112
00:06:58,382 --> 00:06:59,893
You get more beautiful every day.

113
00:07:02,048 --> 00:07:03,520
If I ever run away from home again,

114
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,170
I'll bring more outfits.

115
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,050
Xin only has suits and dress pants.

116
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,570
Let's hope that won't happen again.

117
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,440
Do you think I'm being willful?

118
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,840
You just don't get it.

119
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,570
All my life,

120
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,490
I've never made a decision for myself.

121
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,840
Even my major was chosen by my parents.

122
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,490
The first time
I walked into an anatomy lab,

123
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,520
I was so scared that I ran home.

124
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,050
But my dad dragged me back.

125
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,840
He stayed with me
the whole day in there.

126
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,690
I was too scared to even cry.

127
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,840
Wasn't I being obedient enough?

128
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,520
Now, I just want to do

129
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,170
something I actually enjoy.

130
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,400
How's that willful?

131
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,050
Lan Yangyang.

132
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,493
Of course I support you

133
00:07:56,515 --> 00:07:57,690
doing what you love.

134
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,960
But I don't even know what that is.

135
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,520
Come on, you're so smart.

136
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,690
Look. Even though you hated med school,
you still graduated with top scores.

137
00:08:12,048 --> 00:08:13,750
How hard could it be
to find what you love?

138
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,490
But I don't even know how to do that.

139
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,610
Well, be dedicated.

140
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,248
Use half the effort you used chasing me

141
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:26,537
and you'll find it in no time.

142
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,730
My former high schoolmate

143
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,893
has recommended me for a PR job.

144
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,040
The interview is around the corner,

145
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,450
but I don't even know what PR is.

146
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,760
You'll figure it out once you start.

147
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,160
Wait a second.

148
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,730
Did you just say
I'm the one who pursued

149
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,280
and chased after you?

150
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,130
Yes.

151
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
Zong Qing.

152
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,240
You chased after me, didn't you?

153
00:09:05,248 --> 00:09:07,970
Say it again. Say it one more time!

154
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,040
Back when I was serving

155
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,160
in the '80s,

156
00:09:12,515 --> 00:09:14,440
I was stationed on an island
in Nansha District.

157
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,250
I was part of the first batch
to live in stilt houses.

158
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,610
The locals

159
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,160
used to call them...

160
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,760
Well...

161
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,680
"Melon watch huts."

162
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,280
"Sea foxholes."

163
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,040
And later, "octagonal pavilions."

164
00:09:26,848 --> 00:09:28,850
During the day,
we kept a lookout for enemies.

165
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,560
At night, we watched the stars.

166
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,400
Well,

167
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,250
living in those tin shacks
and melon huts

168
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,280
for months

169
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,250
has given me arthritis,

170
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,160
gout, and skin conditions.

171
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:43,760
Captain Tang.

172
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,040
You all really went through so much.

173
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,370
Look at me now.

174
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,640
I can't do it anymore.

175
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,680
I'm getting old.

176
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,680
Even for a hospital visit,

177
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,210
I need Tang Xin to pick me up.

178
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,040
Tang Xin came with you?

179
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,537
She's parking in the basement.

180
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,250
Wait...

181
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,520
What's taking her so long?

182
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,680
I'll give her a call.

183
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:36,640
Hello, Dad?

184
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,040
Hey, my precious.

185
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,520
If you don't get up here soon,

186
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,850
I'll be done with my appointment.

187
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,048
I'm in the garage.

188
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:43,115
I'll be up in a bit.

189
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,640
What? What did you say?

190
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,115
Why's your voice so low?

191
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:49,715
Is your signal bad or something?

192
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,280
Hello?

193
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:52,970
Speak up!

194
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,640
It's not convenient to talk now.

195
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,970
I'll tell you when I get up. Bye.

196
00:10:57,137 --> 00:10:59,271
Tang Xin? Why did she hang up on me?

197
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,400
Captain Tang, have a seat first.

198
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,280
Third Bro, found it.

199
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,271
It's right here.

200
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,850
WEN V67321.

201
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,671
That's the one.

202
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,610
You two stop wandering.

203
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,280
It's right here.

204
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,850
Go ahead and deflate the tires.

205
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,250
Who are they?

206
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:53,400
Wu Si.

207
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,560
I don't know them.

208
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,920
Smash the windshield.

209
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,920
Is that your car?

210
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,800
Smash it hard.

211
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,490
Don't go over there.

212
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,610
Wait here for me.

213
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,040
Smash it hard!

214
00:12:12,137 --> 00:12:13,250
What are you doing?

215
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,426
Hey, this has nothing to do with you.

216
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,800
Stay out of it!

217
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,330
Mind your own business.

218
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,130
You're smashing someone's car in public.

219
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,048
You think that's okay?

220
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,920
I'll smash a car

221
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,880
wherever I want.

222
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,800
What do you think you are, punk?

223
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,520
Scram!

224
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,210
I'm nobody.

225
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,800
But I saw what you did.

226
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,560
So I have to step in.

227
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,826
Trying to be a busybody, huh?

228
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:45,250
Looks like you're asking for it.

229
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,010
Bring it on, then!

230
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,210
Get him!

231
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,560
Wu Si!

232
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:05,826
Call the police.

233
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,250
You're not getting any younger.

234
00:13:10,515 --> 00:13:11,640
It's time to settle down.

235
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,760
Otherwise, Dad keeps calling me

236
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,360
and asking me to come keep you company.

237
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,370
The thing is...

238
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,130
I'm kind of busy at night.

239
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:25,940
Fine.

240
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,460
To make sure

241
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,940
your nights aren't wasted,

242
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,820
I'll do my best to make that happen.

243
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,180
It's still
that female reporter, isn't it?

244
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,182
A reporter's a reporter.

245
00:13:39,182 --> 00:13:40,560
Why "still," though?

246
00:13:40,582 --> 00:13:41,340
Of course it is.

247
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,220
What do you like about her?

248
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,940
I'd never met

249
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,700
a girl like her

250
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,700
before.

251
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,820
Take that fishing boat fire,
for example.

252
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,940
Everyone else,

253
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,060
both men and women,

254
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,300
ran for their lives.

255
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,340
But

256
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,580
she was the only one

257
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,460
willing to risk her life

258
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,420
to come back and save me.

259
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,460
Just for that,

260
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,300
I really admire her.

261
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,820
So what you're saying is

262
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,180
you're ready to pledge your life to her?

263
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,700
What are you talking about?

264
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,820
We're not even at that stage yet.

265
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,580
Right now, I just hope

266
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,420
to have more chances

267
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,060
to spend time with her.

268
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,700
Spend time, huh?

269
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,220
Still, the fact
that she turned back for you

270
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,180
does show she's a kind-hearted girl.

271
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,700
However,

272
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,700
I've read some
of her investigative pieces too.

273
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,980
They're dangerous.

274
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,860
She doesn't even care
about her own safety.

275
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,340
How's she going to care for you?

276
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,060
How could you two have a future?

277
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,300
Seriously, take my advice.

278
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,620
Find someone else.

279
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,740
What do you mean by that?

280
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,137
We haven't even started.
How can I find someone else?

281
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,340
I've been there.

282
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,915
You two aren't right for each other.

283
00:15:07,937 --> 00:15:09,180
Why not?

284
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,700
I think we're a good match.

285
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,740
You've been through it.

286
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,340
That's your path, not mine.

287
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,580
That doesn't mean
I'll take the same one.

288
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,180
Right?

289
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,940
Why can't we have a future?

290
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,740
Everyone's future is different.

291
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,540
Besides, we haven't even started.

292
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,700
No matter what,

293
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,620
we need to be together first.

294
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,180
We then explore and get
to know each other.

295
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,300
We'll work at it together.

296
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,420
Only then could we have a good future.

297
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,100
You've got a whole love theory, huh?

298
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,360
Ever since you were a kid,

299
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,580
I could never out-talk you.

300
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,940
Fine...

301
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,300
Come on, let's drink.

302
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,580
I can't win against you.

303
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,940
And I'm not as eloquent as you.

304
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,540
Alright.

305
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,115
What's on your mind?
You look so preoccupied.

306
00:15:57,137 --> 00:15:58,226
You haven't gotten changed.

307
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,700
Still thinking about that good guy?

308
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,100
I told you that was a joke.

309
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,460
Don't say that.

310
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,820
I can tell you've completely

311
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,860
lost focus
on finding your Prince Charming.

312
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,820
Your mind's clearly on someone else.

313
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,340
Yangyang.

314
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,580
Well,

315
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,460
is it because

316
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,740
he really looks like that person,

317
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,180
or

318
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,460
is it because I want him
to be that person,

319
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,100
so I convinced myself he is?

320
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,580
Well,

321
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,940
convince yourself enough
and it becomes real.

322
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,340
Ever heard of "Love is destiny"?

323
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,980
Love is destiny.

324
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,420
How did Sergeant Cheng
end up with a fracture?

325
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,540
Nonsense. Who told you that?

326
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,580
Li Xu said so.

327
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,760
He said an ambulance even came.

328
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,340
You actually believe
that bigmouth Li Xu?

329
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,340
It's just a strain. No big deal.

330
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,915
A strain still needs to be checked.

331
00:17:01,915 --> 00:17:02,740
What for?

332
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,300
A strain isn't a minor injury.

333
00:17:06,204 --> 00:17:07,271
- Brigadier.
- Brigadier.

334
00:17:07,315 --> 00:17:07,860
Brigadier.

335
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,620
Your limbs are military assets.

336
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,150
There's no such thing as a minor injury.

337
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,980
My wife made some snacks.

338
00:17:16,071 --> 00:17:17,260
Share them among yourselves.

339
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,100
Brigadier, your wife's here?

340
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,115
Yes, she's finally here.

341
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,340
You guys are in for a treat now.

342
00:17:22,515 --> 00:17:23,860
She's staying for good this time.

343
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,340
Wu Si.

344
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,020
Did you tell Miss Tang

345
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,740
that my wife agreed to the interview?

346
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,620
I did.

347
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,500
Tang Xin said she'd get ready for it.

348
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,860
Her interview is an official task
that has to be reviewed.

349
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,340
It's part of her job.

350
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,337
So treat it seriously.

351
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,340
March in place.

352
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,380
Halt.

353
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,500
Left face.

354
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,860
Right dress.

355
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,780
Eyes front.

356
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,300
At ease.

357
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,580
Sing a song.

358
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,100
Unity.

359
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,140
All together. Sing!

360
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,140
♪Unity is strength♪

361
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,020
♪Unity is strength♪

362
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,820
♪This strength is like iron♪

363
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,620
♪This strength is like steel♪

364
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,260
♪Harder than iron♪

365
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,300
♪Stronger than steel♪

00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,860
♪Open fire on the fascists♪

367
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,500
♪May every undemocratic system perish♪

368
00:18:36,093 --> 00:18:37,660
What are you, a starving ghost reborn?

369
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,900
You couldn't wait ten more minutes?

370
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,660
Last night's training wiped me out.

371
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,100
I didn't eat. Now I'm starving.

372
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,820
Eat and get out.

373
00:18:44,893 --> 00:18:45,920
Don't get in our way here.

374
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,820
Squad Leader Hao.

375
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,420
I'm not stealing anything, you know.

376
00:18:52,893 --> 00:18:54,180
I just wanted to ask something.

377
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,980
What good could it possibly be?

378
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,740
Speak.

379
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,260
Isn't it my turn
in the kitchen this weekend?

380
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,340
I want to switch shifts with Li Xu.

381
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,660
We've already talked it out.

382
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,100
I just came to inform the kitchen squad.

383
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,580
Since when

384
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,315
did you become
part of the kitchen squad?

385
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,100
Why the switch?

386
00:19:11,337 --> 00:19:13,271
If you don't give a reason,
I'm not approving it.

387
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,780
Is that even necessary?

388
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,820
You've been there, right?

389
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,260
I get it now.

390
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,740
You've got a date this weekend, right?

391
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,960
What date?

392
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,180
She's my actual girlfriend!

393
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,820
I knew you were up to something.

394
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,226
You think I don't know you?

395
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,180
So, is that a yes?

396
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,604
Thank you, Squad Leader!

397
00:19:35,671 --> 00:19:36,426
Go on, then.

398
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,580
It's you, Mr. Tian.

399
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,500
What's the word?

400
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,580
What else could it be?

401
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,300
You didn't drive today, right?

402
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,020
Hai's just got a big mouth.

403
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,620
You okay?

404
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,860
I'm fine.

405
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,620
I'm standing right here, aren't I?

406
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,780
Who did it?

407
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,100
No idea.

408
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,620
They were taken to the station.

409
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,671
We'll wait for the results.

410
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,100
Tang Xin, people like that

411
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,020
are desperate types.

412
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,380
They're capable of anything.

413
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,260
The closer you get to the truth,

414
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,300
the more danger you're in.

415
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,990
I couldn't just let them

416
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,100
smash my car just like that.

417
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,550
They had to be punished for doing so.

418
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,340
Do me a favor and take it easy.

419
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,860
It's just a scare tactic.

420
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,860
That's all they've got.

421
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,580
I'm fine.

422
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,980
You'd better take it seriously.

423
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,780
Got it.

424
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,620
Thank you, Mr. Tian.

425
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,380
(Chinese People's Liberation Army)

426
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:43,860
Well?

427
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,300
Looks great.

428
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,380
Where are you off to?

429
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,260
Proposing.

430
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,580
To who?

431
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,540
Who else would it be?

432
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,100
Of course it's Lan Yangyang.

433
00:20:56,315 --> 00:20:57,537
You've thought it through?

434
00:20:57,782 --> 00:20:59,820
I've actually been thinking
about this for a while.

435
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,580
I didn't want to move too fast,

436
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,580
so I never told her.

437
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,026
Yet having spent these days with her,

438
00:21:05,026 --> 00:21:05,860
I realized

439
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,820
her goal is the same as mine.

440
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,620
Since we're on the same page

441
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,500
and we're of age,

442
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,620
why not settle down soon?

443
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,500
As long as you're sure about it.

444
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,020
If you're sure,

445
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,620
we all support you.

446
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,860
If you need help,

447
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,620
just let me know.

448
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,300
Please don't.

449
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,020
I wouldn't dare trouble you.

450
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,100
You're the brigadier's favorite now.

451
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,260
I can't have you missing out
on training time.

452
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,100
Don't worry.

453
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,120
There are so many proposal ideas online.

454
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,620
I got this.

455
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,580
I'm really sorry for being late.

456
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,860
Traffic was bad.

457
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,500
Miss Lan?

458
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,540
Yes.

459
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,820
(Liang Yu, HR Department)

460
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,780
Please close the door.

461
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,260
Sure.

462
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,100
Give us a quick self-introduction.

463
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,500
Hello, everyone.

464
00:22:03,515 --> 00:22:06,150
I'm Lan Yangyang, and I'm here
to interview for your PR department.

465
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,260
I just graduated
from Wenzhou University Medical School,

466
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,340
majoring in Anesthesiology.

467
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,380
When I was in school...

468
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,300
Word.

469
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,260
Excel.

470
00:22:13,315 --> 00:22:14,382
Video editing software.

471
00:22:14,426 --> 00:22:15,140
English.

472
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,293
Are you fluent in them all?

473
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,500
I used them all at school.

474
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,500
And my English is decent.

475
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,300
You used them?

476
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,540
"Decent"?

477
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,780
That's a first.

478
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,540
Well, what would you say

479
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,740
is your greatest strength?

480
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,020
I think my biggest strength

481
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,620
is that I learn new things fast.

482
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,820
Even though
I don't have much experience,

483
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,340
I'm eager to learn.

484
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:41,860
Miss Lan.

485
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,540
This is a company,

486
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,340
not a school.

487
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,540
Other than being a fast learner,

488
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,300
do you have any real strengths?

489
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,340
Well...

490
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,909
I worked as an intern team leader
in the research division.

491
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,200
I've got strong leadership skills.

492
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,870
I could identify issues
with the team in time

493
00:22:56,871 --> 00:22:57,620
and solve them.

494
00:22:57,693 --> 00:22:58,500
Give me an example.

495
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,620
For example...

496
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,580
(Crisis PR Case Study)

497
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,737
PR is responsible

498
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:10,100
for managing a company's internal

499
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,180
and external public image.

500
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,740
Here are a few examples

501
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,820
of negative news
about companies in the industry.

502
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,820
Miss Lan, please evaluate them
from a media monitoring standpoint

503
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,060
and share
your PR communication strategy.

504
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,140
(Case)

505
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,670
I think this...

506
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,560
Excuse me...

507
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,580
I think...

508
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,300
First of all...

509
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,580
Okay.

510
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:52,980
Let's stop here.

511
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,780
Being able to recognize
your own shortcomings

512
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,660
is also important.

513
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,620
I have no idea

514
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,660
how you got your internal referral spot,

515
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,100
but this job

516
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,660
represents the company's image.

517
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,380
We need someone agile and adaptable

518
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,300
to ease our workload,

519
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,140
not make it worse.

520
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,340
Perhaps you'd be more suited

521
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,980
to work in a hospital.

522
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,580
You seem busy, Miss Lan.

523
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,380
I hope traffic won't be too bad
on your way back.

524
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,820
(Wu Si)

525
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,140
Hello, Captain Wu?

526
00:24:45,626 --> 00:24:47,620
No one's been bothering you
lately, right?

527
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,820
Not at all. Thanks for asking.

528
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:51,820
You're welcome.

529
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,580
Still, you should

530
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,620
be more cautious from now on.

531
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,580
Try not to use your phone while walking.

532
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,060
Oh, right. There's something important
I didn't tell you.

533
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,620
I suspected the coordinates were wrong,

534
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,300
so I asked that guy to resend them.

535
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,737
Turns out they're different
from what's on my computer.

536
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,100
But he insists he sent the same file.

537
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,300
So if he's right,

538
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,900
someone must've tampered

539
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,340
with my computer.

540
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,620
Think carefully.

541
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,340
When was your laptop not with you?

542
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,420
Too many times. I can't remember.

543
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,180
How about this?

544
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,340
Change your email password.

545
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,900
And when you're out,

546
00:25:28,071 --> 00:25:29,620
keep your laptop with you at all times.

547
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:30,980
I already changed the password.

548
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,420
Don't tell anyone

549
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,820
about the new coordinates.

550
00:25:33,826 --> 00:25:35,115
I'll go with you this weekend.

551
00:25:35,115 --> 00:25:36,848
Will that be too much trouble for you?

552
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,020
Don't worry.

553
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,420
I'll inform my unit of it.

554
00:25:39,515 --> 00:25:41,226
I'll let you know
once my leave is approved.

555
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,100
That's perfect!

556
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,340
I've been racking my brain
over my third trip

557
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,140
out to the sea.

558
00:26:02,315 --> 00:26:04,071
Excuse me, Sir. Is there a place nearby

559
00:26:04,093 --> 00:26:05,140
where I can rent a boat?

560
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,720
Just keep going straight.

561
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,720
Any fishermen who haven't gone out
will rent you one.

562
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,720
Alright, thank you.

563
00:26:11,226 --> 00:26:12,180
Let's check over there.

564
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,820
Mister, are you busy?

565
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,140
Not at all.

566
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,660
You two need something?

567
00:27:02,715 --> 00:27:04,820
We're wondering
if there are boats for rent nearby.

568
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,340
I've got one.

569
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,540
What do you need the boat for?

570
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,420
Fishing?

571
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,660
Exactly.

572
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,820
The weather looks great today.

573
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,820
I wanted to take my girlfriend
to Dayan Reef

574
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,660
for a bit of diving.

575
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,060
Dayan Reef?

576
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,660
That's quite a distance.

577
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,300
Indeed.

578
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,340
Mister, my boyfriend's
always super busy.

579
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,580
He finally managed to take a day off
just to take me out.

580
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,260
Could you help us out, please?

581
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,426
We can discuss the price.

582
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:32,900
Alright, then.

583
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,540
I'll see to that.

584
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,420
Wait here.

585
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,100
Thank you.

586
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:48,900
What's wrong?

587
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,500
Nothing. Let's go.

588
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,180
Hello?

589
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,620
Hey, what are you up to?

590
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,740
Nothing, just wandering around.

591
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,100
Why?

592
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,100
You sound kind of down.

593
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,580
Yeah.

594
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,860
There's not much to be happy about.

595
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,060
No worries.

596
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,980
I'll cheer you up right away.

597
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,820
Well, I'll forward you the address now.

598
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,915
Get over here now.

599
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,980
What are you even planning?
Tell me already.

600
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,620
Stop asking so much.

601
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,860
Just come as soon as you can.

602
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,060
See you soon.

603
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,180
How mysterious.

604
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,620
Captain Wu.

605
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,860
No matter what,
I'd like to say thank you.

606
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,380
You rarely get a day off,

607
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,982
yet you're spending it out
at sea with me.

608
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,820
Honestly,

609
00:29:08,093 --> 00:29:09,620
this is the best kind of rest for me.

610
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,100
Since when did you get
so good with words?

611
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,620
I'm being serious.

612
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,740
I want to get to the bottom of this too.

613
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,300
My presence here isn't just for you.

614
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,100
It's also to settle my own past.

615
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,860
Your past?

616
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,580
What do you mean?

617
00:29:33,626 --> 00:29:35,100
My dad used to be in the navy too.

618
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,340
He was navy too?

619
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,580
Just like Captain Tang,

620
00:29:38,782 --> 00:29:40,293
he was away most of the time.

621
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,060
I was seriously ill as a kid,

622
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,500
and I barely made it through.

623
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,820
Having thought it through,

624
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,620
my dad left the service

625
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,580
for me and my mom.

626
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,980
He transferred
to the Anti-Smuggling Bureau

627
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,060
and became an undercover officer.

628
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,580
With his experience,

629
00:29:57,715 --> 00:29:59,180
he went straight to the front line

630
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,860
and infiltrated a smuggling gang.

631
00:30:01,982 --> 00:30:03,860
He stayed undercover
for nearly ten months.

632
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,060
But in the end,

633
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,140
his boat sank for no reason.

634
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,580
So your dad...

635
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,180
Everyone on board was gone.

636
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,340
Sometimes I wonder,

637
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,580
if I hadn't gotten sick then,

638
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,380
would he have stayed in the navy

639
00:30:24,515 --> 00:30:25,660
instead of going undercover?

640
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,420
If he hadn't left the navy,

641
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,420
perhaps none of that would've happened.

642
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,100
Our family

643
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,782
could've stayed together happily.

644
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,860
What your dad did

645
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,820
was incredibly brave.

646
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,140
Thus, about this case,

647
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,180
no matter if it's connected

648
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,693
to what happened to my dad or not,

649
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,060
I will look into it.

650
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,180
Absolutely.

651
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,060
From now on,
I'll share everything I find

652
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,540
with you.

653
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,100
Hello, guys.

654
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:13,860
Are you there yet?

655
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,060
Alright, wait at the designated spot.

656
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,860
Make sure you come out
at the right time.

657
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,340
Be punctual.

658
00:31:21,471 --> 00:31:22,820
Pardon me for nagging at you.

659
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,380
My whole future happiness

660
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,820
is in your hands.

661
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,660
You have to be right on time.

662
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:28,860
Thanks for that.

663
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:29,820
Got it.

664
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,980
- A kid fell into the water!
- A kid fell into the water!

665
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,500
Has anyone called the police?

666
00:31:40,515 --> 00:31:42,426
- Hurry, let's go check it out!
- Whose kid is it?

667
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,020
Quick, come help!

668
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,180
Did someone call the police?

669
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,540
Whose child is this?

670
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,980
How could no one be watching him?

671
00:31:53,048 --> 00:31:54,740
Where are the parents?
Find them already!

672
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,620
- What should we do?
- Saving the kid comes first!

673
00:31:56,626 --> 00:31:57,500
Save him. I'll do it.

674
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,420
Hurry and get in there!

675
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,420
Young man!

676
00:31:59,582 --> 00:32:00,980
Don't go in! Be careful, young man!

677
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,100
Watch out!

678
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,620
- No idea if he can even swim.
- Yeah, exactly.

679
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:05,980
Look, he's going in!

680
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,290
Hurry!

681
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,100
Almost there!

682
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,180
Hurry up!

683
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,020
Kid, stay still!
Someone's coming for you!

684
00:32:13,448 --> 00:32:14,420
There! He's right there!

685
00:32:14,604 --> 00:32:15,620
Almost there! Over there!

686
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,937
- Right there!
- Pull him up!

687
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,140
- Kid, hang in there!
- Yeah!

688
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,260
- You got this, young man!
- Come on!

689
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,580
- Come on!
- Hurry up, young man!

690
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,180
Hang in there!

691
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:25,660
Lin!

692
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,382
- He's not going to make it! Hurry!
- Lin!

693
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,500
Lin!

694
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,100
Quick!

695
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,780
Hurry! He's running out of time!

696
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,740
Lin!

697
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,260
- Lin!
- Don't go in! It's dangerous!

698
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,260
Don't stop me! Lin!

699
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,820
Lin!

700
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,820
Where is he going?

701
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,780
Why haven't they come back up?

702
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,020
Where is he? Is he alright?

703
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,300
- It's dangerous. Stay back!
- Can't see anything down there!

704
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,020
Indeed.

705
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,100
- They're out!
- They're out!

706
00:32:57,182 --> 00:32:58,560
Where's the child? Where is he?

707
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,660
Where's the child?

708
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,540
He couldn't find him...

709
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,540
Stay calm...

710
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,340
He'll be saved.

711
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,340
He'll be okay.

712
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,740
Why isn't he coming back up yet?

713
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,860
- He's up!
- He's up!

714
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,860
Lin!

715
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,100
He's safe! He's safe!

716
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,100
- Well done!
- He's safe!

717
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,300
Lin!

718
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,740
- He's safe!
- Lin!

719
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,340
Lin, wake up! Lin!

720
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,340
Make way!

721
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,580
Clear the way!

722
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,860
Wake up, Lin!

723
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,340
Mommy's right here!

724
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,580
Lin, please wake up, okay?

725
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,820
I'm begging you...

726
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,300
Lin, wake up, please!

727
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,020
Wake up!

728
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,820
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

729
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,060
Lin, please wake up, okay?

730
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,740
Mommy's here. Wake up!

731
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,580
- Lin!
- He's awake!

732
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,060
- He's awake!
- He's awake!

733
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,780
Thank goodness! Great!

734
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,340
Thank you for saving my son!

735
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,340
Thank you! Thank goodness!

736
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:03,980
It was nothing.

737
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,620
Lin.

738
00:34:05,004 --> 00:34:06,260
Get him to the hospital now.

739
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,493
- Let's go.
- Thank goodness.

740
00:34:08,515 --> 00:34:09,580
Great! Thank goodness!

741
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,260
Thank you, young man!

742
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,300
- Good job!
- Thank goodness!

743
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:14,980
Great job, young man!

744
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,420
You're amazing, young man!

745
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,860
Such a kind soul.
Thank goodness you were here!

746
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,020
I just spoke to the boat captain.

747
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,020
He said it'll be another two hours

748
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,204
before we reach Dayan Reef.

749
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,020
Two more hours?

750
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,140
Alright, then.

751
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,780
So, what should we talk about?

752
00:34:46,048 --> 00:34:48,060
Actually, I've been wanting
to ask you something.

753
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,740
You wouldn't go out to sea

754
00:34:52,848 --> 00:34:54,460
just because
of one anonymous tip, right?

755
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,900
Of course not.

756
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,580
Even before my first trip out,

757
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,940
I had already received a few emails.

758
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:04,060
At first, I didn't take them seriously.

759
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,060
But the sender kept writing to me

760
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,060
and told me

761
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,460
the shipwreck site was at Dayan Reef.

762
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,740
So I went to the Cultural Relics Bureau

763
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,580
for an interview.

764
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,180
The workers there told me

765
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,500
a lot of underwater relics

766
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,060
have appeared on overseas markets
in recent years.

767
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,860
So in the end,

768
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,620
I decided
to conduct the investigation myself.

769
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,940
And you know

770
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,220
what happened after that.

771
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,220
But it's almost impossible

772
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,580
for you to investigate this alone.

773
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,780
Wang Chen's husband, Bai Zijian,

774
00:35:38,893 --> 00:35:40,060
was just transferred to

775
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,500
the Wenzhou Marine Museum.

776
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,540
You could ask him for help.

777
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:43,900
It'd be even better

778
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,980
if the Cultural Relics Bureau
could lead a dive survey.

779
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,700
Captain Wang Chen?

780
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,260
I ever did an interview with her.

781
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,220
This is great!

782
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,940
If we make a discovery today,

783
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,940
everything might fall into place.

784
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,580
Alright.

785
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,700
Zong Qing.

786
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,580
Why are you soaking wet?

787
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:16,620
Young man, you forgot your clothes.

788
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,737
- Here, your clothes.
- Your clothes.

789
00:36:18,737 --> 00:36:19,404
Thanks.

790
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,300
Miss, are you his girlfriend?

791
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,460
A kid fell into the water earlier.

792
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,420
- Thank goodness he saved the kid.
- Yeah.

793
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,060
Indeed.

794
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,900
- It wasn't easy.
- Yeah.

795
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,880
He dove in several times

796
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,115
- before he got him.
- Yes.

797
00:36:32,115 --> 00:36:33,093
He's a real hero.

798
00:36:33,093 --> 00:36:33,540
Young lady.

799
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,380
You're lucky.

800
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,460
You've got good taste.

801
00:36:35,782 --> 00:36:37,220
- He's a great guy.
- Absolutely.

802
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,915
- Thank you.
- What a perfect match.

803
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,220
Take care, then.

804
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,100
We're off.

805
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,500
Bye!

806
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,020
You saved someone?

807
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,260
Are you hurt?

808
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,020
Come on, let's get you into dry clothes.

809
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,420
What's it?

810
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,660
I...

811
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,420
I think I lost the ring

812
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,860
while I was saving the kid.

813
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,060

There are some things
we need to straighten out.

846
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,100
Go ahead.

847
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,180
This is your third trip
to Dayan Reef, right?

848
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,220
Yes.

849
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,893
And after your second trip there,

850
00:40:24,026 --> 00:40:26,069
you suspected someone
tampered with your computer

851
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,760
and changed
the whistleblower's coordinates?

852
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,100
If you've been right about it,

853
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,540
that means

854
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,300
they're aware you're investigating them.

855
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,460
And my car was smashed.

856
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,860
I bet those men were sent by someone.

857
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,420
Well, weren't those thugs
already caught?

858
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,060
What did the police say?

859
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,180
They only said those men
were paid off by someone.

860
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,700
But as for who was behind it,

861
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,100
they're still investigating.

862
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,420
If so, you need to think carefully.

863
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,900
Who knew you were looking into this?

864
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,420
You.

865
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,580
Mr. Tian. Hai.

866
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,004
Han Yuhang.

867
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,220
Han Yuhang?

868
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:13,260
He's the one
who lent you the boat, right?

869
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,020
Yeah, that's him.

870
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,980
Why do you suspect him?

871
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,580
He's the second son of Changzhou Group.

872
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,420
I once asked the whistleblower

873
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,460
who exactly was behind

874
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,380
the illegal salvage of sunken relics.

875
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,460
He wouldn't say it,

876
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,500
but he gave me a small clue.

877
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,380
So I did some research

878
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,140
and compared what I found.

879
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,620
Only Changzhou Group

880
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,900
matched the characteristics
he described.

881
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,900
You suspect Changzhou Group,

882
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,780
but you still asked the younger son

883
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,260
for help?

884
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,220
Weren't you walking right
into the lion's den?

885
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,580
When I asked him for help,

886
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,900
I didn't have those leads yet.

887
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,260
At the time,
I wanted to investigate offshore.

888
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,540
I happened to know him,

889
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,860
so I asked for help.

890
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,940
That was my oversight.

891
00:41:58,848 --> 00:42:00,620
Did he ever have access
to your computer?

892
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:02,660
No.

893
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,620
But I recalled something recently.

894
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,880
Is it about you being framed

895
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,060
at Baitun Bay?

896
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:08,700
Exactly.

897
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,540
My laptop was in my room
at the guesthouse.

898
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,620
So they framed me and called the police

899
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,860
just to get into my room

900
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,048
and mess with my laptop.

901
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,540
In any case,

902
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,620
whether your theory is right or not,

903
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,660
Han Yuhang can't know

904
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,020
about any of your progress.

905
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:26,860
Also,

906
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,220
be careful.

907
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,260
