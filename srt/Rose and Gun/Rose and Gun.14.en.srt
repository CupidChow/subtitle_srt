18
00:03:08,382 --> 00:03:09,871
Here's another foreign team member.

19
00:03:10,004 --> 00:03:11,337
It's also an oxygen tank failure.

20
00:03:11,537 --> 00:03:13,248
Captain is nowhere to be seen though.

21
00:03:13,337 --> 00:03:14,671
Also, where's Captain Chen?

22
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:15,720
Could they be in danger?

23
00:03:17,737 --> 00:03:19,370
Captain Zong,
don't forget the oxygen tank.

24
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,337
We're running out of time.

25
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,850
One more thing needs to be declared

26
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,920
before I announce the results.

27
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,810
This time, we set up
a new emergency rescue test.

28
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,320
Some members

29
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,250
only had one-third of basic oxygen
in their oxygen cylinders.

30
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
But the meter readings were normal.

31
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,600
We placed some spare oxygen cylinders

32
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,480
in the water.

33
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,370
But it was a pity
that only a few members found them.

34
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,080
You guys here are all top soldiers
around the world.

35
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,250
To be a qualified soldier,
not only should we be strong,

36
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,071
but we also must
have some other qualities,

37
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,570
preferring the life security

38
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,640
of our comrades in arms

39
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,810
to the competitiveness
in case of something crisis,

40
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:47,050
and adapting ourselves to complete
the tasks in extreme environments

41
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,050
when encountering temporary dangers.

42
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,810
Therefore, I announce

43
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,810
the winner of the game is

44
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,730
the Blue Blade Special Ops Team
from the Chinese Navy.

45
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,320
Not only were they the first team

46
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,080
to discover the malfunctioning
of the oxygen cylinders,

47
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,370
but they also had the quickest response

48
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,010
at critical moments.

49
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,610
They're also the ones
who were demonstrating

50
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,520
strong teamwork in the challenge.

51
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:25,370
As for the two captains,
Wu Si and Zong Qing,

52
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,960
they've been given a thorough checkup,

53
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:35,610
and they will soon recover
from hearing loss caused by drowning

54
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,130
after some rest and recuperation.

55
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,490
Wishing you all get good results

56
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,080
in the upcoming competition.

57
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,400
All accounted for.

58
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,280
Salute!

59
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,690
There we go.

60
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,810
Xin, check this out.

61
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,200
Doesn't it kind of look like it?

62
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,440
Look.

63
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,930
I don't think so.

64
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,050
It's solid inside.

65
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:26,730
That's not it.

66
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,440
Yeah, it's probably not.

67
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,840
Maybe this plant hasn't
produced seeds yet.

68
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:37,880
King Lan.

69
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,760
How long are we going to keep searching?

70
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,730
Wait, did you hear that?

71
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,080
Hear what?

72
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,130
A wolf...

73
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,640
Run!

74
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,080
Yangyang!

75
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,050
Run, Xin!

76
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,130
We've got rid of it, right?

77
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:51,760
I guess so.

78
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,400
That was terrifying.

79
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:56,880
Oh my god.

80
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,570
Let's rest a bit.

81
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,880
You seriously heard it?

82
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,080
I did! It was definitely a wolf howling!

83
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,690
Don't tell me you didn't hear it?

84
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,130
Are you going deaf?

85
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Maybe you heard wrong.

86
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,280
Nope, I'm sure it was a wolf.

87
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,640
It scared the life out of me.

88
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,370
Ugh, I need water.

89
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,400
Hold up.

90
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,760
Listen. Is that the wolf again?

91
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,160
Is it following us?

92
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,370
You're just scaring yourself.

93
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,090
Yangyang.

94
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,090
Look at all these pine trees.

95
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,850
This doesn't look like the forest
we were just in.

96
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,560
You're right.

97
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,450
No way.

98
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,610
We're too deep in the forest.

99
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,250
Let's head back.

100
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,920
I need five minutes first.

101
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,960
Alright, five minutes only.

102
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,670
Okay.

103
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,680
Captains.

104
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,370
How are you two?

105
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,850
I'm alright.

106
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,730
How's your ear?

107
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,160
Yes, I'm fine.

108
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,560
It won't affect tomorrow's match.

109
00:09:50,226 --> 00:09:51,850
Overall, the last mission met standards.

110
00:09:51,893 --> 00:09:54,604
Zong Qing responded quickly,
and Yi Nanwang backed us up perfectly.

111
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,450
Wang Chen also completed her task.

112
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,610
Are you all clear
on the semifinals rules?

113
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,400
Yes, Sir!

114
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,020
Don't jump the gun
or drag the team down.

115
00:10:02,026 --> 00:10:03,799
We'll cooperate
to deliver the best result.

116
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,426
Especially you, Cheng Yuan.
Stay sharp.

117
00:10:05,426 --> 00:10:06,560
You need to be in top shape

118
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,880
for the final Sniper Honor Match.

119
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,730
Yes, Sir!
- Yes, Sir!

120
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,160
Xin.

121
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,970
This isn't working.

122
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,490
Here, let me try.

123
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,850
Give it to me.

124
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,680
Why isn't it lighting?

125
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,490
Right?

126
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,090
Fire starter.

127
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,760
Strike down to create sparks.

128
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,450
That's what I'm doing.

129
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,280
Xin, who wrote that for you?

130
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,450
How detailed.

131
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,880
Who else could it be?

132
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,730
It was Wu Si.

133
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,400
There was this one time

134
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,400
when he said he'd write me
some wild survival tips.

135
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,210
I never thought
they'd come in handy now.

136
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:29,450
If only

137
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,920
Zong Qing and Captain Wu were here...

138
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,210
I seriously regret it.

139
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,826
I shouldn't have asked you

140
00:11:37,848 --> 00:11:39,626
to come to this awful place with me.

141
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,640
There, there.

142
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,210
What's the point of saying that now?

143
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,250
We made the choice.

144
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,337
No matter what,
we've got to see it through.

145
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,330
Right?

146
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,610
Forget it. Let's not light it.

147
00:12:01,515 --> 00:12:02,850
Good thing we've got a lamp here.

148
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,730
It'll keep wild animals away at night.

149
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,680
Come on.

150
00:12:06,937 --> 00:12:08,248
We've been running all day.

151
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,920
Let's rest up and save energy.

152
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,920
Get in position.

153
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,400
Ready.

154
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:14,970

187
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,840
We're already lost.

188
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,010
We can't go in circles again,

189
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,560
so we need to mark

190
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,250
any path we've walked.

191
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,210
In case someone sees it,

192
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,280
they'll know where to find us.

193
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,280
Indeed. Zong Qing told me
the same thing.

194
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,210
He said if you ever
get lost in the forest,

195
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,520
you must leave a mark.

196
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,840
However, will anyone actually come here?

197
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,890
And will they even see it?

198
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,930
Still, one more mark

199
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,690
means one more chance.

200
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:19,690
Alright.

201
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,450
Get up.

202
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,730
Two minutes are up.

203
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:26,890
Okay.

204
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,730
We have to get out before dark.

205
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,170
Give me a hand.

206
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:46,760
Hello?

207
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,970
There are two Chinese girls
at our hotel.

208
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,650
They've been missing for two days.

209
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,970
They went into the forest,

210
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,450
and they might be in danger.

211
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,280
Xin.

212
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,210
Still no sign of water?

213
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:37,890
You finished checking everything?

214
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,520
How much food do we have left?

215
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,730
Just two packs of compressed biscuits.

216
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:44,800
Half a piece of bread,

217
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,250
and this tiny bit of water.

218
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,250
Here.

219
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,360
I'm fine. Save the water.

220
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,320
No, drink it. All of it.

221
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Slowly.

222
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,010
Finish it.

223
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,250
Give it to me.

224
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,210
But it's already empty.

225
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,280
We'll keep the bottle.

226
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,040
If we find water tomorrow,

227
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,210
we can collect some.

228
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,520
Xin.

229
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,737
Are we really not getting out of here?

230
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,080
If we still can't
find the way out tomorrow,

231
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,271
then we're in real trouble.

232
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:26,800
Well done.

233
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,080
That's impressive.

234
00:23:28,293 --> 00:23:29,560
Let me congratulate you first.

235
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,970
You've trained an excellent unit.

236
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:31,800
Thank you, Chief.

237
00:23:35,182 --> 00:23:37,930
Wu Si and the others have always been
top of the class in the brigade.

238
00:23:37,982 --> 00:23:39,560
I'm not surprised they took first place.

239
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,080
The competition includes
the best from each country.

240
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,360
To win in such
a global military contest,

241
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,930
it's no small feat.

242
00:23:45,982 --> 00:23:48,120
Make sure they're properly commended
when they return.

243
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:48,800
Yes, Sir.

244
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,360
My wife

245
00:23:52,426 --> 00:23:53,760
called at just the right time.

246
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,450
Let me share the good news
with her first.

247
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:56,360
Hello?

248
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:57,970
Good news...

249
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:01,360
What?

250
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,690
Don't panic. I got it.

251
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,250
What's happened, Chief?

252
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,250
Lan Yangyang has gone missing in An.

253
00:24:14,604 --> 00:24:16,293
The hotel's already filed
a police report.

254
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,120
Yangyang is missing?

255
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:52,300
(Email not replied.)

256
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,450
(If we're meeting,)

257
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,120
(Miss Tang must be present.)

258
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,730
(Fine by me.)

259
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,137
(We'll meet when Miss Tang returns.)

260
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,170
Mr. Han.

261
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,250
This is the senior care facility

262
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,930
improvement plan drafted by Mr. Ma.

263
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:43,730
That's not urgent.

264
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,600
Well,

265
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,040
I have something really important

266
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,600
to discuss with Miss Tang.

267
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:48,490
Help me check

268
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,730
when she'll be back.

269
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,690
Got it.

270
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,690
Stop adding salt.

271
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,360
Thanks.

272
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,280
You can have mine.

273
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,280
I'll wear it, then.

274
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:03,825
You're amazing.

275
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,800
That's right.

276
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,690
Good job.

277
00:26:05,737 --> 00:26:07,293
- Help yourself with the food.
- Okay.

278
00:26:07,293 --> 00:26:07,800
Eat more.

279
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,360
Sure.

280
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:11,930
Alright.

281
00:26:12,048 --> 00:26:13,120
- See you.
- Is it salty?

282
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,537
See you.

283
00:26:13,582 --> 00:26:15,170
Cheers!

284
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,040
Come on!

285
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,840
Captain, what were they talking about?

286
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,600
Still wearing that?

287
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,040
Hey, Yi Nanwang.

288
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,982
You've only been in the force
for two years,

289
00:26:25,982 --> 00:26:27,670
but you've joined
such a high-level event.

290
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:29,050
You're ahead of a lot of folks here.

291
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,490
You flatter me, Captain.

292
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,600
I got to compete abroad

293
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,800
because of all of you.

294
00:26:34,871 --> 00:26:36,710
It's thanks to you all
that I've improved much.

295
00:26:36,715 --> 00:26:38,730
Don't be so humble.
We're just support.

296
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,560
Your personal effort is what counts.

297
00:26:42,848 --> 00:26:43,915
How about this?

298
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,360
I'll toast with juice.

299
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,490
Here, cheers to all of you!

300
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:48,600
Drink up!

301
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:52,490
Great!

302
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,560
- Bravo!
- Nice!

303
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,448
We're not drinking.

304
00:26:54,471 --> 00:26:55,493
Juice is expensive.

305
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:56,800
Either way,

306
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,930
our win

307
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,170
deserves a celebration.

308
00:26:59,226 --> 00:27:00,010
Let's toast to that!

309
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:00,840
- Come on.
- Cheers!

310
00:27:00,848 --> 00:27:01,782
- Here.
- There we go.

311
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,490
Okay. One, two, three.

312
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,010
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

313
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,360
Captain Wu.

314
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,360
It's from the Chinese Embassy.

315
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,120
Please take the call.

316
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,490
Greetings, sir.

317
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,120
Are you okay?

318
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,560
Hello, this is Wu Si.

319
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,360
(The military attaché
conveyed orders from above.)

320
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,360
(The four of us are to assist
with the operation)

321
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,604
(and conduct a full search
for the missing Chinese citizens.)

322
00:27:35,604 --> 00:27:36,250
Copy that.

323
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,210
So here we are.

324
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,080
This is the place.

325
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,970
There are too many tourists over here.

326
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,080
So you have to head out from here
to reach the forest.

327
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,410
You'll stay here

328
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:04,280
and be ready to provide help and backup.

329
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,410
No, no, no.

330
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,450
We've got the manpower.

331
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,210
We'd be better off
going into the jungle with them.

332
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,010
I believe someone already briefed you

333
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:16,280
before the departure.

334
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,730
But I must repeat.

335
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:21,800
This rescue of Chinese citizens

336
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,520
is a coordinated operation
led by the Embassy.

337
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,450
Due to the fact that the two of you

338
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,410
know the missing persons,

339
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:32,155
you've been granted special approval

340
00:28:32,156 --> 00:28:34,450
to assist the police
in the search and rescue.

341
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:37,160
However, no weapon is allowed.

342
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,890
Please comply with our laws.

343
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:41,970
Got it.

344
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,560
This is the equipment.

345
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,650
There are a lot of wild animals
in the forest.

346
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:54,760
So please don't harm them
during the search.

347
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:55,890
Sure.

348
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:56,520
Sure.

349
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:57,280
Thanks.

350
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:58,650
Okay, let's go.

351
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,730
This is a massive forest.

352
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,137
We can't keep searching like this.

353
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,520
Let's split up.

354
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,639
I'll pair with Zong Qing.

355
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,280
Cheng Yuan and Yi Nanwang
will go together.

356
00:29:25,426 --> 00:29:26,515
Report via walkie-talkie.

357
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,120
- Roger.
- Roger.

358
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:41,490
Here.

359
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:42,490
Give me your hand.

360
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:44,320
I'm so tired.

361
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,040
Yangyang.

362
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,010
Listen.

363
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,650
Water... It sounds like running water!

364
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,760
It is water!

365
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:57,840
Hurry!

366
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,780
It could be a stream.
Come on, let's go get water!

367
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,871
Quick, let's get the water!

368
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,560
Yangyang.

369
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:10,320
Look!

370
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,800
Xin, we found water!

371
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,210
Slow down.

372
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,600
Quick. Come on.

373
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,450
Xin.

374
00:31:30,093 --> 00:31:32,170
Sergeant Cheng,
there's a fork in the path here.

375
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,040
I'll check it out.

376
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,170
Copy that.

377
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,320
Yi Nanwang, keep your distance.

378
00:31:43,426 --> 00:31:44,560
Don't stray too far from me.

379
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,450
Copy.

380
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,250
What's your status over there?

381
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,010
Reporting.

382
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:04,840
There are no signs yet.

383
00:32:05,115 --> 00:32:06,250
Alright, continue the search.

384
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,250
Roger.

385
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,560
Are you okay?

386
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,650
No, I'm not. I'm so tired, man.

387
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:12,600
Sorry.

388
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,730
Zong Qing.

389
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:54,471
We've walked at least five
or six kilometers, right?

390
00:32:54,937 --> 00:32:56,120
It's probably more than that.

391
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,490
Could they have made it this far?

392
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,560
When people are lost and panicking,

393
00:33:02,182 --> 00:33:03,840
they don't realize how far they've gone.

394
00:33:04,626 --> 00:33:06,600
During our honeymoon,
I took Yangyang hiking.

395
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,426
I ever taught her this.
If she ever got lost,

396
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:09,930
she should mark the trees.

397
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,915
But I haven't seen any markings
along the way.

398
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:21,120
Yangyang.

399
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:33,560
Let's go!

400
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,250
- Go!
- Come on!

401
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,370
Zong Qing.

402
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:22,970
There's a path here.

403
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:25,804
Considering their strength,
they wouldn't go into the dense woods.

404
00:34:25,848 --> 00:34:27,093
They probably followed the road.

405
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,600
Careful.

406
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,370
Slow down, wait for me.

407
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,850
Let's sit for a bit.

408
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:54,600
Xin.

409
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,404
Something's wrong with this spot.

410
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,330
Well, stay here.

411
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,120
I'll go ahead and look for a path.

412
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:11,970
Please don't.

413
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,370
Don't leave me here alone.

414
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:14,600
Let me come with you.

415
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,770
Your leg's in bad shape.

416
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,370
You need to save your strength.

417
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,240
I'll go ahead

418
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:21,848
and come back once I find the way.

419
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:23,930
Wait for me.

420
00:35:58,850 --> 00:35:59,600
Yangyang.

421
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,200
Don't wander around.

422
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,720
Stay here and wait for me.

423
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,010
Did you hear me?

424
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,330
Yes.

425
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:07,410
Well, come back soon.

426
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,770
Don't go too far.

427
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,720
Sure.

428
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:33,970
Zong Qing.

429
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,970
That's a domestically made
550-grade paracord.

430
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:39,720
It must've been tied by the ladies.

431
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:42,720
Could it really be?
Did you teach her that?

432
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,915
I made her a survival guide.

433
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:45,360
It was inspired by you.

434
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,120
Let's hope it's them.

435
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:36,490
Zong Qing!

436
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,640
The fire didn't catch.

437
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,450
But someone camped here.

438
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,010
Tang Xin!

439
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:51,810
Yangyang!

440
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:52,520
Tang Xin!

441
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:55,330
Tang Xin!

442
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,200
Yangyang!

443
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,490
Tang Xin!

444
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,290
Yangyang!

445
00:37:58,970 --> 00:37:59,680
Zong Qing!

446
00:38:02,982 --> 00:38:04,200
There's another knot here.

447
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:07,770
It has to be them.

448
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,290
It's definitely them.

449
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:20,040
Tang Xin!

450
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,890
Yangyang!

451
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,010
Tang Xin!

452
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:22,850
Yangyang!

453
00:38:24,071 --> 00:38:25,382
Come, let's check out that area.

454
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:27,080
Hurry.

455
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,520
Yangyang!

456
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:33,600
Tang Xin!

457
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:35,850
Yangyang!

458
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,450
Tang Xin!

459
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,410
Yangyang!

460
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:39,520
Tang Xin!

461
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,810
Yangyang!

462
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:43,680
Tang Xin!

463
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,680
Yangyang!

464
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,770
Captain.

465
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,040
They must be close.

466
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:55,720
Tang Xin!

467
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:56,720
Yangyang!

468
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:11,120
Tang Xin!

469
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:12,520
Yangyang!

470
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,490
Tang Xin!

471
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,290
Yangyang!

472
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:16,680
Zong Qing.

473
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,930
- Yangyang!
- I'm over here!

474
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,680
Yangyang!

475
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:23,680
Zong Qing, I'm here!

476
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,040
I'm here...

477
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,120
Yangyang, stay still.

478
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,200
– Zong Qing!
– Stay still.

479
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:28,850
Just stay still.

480
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,290
Yangyang. Where's Tang Xin?

481
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,930
Well, she went to find a way out.

482
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:38,804
Which way did she go?

483
00:39:38,871 --> 00:39:40,040
Where you came from.

484
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,040
Is anyone there?

485
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,160
Who's there?

486
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,520
Is... Is anyone there?

487
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,040
Stay back!

488
00:40:31,515 --> 00:40:32,410
Don't come any closer!

489
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,490
Stay back!

490
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,560
Don't come any closer!

491
00:40:47,848 --> 00:40:49,080
Don't be scared. It's me.

492
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,200
