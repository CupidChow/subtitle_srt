18
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,660
Captain Wu.

19
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,020
What should I do?

20
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,500
Do you want this child?

21
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,580
Yes, of course I do.

22
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,140
Do you know what having a child means?

23
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,460
Do you know

24
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,380
what I remember most from my childhood?

25
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,980
It was my mom waiting by the phone

26
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,820
every day, hoping it'd ring.

27
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,700
Sometimes, we get

28
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,940
one phone call a week.

29
00:02:30,293 --> 00:02:31,780
Sometimes, we'll go one whole month,

30
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,540
half a year, or even longer

31
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,260
without a single call.

32
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,540
You're not from a military family,

33
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,940
so you don't understand.

34
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,980
But it's pure suffering

35
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,900
for the kids and family.

36
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,100
It's much better now.

37
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,780
We can contact every week when off duty.

38
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,380
When things are good,

39
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,380
we can go home a few times a week.

40
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,180
But that's not enough

41
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,620
to raise a child.

42
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:03,780
Even the basics,

43
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,500
what if she can't eat from nausea?

44
00:03:07,048 --> 00:03:08,100
What if she can't walk

45
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,260
and can't go to pregnancy checkups?

46
00:03:11,048 --> 00:03:12,940
What if you don't have leave
on her due date?

47
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,060
You can't even be sure.

48
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,460
Yangyang has to expect the worst.

49
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,115
You should
see things from her perspective.

50
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,540
She has to imagine
you'll be absent all the time.

51
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,500
What should she do?

52
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,460
Captain Wu.

53
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,260
If it were you, what would you do?

54
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,820
Just thinking

55
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,540
of my pregnant wife

56
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,980
getting up at night

57
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,940
with no one there
to pour her a glass of water,

58
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,460
makes my chest feel tight

59
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,100
and heavy.

60
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,380
I understand you.

61
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,500
Yes, it's a huge responsibility.

62
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,460
But you have to carry it.

63
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:57,940
If you can't,

64
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,700
everything you said at the warship

65
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,820
was nonsense.

66
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,340
Zong Qing.

67
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,580
Explain the flag signals to the brides.

68
00:04:23,593 --> 00:04:24,820
Let the sea bear witness.

69
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,260
With the ship as our matchmaker,

70
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,580
we'll be together

71
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,900
forever!

72
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,500
What a rare guest.

73
00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:39,560
Sorry, I need to trouble you again.

74
00:04:39,582 --> 00:04:40,900
Something urgent came up at work.

75
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,380
I'll leave Yangyang with you for a bit. I'll pick her up after.

76
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,020
It's alright.
I just got off shift, so I'm free.

77
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,460
Yangyang, you're with me today.

78
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,940
Go on. Why are you being shy?

79
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,460
Mrs. Wang, sorry to trouble you.

80
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:54,700
Bye.

81
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,340
Goodbye.

82
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,020
Mrs. Wang.

83
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,900
You're due soon.
Why are you still working?

84
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,260
I still have a few days to go.

85
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,220
Staying home is boring.

86
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,460
Have you prepared everything?

87
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,700
What's there to prepare?

88
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,382
I'll just deliver the baby
when it's time.

89
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,700
Want to touch her?

90
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,500
No thanks.

91
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,700
Are you scared?

92
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,220
Aren't you scared?

93
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,820
What's there to fear?

94
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,140
It's just pregnancy.

95
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,100
When I was pregnant
with the first child,

96
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,780
I was scared too.

97
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,500
Wang Lang was in the army then.

98
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,140
I stayed with my mother-in-law
back home.

99
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,580
I watched my belly

100
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,460
grow bigger day by day.

101
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,940
I was so panicked.

102
00:05:49,273 --> 00:05:50,020
I thought

103
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,820
I was not even ready.

104
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,460
How can I be a mom?

105
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:57,340
The worst part was that Wang Lang
wasn't around during the pregnancy.

106
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,580
Not until the due date

107
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,780
did he get leave to come home.

108
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,820
But who knew

109
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,500
he got an urgent order on the train.

110
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,500
He was called back halfway.

111
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,500
I broke down when I heard that.

112
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
Wang Zhaoyang
was born prematurely that day.

113
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,420
Three days after giving birth,

114
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,860
Wang Lang finally called me.

115
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,060
On the phone,

116
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,740
he was crying so much

117
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,260
that he couldn't even
finish apologizing.

118
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,060
Brigadier cried?

119
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,820
Have you heard a man cry?

120
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,700
That kind where he chokes up

121
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,060
and sounds terrible.

122
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,180
It's like he's suffocating himself.

123
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,860
Actually, having a child
is a shared responsibility.

124
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,940
But giving birth

125
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,620
is something women face alone,

126
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,060
from start to finish.

127
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,620
You'll be pregnant for ten months.

128
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,300
Think about it.
Not only does your body lose shape,

129
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,860
but your memory also worsens.

130
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,620
You'll be throwing up every single day.

131
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,740
In the end, your feet and hands

132
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,020
will swell too much to wear shoes.

133
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,060
Especially during labor.

134
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,020
The pain is so intense

135
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,060
that you forget how to scream.

136
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,860
But it's strange.

137
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,420
When the nurse

138
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,740
places that ugly little thing

139
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,380
on you,

140
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,180
that wrinkly and red little hand

141
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,060
just grabs your finger.

142
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,260
In that moment,

143
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,180
you instantly calm down

144
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,180
and forget all about the pain.

145
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,620
Your heart will melt.

146
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,140
Mrs. Wang.

147
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,380
I'm pregnant too.

148
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,180
I could tell.

149
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,260
That's why Xin brought you to me.

150
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,060
But I don't know what to do.

151
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,620
I'm a little scared.

152
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,880
Yangyang.

153
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,300
Remember this.

154
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,500
Giving birth is not a duty.

155
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,260
It's a personal choice.

156
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,180
After I had Wang Zhaoyang,

157
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,180
I thought

158
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,260
I'll never

159
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,420
have a second child.

160
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,020
But look at me now.

161
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,820
Pregnancy is tough.

162
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,580
But you know what?

163
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,060
After the baby is born,

164
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,620
many unexpected things

165
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,180
will happen.

166
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,140
Really.

167
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,580
So

168
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,380
I hope you think it through.

169
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,500
(I forgot to tell you.)

170
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,020
(The day after you gave
the porcelain shards to Wu Si,)

171
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,680
(I sent them to the museum.)

172
00:08:45,871 --> 00:08:48,220
(I hope it would catch
Cultural Relics Bureau's attention.)

173
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:48,860
(Also,)

174
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,740
(if it's true that someone is stealing
underwater cultural relics)

175
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,260
(more relics)

176
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,140
(will be smuggled overseas)

177
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,800
(for every day we delay.)

178
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,380
Xin, Mr. Tian asked you
to join the meeting.

179
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,260
Got it.

180
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,460
(Atocha,)

181
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,540
(a company registered
in the Roman Islands.)

182
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,620
(Check out that company.)

183
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,100
(The address is 56, Torini Street.)

184
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,860
(What can I find with just a name)

185
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,260
(and an address?)

186
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,660
(Then it's up to your abilities.)

187
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,780
(I'm just a reporter.)

188
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,460
(I'm not that powerful.)

189
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,020
(Any other leads?)

190
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,540
(Tell me all of them.)

191
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,460
(That's all for now.)

192
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,820
(One New Email Received)

193
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,620
(But perhaps you'll get lucky)

194
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,260
(and find something.)

195
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,093
Find me a company

196
00:10:06,093 --> 00:10:07,540
registered in the Roman Islands.

197
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,860
Is it related to the relics?

198
00:10:08,982 --> 00:10:10,860
It's important.
I need all the information.

199
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:14,780
Mrs. Wang.

200
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,260
I don't feel anything.

201
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,260
I'm not happy

202
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,860
or excited at all.

203
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,260
I don't look forward to it.

204
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,660
Am I unfit to be a mom?

205
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,540
Of course not.

206
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,380
Do you know

207
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,740
when I stopped regretting?

208
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,340
When Wang Zhaoyang turned one month old.

209
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,140
Wang Lang applied for leave
and came home.

210
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,020
I recall waking up

211
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,780
one morning

212
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,020
to vaguely see Wang Lang

213
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,860
clumsily feeding the baby.

214
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,460
Scared to wake me,

215
00:10:47,471 --> 00:10:48,620
he didn't turn on the light.

216
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,020
He just opened

217
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,660
a small slit between the curtains,

218
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,140
turned the baby toward it,

219
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,140
and tried to feed the baby the pacifier.

220
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,460
He was so clumsy
that he was sweating all over.

221
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,020
Watching him like that...

222
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,540
Honestly,

223
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,500
when Wang Zhaoyang misbehaves

224
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,380
or Wang Lang upsets me,

225
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,780
I think of that day.

226
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,540
I think

227
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,660
of the warm sunlight

228
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,893
that shone through the slit that day.

229
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,140
And I'll feel

230
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,860
that

231
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,140
it's all worth it.

232
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,260
Can I touch her?

233
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,380
Of course.

234
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,860
She's turning around

235
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,260
to say hi to you.

236
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,260
Did you feel it?

237
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,900
Our little one is saying

238
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,020
"Yangyang,

239
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,260
we'll be meeting very soon."

240
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,740
How did it go?

241
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,540
I did find something.

242
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,380
This company

243
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,500
(Atocha, 56, Torini Street)
is registered in the Roman Islands,

244
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,860
but I couldn't find anything else.

245
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,380
Maybe try pressing
your informant again.

246
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,740
If he relents,

247
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,780
he might tell you others.

248
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,380
I've pressed him for days

249
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,260
before he told me about Atocha.

250
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,140
Alright, work on something else.

251
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,271
I'll think of something.

252
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,660
Dad, Mom, I'm home.

253
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:33,860
You're home.

254
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,780
Hurry over.

255
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,660
Let me officially

256
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,500
announce some good news.

257
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,380
What good news?

258
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,140
Lan Yangyang

259
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,740
is pregnant.

260
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,140
This is great news.

261
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,660
I'll call Lan Weiguo later

262
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,660
to congratulate him.

263
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,660
At the very least, Xin should share

264
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,500
some good fortune
from his becoming a grandpa.

265
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,140
Dad, must you always

266
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,620
drag me into everything?

267
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,260
Who else would I drag in?

268
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,860
I'm just jealous.

269
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,020
Look at them.

270
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,740
How annoying.

271
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,737
Let me help you.

272
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,140
How nice.

273
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,100
Sergeant Cheng.

274
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,260
What's up with Captain Zong?

275
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,740
How long will he run for?

276
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,140
You don't get it.

277
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,620
He'll stop running
when he figures things out.

278
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,493
Captain Zong, your wife texted you.

279
00:13:45,493 --> 00:13:47,715
Are you going to read it?
If not, I'll toss your phone.

280
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,540
(Lan Yangyang:
I'm going to Dad's. Talk later.)

281
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:07,740
What?

282
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,140
No, again?

283
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,500
What happened?

284
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,860
Guess he didn't get good news.

285
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,500
(A needle is inserted through
the mother's spinal foramen)

286
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,260
(to guide a thin catheter)

287
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,740
(into the epidural space.)

288
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,860
(It's a potential space)

289
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,500
(outside the spinal canal,
filled with nerve roots.)

290
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,860
Tell me what you think.

291
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,140
That's all the informant gave me.

292
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,380
After what happened last time,

293
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,100
he's probably wary of you.

294
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,860
This confirms again

295
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,860
that my suspicion of Changzhou
was correct.

296
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,590
I think he still has clues.

297
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,260
Think about his last statement.

298
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,740
"If you're lucky,

299
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,500
you might find something."

300
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,260
You're saying

301
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,260
he'll give me more clues

302
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,260
if I go to Roman?

303
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,860
It's possible.

304
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,260
Or

305
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,380
he's testing you.

306
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,980
This trip is worth it then.

307
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,620
You can go

308
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,620
but not alone.

309
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,740
I'll bring Hai.

310
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,500
I'm saying

311
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,337
it's not the same abroad
as it is at home.

312
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,380
Your safety must be taken seriously.

313
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,500
Before you go,

314
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,860
you must report

315
00:16:03,982 --> 00:16:05,260
to the relevant authorities.

316
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,500
Got it.

317
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:17,500
(Chinese People's Liberation Army)

318
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,620
The Gulf of Aden is a key route
from the Indian Ocean

319
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,860
into the Mediterranean
and the Atlantic Ocean.

320
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,500
It's also a major route connecting

321
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,860
East Asia,
Western Europe and North America.

322
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,500
Each year,
hundreds of countries and regions

323
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,100
send about 20,000 vessels

324
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,860
to sail through this route.

325
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,260
They take up one-fifth

326
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,380
of global sea cargo.

327
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,020
Since we sent

328
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,380
our first escort fleet in 2008,

329
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,620
long-range escort

330
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,500
has become a regular deployment

331
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,620
and a tradition
in fulfilling our duties.

332
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,380
This escort follows old rules.

333
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,220
Three warships in one formation.

334
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,740
Wenzhou Ship will lead.

335
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,100
Wang Lang.

336
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,020
Yes!

337
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,500
This escort crosses unknown waters
for the first time.

338
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,900
You must boost your leadership.

339
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,580
Also, the higher-ups decided

340
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,460
to let you form

341
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,693
this time's special ops team.

342
00:17:16,693 --> 00:17:18,100
Lead well. Train well.

343
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,260
I'll complete the mission!

344
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,780
At ease.

345
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,260
Attention!

346
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,460
Chief.

347
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,020
Blue Blade Team is assembled.

348
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,737
Awaiting orders.

349
00:17:28,737 --> 00:17:29,300
At ease.

350
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,180
Yes!

351
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,260
At ease.

352
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,700
A command.

353
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,660
At ease.

354
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:43,020
I'll spare the nonsense.

355
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,660
A new round of escort missions

356
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,740
is about to begin.

357
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,780
I'm here today to select candidates.

358
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,500
Same rules.

359
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,900
We'll train first.

360
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:52,020
Winners join the mission.

361
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,180
Don't let me see Blue Blade fall behind.

362
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,020
Can you do it?

363
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,020
- Yes!
- Yes!

364
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,200
Fire!

365
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,260
- One, two, three, four!
- One, two, three, four!

366
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,100
No showers tonight.

367
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,700
Avoid water for the next few days.

368
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,500
Can you be more gentle, Dr. Qiu?

369
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,460
Don't move.

370
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,940
No tough guy will whine.

371
00:18:52,204 --> 00:18:54,315
How can you join special forces
without getting injured?

372
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,004
Bear with it.

373
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,220
Does it still hurt?

374
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:00,740
No.

375
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,060
Well, Dr. Qiu.

376
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:13,500
Can you work a bit faster?

377
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,004
I have to help in the kitchen later.

378
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,500
Bear with it.

379
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,020
Cut down on the firewood. Don't burn it.

380
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,260
How's it going?

381
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,740
Captain, almost done.

382
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,460
Alright.

383
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,500
Report!
We're back to help in the kitchen.

384
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,940
Aren't you applying ointment
for sunburn?

385
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,700
All done. I'm fine.

386
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,700
Captain.

387
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,740
Do our tents

388
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,740
have to be that close to the beach?

389
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,740
The sound of waves keeps me

390
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,940
from sleeping at night.

391
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,220
You can't sleep with waves?

392
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,660
What will you do on a warship?

393
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,515
You need to listen more
and get used to it.

394
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,580
Overcome it.

395
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:05,700
Yes.

396
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,580
Mr. Yi Nanwang.

397
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,460
You know how bad
your swimming is, right?

398
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,220
Practice more. It'll be helpful.

399
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,740
Get used to it.

400
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:19,871
I'll go over first.

401
00:20:19,893 --> 00:20:20,537
Alright.

402
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,500
Where are you hurt?

403
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,500
My back.

404
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,500
Here?

405
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,500
Ouch.

406
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,180
Ouch!

407
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,660
How is it, punk?

408
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,900
Blue Blade isn't easy, right?

409
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,940
I'm doing great.

410
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,220
Stop lying.

411
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,982
You can't even sleep
with the sound of waves.

412
00:20:44,004 --> 00:20:44,960
I'm doing great.

413
00:20:45,003 --> 00:20:46,300
I'm doing great.

414
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,740
When will the food be ready?

415
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,220
I'm starving. Hurry up.

416
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,460
Tactical rowing.

417
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,900
Enemy.

418
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,900
Enemy cleared.

419
00:21:55,404 --> 00:21:56,626
Alright, go straight ashore.

420
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,740
Zong Xi.

421
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,020
What are you looking at?

422
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,460
There are no fairies in the sky.

423
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,220
What I'm thinking about
is way better than fairies.

424
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,300
I'm thinking about my son's name.

425
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,060
What do you think of Zong Xi?

426
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,100
My dad picked it.

427
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,540
Zong Xi?

428
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,500
Why not call him

429
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,220
Zong Dong, Zong Nan, or Zong Bei?
[*These mean directions in English.]

430
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,540
Why must it be Zong Xi?

431
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,300
Do you know anything about culture?

432
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,540
It's the "Xi" that means bustling.

433
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,660
Who names their kid
something like direction?

434
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,493
Your kid's name should be

435
00:22:50,515 --> 00:22:51,515
Wu Liuqi, Wu Basishi,

436
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,540
Wu Jiusishiwu, or Wu Dang.
[*These mean numbers in English.]

437
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,340
Actually, Wu Dang sounds pretty good.

438
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,020
The kid should stand on his own.

439
00:22:58,248 --> 00:23:00,060
Spoken like
a true major battalion commander.

440
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,780
I'll name yours.

441
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,780
You're definitely up to no good.

442
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,580
I'll give your kid a nice name.

443
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,220
How about Zong Shi?
[*Means a master.]

444
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,900
Alright, my kid's name is Zong Shi.

445
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,320
Yours is Wu Dang.
[*Means an ancient sect.]

446
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,260
They will grow up
to become special forces.

447
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:17,980
How about that?

448
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,220
Unbelievable.

449
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,980
Zong Xi sounds nice.

450
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,780
Right? I think so too.

451
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,020
Zong Xi!

452
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,460
♪A battle-hardened company♪

453
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,260

00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,460
Put him down!

459
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,500
Gather round!

460
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,980
Let me show you how it's done.

461
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,740
- Good job!
- Good job!

462
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,780
Keep up!

463
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:29,980
Can you do it?

464
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,060
No, stop.

465
00:25:40,137 --> 00:25:41,260
You can't handle it anymore?

466
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:52,820
Captain.

467
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,020
A few more times left.
Hold on a bit more.

468
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,740
Yes, Captain.

469
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,660
Resume training.

470
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,740
Hurry.

471
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,420
One more, and you'll finish all four.

472
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,420
Here. Stand still.

473
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,260
Okay, keep rocking.

474
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,260
Investigate in the Roman Islands?

475
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,020
Tang Xin, you've gone a little too far.

476
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,740
You found nothing in China.

477
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,404
Do you think
you'll find the truth abroad?

478
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,740
This is the only lead I have now.

479
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,740
I've looked into it.

480
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,700
Organizations
registered in the Roman Islands

481
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,260
don't disclose corporate information,

482
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,300
so many companies

483
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,410
engaged in illegal activity

484
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,940
choose there as their base.

485
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,020
Since the informant gave this to me,

486
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,900
Atocha Company

487
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,420
must hold valuable info.

488
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,940
He gave you

489
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,100
lots of leads.

490
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,020
And what's the result?

491
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,060
You went to sea three times.

492
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,660
You didn't even see a sunken ship.

493
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,740
Once you're in Roman,

494
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,500
can you get more information from him?

495
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,820
Hello, Mr. Bai?

496
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,782
Tang Xin, the identification results

497
00:27:03,782 --> 00:27:05,980
for the porcelain shards
you gave me last time are out.

498
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,740
They're indeed sunken ship relics.

499
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,260
Wait, Mr. Bai.

500
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,020
I didn't catch that.

501
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,060
Can you repeat that?

502
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,300
I said that the identification results

503
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,820
for the porcelain shards
you gave me last time are out.

504
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,220
They're indeed sunken ship relics.

505
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,300
If the porcelain were intact,

506
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,300
it would be highly valuable.

507
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,460
Cultural Relics Bureau
has officially decided

508
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,260
to begin underwater archaeological work

509
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,740
at Dayan Reef.

510
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,300
That's great.

511
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,300
Thank you, Mr. Bai.

512
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,300
We should be the ones thanking you.

513
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,848
The head of Cultural Relics Bureau

514
00:27:35,871 --> 00:27:37,700
asked me to pass along their thanks.

515
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,020
Don't mention it.

516
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,220
We're just doing our duty.

517
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,660
Alright, bye.

518
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,020
Mr. Tian, you heard that.

519
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,660
Don't you think I should go to Roman

520
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,540
and finish this investigation?

521
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,100
Alright.

522
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,780
Good luck then.

523
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,020
But be sure to stay safe.

524
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,420
After some intensive training,

525
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,700
the new selection list
for the escort mission is out.

526
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,660
Selected personnel will undergo
isolated training at sea.

527
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,580
Only those who pass the training

528
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,660
are qualified to board the ship
for the mission.

529
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,980
I now announce

530
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,740
the selection list of escort personnel.

531
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,540
Wu Si!

532
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,300
Here!

533
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,300
Zong Qing!

534
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:23,900
Here!

535
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:25,900
Cheng Yuan!

536
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,020
Here!

537
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,540
Dai Wei!

538
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,260
Here!

539
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,820
Zhou Keyang!

540
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,700
Here!

541
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,020
Li Xu!

542
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:33,820
Here!

543
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,260
Ye Haiyang!

544
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:35,900
Here!

545
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,500
Yi Nanwang!

546
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,420
Here!

547
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,100
Wang Chen!

548
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,700
Here!

549
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,540
Peng Tiechao!

550
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,100
Here!

551
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,100
Yu Bo!

552
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:45,700
Here!

553
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,460
Su Hong!

554
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,100
Here!

555
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,100
Liu Xiangsheng!

556
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,100
Here!

557
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,340
Ke'er.

558
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,060
Cheng Yuan, why are you here today?

559
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,700
I know.

560
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,515
You're here to make up
for my birthday, right?

561
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,020
I'm about to leave for escort duty.

562
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,020
How long will you be gone?

563
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,300
Not sure. It depends on the mission.

564
00:29:22,737 --> 00:29:24,540
But you're getting discharged
in September.

565
00:29:25,204 --> 00:29:26,737
I probably won't make it back in time.

566
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,900
I understand.

567
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,060
Anything else?

568
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,340
If not, I'll go back first.

569
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,780
I'm sorry.

570
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,020
Don't be mad.

571
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,300
You're afraid I'd be mad?

572
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,260
Escort duty is a mission. I have to go.

573
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,300
I never said you couldn't go,

574
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,900
but why couldn't you tell me in advance?

575
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,260
You knew I'm getting discharged
this September.

576
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,580
And you knew clearly

577
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,420
that escort duty would overlap
with that time.

578
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,660
But you still chose to sign up.

579
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,900
You only told me
once the list was confirmed.

580
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,540
Are you trying to avoid my discharge?

581
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,420
No.

582
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,780
Don't worry.

583
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,500
I'm a soldier too.

584
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,900
I won't hold you back.

585
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,420
I chose to join the army myself.

586
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,740
I'll leave on my own too.

587
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,580
Ke'er.

588
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,180
There's no signal at sea.

589
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,900
Calls have to be made
within the permitted time frame.

590
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,260
I can't contact you often.

591
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,300
I'm sorry.

592
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,580
Take care of yourself.

593
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,420
Cheng Yuan.

594
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,740
Do you know what I've heard

595
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,100
most often these past two years?

596
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,460
It's exactly what you just said.

597
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,260
"I'm sorry.

598
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,660
Take care of yourself."

599
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,260
What else?

600
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:14,340
If I don't take care of myself,

601
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,915
am I supposed to count on you to do it?

602
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,980
Alright.

603
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,500
Go back.

604
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,780
Be careful while you're at sea.

605
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,540
Guess who I am.

606
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,100
Honey.

607
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,660
Why are you back?

608
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,660
I missed you.

609
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,100
Alright.

610
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,340
Why were you gone so long this time?

611
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,780
I thought you were mad at me.

612
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,740
I dare not be mad at my goddess.

613
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,940
Are you joking?

614
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,580
I just finished training

615
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,940
and didn't even get changed.

616
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,260
Hurry, let me show you something.

617
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,660
I went shopping today

618
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,660
and bought

619
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,460
some items I really like.

620
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,871
You're not allowed to dislike them.

621
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,300
And then,

622
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,900
I don't know

623
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,420
our baby's gender,

624
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,420
so I bought clothes in neutral colors.

625
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,580
Look. Navy blue. Is it cute?

626
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,340
Honey.

627
00:33:14,782 --> 00:33:15,980
Have you thought it through?

628
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,260
Yes.

629
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:20,740
Honey.

630
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,100
I'm not that scared anymore.

631
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,500
Let's bring our baby into this world

632
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,580
and be

633
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,460
the coolest parents.

634
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,660
They say pregnancy makes me silly.

635
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,980
You'd better take care of me then.

636
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,300
You're not allowed to say

637
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,660
I've become dumb, fat,

638
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,820
or ugly.

639
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,980
I've thought it through.

640
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,820
You'll come home once a week.

641
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,060
Accompany me

642
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,020
to birthing classes in the morning.

643
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,260
In the afternoon,

644
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,660
you'll help set up the nursery.

645
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,260
Okay?

646
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,340
Honey.

647
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,460
I...

648
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,500
was selected
for a marine escort mission abroad.

649
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,180
I leave tomorrow.

650
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,620
For how long?

651
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,140
At least two months.

652
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:21,940
I'm sorry.

653
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,100
You'll be home by yourself again.

654
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,380
It's okay.

655
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,300
Mom can take care of me.

656
00:34:29,826 --> 00:34:31,782
The baby and I
will wait for you at home.

657
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,340
Honey.

658
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,620
Enough.

659
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,020
Again? At this hour?

660
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,380
What do you want to say?

661
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,860
Say it to your daughter.

662
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,700
Darling.

663
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,020
I have to leave.

664
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,540
Be good and listen to Mom.

665
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,660
Don't give her a hard time.

666
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,860
I'll hold you and Mom every day

667
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,540
when I come back.

668
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,700
You

669
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,620
leave in one piece,

670
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,380
so come back safe and whole.

671
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:34,980
You hear me?

672
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,500
Lie down.

673
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,540
Lie down.

674
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,020
I'll walk you out.

675
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,780
Don't. If you do,

676
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,700
I won't be able to leave.

677
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,980
You're still playing brigadier at home?

678
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,540
Be good.

679
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,020
Honey.

680
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,420
I'm off to handle my duty.

681
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,620
Approved. Go ahead.

682
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,380
Wang Lang.

683
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,140
Come home soon.

684
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,220
Zhaoyang.

685
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,620
Why are you still up?

686
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,500
Dad.

687
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,020
When Mom gives birth to my sister,

688
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,500
are you not going to be home?

689
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,980
If I'm not home,

690
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,380
will you be scared?

691
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,980
No.

692
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,300
Daddy, you can't be scared either.

693
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,220
I already know how to take care of Mom.

694
00:37:26,315 --> 00:37:28,071
Do you remember the number of that guard

695
00:37:28,137 --> 00:37:29,380
I had you memorize?

696
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,980
If Mom doesn't feel well,

697
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,500
call him right away.

698
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,620
He'll come and get you.

699
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,500
Remember to bring Mom's maternity bag.

700
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,940
It's in her closet.

701
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,780
It contains toiletries

702
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,940
and your sister's items.

703
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:42,540
Also...

704
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,860
I also have to bring enough cash

705
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,580
and documents
like household registration book, ID,

706
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,340
mother-child health records,

707
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,860
birth permit,

708
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,460
and medical records.

709
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,820
I know all the things you tell me.

Wang Zhaoyang.

711
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,660
I'll hand over this family to you.

712
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,420
Take care of your mom and sister.

713
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,300
Can you do that?

714
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,340
Yes!

715
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,380
(Honey, you're awake?)

716
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:04,980

so I left first.)

(I chose the simplest one to use.)

720
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,140
(I wrote notes on the manual.)

721

with it soon.)

(If you want something else,
call the number on the sticky note.)

727
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,940

all the things you bought.)

are right in front.)
