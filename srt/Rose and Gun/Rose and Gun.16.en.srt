(You Are Under Surveillance)

19
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:47,020
(You Are Under Surveillance)

20
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,430
Near the west entrance,

21
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,404
there's a trestle bridge?

22
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:21,670
A trestle bridge?

23
00:03:22,248 --> 00:03:23,510
Is that the trestle bridge?

24
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,070
Should be.

25
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,200
Let's go check it out.

26
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,560
He said he's on the trestle bridge.

27
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,204
All right.

28
00:03:57,515 --> 00:03:58,880
This should be the place, I think.

29
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,426
There aren't any other bridges here.

30
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,430
Hold on.

31
00:04:04,737 --> 00:04:06,170
(We're on the trestle bridge now.)

32
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,450
Let's wait for his reply.

33
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,800
Okay.

34
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,370
It's been some time
since I came to Rainbow Park.

35
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,460
It feels unfamiliar now.

36
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,130
Our economy has grown too fast

37
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,290
for infrastructure

38
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,530
and everything else

39
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,550
to catch up.

40
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,300
Mr. Han, you seem concerned

41
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,670
about the national economy.

42
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:35,960
Of course.

43
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,520
As the saying goes,
"Without a country, there is no home."

44
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,469
A rich nation makes a strong people,

45
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,004
and a strong nation ensures their peace.

46
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,180
You're the same.

47
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,370
As a journalist,

48
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,570
aren't you working

49
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,450
to uphold justice and fairness?

50
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,760
I'm learning from you.

51
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,840
Mr. Han, you flatter me.

52
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,870
I'm just doing my job.

53
00:04:55,915 --> 00:04:57,200
It's not like I had much choice.

54
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,030
You're being

55
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,020
too modest.

56
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,220
Honestly, I've always admired you.

57
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,520
As a woman,

58
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,540
you're courageous

59
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,240
and responsible.

60
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,770
It's rare.

61
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,810
If you keep praising me,

62
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,315
you're going to send me over the moon.

63
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,070
Then go ahead.

64
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,130
Anyway, I'm just speaking the truth.

65
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:15,960
No exaggeration.

66
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:54,440
Hello.

67
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,170
Miss Tang asked me to meet you.

68
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,470
I'm Wu Si.

69
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,990
It's been twenty minutes.

70
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,640
He didn't reply to my email,

71
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,915
nor did he show up either.

72
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,690
Should I follow up with him?

73
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,730
I don't think so.

74
00:06:27,737 --> 00:06:28,810
Let's wait a bit longer.

75
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:31,730
Sure.

76
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,880
Anyway,

77
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,520
it's not often I get time

78
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,680
or chances

79
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:36,780
to just be with you.

80
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,980
You're always busy

81
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,871
and don't have time
for a walk in the park.

82
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,210
Tell me.

83
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,680
What's Tang Xin's relationship

84
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,180
with Han Yuhang?

85
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,570
There's nothing between them.

86
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,937
They met during an interview.

87
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,070
Also,

88
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,790
everything Miss Tang wrote in the email

89
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,400
is true.

90
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,140
If they were hiding something,

91
00:07:06,648 --> 00:07:08,280
they wouldn't have gone to such lengths

92
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,400
to set up this meeting,

93
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:10,680
right?

94
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:19,540
Pass this

95
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,190
to Miss Tang.

96
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,160
Are these artifact fragments

97
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,290
from Dayan Reef?

98
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:32,580
Yes.

99
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,420
Wait.

100
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,120
Tang Xin said

101
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,080
you had more leads to share with her.

102
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,550
Please tell her

103
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,020
I'll contact her

104
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:46,810
through email.

105
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:47,880
Okay.

106
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:49,560
I'll let her know.

107
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:50,940
Please don't worry.

108
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:52,670
This isn't

109
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,720
just Tang Xin's investigation,

110
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,440
it's mine too.

111
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,550
- Because...
- I know who you are.

112
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,100
I agreed to meet you today,

113
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,460
not because
you're Miss Tang's boyfriend.

114
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,010
It's because

115
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,220
you're Wu Tongshu's son.

116
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,370
Although I don't know him,

117
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,770
I heard about his story.

118
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,250
He's admirable.

119
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,140
If possible,

120
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,780
we'll meet again.

121
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,370
Mr. Han,

122
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,120
I don't think he's coming.

123
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,048
Should we go?

124
00:09:50,937 --> 00:09:52,040
You want to leave now?

125
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:53,880
It's been too long.

126
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,390
If he were coming, he'd be here by now.

127
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,080
Send him an email

128
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,040
and tell him we're heading back.

129
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,630
If he replies

130
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,520
on the way,

131
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,730
we'll rush back.

132
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,293
All right.
Guess that's the best we can do.

133
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,648
This guy is really unreliable.

134
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,010
All right.

135
00:10:13,115 --> 00:10:14,560
Where are you going? I'll drive you.

136
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:33,990
We...

137
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:34,920
Mr. Han,

138
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,820
let me introduce you.

139
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,650
Wu Si, my boyfriend.

140
00:10:38,693 --> 00:10:39,937
He's here to pick me up.

141
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:43,410
Hi.

142
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,450
Hi.

143
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,730
Since he's here,

144
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,140
I should take my leave.

145
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:51,330
See you.

146
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:51,810
See you.

147
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:52,700
Bye.

148
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,470
Let's go. I'll tell you in the car.

149
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,160
He asked me to pass this to you.

150
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,760
Fragments?

151
00:11:30,071 --> 00:11:31,782
What about the major lead he mentioned?

152
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:32,990
I brought it up.

153
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,982
He thought it over for a long time,

154
00:11:34,982 --> 00:11:36,770
but still decided he'd rather email you.

155
00:11:37,271 --> 00:11:38,850
Probably because he has some concerns

156
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,182
about you knowing Han Yuhang.

157
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:42,760
Understandable.

158
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,520
From his point of view,

159
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,040
Han Yuhang borrowed boats
to go out to sea with me twice.

160
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,040
We can't be just friends.

161
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,490
Do you think

162
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,671
he suspects Han Yuhang
and me are on this together?

163
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,490
I don't think so.

164
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,250
If he really thought that,

165
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,660
he would've cut you off.

166
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,130
True.

167
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,810
Tell me what happened when you met him.

168
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,710
He's very cautious.

169
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,620
He even investigated me

170
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,680
and got to the meeting spot early

171
00:12:11,182 --> 00:12:13,093
to watch me from a distance
for over ten minutes

172
00:12:13,137 --> 00:12:14,048
before showing himself.

173
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,890
He investigated you?

174
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,850
Yeah.

175
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,960
He knows about my father.

176
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,640
Did he say anything else?

177
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:25,520
No.

178
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:26,970
What about you?

179
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,280
How did Han Yuhang react

180
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,840
when the man didn't show up?

181
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,250
He was disappointed.

182
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,060
Maybe even a little down.

183
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,640
He kept asking me

184
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,782
why the informant suddenly bailed.

185
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,630
What do you think

186
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,370
his real motive was

187
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,515
for setting up this meeting?

188
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,520
I was observing him

189
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,640
and the surroundings closely,

190
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,570
but nothing seemed off.

191
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,100
It didn't feel like he was using me

192
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,580
to lure the informant out.

193
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,400
But I could tell

194
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,520
he had a lot on his mind.

195
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,340
He barely spoke

196
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,720
on the way back.

197
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,440
At least this confirms

198
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,450
your earlier suspicions about

199
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,190
Changzhou Group.

200
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,210
Exactly.

201
00:13:15,715 --> 00:13:17,293
Since the informant is concerned about

202
00:13:17,315 --> 00:13:18,400
my knowing Han Yuhang,

203
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,770
he must have his reason.

204
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,130
All right.

205
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,120
It's finally making progress.

206
00:13:28,137 --> 00:13:30,182
But we can't just sit in the car
analyzing.

207
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,340
Where are we going, my girlfriend?

208
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,850
Home

209
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:34,960
or dinner?

210
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,970
You told Han Yuhang

211
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,280
I'm your boyfriend,

212
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,560
and I came to pick you up.

213
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,400
Fine.

214
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:47,730
Home.

215
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,130
Let's go.

216
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,970
Go home and get some rest.

217
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,800
As for Han Yuhang and the informant,

218
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,250
we'll wait for the news.

219
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,300
Hello, Dad?

220
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,920
Where are you?

221
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,680
Did you meet Wu Si?

222
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,020
How was your date?

223
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,900
I'm downstairs. I'll come up and talk.

224
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,250
Right. You're already downstairs.

225
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,100
Why not just tell me now?

226
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,970
Wu Si's right here.

227
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,210
Well...

228
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,850
Wu Si? Why did you say so earlier?

229
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,640
Bring him home.

230
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,210
No, I didn't plan to.

231
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,880
He just walked me back.

232
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,720
Don't try to deny it.

233
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,200
Put him on the phone.

234
00:14:39,515 --> 00:14:40,337
I'll talk to him.

235
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,300
Can you stir things up?

236
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,560
Wu Si, come upstairs and sit for a bit!

237
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,360
Well,

238
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,130
my dad asks you to drop by
if you have time.

239
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,400
I heard him.

240
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,850
Dad, that's enough.

241
00:14:54,871 --> 00:14:56,182
When you're in a relationship,

242
00:14:56,182 --> 00:14:58,300
you've got to know when to be demure

243
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,880
and when to make a move.

244
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,560
Dad,

245
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,330
if you keep messing around,

246
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,760
you're going to ruin my love life.

247
00:15:03,782 --> 00:15:04,693
I'm hanging up.

248
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,900
Look at her.

249
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,090
She hung up on me.

250
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,520
Why is she making a fuss?

251
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,210
You asked for it.

252
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,990
They're dating,

253
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,700
so why are you interfering so much?

254
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,760
Look at you.

255
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,915
If I didn't, you think
she would've made it this far?

256
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:20,850
If I didn't,

257
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,960
would Wu Si have ever
stepped foot in this house?

258
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:29,760
What?

259
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,210
So,

260
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,200
we're really dating now?

261
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,120
What? You want to back out?

262
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,400
No.

263
00:15:38,448 --> 00:15:39,810
I'm just afraid you'll regret it.

264
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,500
What would I regret?

265
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,870
I never go back on my word.

266
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,660
Let me confirm one more time.

267
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,640
Are you really my girlfriend now?

268
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,780
♪Baby, you kiss me, kiss me, kiss me♪

269
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,780

Miss Tang,

00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,450
what are you doing?

280
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,680
Making advances on you.

281
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,970
♪That never fades away♪

282
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,810
Are you sure you want to do that?

283
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,400
Already did.
Do I have to file a report too?

284
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,280
I think

285
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,910
you should report it.

286
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,280
Dad, why did you come downstairs?

287
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,250
You hung on

288
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,360
before I finished talking,

289
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,170
so I thought I'd just come down
to check.

290
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,110
Didn't I say

291
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,120
I'd come up in a bit?

292
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,690
Captain Tang,

293
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,290
I've brought Tang Xin back.

294
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,730
I'll head back now.

295
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:25,560
All right.

296
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,900
(Navy Unit 91358 Family Quarters)

297
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,280
Xin,

298
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,820
promise me.

299
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,490
Don't ever go to

300
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,048
such dangerous places on your own again.

301
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,240
It's wonderful to have you, Captain Wu.

302
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,360
Call me Si.

303
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,010
Si.

304
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:43,910
From now on,

305
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,110
we'll face all the obstacles together.

306
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,760
Why is Cheng Yuan only saying
one word again?

307
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,840
Because he's a robot.

308
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,600
He only speaks one word at a time.

309
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,780
Zong Qing,

310
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,840
Wang Zhaoyang's kid

311
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,210
is not stupid.

312
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,650
Come and have some fruit.

313
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,093
- Thank you, Mrs. Wang.
- Sure.

314
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,060
Come on.

315
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,210
Sit.

316
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,150
Sit and have some fruit.

317
00:18:11,182 --> 00:18:12,490
Why are you standing there alone?

318
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,120
Sit down.

319
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:14,360
Mrs. Wang, he's spare stock.

320
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,404
Don't worry about him.

321
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,860
How did

322
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,630
your captain's date go?

323
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:48,760
Mom.

324
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:50,770
There you are.

325
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,470
You still remember you have a mother?

326
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,930
I know you're mad at us.

327
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,210
You think we lied to you.

328
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,810
But this has nothing
to do with Wang Chen.

329
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,020
She even told me not to lie to you.

330
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,430
If you're angry,

331
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,620
be angry with me.

332
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,210
Where are you going?

333
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,330
I came back because I want to
resolve our conflicts.

334
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,360
Just hear me out.

335
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,230
If you think

336
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:20,960
I'm still wrong,

337
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,490
you can be mad and walk away.

338
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,515
It won't be too late.

339
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,970
Please sit.

340
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:33,360
Come.

341
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,010
You've seen Wang Chen's test report.

342
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,190
You know the situation.

343
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,280
But the doctor also said

344
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,350
it's not 100 percent certain

345
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,600
she can't conceive.

346
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,950
It just takes time

347
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,230
and requires careful treatment.

348
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,470
What I'm trying to tell you is

349
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:58,770
how her body

350
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,060
ended up in this state.

351
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,940
Wang Chen

352
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,760
is an outstanding soldier.

353
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,910
I'd say she's exceptionally excellent.

354
00:20:09,226 --> 00:20:12,060
That's why she was selected
to join Blue Blade in a very short time.

355
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,250
(Do you know what Blue Blade is?)

356
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,600
(It's a special forces unit.)

357
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
(The best of the best.)

358
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,730
(Most of them are men,)

359
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,260
(only a few are women.)

360
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,037
(- If they want to earn a spot there,)
- Form a line.

361
00:20:23,037 --> 00:20:24,520
(they have to train even harder.)

362
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,360
(If others train five times harder,)

363
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,350
(they train ten times harder.)

364
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,090
(For stealth training,
they stay submerged in icy water)

365
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,604
(- for three to five hours.)
- Adjust your gear. Do it again.

366
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,050
(Why does she do that?)

367
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,850
(- Is she crazy?)
- What's wrong?

368
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,930
(- She doesn't want to drag)
- Do I have to repeat myself?

369
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,982
(- her team down during missions.)
- Move out.

370
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,360
(She can't burden her team
to take care of her.)

371
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,250
Move toward the sea.

372
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,800
(The missions they take on)

373
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,970
(are in extreme conditions.)

374
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,560
(It's far beyond)

375
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,460
(what we civilians can imagine.)

376
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,320
Wang Chen specializes in diving.

377
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,693
Due to intense underwater pressure,

378
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,120
the body loses heat underwater

379
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,560
twenty times faster than on land.

380
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,404
Even male soldiers struggle
to endure it,

381
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,410
let alone female soldiers.

382
00:21:19,537 --> 00:21:21,315
They're the soldiers who protect us.

383
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:23,960
Before we got married,

384
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,340
you didn't approve of me and Wang Chen.

385
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,050
You said soldiers are busy,

386
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,870
they have no free time,

387
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,700
and are always away from home.

388
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,650
But sometimes

389
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,160
we have to think,

390
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,040
if it weren't for these soldiers,

391
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,370
would our lives be so safe and peaceful?

392
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,210
I can't leave her

393
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,900
because she might not have children.

394
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,280
I can't let her suffer physically

395
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,190
and emotionally.

396
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,730
There's a saying I like,

397
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,650
"Peaceful times exist

398
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,160
only because someone else
is bearing the weight."

399
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,260
Wang Chen, your daughter-in-law,

400
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,560
is one of those people.

401
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,180
If Wang Chen and I

402
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,660
can have a child,

403
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,410
that's wonderful.

404
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:17,910
But if we can't,

405
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:19,820
I've made up my mind,

406
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,648
I'd rather not have children.

407
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,690
Both of us

408
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,190
can still live a happy life.

409
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:29,930
Mom,

410
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,350
as Wang Chen's husband

411
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,200
and a military spouse,

412
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,690
I won't leave her.

413
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,340
We won't get divorced.

414
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,060
I only love her in this life.

415
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,010
Mom,

416
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,450
come back home with me,

417
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,170
yes?

418
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,930
(I've received the thing)

419
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,115
(you passed to my boyfriend.)

420
00:23:17,137 --> 00:23:19,540
(Thank you so much
for providing physical evidence.)

421
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,890
(Can you tell me)

422
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,780
(what the new lead is?)

423
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,870
(I know you're wary of my connection)

424
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,870
(with Han Yuhang.)

425
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,440
(I understand.)

426
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,400
(But please believe me.)

427
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,170
(If I really meant to harm you,)

428
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,760
(I wouldn't have told you)

429
00:23:56,782 --> 00:23:58,950
(Han Yuhang was the person
who arranged the meeting.)

430
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,170
Yi Nanwang likes flatbread.

431
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:20,520
Thanks.

432
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:21,650
Flatbread.

433
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:23,800
Take that away.

434
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,060
Peel your own egg.

435
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:31,670
Dig in.

436
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,100
Yi Nanwang,

437
00:24:34,537 --> 00:24:36,493
what kind of filling
did you get in your bun?

438
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:37,690
Cabbage.

439
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,410
You don't like...

440
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,520
This isn't enough for you.

441
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,170
Here.

442
00:24:46,626 --> 00:24:47,680
Thank you, Captain Zong.

443
00:24:47,826 --> 00:24:49,071
Thank you, Sergeant Cheng.

444
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,510
My informant

445
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,800
provided me
with these artifact fragments.

446
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:05,048
Please take a look.

447
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,040
And these, too.

448
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,360
Are they all salvaged

449
00:25:11,382 --> 00:25:12,850
from the Dayan Reef seabed?

450
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,010
That's what he said.

451
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,390
So I brought them over

452
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,471
for you to check out.

453
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,030
I'll examine them.

454
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,030
If these fragments really turn out to be

455
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,260
from underwater artifacts,

456
00:25:26,426 --> 00:25:27,648
that would be wonderful.

457
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,930
It could prompt
the Cultural Relics Bureau

458
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,720
to initiate an underwater
archeological dig

459
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,610
at Dayan Reef.

460
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,930
If they're confirmed

461
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,982
genuine, I'll need to trouble you

462
00:25:37,982 --> 00:25:39,840
to hand them over to
Cultural Relics Bureau.

463
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,448
Sure.

464
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,890
If I'm not mistaken,

465
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,530
I was the one who recruited you
into the company.

466
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:55,600
Yeah.

467
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,810
So it's been a few years now.

468
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,930
Besides

469
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,160
your own tasks,

470
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,930
do you know much about the work

471
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:10,826
my dad and brother do?

472
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,500
Not really.

473
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,170
What about their reputation

474
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,940
over the years?

475
00:26:19,026 --> 00:26:20,080
Do you know much about it?

476
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,240
Very positive.

477
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,650
Many people say the Chairman is kind

478
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,204
and has a charitable spirit.

479
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,120
Yeah.

480
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:30,840
Mr. Han.

481
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,680
I noticed you have a lot
on your mind lately.

482
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,430
Many meetings were also canceled.

483
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,210
Did anything happen?

484
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,090
Report! Dai Wei's ready for descent.

485
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,720
Report! Zhou Keyang's ready for descent.

486
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,270
Report! Cheng Yuan's ready for descent.

487
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,120
Report! Zong Qing's ready for descent.

488
00:27:36,026 --> 00:27:37,493
Now I'll announce your results.

489
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,840
Zhou Keyang, 2.87 seconds.

490
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,590
Da Wei, 3.05 seconds.

491
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:43,690
Zhang Hua, 2.12 seconds.

492
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,600
Li Ming, 4.05 seconds.

493
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,630
Cheng Yuan, 2.02 seconds.

494
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,560
Zong Qing, 2.57 seconds.

495
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,360
Wang Xiaolu...

496
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,130
All right, I've shared a lot with you.

497
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,250
Now here's a quick fact,

498
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:55,860
aside from natural skin oils,

499
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,170
we also have biological lipids

500
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,710
on our face...

501
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,930
Steady breath.

502
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,410
Steady grip.

503
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:48,640
Elbows out.

504
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,250
Faster!

505
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:09,890
Come on.

506
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:15,600
Faster.

507
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,840
Tomorrow's weekend.

508
00:29:18,871 --> 00:29:19,950
Which home are you going to?

509
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,730
Your own place,

510
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,940
or Commander Lan's house?

511
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,520
My place.

512
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,100
(The King of Fighters)

513
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,250
Kick! Kick! Kick!

514
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,250
This character looked tough
when I picked him,

515
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,650
but it sucks.

516
00:29:45,682 --> 00:29:47,202
Ugh! I hate this.

517
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,360
Can't take losing?

518
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,810
I'm out. I'm hungry.

519
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,970
Hang in there.

520
00:29:53,982 --> 00:29:55,040
Let's have one more round.

521
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,590
- One more.
- No.

522
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,220
- Come on.
- I'm starving.

523
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,790
Xin.

524
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,360
Come on in. Welcome.

525
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:05,880
Xin!

526
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,480
I brought someone with me.

527
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,360
Captain?

528
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:24,410
What's going on?

529
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,220
What are you talking about?

530
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,120
Isn't it obvious?

531
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,840
Looks like

532
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,010
it's official now.

533
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,960
They look like an old married couple

534
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,350
carrying groceries together.

535
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,590
That's enough. Hurry up and cook.

536
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:02,893
You're good to go.

537
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,350
Dear,

538
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,050
don't you think those two
are acting strange now?

539
00:31:11,382 --> 00:31:13,537
They're more like an old married couple
than us.

540
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,490
Captain fits the role,

541
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,200
but what's going on with Xin?

542
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,490
Apparently,

543
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,270
she's been completely won over
by Captain Wu.

544
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:24,880
Is it okay?

545
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:26,690
Yes. Keep going.

546
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,280
Okay.

547
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:32,880
Dear.

548
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,600
Let's do a remote interview later.

549
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:42,930
Yi Nanwang.

550
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,600
Yes, Sir!

551
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,170
Come back.

552
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,010
I was mopping the floor,

553
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,570
and you went stomping all over it.

554
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,390
Take this.

555
00:31:49,426 --> 00:31:50,640
I'm sorry, Squad Leader Li.

556
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:51,690
Yi Nanwang,

557
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,760
mind your own business.

558
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,520
Yeah.

559
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:57,080
Come.

560
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,080
I'm just kidding.

561
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,010
I won't let you do the chores.

562
00:32:05,937 --> 00:32:08,382
(Zong Qing:
Here's something fun. Call them.)

563
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,782
Apply some water to it.

564
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,380
Thank you.

565
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:23,840
Miss Tang,

566
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,690
you're usually the one doing interviews.

567
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,840
Now it's your turn.

568
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:30,320
Please answer honestly.

569
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:33,610
When did you fall for Captain Wu?

570
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:38,230
Do you want dinner or not?

571
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:38,780
Stop it.

572
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,260
Captain Wu,

573
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,810
when did you fall

574
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:45,930
for Miss Tang?

575
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,190
Go away. Stop messing around.

576
00:32:53,426 --> 00:32:54,204
A long time ago.

577
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,000
Gosh. Only four words.

578
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,120
That's the best he could do.

579
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,093
Come on. Carry on.

580
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,520
Captain Wu,

581
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,980
next question.

582
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,360
What spell did you cast on Tang Xin?

583
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,010
Don't you know she always claims

584
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,520
she'd never marry a soldier?

585
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,280
I don't think she hated it.

586
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:25,600
She just...

587
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,690
Resisted fate.

588
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,520
Say that again if you dare.

589
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,970
I told you.

590
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,570
Live interviews come with risks.

591
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:34,880
Now,

592
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,890
the remote interview begins.

593
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,250
Salute.

594
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,010
- Captain!
- Captain!

595
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,320
At ease.

596
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:48,650
Hello.

597
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:51,040
Introduce her to us.

598
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,360
Is that necessary?

599
00:33:53,404 --> 00:33:54,410
You all know each other.

600
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,790
Yeah,

601
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,893
but we've never seen you two
cooking together.

602
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,780
Look, they're making dumplings.

603
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,280
That's something.

604
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:04,910
Captain,

605
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,330
what's going on now?

606
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:07,120
Tell us.

607
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,240
Come on. Tell us.

608
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,770
- Tell us!
- Tell us!

609
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,370
All right, I'll introduce her.

610
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:22,930
They're holding hands.

611
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,370
This is

612
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:27,010
my girlfriend, Tang Xin.

613
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:27,850
Clap.

614
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:31,170
Hello, everyone.

615
00:34:31,204 --> 00:34:32,830
Thank you for taking care
of Captain Wu.

616
00:34:34,671 --> 00:34:36,160
I'm the one taking care of them.

617
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,150
Attention!

618
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,782
- Nice to meet you, sister-in-law!
- Nice to meet you, sister-in-law!

619
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,230
Mom, Zijian, I'm back.

620
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,010
Hello? Where are you now?

621
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,093
Have you picked up Mom?

622
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,270
Yeah. We're downstairs now.

623
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,210
The training ended late.

624
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,620
I was going to pick you up,

625
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,871
but I just came straight home.

626
00:35:11,937 --> 00:35:13,120
Should I come down to get you?

627
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,140
No, no need.

628
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,550
We're almost at the door.

629
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,780
All right, then.

630
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,080
Chen, Mom's back.

631
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:34,800
Mom.

632
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,080
Mom.

633
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,990
You must be tired from the journey.

634
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:40,160
Are you okay?

635
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,410
I'm fine.

636
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,110
Come and sit.

637
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:47,930
Mom, it's all my fault.

638
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:49,850
I made you upset.

639
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,290
No, no.

640
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,320
Zijian told me everything.

641
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,040
If he hadn't,

642
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,080
I never would've known

643
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,420
what you went through.

644
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,700
I was wrong to blame you both.

645
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,210
I thought

646
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:08,190
you two were fooling me.

647
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,640
We weren't, Mom.

648
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:13,710
Honestly, I never imagined

649
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,200
you'd be away all the time,

650
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,426
working so hard and suffering.

651
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,370
No, Mom.

652
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,120
It's common.

653
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:22,300
Common?

654
00:36:22,337 --> 00:36:23,890
If so, why do
the other female soldiers

655
00:36:23,893 --> 00:36:24,940
seem to be doing just fine?

656
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,310
You're too proud.

657
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,200
I'm not saying anything

658
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,120
about your work,

659
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:31,850
but from now on,

660
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,240
you must take care of your health.

661
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:36,430
What's that saying again?

662
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,730
"Health is our greatest wealth."

663
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,420
Without good health,

664
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,410
how can you do anything well?

665
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:43,300
Right?

666
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,690
Mom, you're absolutely right.

667
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,210
We'll make sure

668
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:47,693
to take better care of ourselves.

669
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:48,800
Right.

670
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:49,890
Don't worry, Mom.

671
00:36:50,093 --> 00:36:51,330
You haven't eaten yet, right?

672
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,648
Let me cook something for you.

673
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,400
No need.

674
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:54,620
I came here this time

675
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,410
to look after you two.

676
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,010
Get some rest. I'll handle it.

677
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:00,590
No, Mom. Let me.

678
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,950
My hands are already wet.

679
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,720
I'll do it.

680
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,680
All right. Stop fighting.

681
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,240
I'll cook.

682
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,370
The kitchen is off-limits.

683
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,520
You're not allowed in.

684
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,730
You can go sit on the couch and chat.

685
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,330
Shouldn't I go help Mom?

686
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,080
She said no.

687
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,090
Just sit

688
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:20,740
and talk to me.

689
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,990
Mom isn't mad anymore?

690
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,400
What did you say to her?

691
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,320
Nothing much.

692
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:28,770
She had a long face
the whole train ride.

693
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,210
Turns out she was just keeping me
in suspense.

694
00:37:32,271 --> 00:37:33,715
I think I should go help her out.

695
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,460
In earlier videos,

696
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,550
I shared some products

697
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,960
that were duds.

698
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,230
Today, I picked a fan's message

699
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:55,810
and reviewed this one.

700
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:01,280
Meiduo's Niacin Whitening Essence.

701
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:02,160
As usual,

702
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,970
here's the verdict.

703
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,720
Just one line.

704
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,048
(Meiduo's terrible. I'm allergic to it.)
Don't buy. Run!

705
00:38:17,582 --> 00:38:18,826
(Han Yuhang: If you have time,)

706
00:38:18,826 --> 00:38:19,520
(can we meet?)

707
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,471
(I'd like to talk to you about
the underwater artifact investigation.)

708
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,930
Here's your coffee with love.

709
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:25,520
You must be tired.

710
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,040
Why don't you take a break?

711
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,248
I can take over a bit.

712
00:38:29,093 --> 00:38:30,420
I really do need you to cover me.

713
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,410
Mr. Han asked to meet.

714
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,730
Go ahead. I've got this.

715
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,600
About last time,

716
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:40,680
I'm sorry.

717
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,450
I wanted to help you,

718
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,804
but in the end,
we didn't get to meet that person.

719
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,240
Do you have any other leads?

720
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,210
If you do,

721
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,120
maybe we can

722
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,010
start digging from somewhere else.

723
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,950
Honestly, I have one.

724
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:58,300
I've got nothing else.

725
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,560
But Mr. Han,

726
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:05,293
you didn't answer my question last time.

727
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,600
I need to know

728
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:08,940
how you got

729
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,080
the email address.

730
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,520
I'm truly sorry.

731
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,410
I can't disclose

732
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,620
that source.

733
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,230
But as I said,

734
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:20,500
please believe me.

735
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,820
I genuinely want to help you.

736
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,310
I mean no harm.

737
00:39:25,693 --> 00:39:26,490
All right, then.

738
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:28,710
Since you have your source,

739
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,910
maybe you've gotten more information
than I have.

740
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,450
Can you share it with me?

741
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:34,930
Truth be told,

742
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,790
the email address

743
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:38,670
is all I have.

744
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,640
But I promise you,

745
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,010
if

746
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,540
I ever get

747
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,950
anything more,

748
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,850
I'll share it with you

749
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:47,715
right away.

750
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:50,620
As for why that person
didn't show up that day,

751
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,280
I honestly

752
00:39:52,471 --> 00:39:54,293
haven't figured that out myself.

753
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,150
Did you try contacting him afterward?

754
00:39:58,850 --> 00:39:59,720
I did.

755
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,204
But he never replied.

756
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,750
Tang Xin has so many hobbies.

757
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,470
She takes after me in that.

758
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:16,150
I love going to museums.

759
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,970
What about Tang Xin?

760
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,370
Tang Xin? Her favorite place

761
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:23,010
is the Navy Museum.

762
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:28,060
All right.

763
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,330
I'll take her this weekend.

764
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:31,370
That's great.

765
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:33,950
Come home for dinner after that.

766
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:36,560
Mrs. Tang and I will cook for you.

767
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,450
Sure, Captain Tang. Got it.

768
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:40,080
What is this?

769
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,290
Captain Wu sent you this.

770
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,520
Wu Si sent this?

771
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:47,930
What's it?

772
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,180
Um...

773
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:09,620
Judging by the style,

774
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,850
he picked this out himself for sure.

775
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:14,320
Wait.

776
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,090
Why would he give me this?

777
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:17,604
Are you silly?

778
00:41:17,604 --> 00:41:19,069
Of course, he wants you to wear it,

779
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:21,130
take a picture, and post it
on your Moments to show off.

780
00:41:21,137 --> 00:41:21,870
Go try it on.

781
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:24,080
Me? In this?

782
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,680
It's so embarrassing.

783
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,630
Can you bear to disappoint Captain Wu?

784
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,770
What's wrong?

785
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,700
(Wu Si: Her name is Tang Xin.)

786
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,540
(Wu Si: Her name is Tang Xin.)

787
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:13,560
Yi Nanwang.

788
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,610
Yes, Sir.

789
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:15,960
Get everyone over here right now.

790
00:42:16,004 --> 00:42:16,937

00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:18,570
Hurry up.

792
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:19,430
