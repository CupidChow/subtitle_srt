=Episode 21=

18
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,600
Mr. Han.

19
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,210
I know you came to Roman because of me.

20
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,410
What exactly are you after?

21
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,720
I know you're investigating

22
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,440
the illegal salvaging
of underwater relics.

23
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,290
I want to help you.

24
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,130
That's why I followed you here.

25
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,480
Can you share with me

26
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,920
what clues you've found so far?

27
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,720
Tang Xin, I know you don't trust me.

28
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,480
But none of us knows

29
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,810
what the future holds for us.

30
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,970
Are you still hiding something from me?

31
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,370
I want you to come clean.

32
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,160
Why did you follow me here?

33
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,690
What is your real motive?

34
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,720
I know you suspect my family

35
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,530
of salvaging relics illegally.

36
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,090
To be honest, so do I.

37
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,880
When did you start suspecting them?

38
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,200
Ever since that email account showed up.

39
00:02:58,293 --> 00:03:00,160
I once arranged
to meet the informant,

40
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,370
but we never met in person.

41
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,320
Everything after that,

42
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,880
you already know.

43
00:03:06,626 --> 00:03:08,130
I want to get to the bottom of this,

44
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,530
but I don't have any leads of my own.

45
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,320
So I had no choice but to follow you.

46
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,690
What if...

47
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,970
What if you do find out

48
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,810
that your family is indeed

49
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,320
illegally salvaging underwater relics?

50
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,880
I'll do everything I can

51
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,600
to make them stop.

52
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,460
(Chinese People's Liberation Army)

53
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:12,760
Hello.

54
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,290
The number you dialed is powered off.

55
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,280
Sorry, the number you dialed
is powered off.

56
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,250
Any luck? Have you reached Tang Xin?

57
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,280
Nope. She still isn't answering.

58
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,730
I called the police.

59
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,200
What did they say?

60
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,570
Don't get me started.

61
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,320
The police here
are nothing like back home.

62
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,400
They asked a few questions,

63
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,050
jotted things down,
and then sent me off.

64
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,250
Mr. Tang can't reach Xin.

65
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,710
So he's calling me instead.

66
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,890
Don't tell her family yet.

67
00:05:06,204 --> 00:05:07,890
There's nothing they can do to help her.

68
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,930
Keep pushing the police, okay?

69
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,520
Keep searching.

70
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,690
Got it. I will.

71
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,280
Make sure

72
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,760
you're not in any danger.

73
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,930
Don't go missing too.

74
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:23,490
Dad.

75
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:24,930
Have you found your brother?

76
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,400
He hasn't been back to the hotel.

77
00:05:26,515 --> 00:05:28,382
Secretary Ding doesn't know
where he went.

78
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,440
Should I try calling home?

79
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,570
I already did.

80
00:05:32,226 --> 00:05:34,520
No one at home
or the office has seen him.

81
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,250
Secretary Ding is still in Roman.

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,840
Yuhang probably hasn't returned yet.

83
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,050
He's a grown man.

84
00:05:43,448 --> 00:05:45,250
How could he just vanish like that?

85
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,490
Dad, don't worry.

86
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,250
I'll assign more people

87
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,170
to go look for him.

88
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,570
Can we talk?

89
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,130
We can pay you.

90
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,250
You name the price.

91
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,570
You don't want money?

92
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,840
Hey, bro!

93
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,960
It's useless.

94
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,490
Before you woke up,

95
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,320
I tried everything.

96
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,050
He just wouldn't talk.

97
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,140
We have no idea

98
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,380
where they're taking us.

99
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,220
Or whether we'll even get out.

100
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,460
If it weren't for saving me...

101
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,580
You wouldn't be going through this.

102
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,660
I chose to save you.

103
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,220
Just like
when the fishing boat caught fire,

104
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,580
you turned back to save me.

105
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,260
I asked you for help,

106
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,100
and then we got into trouble.

107
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,820
It's different this time.

108
00:07:35,937 --> 00:07:37,700
You know I'm investigating your family.

109
00:07:40,537 --> 00:07:41,982
You could've stayed out of it.

110
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,700
Whether my family

111
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,580
is involved or not,

112
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,020
I would never leave you behind.

113
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,820
Hey, everyone.

114
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,020
Your class health rep, King Lan,

115
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,260
is back again.

116
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,140
I have good news for all of you.

117
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,260
I'm having a baby!

118
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,580
So...

119
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,460
This episode's topic

120
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,300
is all about moms-to-be.

121
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,300
First off,

122
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,820
I strongly advise

123
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,100
everyone to avoid

124
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,820
any products that are too harsh
during pregnancy.

125
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,820
For example, anything too acidic.

126
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,420
This one,

127
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,700
this one,

128
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,340
this one,

129
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,100
this one,

130
00:08:55,204 --> 00:08:56,420
and this one,

131
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,820
and lastly this big bottle.

132
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,100
Remember this well.

133
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,820
All moms should always
read the ingredient list

134
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,700
very carefully
before buying skincare products.

135
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,580
Never buy anything with retinol,

136
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,860
vitamin A,

137
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,980
benzophenones, 2-fluorotoluene,

138
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,580
ethanol,

139
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,700
or any products with salicylic acid.

140
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,580
Lastly, here's my advice as King Lan.

141
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,100
During pregnancy,

142
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,820
you should really wear as little makeup
as possible or none at all.

143
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,540
Because that's the best way

144
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,100
to protect your baby's health
and your own.

145
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,420
I really believe
that once you're expecting,

146
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,060
every mom is the most
beautiful woman in the world.

147
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,580
Big thanks to
the last thirty-seven of you

148
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,700
who've stuck with me to the very end.

149
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,340
King Lan

150
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,460
is about to set off on a new journey.

151
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,460
You all need to keep going strong

152
00:09:52,115 --> 00:09:53,100
in your own fields.

153
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,620
Report.

154
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,580
Come in.

155
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,980
Brigadier, your orders?

156
00:10:44,004 --> 00:10:46,420
The fleet received a notice from
International Maritime Bureau.

157
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,580
A foreign cargo ship
was hijacked by pirates.

158
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,100
The IMB has requested

159
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,340
escort vessels along the route
to assist in the rescue.

160
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,220
In the spirit of humanitarian aid,

161
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,100
the fleet commander
reported to higher-ups

162
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,420
and decided to offer support.

163
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,460
They assigned this rescue mission to us.

164
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,860
These are the coordinates
of the cargo ship.

165
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,100
I'll assemble the team.

166
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,620
Hold on.

167
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,540
The fleet commander
sent a drone ahead for reconnaissance.

168
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,860
The ship stopped moving.

169
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,100
That means the pirates
are already onboard.

170
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,460
They're likely holding hostages.

171
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,460
To keep the hostages safe,

172
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,860
you must board the ship covertly.

173
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,820
Act accordingly.

174
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,460
Yes, Sir.

175
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,740
Based on intel analysis,

176
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,240
the crew is likely
locked in the bridge by the pirates.

177
00:11:30,248 --> 00:11:31,980
We don't know
how many of them there are.

178
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,940
Make sure the hostages stay safe.

179
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,740
What's going on?

180
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,980
Where are you going?

181
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,420
Hey! Don't leave us here.

182
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,220
There are supposed
to be pirates onboard.

183
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,220
I'm leaving. Good luck, guys.

184
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,460
Untie the rope.

185
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,580
I'll say it again. Do not fire first.

186
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,826
Board the ship in three groups
and approach discreetly.

187
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,220
Once each area is secured,

188
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,871
surround the area
and flush the pirates out.

189
00:13:36,871 --> 00:13:37,782
Rescue the hostages.

190
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,700
Cheng Yuan, pick your sniping position.

191
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,026
Report back with recon details.

192
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,160
- Got a smoke?
- Thanks, bro.

193
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,730
Let's check over there.

194
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:26,980
Move.

195
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,860
Where are we going?

196
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,740
Maybe we should just hide here.

197
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,420
This spot's no good.

198
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,540
The pirates will search every room.

199
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,980
So before they get to us,

200
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,180
we need to find the ship's safe room.

201
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,540
That's the only safe place.

202
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:09,980
What now?

203
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,220
Look for another way out.

204
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,860
What's up?

205
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,540
Mr. Han?

206
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,860
Mr. Han?

207
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,940
I'll go first. Stay close behind me.

208
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,980
Team A, be advised.

209
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,580
One pirate is heading toward you
around the next corner.

210
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,620
Five seconds out.

211
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,020
Mr. Han.

212
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:14,860
Mr. Han.

213
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,140
Look.

214
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,780
Area A cleared.
Team B, report your status.

215
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,720
Area B cleared.
Moving toward the target zone.

216
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,100
Team C, clear your zone
and draw out the pirates.

217
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,020
Copy that.

218
00:19:53,315 --> 00:19:54,737
Team C has engaged the enemy.

219
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,260
Area C cleared.

220
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,140
Copy that.

221
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,260
Move out.

222
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,740
You two stay here.

223
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:05,980
Go.

224
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,260
Sniper, stay alert.
Watch for pirates returning.

225
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,715
Only shoot if absolutely necessary.

226
00:20:13,715 --> 00:20:14,380
Sniper, copy.

227
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,340
Team A, sniper reporting.

228
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,740
Multiple pirates moving toward you
from the target zone.

229
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,010
Contact in eight seconds.

230
00:20:25,648 --> 00:20:28,182
Team A has engaged.
All units switch to tactical alert.

231
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,260
I need to get out.

232
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,004
I have to go out.

233
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:39,860
No, no, no.

234
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,340
There's gunfire outside.

235
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,140
We have to find somewhere to hide, fast.

236
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,620
There, over there.

237
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,540
Smoke grenade.

238
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,620
Copy that.

239
00:21:47,115 --> 00:21:48,740
All units, prepare to advance.

240
00:21:49,004 --> 00:21:49,982
Begin push forward.

241
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,340
Yi Nanwang,
flank in with me from the side door.

242
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,620
Copy.

243
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,790
Get down. Nobody move.

244
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,900
Captain, area secured.

245
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,260
This is the Chinese Navy.

246
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,620
Don't worry.

247
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,060
Hostages secured.
All teams, begin final sweep.

248
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,580
Captain.

249
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,980
New development.

250
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,900
One pirate spotted on Deck 2.

251
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,660
Armed with a pistol and a grenade.

252
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,980
He's holding two hostages.

253
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,380
Miss Tang and Mr. Han.

254
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,180
Copy that.

255
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,300
Please stay here.

256
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,620
Captain.

257
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,140
I need your help.

258
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,300
We'll catch them. Everybody, okay?

259
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,820
Wang Chen, join me at the deck.

260
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,137
Everyone else, hold position.

261
00:23:38,137 --> 00:23:39,100
Keep the hostages safe.

262
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,580
This is Chinese Navy. Put down your gun!

263
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,620
Put your guns down!

264
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,380
Or they are dead!

265
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,380
Captain.

266
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,820
I can't get a clear shot.

267
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:55,560
Miss Tang is in the way.
Try to get her to move.

268
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,340
I said guns down!

269
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,820
Okay, okay, fine.

270
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,893
Relax.

271
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,140
Okay, fine.

272
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,580
I will put down my gun.

273
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,980
I'll let you off the boat.

274
00:24:20,182 --> 00:24:21,380
Sway cycle is eight seconds.

275
00:24:21,604 --> 00:24:22,850
Tilt angle thirty-two degrees.

276
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,580
Fire when it tilts left at 1.5 seconds.

277
00:24:24,893 --> 00:24:26,380
Hostage is clear of blast radius.

278
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,500
Ready to fire.

279
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:28,860
Do it.

280
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,380
Dr. Lin, how did the surgery go?

281
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,860
The surgery was a success.

282
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,399
But the anesthesia hasn't worn off yet.

283
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,650
She still needs to rest a while.

284
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,060
How bad was the injury?

285
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,300
A torn Achilles tendon
is no small matter.

286
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,820
Even though surgery can repair it,

287
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,180
post-op complications

288
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,980
like tendon contracture
are still possible.

289
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,820
How well she recovers

290
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,100
is still uncertain.

291
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,100
Dr. Lin, she's a special ops soldier.

292
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,860
Don't worry.

293
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:28,860
I'll do my best.

294
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,380
Let's head back.

295
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,580
You all heard it.

296
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,340
The surgery went well.

297
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,980
Wang Chen needs to rest.

298
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,060
Same goes for you all.

299
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,380
(Let me think what else I can ask you.)

300
00:26:25,804 --> 00:26:28,060
(From north to south,
what are China's territorial seas?)

301
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:28,620
(Go.)

302
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,060
(Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea,
East China Sea, South China Sea.)

303
00:26:31,337 --> 00:26:32,100
(Captain Chen.)

304
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,580
(Name five reefs
from the Nansha Islands.)

305
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,100
(Mischief Reef, Subi Reef,)

306
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,860
(Fiery Cross Reef, Huayang Reef,)

307
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,420
(Johnson South Reef, Burgos Reefs,
Hughes Reef.)

308
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,420
(I gave you seven.)

309
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,420
(How many sit-ups did you do yesterday?)

310
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,500
(Three hundred.)

311
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,620
(Three hundred?)

312
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,820
(Liar.)

313
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,980
Is Chen back?

314
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,100
No, Mom.

315
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,140
I'm just watching
some of Chen's old videos.

316
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,420
I thought I heard her voice.

317
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,620
I even thought,

318
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,500
if she came home,
how could you not tell me?

319
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,620
If so, I would definitely tell you.

320
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,100
Have you spoken to her on the phone?

321
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,620
She's out in the ocean.

322
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,820
There's no signal out there.

323
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,580
It's been so long.

324
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,620
She can't even make one phone call?

325
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,820
It's not that she can never call.

326
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,340
Sometimes she calls me
with a satellite phone.

327
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,500
That's good.

328
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,580
Zijian, if she calls again,

329
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,100
tell her this for me.

330
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,860
Tell her to take care of herself.

331
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,100
She must not overwork herself.

332
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,300
Once her mission is done,

333
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,500
she should come home early.

334
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,380
Don't worry, Mom.

335
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,660
I'll pass your words on.

336
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,820
Captain Wu.

337
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,340
Wait until she wakes up
and sees you before you go.

338
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,140
Qiu Xiao.

339
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,500
I'll need to trouble you for a while.

340
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,180
Please help look after her.

341
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,582
She hasn't spent much time on ships.

342
00:28:17,693 --> 00:28:19,293
Her body won't handle it well.

343
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,420
I can take care of her.

344
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,860
But she wants to see you.

345
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,860
I still need to check on Wang Chen.

346
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:29,740
I'll go now.

347
00:28:40,004 --> 00:28:41,140
Fetal heartbeat is normal.

348
00:28:41,337 --> 00:28:42,820
But there's a bit too much movement.

349
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,420
There's a chance
of early placental abruption.

350
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,100
Once you're back home,

351
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,820
keep an eye on fetal movement.

352
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,300
If you notice abdominal pain,

353
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,980
bleeding, or fluid leakage,

354
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,360
come to the hospital.

355
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,380
Thank you, Dr. Meng.

356
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,380
You haven't looked well lately.

357
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,100
Have you been worrying

358
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,820
about the amniocentesis results?

359
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,500
A pregnant woman's emotions

360
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,900
affect the baby too.

361
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,060
This is your first child,

362
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,060
and your husband isn't with you.

363
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,500
We recommend
that you try not to be alone.

364
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,820
Stay positive and keep yourself happy.

365
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,620
I'll keep that in mind.

366
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,740
Mrs. Wang.

367
00:29:28,848 --> 00:29:31,426
Your due date is almost here.
You should stop coming to work.

368
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,100
There are still a few days left.

369
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,740
Wang Zhaoyang likes it here.

370
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,860
It's nice to walk around every day.

371
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,340
Come on, have a seat.

372
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:40,660
Come.

373
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,300
Take it slow.

374
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:42,980
Alright.

375
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,180
Yangyang,

376
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,340
you're pregnant too.

377
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,380
You shouldn't be
running around like this.

378
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,860
You don't have to visit me every day.

379
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,420
Zong Qing is never home.

380
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,740
I'm just a free soul.

381
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,500
I like stopping by for a chat.

382
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,820
Just remember two things.

383
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,580
First, you must keep your spirits up.

384
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,100
Second, don't overwork yourself.

385
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:05,980
Got it?

386
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,620
Got it.

387
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,740
Yangyang,

388
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,180
what's his name?

389
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,580
Him?

390
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,340
He's called Zong Xi.

391
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,900
That's a beautiful name.

392
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,340
Much better than the one our guy picked.

393
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,980
What name did the brigadier choose?

394
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,180
Jinqing. Wang Jinqing.

395
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,860
Does it have a special meaning?

396
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,100
Of course it does.

397
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,620
Jinqing is the name of an island.

398
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,740
It's a reef in the Xisha Islands
of the South China Sea.

399
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,100
The reef has a long tail,
shaped like a mermaid.

400
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,980
My dad said a Navy daughter

401
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,620
is a daughter of the sea too.

402
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,500
So she's a little mermaid.

403
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,060
Let me tell you,

404
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,620
Navy men are the typical guys.

405
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,100
They think in straight lines.

406
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,580
You just can't argue with them.

407
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,900
Sounds like he gives you
a lot of geography lessons at home.

408
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,740
Tell me about it. He drives me crazy.

409
00:30:52,826 --> 00:30:54,380
He's gone for ten days or half a month.

410
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,500
And when he comes back,

411
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,100
all he does is
lecture the kid on random stuff.

412
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,380
It's the weirdest thing.

413
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,860
But Wang Zhaoyang
just loves listening to him.

414
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,180
Zhaoyang,

415
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,140
your dad is always away.
Are you mad at him?

416
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,580
A little bit.

417
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,100
But I know he doesn't do it on purpose.

418
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,980
Yangyang, are you worried that

419
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,340
when Xi grows up
and doesn't see Captain Zong much,

420
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,860
he'll end up resenting him too?

421
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,340
A little.

422
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,100
When Xi grows up, I'll tell him.

423
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,820
Captain Zong is just like my dad.

424
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,048
They don't mean to.

425
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,420
My son is so understanding.

426
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,380
You really are your father's son.

427
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:37,860
Hello?

428
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,420
What?

429
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,580
Wang Chen's mother-in-law fell down.

430
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,340
Careful.

431
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,620
Slow down, take it easy.

432
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,500
Here.

433
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,500
Here.

434
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,620
Sit, please.

435
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,100
How's Mrs. Bai doing?

436
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,980
The doctor said it's nothing serious.

437
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,100
Once the wound is treated,
she can go home.

438
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,020
An elderly person alone at home

439
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,140
is just not safe.

440
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,420
Bai and Wang Chen aren't home.

441
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,140
Right, I need to pay the hospital bill.

442
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,580
You sit and rest. I'll handle it.

443
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,380
Yangyang, don't run. You're pregnant.

444
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,500
That girl, I swear...

445
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,580
Mr. Han.

446
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,100
It's best not to stand too close
to the railing at sea.

447
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:30,900
It's not safe.

448
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,580
You should go rest in the cabin.

449
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,340
The most dangerous part is already over.

450
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,820
Thank you.

451
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,980
That's the second time you've saved me.

452
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,580
It's our duty.

453
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,860
Captain Wu, do you know

454
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,500
why I was on that ship?

455
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,660
I don't know the full story,

456
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,100
but thank you
for looking after Tang Xin.

457
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,620
You don't know the full story?

458
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,620
You're her boyfriend.

459
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,100
You didn't know
she was heading to Roman?

460
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,380
I didn't.

461
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,900
If I had known,

462
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,860
I would never have let her go alone.

463
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,620
Besides, when it comes to work,

464
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,300
she doesn't need my permission.

465
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,060
I just want her to be safe.

466
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,300
Captain Wu.

467
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,660
She's an investigative journalist.

468
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,340
What she looks into is shady by nature.

469
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,100
There's no way it isn't dangerous.

470
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,660
Take this time for example.

471
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,340
If we hadn't run into your team

472
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,820
on your way back from escort duty,

473
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,340
I don't even want to imagine
the consequences.

474
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,060
Sorry.

475
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,980
I wasn't blaming you.

476
00:33:50,782 --> 00:33:52,380
I'm worried about Tang Xin's safety.

477
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,660
I just hope that in the future,

478
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,804
you can help keep her safer.

479
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,960
Thanks for the reminder.

480
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,420
Yangyang.

481
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,900
The doctor said Mrs. Bai is fine now.

482
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,580
Tonight,

483
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,182
Zhaoyang and I will check on her again.

484
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:21,660
You've been running around all day.

485
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,848
Go home and get some rest.

486
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,180
No way.

487
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,140
Zhaoyang and I have to
keep an eye on you.

488
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,660
You're just like Mrs. Bai now.

489
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,780
A priority protection target.

490
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,700
How did I become that?

491
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,580
Give me a break.

492
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,260
Driver, please go a little slower.

493
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,380
My mom's a high-risk pregnancy.

494
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,580
Wang Zhaoyang,
you're just like your dad.

495
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,140
You always call me high-risk.

496
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,940
How exactly am I high-risk?

497
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,100
Don't worry, kiddo.

498
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,620
I drive safe.

499
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,620
Exactly.

500
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,620
Mom, what's wrong?

501
00:34:59,140 --> 00:34:59,700
Mom?

502
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,140
- Mrs. Wang!
- I'm going into labor!

503
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,460
- Quick, back to the hospital!
- Mom!

504
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,380
Okay!

505
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:04,940
Mrs. Wang!

506
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:15,920
Begin anesthesia induction.

507
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,580
Start IV injection.

508
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,980
Hi, excuse me.

509
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,460
May I ask you something?

510
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,620
Do you know Captain Wu Si?

511
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,660
Captain Wu?

512
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,380
Yes, do you know where he is?

513
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,960
He's on deck, on duty.

514
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,620
Got it, thanks.

515
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,540
Hello?

516
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,580
Hello?

517
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,380
Brigadier Wang.

518
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,860
Your wife has delivered.

519
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,660
Both are safe.

520
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,300
The base is looking after them.

521
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:34,660
Don't worry.

522
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,020
Got it, Commissar. Thank you.

523
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,180
Can you help me sit up?

524
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,060
I want to look at my legs.

525
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,100
No can do.

526
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,220
I really can't help you with that.

527
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,540
If I help you,

528
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,620
the Brigadier will skin me alive.

529
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,100
Don't worry.

530
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,700
The doctors said you'll recover.

531
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,060
Captain Chen.

532
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,940
Actually, I came here

533
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,940
to ask you for a favor.

534
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,060
What is it?

535
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,180
Where I'm from, there's a tradition.

536
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,020
When a baby is born,
they have to pick a godmother.

537
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:24,860
So I was wondering...

538
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,140
Her right Achilles tendon is torn,

539
00:39:42,204 --> 00:39:43,900
and her calf has a comminuted fracture.

540
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,140
It's worse than we initially thought.

541
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,180
Doctor Lin reported to the Brigadier.

542
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,140
They decided not to tell her

543
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,380
the full extent just yet.

544
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,260
Captain Chen is very strong-willed.

545
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,060
Knowing everything
might slow her recovery.

546
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,580
No matter what,

547
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,700
she's definitely
going to recover, right?

548
00:40:06,893 --> 00:40:08,580
She'll be back on duty for sure, right?

549
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,100
Is there anything else we can do?

550
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,900
We've done everything we possibly could.

551
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,060
But medicine can't solve every problem.

552
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,420
As for how this ends,

553
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,180
none of us can say yet.

554
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,420
I can't just comfort you
with empty words

555
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,700
and promise a miracle.

556
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,740
Dr. Qiu...

557
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,940
From a medical perspective,

558
00:40:43,648 --> 00:40:46,204
how much recovery
can Captain Chen expect?

559
00:40:53,426 --> 00:40:55,580
After a period
of structured rehab training,

560
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,580
she'll be able to walk

561
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,660
with the help of assistive devices.

562
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,220
Time to eat.

563
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,420
I...

564
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,580
I'll head out now.

565
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,100
I put the fruit here
where you can reach it.

566
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,740
I'll head out then, Captain Chen.

567
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:45,900
Zong Qing.

568
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:49,500
I know you're trying to comfort me.

569
00:41:51,204 --> 00:41:52,260
Captain Chen.

570
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,940
Yangyang, slow down.

571
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,848
The Political Commissar
is coming to pick us up.

572
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,940
