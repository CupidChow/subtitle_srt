Captain.

19
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,520
Am I the worst soldier you've trained?

20
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,360
I've never trained bad soldiers.

21
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,490
You aren't bad.

22
00:01:52,915 --> 00:01:54,960
You are just not being placed
in the right position.

23
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,410
Do you know

24
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,915
what I saw in you when I picked you?

25
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,410
You are bold,

26
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,690
tough,

27
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,290
and have adaptability and endurance

that surpass your age.

29
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,530
These traits are rare
among my new recruits.

30
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,130
For all these years,

31
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,970
I've only seen it in Cheng Yuan.

32
00:02:13,493 --> 00:02:15,880
Sergeant Cheng is a marksman.
I can't be compared to him.

33
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,040
He didn't start out as one.

34
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,370
He has gone all the way

35
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:20,720
to the international level

36
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,250
one shot and one step at a time.

(People's Liberation Army, Navy)

38
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,290
Actually,
I've heard about Sergeant Cheng

39
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,880
before joining Blue Blade.

40
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,880
He is the only ace sniper in our brigade

41
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,850
who has won the Tai'e Sword
in many years.

42
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,160
Do you want to know

43
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,370
what the ace sniper

44
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,640
says about you?

45
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,690
He said
you have a high sense of awareness

46
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,640
and reaction.

47
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,880
You've exceeded everyone

48
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,871
in terms of
your ability to capture information.

49
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,600
However,

50
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,810
you are not steady enough.

51
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,250
Captain!

52
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,530
I understand now.

53
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,026
I want to stay on the Blue Blade

54
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,093
and become an ace sniper
just like Sergeant Cheng!

55
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,410
It's a good thing to be determined

56
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,090
but a soldier speaks with his actions.

57
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,440
If you want to join Blue Blade,

58
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,010
you need to learn many things

59
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,160
to make up for your weaknesses

60
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,250
and show your strengths.

61
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,720
You and your gun must be steady.

62
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,226
That includes your mentality as well.

63
00:03:32,248 --> 00:03:32,850

00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,090
Do you think I won't feel ashamed?

189
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,680
I must tell Captain Chen
and Sergeant Cheng.

190
00:11:40,782 --> 00:11:43,026
Thank you, Squad Leader Dai.
Thank you, Captain Wu!

191
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,130
Look how happy he is.

192
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,450
Did you give him a handicap?

193
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,130
Reporting.

194
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,850
I didn't.

195
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,250
This kid is capable.

196
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,040
He works hard and he is smart.

197
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,450
He improves faster than I imagined.

198
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,040
You want a day off to go out to sea

199
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,693
just to do an interview on a matter
that hasn't been decided on?

200
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,520
After you leave,

201
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,850
who will take over your work?

202
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,610
Don't worry. I can deal with it.

203
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:17,800
Just a day off.

204
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,880
What if I can stir up a storm

205
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,330
for Minghua News?

206
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,160
Right?

207
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,010
Just work hard
and prepare for tomorrow's interview.

208
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,280
Fine.

209
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,920
I'll be honest with you.

210
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,871
I'm investigating

211
00:12:33,871 --> 00:12:36,210
a case of illegal salvage
of state-owned underwater relics.

212
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,970
It's true.

213
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,560
A while ago,

214
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,800
I received an anonymous tip-off

215
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,800
about illegal salvage
of underwater relics

216
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,970
in the Dayan Reef.

217
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,760
I went out to the sea for this.

218
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,850
Tang Xin,

219
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,800
your spirit is precious

220
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,160
but we cannot

221
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,010
investigate something like this clearly.

222
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,010
You should hand the case
over to the police.

223
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,880
That person did that before.

224
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,250
However, there's no update
about the investigation currently.

225
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,250
So, I was thinking

226
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,160
that if we found any evidence

227
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,730
and submitted it to the police,

228
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,970
Minghua News would be
at the height of its glory.

229
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,730
The attention we get from this
is more than being a female superhero.

230
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,880
Right, Mr. Tian?

231
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,250
I'll assume that you've agreed.

232
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,210
All right. You...

233
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,280
You can only give it a try.

234
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,450
Stay safe.

235
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:27,737
Thank you, Mr. Tian.

236
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:48,610
Mr. Han,

237
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,280
we'll arrive soon.

238
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,800
Let's put on the life vests.

239
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,760
Sure.

240
00:13:55,604 --> 00:13:56,871
Do you know how to put it on?

241
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,130
Mr. Han.

242
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,850
Thank you for your help today.

243
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:15,730
Without you,

244
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,040
I have no way of coming out

245
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,490
to search for the sunken ship.

246
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,210
Stop thanking me.

247
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,450
You thanked me
when you asked to borrow my boat.

248
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,970
You thanked me when you boarded the boat

249
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,330
and you're still thanking me now.

250
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,040
When I find the sunken ship

251
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,880
and get off the boat,

252
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,090
are you going to thank me again?

253
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,400
Of course.

254
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,520
I'm being sincere.

255
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,680
Fine.

256
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,400
I can see your sincerity.

257
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,680
Speaking of which,

258
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,520
I should be the one thanking you.

259
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,040
Thank you for giving me a chance

260
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,330
to do my part
to protect the underwater relics

261
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,160
of the sunken ship.

262
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,680
Sure.

263
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,450
If we can find the sunken ship,

264
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,450
I will write about you

265
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,400
and the Changzhou Group in a column.

266
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,400
That works.

267
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,880
However,
there's no need to write about me.

268
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,520
You should promote Changzhou Group more.

269
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,330
Understood.

270
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,250

Yes.

00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,520
Go, Yi Nanwang.

283
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,560
Dive in.

284
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,280
He's taking so long.

I heard the Dayan Reef interview
has been approved.

334
00:20:06,626 --> 00:20:08,170
However, the brigadier doesn't allow us

335
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,893
to mention it was you
who executed the mission.

336
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,600
All of us were there during the rescue.

337
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,930
There's no need to mention me.

338
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,840
Is it because of
Miss Tang from Baitun Bay?

339
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,360
She was there at Dayan Reef too.

340
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,730
Why are you avoiding her?

341
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,040
I'm not avoiding her.
I just think it's pointless.

342
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,410
The mission is already over.

343
00:20:27,471 --> 00:20:29,093
There's no need to speak to anyone else.

344
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,600
What if she just wants

345
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,980
to thank you in person?

346
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:33,930
We don't go on missions

347
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,930
so other people can thank us.

348
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,250
Her safety is
the best gratitude we can receive.

349
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,730
You are right.

350
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,410
However, I always feel

351
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,840
that you're cautious

352
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,182
when you speak about Miss Tang.

353
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,170
What?

354
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,490
Are you afraid that she will
recognize you?

355
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,280
I'm quite curious.

356
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,490
Why did she find me?

357
00:20:56,026 --> 00:20:57,730
If you're curious,
just ask her yourself.

358
00:20:57,737 --> 00:20:59,930
- Do you think you can guess it?
- I can't.

359
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,840
She is also the blind date
the brigadier introduced me.

360
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,280
That's great.
Both of you are fated together.

361
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,800
Even so,

362
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,280
I can't tell her

363
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,970
that I was the one who saved her.

364
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,170
It feels like moral kidnapping.

365
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,690
As if I'm forcing her to date me.

366
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,690
If you hide it from her,

367
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,490
you'll still have to be honest with her

368
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:19,600
if your date is successful.

369
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,280
It won't be that easy.

370
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:55,800
They are coming up.

371
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,560
How is it?

372
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,280
There's nothing!

373
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:04,360
There's nothing!

374
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,650
Nothing?

375
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,320
Did you search carefully?

376
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,280
Mr. Han, don't worry.

377
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,420
You even came here in person.

378
00:22:10,426 --> 00:22:11,490
We won't make any mistakes.

379
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:12,730
Calm down.

380
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,715
There are still two divers
who haven't come up yet.

381
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,450
They are back!

382
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,010
Did you find anything?

383
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,520
We didn't!

384
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,890
Everyone, work harder

385
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,120
and search again, all right?

386
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,520
Search carefully.

387
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,410
Yes. We've finally come here.

388
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,600
Please work harder.

389
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,800
Everyone, let's go again.

390
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,760
Come on!

391
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,690
They are back, Mr. Han.

392
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,760
How is it?

393
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,410
We still haven't found anything!

394
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,690
How?

395
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,210
Don't be anxious.

396
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,520
Get everyone on the boat

397
00:23:08,537 --> 00:23:09,410
and take a break.

398
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,650
Did we anchor the boat
at the wrong spot?

399
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,520
I don't know about this.

400
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,170
Secretary Ding,

401
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:21,890
tell the captain

402
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,890
to move two nautical miles forward

403
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,070
before making the next move.

404
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:25,650
Understood.

405
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,560
Don't worry. I believe we will find it.

406
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,890
I hope so.

407
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,280
That's right.

408
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,360
It's correct, right?

409
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,250
Yes.

410
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,040
10926.

411
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:59,520
Let's expand the search area.

412
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,360
Sure.

413
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:09,490
Hello.

414
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,320
Mr. Han.

415
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,650
Mr. Yuhang went to Dayan Reef
with the female reporter.

416
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,010
He even brought divers with him.

417
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,560
Just let them trouble themselves.

418
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:51,760
What about this time?

419
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,010
We still found nothing.

420
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,040
It's full of coral reefs.

421
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,040
Coral reefs?

422
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,180
(You received one new email.)

423
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,280
(I went to the coordinates you sent me)

424
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,040
(but I found nothing.)

425
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,220
(Did you send me the wrong coordinates?)

426
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,830
(Can you send me the coordinates again?)

427
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,490
(That's impossible.)

428
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:40,120
(Perhaps there's a mistake
in where you anchor your boat.)

429
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:43,120
(After all,
the sea is different from the land.)

430
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,820
(Coordinates)

431
00:25:53,848 --> 00:25:56,226
(These coordinates are different
from the ones I received.)

432
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,250
(It's this one.)

433
00:26:04,182 --> 00:26:06,226
(I sent these coordinates
to you last time.)

434
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,210
(My computer might be hacked.)

435
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,690
(Use this email
to contact me next time.)

436
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,560
(To be safe, you should
change your email address as well.)

437
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,800
(Moreover, it's troublesome
for me to search like this.)

438
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,560
(Can't you just tell me directly)

439
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,080
(who the ones are
who illegally salvage the relics?)

440
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,520
Captain.

441
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:55,560
Stop reading.

442
00:26:55,604 --> 00:26:57,310
K5 military reconnaissance
and capture case.

443
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,515
If you read it, I'll be angry.

444
00:27:01,715 --> 00:27:03,420
Stop reading.
Read after you finish eating.

445
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,560
Yes.

446
00:27:07,115 --> 00:27:08,782
Cheng Yuan, you have double standards.

447
00:27:08,804 --> 00:27:10,520
You ignored me
when I asked you not to read it

448
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,930
but when Captain asked you, you...

449
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,310
Are you comparing yourself
with him?

450
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,040
Don't you know
why I have double standards?

451
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,730
Get lost.

452
00:27:16,115 --> 00:27:17,490
Don't borrow books from me again.

453
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:18,560
Cut it out.

454
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:19,930
Cheng Yuan.

455
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,690
Help me guide the instructors
in doing the interview tomorrow.

456
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:24,800
Yes.

457
00:27:24,871 --> 00:27:26,693
Why are you bringing Cheng Yuan
instead of me?

458
00:27:26,715 --> 00:27:27,490
You?

459
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,450
Can you say anything nice about me?

460
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,560
I'll surely give you the highest praise.

461
00:27:34,226 --> 00:27:35,930
This is the reason
why I don't bring you.

462
00:27:35,937 --> 00:27:37,010
You talk too much nonsense.

463
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:37,970
Just eat.

464
00:27:38,337 --> 00:27:39,650
You still won't let me say it.

465
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:40,760
Cheng Yuan is suitable then.

466
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,170
He won't say a word no matter what.

467
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:44,690
Captain.

468
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,730
Are we going to send anyone

469
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,890
to do Miss Tang's interview tomorrow?

470
00:27:51,382 --> 00:27:53,026
It depends on the situation. Let's see.

471
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,560
(They are too powerful.)

472
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,930
(I can't afford to offend them.)

473
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,410
(You should investigate it yourself.)

474
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,040
(You should also be careful.)

475
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,490
(Provide me
with information about them.)

476
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,010
(That's fine, right?)

477
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,360
What does she

478
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
want to know?

479
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,890
Probably who saved her.

480
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:29,250
What should I answer if she asks?

481
00:28:29,315 --> 00:28:30,450
It's easy. Let me teach you.

482
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,080
Two words.

483
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,210
Zong Qing.

484
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,320
Just let me handle it. I'm not afraid.

485
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:37,800
Can you just eat?

486
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,560
Sure.

487
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:42,890
If she asks,

488
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,690
let me answer her.

489
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:45,800
Understood.

490
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,450
Let me peel a banana for you.

491
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,890
(I can only tell you)

492
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:07,010
(that they were fishermen
in the early days.)

493
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:09,120
(However, the enterprise grew quickly.)

494
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:12,010
(Currently, it is a large enterprise.)

495
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,600
(This is my new email address.)

496
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,040
(Don't forget to wipe out everything)

497
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,170
(from my old email address.)

498
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,509
(Which companies
in Wenzhou were engaged)

499
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,160
(in marine fishing operations
in the early years?)

500
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,580
(Changzhou Group)

501
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,690
You...

502
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,840
If you keep developing,

503
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,280
it will be exposed.

504
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,360
Wang Lang.

505
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,600
If you have no time to interfere,

506
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,490
I have time.

507
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,840
I can interfere with it.

508
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,280
Captain,

509
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,890
Xin's application
for the interview of the team

510
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,210
has been approved.

511
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,120
I've informed Wu Si.

512
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,450
I will ask him to work with her.

513
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,560
I believe

514
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,800
they know what to do regarding this.

515
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,520
No. They know
their responsibilities too well.

516
00:29:58,537 --> 00:30:00,170
They don't have
a relationship foundation

517
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,560
so not putting them together is bad.

518
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,080
Wang...

519
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:06,560
Wang Lang.

520
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,080
Captain.

521
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,210
I'm picking up Lin Lan and my son.

522
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,360
Lin Lan is here.

523
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,280
You picked them up?

524
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,450
I'll hang up then.

525
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,120
You've hung up?

526
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,120
Yes.

527
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:21,840
It's great now.

528
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,537
You don't have to run around anymore.

529
00:30:23,582 --> 00:30:24,450
It feels better, right?

530
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,120
I still need to wait at home for you.

531
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,730
I come home every day.

532
00:30:28,782 --> 00:30:30,604
I'm just waiting for you
at a different place.

533
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,650
Wang Zhaoyang.

534
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,120
From today onwards,

535
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,360
you can start counting

536
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,970
how many days a year
your father is staying at home.

537
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:38,840
I can guarantee

538
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,426
that you are the best in your class

539
00:30:40,448 --> 00:30:41,930
in Mathematics among 100 people.

540
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:44,450
I'm the best among 200 people.

541
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:47,040
How arrogant.

542
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,520
Both of you.

543
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,250
Reporting!

544
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,040
Come in.

545
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,450
Miss Tang, please go inside.

546
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:58,800
Attention.

547
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,660
(Meeting Room)

548
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,490
Hello, Miss Tang.

549
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,690
I am Liu Shihua,
a Blue Blade instructor.

550
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,120
Tang Xin.

551
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,080
Wu Si, Blue Blade Special Ops Team.

552
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,700
Cheng Yuan, Blue Blade Special Ops Team.

553
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,650
Please sit down.

554
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,250
Sure.

555
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:22,410
Sit.

556
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:34,760
Miss Tang.

557
00:31:35,715 --> 00:31:37,693
Is there anything funny
about the interview?

558
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,360
It's not.

559
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,360
I'm honored.

560
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,120
This is the draft for the interview.

561
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,210
Both of you can take a look.

562
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:48,490
There's no need.

563
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,800
Just ask any question you want.

564
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,040
We will do our best.

565
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:54,250
Sure.

566
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,490
Here's my first question.

567
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:01,120
Was everyone involved
in the Dayan Reef Rescue

568
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,071
a member of
the Blue Blade Special Ops Team?

569
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,426
We are all comrades
regardless of the team.

570
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,010
May I know how the duties are assigned

571
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:14,030
in the Blue Blade Special Ops Team?

572
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:14,893
It's confidential.

573
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,410
I understand.

574
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:22,560
May I know

575
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,450
if the team was around

576
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,970
or rushed there after receiving an order

577
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:27,010
during that operation?

578
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,010
The superior orders

579
00:32:28,226 --> 00:32:29,960
for all soldiers to be ready
at all times.

580
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,520
The rescue operation

581
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,600
was a sudden incident.

582
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,650
How did all of you

583
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:45,210
arrive at the scene on time?

584
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,382
We arrive when we are summoned.

585
00:32:46,404 --> 00:32:47,360
We fight when we arrive.

586
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,080
May I know who the members

587
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,490
are involved in the rescue operation?

588
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:54,010
Cheng Yuan.

589
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,490
May I speak to Cheng Yuan alone?

590
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:56,490
Sorry. You can't.

591
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:57,690
Wu Si!

592
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,650
Miss Tang.

593
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:04,170
You've scared my cute comrades.

594
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,040
Captain.

595
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:10,410
Why don't you

596
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:13,360
explain to Miss Tang
about the Dayan Reef Rescue

597
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,930
in simple terms?

598
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,690
Miss Tang was at the scene.

599
00:33:17,248 --> 00:33:18,800
Do I still need to explain anything?

600
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,800
Then,

601
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,410
why don't you
read Miss Tang's interview draft again?

602
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,170
No need.

603
00:33:24,715 --> 00:33:26,520
I believe in
Miss Tang's professionalism.

604
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,650
It is a soldier's duty to save people.

605
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,120
I can answer your questions
on behalf of the Blue Blade Team.

606
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,360
However, if your interview
is about a certain individual,

607
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,840
I'm sorry. I have nothing to tell you.

608
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,650
Captain Wu.

609
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,410
You said you'd cooperate
with me in the interview.

610
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:40,650
I'm working hard to do that.

611
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,490
However, the condition is

612
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:44,320
that you can't ask
any confidential questions.

613
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,320
Sure.

614
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,360
I'll ask you a question as an individual

615
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,871
involved in the Dayan Reef incident.

616
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,170
Who was the person

617
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,450
who saved me that day?

618
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,490
Cheng Yuan, answer her.

619
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,080
Sergeant Cheng, you were there that day.

620
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,040
Can you answer my question?

621
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,240
Please answer my question.

622
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:20,890
Zong...

623
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,490
What?

624
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,850
Anyway,

625
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:26,330
it's...

626
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,120
I haven't asked him for his opinion.

627
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,410
I can't answer you right now.

628
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,850
All right.

629
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:46,560
I'll wait for you to ask for his opinion

630
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,010
before answering my question.

631
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,770
I'm going back then.

632
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,370
Miss Tang.

633
00:35:18,048 --> 00:35:19,848
Do you still have
any interview requirements?

634
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,600
If it's possible,

635
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:26,080
I want to enter the camp once.

636
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,850
Whether they are involved

637
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,426
in the Dayan Reef Rescue or not,

638
00:35:29,448 --> 00:35:30,770
I also feel like speaking to them.

639
00:35:31,693 --> 00:35:33,290
That requires approval from my superior.

640
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:33,970
Sure.

641
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,248
I'll wait for your reply, Captain Wu.

642
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,080
I'm leaving then.

643
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,810
Captain.

644
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,370
Miss Tang is fine.

645
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,850
I don't care.

646
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,120
Captain Wu.

647
00:36:00,182 --> 00:36:01,450
Don't forget to ask for approval.

648
00:36:01,604 --> 00:36:02,737
I'm waiting for your reply.

649
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,290
I think

650
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,200
you are a good match

651
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:13,560
with Miss Tang.

652
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:20,930
Reporting!

653
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:21,600
Come in.

654
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,410
Brigadier.

655
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,410
Miss Tang is requesting
an interview at the camp.

656
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,520
To interview whom?

657
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,560
She didn't say.

658
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:34,010
Reply to her in this way.

659
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:37,970
The camp welcomes her to do an interview

660
00:36:38,051 --> 00:36:40,451
but the team's training
must be guaranteed.

661
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:44,200
We will arrange
a suitable interviewee for her.

662
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,160
Yes.

663
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:50,970
Captain.

664
00:36:51,337 --> 00:36:53,560
Take a break in the afternoon
and go out with me.

665
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:54,720
Meet my girlfriend.

666
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,810
Just meet her yourself.

667
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,226
Why do you need me to accompany you?

668
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:16,930
Xin.

669
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:20,410
You will scare Zong Qing like this.

670
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:22,010
No one brings interview drafts

671
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:24,010
with a buddy to filter blind dates.

672
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:27,370
What did Mr. Lan teach you?

673
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,370
I'm not fighting an unprepared war.

674
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,450
I think you faced an obstacle
during the interview

675
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,200
so you want to make it up
through Zong Qing.

676
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,680
You don't know

677
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,182
how difficult it is

678
00:37:39,204 --> 00:37:40,810
to find a Marine Corps soldier alone.

679
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,080
Why did I face an obstacle today?

680
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,640
Because that person messed

681
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,293
up the whole situation
by being a sentry.

682
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,930
It's difficult to get inside the base.

683
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:50,160
I want to thank you
for helping me find a shortcut.

684
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:53,520
Hurry up.

685
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:15,160
What's wrong?

686
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,010
Don't say anything

687
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,520
about the Dayan Reef,
understand?

688
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,770
Why do you mention that suddenly?

689
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:21,930
Answer my question.

690
00:38:22,382 --> 00:38:24,120
I can't talk
about confidential information,

691
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,200
anything unrelated,

692
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,804
or your identity.

693
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:27,720
Are you satisfied now?

694
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:30,640
Go on.

695
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,810
Hurry. I'm late.

696
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,720
Today, I'll let you speak with him.

697
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,450
Let me tell you.

698
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:39,890
Without that person around,

699
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,190
I'll end the battle with a few questions

700
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:45,120
and let you two be alone. All right?

701
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,410
Tang Xin.

702
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,370
Why do you keep mentioning

703
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,680
a certain person?

704
00:38:57,937 --> 00:38:59,410
Are you interested in that person?

705
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,770
I'm interested in that person?

706
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,370
Will you be interested in a log?

707
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,290
He's an egg without a crack.

708
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,640
He's tough like a steel plate

709
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,680
and I'm sulfur dichloride.

710
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,770
I make him rot bit by bit.

711
00:39:15,565 --> 00:39:16,410
Miss Tang.

712
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,370
You see me as an egg without a crack
yet you're still surrounding me.

713
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,290
What do you see yourself as?

714
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,040
Why is he here?

715
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,040
I don't know.

716
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:38,560
Zhang.

717
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,330
I'm leaving.

718
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:40,669
- See you tomorrow, Mr. Bai.
- Bye.

719
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,271
Bye.

720
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,370
Let me introduce you.

721
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:16,520
He is my captain, Wu Si.

722
00:40:16,715 --> 00:40:18,410
This is my childhood friend, Tang Xin.

723
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,080
What is your name?

724
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:20,600
I am...

725
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,560
Marine Corps,

726
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,410
Zong Qing.

727
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,850
He looks familiar.

728
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,930
Have we met somewhere before?

729
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,370
Yes.

730
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,970
She resisted arrest
at the fishing village previously

731
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,890
and called herself my girlfriend.
She's Miss Tang,

732
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:39,770
Tang Xin.

733
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,410
It was all a misunderstanding.

734
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,970
Yangyang talks about you all the time.

735
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,600
What is your role

736
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,290
in the team?

737
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:49,640
Do you usually

738
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,850
go on very dangerous missions?

739
00:40:59,050 --> 00:40:59,720
I understand.

740
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,640
It's confidential, right?

741
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,680
Sure. Let me change my question.

742
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,290
Have you been to Dayan Reef recently?

743
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:11,770
Miss Tang, stop troubling me.

744
00:41:11,848 --> 00:41:13,560
I didn't accept a task
to be interviewed.

745
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,720
I can't answer your question.

746
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:18,200
I didn't teach him that.

747
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,450
Captain Wu.

748
00:41:24,671 --> 00:41:25,850
I don't think it's suitable

749
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,560
for you to follow him on his date.

750
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,330
Then,

751
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:29,490
Miss Tang, you are...

752
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:30,720
She's my buddy.

753
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,490
I must help her take a look...

754
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:34,080
He's my comrade.

755
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,410
I must observe

756
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,200
his blind date carefully.

757
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,160
It's done. When are you leaving?

758
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:40,970
I'll leave

759
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,200
when you leave.

760
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,600
What should we do now?

761
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,720
Zong Qing, you're free to go.

762
00:42:00,938 --> 00:42:02,025
All right. Understood.

763
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:02,970
