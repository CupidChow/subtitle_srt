18
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,570
We've reached the training sea area.

19
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,982
All squad members, assemble at once.

20
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,410
Yi Nanwang, what's wrong?

21
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:50,690
Move.

22
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,350
Attention!

23
00:01:53,826 --> 00:01:56,004
Helicopter squad,
alternate landing field.

24
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,210
Flight Inspection.

25
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,880
Three-four requests take off.

26
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
Timing begins.

27
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,880
Launch the small craft.

28
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:11,810
Wu Si.

29
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:12,440
Yes, Sir.

30
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,320
Fall back in.

31
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,050
Yes, Sir.

32
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,400
What happened just now?

33
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,170
What did I hear?

34
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,440
Answer me.

35
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,170
Sir!

36
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,570
I'll continue to develop
targeted training plans.

37
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,280
Targeted for what?

38
00:05:40,226 --> 00:05:42,280
Is the gangway too long,
or is the hatch too low?

39
00:05:42,515 --> 00:05:44,915
Are the waves too strong,
or is the ship too rocky?

40
00:05:45,182 --> 00:05:47,137
Only start the training
after boarding the ship?

41
00:05:47,404 --> 00:05:48,760
What were you doing before this?

42
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:49,810
Sir.

43
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,810
We have no excuse.

44
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:53,782
We'll begin additional training
immediately.

45
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,200
Who made that sound just now?

46
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,570
Who was that?

47
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,760
Speak.

48
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,170
Sir!

49
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,050
Step forward.

50
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,080
Apologize, Brigadier.

51
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,050
That was me.

52
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,440
Well done you.

53
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,930
No excuses. You admitted it directly.

54
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:29,840
Very good.

55
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,050
But I'm disappointed.

56
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,520
Yes,

57
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,400
no mistakes during the training.

58
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,320
It's just seasick.

59
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,960
That's understandable.

60
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,320
But I don't understand.

61
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,640
Because you're a special forces soldier
of the Chinese Navy.

62
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,170
The entire fleet

63
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,570
and every commercial ship
that might face danger

64
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,840
are your responsibility.

65
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,050
One small wave
and you're already seasick?

66
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,050
When real danger comes,

67
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,440
how will you protect others?

68
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,440
How?

69
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,400
I don't care if you're throwing up bile

70
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,810
in your berth.

71
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,280
As long as you hear the assembly call,

72
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,520
you must stand firm

73
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,930
and hold your rifle steady.

74
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,840
Understand?

75
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,760
Yes, Sir.

76
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,170
I don't care whether
you're from the south or the north,

77
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,640
whether you've sailed before,

78
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,050
or if you didn't get enough rest,

79
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,520
or anything else.

80
00:07:26,582 --> 00:07:27,840
I'll only emphasize one thing.

81
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,570
Anyone else might falter,

82
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,080
but not you.

83
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,400
Not any of you.

84
00:07:39,804 --> 00:07:41,071
When you finally feel like

85
00:07:41,115 --> 00:07:42,570
a real special forces soldier,

86
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,810
ask me for your arm badge.

87
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,320
Fall back in.

88
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,080
Yes, Sir.

89
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,320
You requested to keep him.

90
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,930
Train him well.

91
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:07,570
Yes, Sir.

92
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,280
Listen.

93
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,640
If you're a soldier,

94
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,320
then act like one.

95
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,280
If I hear throwing up

96
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,930
or seasick groans again,

97
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,370
swim back.

98
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,370
I won't say much.

99
00:08:49,248 --> 00:08:50,490
Arrange more training sessions.

100
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,610
Keep your head up.

101
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,730
Do you want your arm badge back?

102
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,250
Yes, Sir!

103
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:14,880
Me too.

104
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,490
Then act like a warrior.

105
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,680
Understood?

106
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,210
Yes, Sir!

107
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,370
Mom, I'm back.

108
00:09:32,715 --> 00:09:34,130
You came back at the right time.

109
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,760
I just put on a fresh sheet.

110
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,982
Not used to it yet
without Zong Qing around, right?

111
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,010
Look at that pouty face.

112
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,450
Don't worry.

113
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,250
The escort mission

114
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,330
doesn't have a fixed date.

115
00:09:46,382 --> 00:09:48,915
Who knows, he might be back
before you know it. Let's go.

116
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,130
What's wrong?

117
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,130
Acting like a kid again?

118
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,130
Mom,

119
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,450
I'm pregnant.

120
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,880
Don't carry that.

121
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,800
Silly girl.

122
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,450
Let me hug you.

123
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,880
Eat more.

124
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,560
You need good health.

125
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,640
Okay. Don't keep piling food
on her plate.

126
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,760
She just got pregnant.
Let her eat at her own pace.

127
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,440
She doesn't have much
of an appetite now.

128
00:10:40,448 --> 00:10:42,071
That's all the more reason
she needs to eat.

129
00:10:42,093 --> 00:10:43,130
It's also a training.

130
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,330
Eat to stay healthy.

131
00:10:45,471 --> 00:10:47,093
Humans are made of iron.
Food is steel.

132
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,010
Eat up.

133
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,090
Look at your dad.

134
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,240
Ever since he found out
he's going to be a grandpa,

135
00:10:52,248 --> 00:10:53,250
he's all over the moon.

136
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,370
Being a grandpa is great and all,

137
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,250
but

138
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,680
my daughter's health comes first.

139
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,880
Eat more.

140
00:11:00,915 --> 00:11:02,330
All right, Dad, Mom. I'll eat more.

141
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,210
That's right.

142
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,680
Yangyang,

143
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,560
now that you're pregnant,

144
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,640
you're carrying for two.

145
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,450
Be extra careful and slow
in everything you do.

146
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,130
Zong Qing isn't home.

147
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,250
If anything happens, let us know.

148
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,680
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

149
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,370
Zong Qing's away on escort duty.

150
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,010
It's his duty

151
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,560
as a soldier.

152
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,880
As a military spouse,

153
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,010
you have to be prepared for that.

154
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,150
You need to understand that.

155
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,210
Why are you lecturing her again?

156
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,010
It's not like you're any help.

157
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,250
Fine.

158
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,560
I won't say more.

159
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,760
Dad, Mom, don't worry.

160
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,330
I understand.

161
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:42,920
Look at that.

162
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,210
I know what to do.

163
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,370
Well done.

164
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,210
Let me ask you.

165
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,250
Did you register at the hospital?

166
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,370
Have you made an appointment
for a prenatal checkup?

167
00:11:52,404 --> 00:11:54,071
Don't worry. Everything's been arranged.

168
00:11:54,115 --> 00:11:55,250
Which day?

169
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,450
Let me know. I'll go with you.

170
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,210
Okay.

171
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,560
That's what is important now.

172
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,880
All right, all right.

173
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:13,580
(Kaqiman Hotel, Roman Islands)

174
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,880
What's the plan?

175
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,520
Check where Atocha is

176
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,160
and plan the route tonight.

177
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,040
I already got it sorted.

178
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,520
It's all in my phone notes.

179
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,730
Use it any time you want.

180
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,370
Good.

181
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,400
Then let's rest for half a day today.

182
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,800
Start work tomorrow at 8 AM sharp.

183
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,160
Got it. I'll put my things away.

184
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,760
Go ahead.

185
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,130
I'll head upstairs and take a look.

186
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:07,800
Sure.

187
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,450
The conditions here are pretty basic.

188
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,010
Hygiene probably isn't great either.

189
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,010
Mr. Han,

190
00:13:55,182 --> 00:13:57,050
maybe you should go back
to the original hotel.

191
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,330
I'll stay here and watch them.

192
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,010
No need.

193
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,490
No matter where I stay,

194
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,920
I can't show my face.

195
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,010
You'll have to deal with

196
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,400
most things anyway.

197
00:14:04,715 --> 00:14:06,400
I actually think this place is fine.

198
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,850
Clean and quiet.

199
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,210
If Tang Xin can stay here, why can't I?

200
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,850
Put my luggage inside.

201
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,250
Do you know why I brought you up here?

202
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,040
Sir, yes.

203
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,250
This is the highest place on the ship.

204
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,737
The higher it is, the more it rocks.

205
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,490
Everyone gets through this.

206
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,730
I'm sorry, Captain.

207
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,520
I let you down.

208
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:56,680
Yi Nanwang,

209
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,760
you've never let me down.

210
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,760
I hope you'll never

211
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,010
give up on yourself.

212
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,400
Sir!

213
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,520
Captain,

214
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,250
I'll get our arm badges back.

215
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,730
I know you will.

216
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,760
But do it fast!

217
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,010
Sir.

218
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,760
Captain,

219
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
I want to know,

220
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,010
how did you become so strong?

221
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,800
You think I'm strong?

222
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,250
Captain, to me,

223
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,250
you're always the strongest,
the hardest working,

224
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,920
and the most outstanding.

225
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,400
Captain Chen,

226
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,490
Sergeant Cheng, Captain Zong,

227
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,850
and Squad Leader Dai,

228
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,330
each of them is exceptional.

229
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,490
Only me.

230
00:15:55,937 --> 00:15:57,400
I've been holding the team back...

231
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,850
If you were really that bad,

232
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,680
why would I have brought you in?

233
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,560
Everyone started this way.

234
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,010
Seasick, afraid of heights, and fear.

235
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,250
It's normal.

236
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,400
We're human.

237
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,760
We're made of flesh and blood.

238
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,250
We all make mistakes.

239
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,330
When I was a recruit,

240
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,680
my squad leader told me,

241
00:16:29,337 --> 00:16:31,800
"As long as you grit your teeth
and get through the hardest part,

242
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,760
the road ahead gets easier."

243
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,640
Do you understand?

244
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,280
Yes, Sir.

245
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,250
Are you sure?

246
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,160
Don't leave this spot before lights out.

247
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,560
Stand here like a nail.

248
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,250
Yes, Sir.

249
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,860
(Atocha)

250
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,250
Xin,

251
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,730
we've been sitting here for two days.

252
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,650
That door hasn't opened once.

253
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,560
Only the sign says "Atocha".

254
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,250
It's not even a full name.

255
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,280
This doesn't feel like
a real company to me.

256
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,730
Didn't you look into this place?

257
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,160
Are you sure this is the right place?

258
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,040
I'm sure. This is the place.

259
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,170
It doesn't look like a company.

260
00:17:41,071 --> 00:17:43,204
We're already here.
Let's wait a little longer.

261
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:53,600
One, two, three, four. Speed up.

262
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,600
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Keep going.

263
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,250
Eleven, twelve,

264
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,490
thirteen, fourteen,

265
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,490
fifteen. Walk in a straight line.

266
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,320
Step on the red line.

267
00:18:10,448 --> 00:18:11,200
Walk the red line.

268
00:18:11,204 --> 00:18:12,226
Zong Qing, help him.

269
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,490
Walk the red line.

270
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,840
Red line.

271
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,320
Faster.

272
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,600
Ready.

273
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,410
Go.

274
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,690
One, two, three, four, five,

275
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,840
six, seven. Good. Walk straight.

276
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,360
Quick. Get up.

277
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,890
Straight line.

278
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,320
Keep going.

279
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:54,560
Ready.

280
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,010
What are you looking at?

281
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,840
Hurry up and eat.

282
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,120
I feel sick. I'm afraid
I'll throw up again.

283
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,010
Training's coming up.

284
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,860
Hurry up and eat. Don't dawdle.

285
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,040
Can't you overcome this?

286
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,450
Xin,

287
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,320
we've been watching the place for days.

288
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,280
Atocha's door has never opened.

289
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,890
What if the company
has already gone under?

290
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,360
Whether it's shut down or not,

291
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,800
sitting here waiting won't help.

292
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,210
What should we do?

293
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,320
We've been waiting in the cafe
for so long.

294
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,840
I suppose the informant

295
00:20:22,937 --> 00:20:24,840
can see our sincerity now.

296
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,080
Yeah.

297
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,760
Email him.

298
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,360
Cafe?

299
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,970
There must be something special

300
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,890
around that cafe.

301
00:20:42,982 --> 00:20:44,693
Otherwise, they wouldn't travel so far

302
00:20:44,715 --> 00:20:45,690
just to get coffee.

303
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,040
There's a company across the street
called Atocha.

304
00:20:50,248 --> 00:20:52,048
Then there must be something wrong
with it.

305
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,600
Do you know anything about it?

306
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:55,930
I'll look into it.

307
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,760
Just keep an eye on Miss Tang.

308
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,890
I'll get some friends
to check out the rest.

309
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,426
The consultation room is over there.

310
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:16,600
Division 4's attending physician,
please come to the meeting room.

311
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,120
Don't touch me.

312
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,840
Calm down. Don't get upset.

313
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,560
- Don't touch me
- Don't get upset.

314
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,840
You...

315
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:24,800
Don't touch me.

316
00:21:24,893 --> 00:21:26,120
I told you to line up earlier.

317
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,040
There are so many people there.
Get off me.

318
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,600
Mom.

319
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,450
I can't see what it looks like.

320
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,450
You can't?

321
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,120
Let me have a look.

322
00:21:44,982 --> 00:21:47,760
(Ultrasound report, Lan Yangyang)
Here.

323
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,410
Here.

324
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,840
That must be the little head.

325
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:52,650
And here.

326
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,040
I think it's the tiny arm.

327
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,560
And this must be the little butt.

328
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:59,410
Well.

329
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,080
Stop. My eyes hurt.

330
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,360
Fine, fine.

331
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,760
Get some rest.

332
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,690
I'll get you some juice.

333
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,660
(Received A New Email)

334
00:23:29,804 --> 00:23:31,293
(I've been in Roman for a few days,)

335
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,410
(watching Atocha.)

336
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,650
(But it hasn't opened once.)

337
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,320
(There are no signs of activity.)

338
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,840
(If you have any more leads,)

339
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,410
(please send them to me right away.)

340
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,560
Look, there he is.

341
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,120
What did he reply?

342
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:56,800
He said

343
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,360
a bigwig is coming.

344
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,690
And that he usually stays

345
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,320
at the Aston Hotel.

346
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,760
What's wrong with this guy?

347
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,080
Why can't he just tell us

348
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,471
who the bigwig is?

349
00:24:08,471 --> 00:24:10,426
So many people check into this hotel
every day.

350
00:24:10,471 --> 00:24:12,337
How are we supposed to know
who the bigwig is?

351
00:24:12,337 --> 00:24:13,604
All right. Stop nagging.

352
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,360
(Can you be more specific)

353
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:21,080
(about this bigwig?)

354
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,800
(You'll see who it is when he shows up.)

355
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,600
(I've always been curious about you.)

356
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,480
(How did you get to know so much?)

357
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,650
(You don't need to know who I am.)

358
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,600
(You should focus on)

359
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,250
(watching this bigwig)

360
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,930
(and try to get something useful)

361
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,730
(from him.)

362
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,320
Hold it in. Swallow it down.

363
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,010
I can't stand this smell.

364
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:10,970
Report.

365
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:11,760
Speak.

366
00:25:12,226 --> 00:25:14,071
Captain Zong,
you don't have to stay with me.

367
00:25:14,071 --> 00:25:14,937
You can go.

368
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,280
I can manage this.

369
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,120
You think I want to stay with you?

370
00:25:20,137 --> 00:25:22,537
I'm just afraid you'll puke on the deck,
and I'll have to clean it up.

371
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,040
Think about something else.

372
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,280
Walk in a straight line.

373
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,250
Come back.

374
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,690
- Are you okay?
- I can.

375
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,471
You can't even get
this simple thing done.

376
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,970
Come on. Ready. Hold tight.

377
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,520
One,

378
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:47,760
two.

379
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,893
You're a special forces soldier.
And you can do it.

380
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:50,650
Go.

381
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,040
Walk in a straight line.

382
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,170
Faster.

383
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,520
Walk in a straight line.

384
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:56,930
Come back.

385
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,520
Go.

386
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,560
Go.

387
00:25:59,782 --> 00:26:00,930
Walk in a straight line.

388
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:01,970
Step on the red line.

389
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:02,840
Walk straight.

390
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,690
Step on the red line.

391
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,520
Come back.

392
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,650
Brigadier.

393
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,520
Why are you here alone?

394
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,360
Sir, I'm on duty today.

395
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:46,170
Carry on with it.

396
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,040
Yes, Sir.

397
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,170
Mr. Han,

398
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:01,890
they've changed to another place.

399
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,450
They moved to the Aston Hotel.

400
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,650
They changed hotels?

401
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,410
Why?

402
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,040
I found it strange, too.

403
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,650
Aston is the most high-end hotel
in Roman.

404
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,730
Not just anyone can afford
to stay there.

405
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:28,320
Welcome.

406
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,250
Xin.

407
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,410
It's not locked. Come in.

408
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,600
Your room's huge.

409
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,170
Not bad.

410
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,320
Why?

411
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,410
Want to switch with me?

412
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,040
No, you keep it.

413
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,080
So,

414
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,250
what's next?

415
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,730
We can't just wait
in the hotel room forever.

416
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,800
The informant said

417
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,170
once the bigwig arrives,

418
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,840
we'll know who it is.

419
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,930
So that means

420
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,360
it's someone we either know

421
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,210
or at least recognize.

422
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,490
All right.

423
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,360
I know what to do now.

424
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,560
How's Yi Nanwang's training going?

425
00:29:33,871 --> 00:29:35,915
He's thrown up so much
that there's nothing left.

426
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,170
A few more rounds

427
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,360
should be enough.

428
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,360
It's normal.

429
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,970
We were the same when we started.

430
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,080
Mr. Han, we came here in a rush.

431
00:30:08,093 --> 00:30:09,960
No large rooms are available
at the moment.

432
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,450
Which floor is Tang Xin on?

433
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,970
35th.

434
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:18,930
35th, I see.

435
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:21,730
In the coming days,

436
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,690
be extra careful when going out.

437
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,550
Don't let Tang Xin
and her colleague spot you.

438
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,560
We'll have meals

439
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,040
delivered to the room.

440
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,450
Eat it here, okay?

441
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,170
Okay.

442
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:03,840
Thank you.

443
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,210
Let's head over there for today.

444
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,250
Right.

445
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,210
Later, I'll go to the cafe,

446
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,170
and you go to the bar.

447
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,690
If anything comes up, contact me.

448
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,080
Call me if anything happens.

449
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,170
Hello.

450
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:13,730
Thank you.

451
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:51,650
Yi Nanwang.

452
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,410
Yes, Sir.

453
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,760
Your shift ends.

454
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,450
I'll take over from here.

455
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,280
No, Squad Leader Dai.

456
00:32:58,490 --> 00:32:59,280
I can.

457
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:00,840
I really can.

458
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,490
Captain.

459
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:04,650
Captain.

460
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,970
Yi Nanwang,
you've been training too hard lately.

461
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:08,760
Go back and rest.

462
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:10,010
Let Dai Wei take over.

463
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,210
Yes, Sir.

464
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,210
Report.

465
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:37,840
Come in.

466
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:44,970
What is it?

467
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,040
Brigadier,

468
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,800
Yi Nanwang has something to say.

469
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:49,730
Speak.

470
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,320
Brigadier,

471
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:54,840
I...

472
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,600
I'm not seasick anymore.

473
00:33:57,937 --> 00:33:59,250
You're a special forces soldier.

474
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,840
Isn't that the bare minimum?

475
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:02,840
What?

476
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,040
Do you want me to give you a medal?

477
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:06,690
Sir.

478
00:34:06,937 --> 00:34:08,720
I'd like to get back
Captain Wu's arm badge.

479
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:13,330
Just his?

480
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,330
What about your own?

481
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,720
You want me to keep it?

482
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:19,450
I want it back too.

483
00:34:29,215 --> 00:34:30,200
Take them.

484
00:34:30,204 --> 00:34:32,182
It's not like
I want to keep them for you.

485
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:34,410
- Thank you, Brigadier.
- Thank you, Brigadier.

486
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,720
Back to your posts.

487
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,804
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

488
00:34:46,728 --> 00:34:47,240
Brigadier,

489
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:49,200
thank you for the apple.
It's very sweet.

490
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,160
What sweet?

491
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:56,970
Don't think everything's fine now.

492
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:58,200
And you.

493
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:00,720
Don't be proud.

494
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:03,600
Or I'll have you swim back to the base
with him.

495
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,200
Yes, Sir.

496
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:05,850
Yes, Sir.

497
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:06,970
Scram.

498
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,450
Chief,

499
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,560
the Chinese People's
Liberation Army Navy,

500
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,370
Navy Escort Fleet

501
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,890
is ready to carry out

502
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,330
its mission.

503
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,010
Permission to set sail, Sir.

504
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,410
Fleet Commander, Xu Jianhua.

505
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,720
Political Commissar, Song Guoqing.

506
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:39,200
Comrades,

507
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,410
you all know the escort mission
very well,

508
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,600
so no need for more words.

509
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,850
Each of you

510
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,490
represents the Chinese People's
Liberation Army,

511
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,450
and more importantly, the Chinese Navy.

512
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,490
I'll be waiting here

513
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,890
for your safe return.

514
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,010
Salute.

515
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,330
At ease.

516
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:04,160
Board the ship.

517
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,100
(Forge elite forces on the vast ocean,
safeguard peace with steadfast loyalty.)

518
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,582
(Radar)
Report.

519
00:37:09,604 --> 00:37:11,730
Starboard side, one degree.
Distance, two nautical miles.

520
00:37:11,737 --> 00:37:13,048
Vessel outbound for operations.

521
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,240
Heading 142 degrees.

522
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,700
(Operation by Non-Professionals
Is Prohibited)

523
00:39:07,448 --> 00:39:09,040
You didn't make a sound when you came.

524
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:10,520
What are you doing?

525
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,410
Why do you care?

526
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,010
Don't hide it. I saw it.

527
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:15,680
Come on.

528
00:39:16,426 --> 00:39:17,200
Let me take a look.

529
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,010
Just one look.

530
00:39:24,204 --> 00:39:25,370
It's a souvenir I bought.

531
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:26,970
What's it for?

532
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,200
A gift for my baby.

533
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:34,640
Let me see.

534
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,010
I have one, too.

535
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:49,120
When did you buy it?

536
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,450
There's seawater inside.

537
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:52,890
Let me see. Come on.

538
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,010
No. Go to bed.

539
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:56,560
- Come on.
- Yours is leaking.

540
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:57,970
Yours is leaking.

541
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:59,040
Sleep now. Shh.

542
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:06,970
Seawater?

543
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,370
That's a good idea.

544
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,370
Thank you.

545
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:05,680
Thank you.

546
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,810
Chairman.

547
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:11,026
Your passport, please.

548
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:17,600
It's warm here.

549
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,010
It's done, Chairman.

550
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:31,680
Mr. Han.

551
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:32,640
Here you go.

552
00:41:35,271 --> 00:41:36,480
- Let's go.
- Let's go, Dad.

553
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:40,410
Mr. Han.

554
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,560
I'm here.

555
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:45,040
Mr. Han,

556
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,970
while I was watching Miss Tang just now,

557
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,040
I accidentally saw

558
00:41:49,115 --> 00:41:50,240
Chairman and Mr. Yutian.

559
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,560
My dad and my brother?

560
00:41:53,804 --> 00:41:54,490
Where are they?

561
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:55,560
In the lobby.

562
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:57,770
Apparently, they're also
staying at this hotel.

563
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:04,240
Now I get why

564
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,410
Tang Xin moved here.

565
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:11,120
We'll have to be even more careful

566
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:12,410
when we go out from now on.

567
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:19,890
So the bigwig the informant mentioned

568
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,240
is Han Changzhou of Changzhou Group.

569
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,600
Do you know his room number?

570
00:42:26,693 --> 00:42:27,970
I followed them to the elevator.

571
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:29,080
They went to the 41st floor.

572
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,370
I didn't dare follow too closely,

573
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,640
so I don't know which room exactly.

574
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,370
Maybe

575
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:38,520
we should try our luck.
