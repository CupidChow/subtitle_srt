Tang Xin,

19
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,360
what do you want me to do?

20
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,410
I don't need you to do anything for me.

21
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,520
I just hope

22
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,440
you make the choice you truly want

23
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,130
and stay

24
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,600
where you want to be.

25
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,440
Front line.

26
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,850
But do you know

27
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,200
what you will face

28
00:02:17,648 --> 00:02:19,550
if you marry a soldier stationed
at the front?

29
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:20,970
I don't.

30
00:02:22,026 --> 00:02:23,530
I'll only find out after we're married.

31
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,810
But I do know this.

32
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,250
If you make this choice,

33
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,370
we both will regret it

34
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,004
one day.

35
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,970
Since we got together,

36
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,480
I've never asked anything of you.

37
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,250
All I want is an equal marriage.

38
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,970
And that doesn't mean
we hold each other back.

39
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,290
Instead, we love each other

40
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,071
while having our own pursuits.

41
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,290
But what if I insist on this choice?

42
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,690
Will you still marry me?

43
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,410
The man I want to marry

44
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,690
is not the person you are right now.

Jia's.

00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:19,840
Two days, I think.

97
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,400
Have them reshoot.

98
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,570
Don't.

99
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,760
How about I re-edit it?

100
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,760
No. Reshoot.

101
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,170
Hello, Mr. Tian?

102
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,320
Tang Xin, come to my office.

103
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,490
Tian called me. I'll head over.

104
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,720
Tell them now.

105
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:45,900
Mr. Tian.

106
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:46,900
Have a seat.

107
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,020
Here's the situation.

108
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,226
The Ministry of Public Security

109
00:06:51,248 --> 00:06:52,900
is in close cooperation with Interpol.

110
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,700
They found an important lead

111
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,220
from a wanted artifact smuggler.

112
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,020
What's it?

113
00:06:58,248 --> 00:06:59,869
The details haven't been released yet.

114
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,248
But the higher-ups held a meeting

115
00:07:01,248 --> 00:07:03,000
and informed
a few official media outlets

116
00:07:03,004 --> 00:07:04,360
to prepare coverage.

117
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,140
So we were notified to cover it?

118
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,820
No.

119
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,460
Then why did you call me?

120
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,900
I think

121
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,260
this case

122
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,380
might be related

123
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,820
to your earlier investigation

124
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:17,380
about the underwater article smuggling.

125
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,340
Looks like they're about to
wrap things up.

126
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,500
Don't you have any thoughts about it?

127
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,580
Are you suggesting

128
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,380
that I follow the case

129
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,580
as an embedded reporter?

130
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,460
You've followed this case for so long.

131
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,100
So much has happened.

132
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,580
The only thing is
whether you're still up to it.

133
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,020
Of course, I can understand
if you're not.

134
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,020
Tian,

135
00:07:39,115 --> 00:07:40,460
we've known each other for years.

136
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,660
It's no fun

137
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,900
to provoke me like that.

138
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,380
You said it yourself.

139
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,380
I've been on this case for so long.

140
00:07:46,715 --> 00:07:48,582
Of course, I want to see it through
to the end.

141
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,380
Good.

142
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,140
I'll request permission for you
to do embedded coverage.

143
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:56,940
This way.

144
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,580
My old friend.

145
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,900
How are you? How are you?

146
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,580
William, we met again.

147
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,940
Long time no see.

148
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,460
Thank you. Thank you.

149
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,020
Let me show you around.

150
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,100
We can talk on our way to the base.

151
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,700
He said you can talk on the way
to the base.

152
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,500
- Let's go.
- Sure.

153
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,820
There's a sentry here.

154
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,580
Oh yeah. We have several of them
around the island.

155
00:08:26,604 --> 00:08:28,100
There are many sentries around here.

156
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,380
Are they all soldiers?

157
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,420
Are they soldiers, Mr. William?

158
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,940
Not only soldiers.

159
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,860
All of them have
a special forces background.

160
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,580
They're retired from the special forces.

161
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,180
Cool.

162
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,300
Mom.

163
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,340
Mom, don't worry.

164
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,620
This is between me and Tang Xin.

165
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,860
We'll figure it out.

166
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,340
Let me take you out for a meal first.

167
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,620
You order a ride?

168
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,620
I can use this app.

169
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,740
Go check the bathroom.

170
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,580
See if we forgot anything.

171
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,220
Okay.

172
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,380
(Trip)

173
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,940
(My Trip)

174
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,220
Si.

175
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,460
Mom.

176
00:09:30,693 --> 00:09:32,693
We've packed everything.
Nothing left behind.

177
00:09:32,737 --> 00:09:33,340
All right.

178
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,700
I just remembered

179
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,460
that I haven't seen a friend of mine.

180
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,700
We can't have the meal together.

181
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,420
Let's meet at the airport, okay?

182
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,300
I should get going.

183
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:42,980
Mom.

184
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,220
Follow me.

185
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,940
Careful. This place is very secluded.

186
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,700
Very hard to notice.

187
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,420
Is this our base?

188
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,580
Are these two caves our residence?

189
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,220
Yes, exactly.

190
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,820
Boys.

191
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,220
Come in.

192
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,700
Satisfied?

193
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,340
Can't believe such a big cave
exists on this island.

194
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,060
Unbelievable.

195
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,580
I didn't expect to have

196
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,820
such a natural cave here.

197
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,820
Yeah.

198
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,580
Check this out.

199
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,820
William.

200
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,940
Is this what we pulled out

201
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,220
from the sea?

202
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,820
Is this what we pulled out

203
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,700
from the sea?

204
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,100
Come.

205
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,460
Good stuff

206
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,340
is here.

207
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,700
Good stuff is all here.

208
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,980
Just a second.

209
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,860
Alex.

210
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,740
Yes, boss?

211
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,580
Where's Johnson?

212
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,100
He took some guys out for training.

213
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,540
Okay.

214
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,580
Good?

215
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,340
Excuse me.

216
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,300
Can you tell me where Tang Xin lives?

217
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,100
Tang Xin?

218
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,937
Tang Xin's house...

219
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,700
Come here, Tang.

220
00:11:37,137 --> 00:11:38,300
Someone's here to see you.

221
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,460
Him?

222
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:39,820
Yes.

223
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,180
Sure. Thank you.

224
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,220
Thank you so much.

225
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:42,860
All right.

226
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,700
Hello,

227
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,100
you must be Tang Xin's father?

228
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,220
Yes, I am.

229
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,940
I'm Wu Si's mother.

230
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,980
Hello.

231
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,300
Hello.

232
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,100
Sorry for the trouble.

233
00:11:58,404 --> 00:11:59,540
Come have a seat at my house.

234
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,340
Sure. This way?

235
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,700
Captain.

236
00:12:07,604 --> 00:12:09,100
- What are you doing?
- Last time...

237
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,700
Still upset over what was said
the other day?

238
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,100
No, Brigadier.

239
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,820
I was just about to tell him

240
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,580
that I overreacted before.

241
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,460
It's fine.

242
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,740
You didn't say anything wrong.

243
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,740
That's more like it.

244
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,820
You've been comrades for years.

245
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,620
Sometimes,

246
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,220
the truth hurts.

247
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,700
They're not easy to hear.

248
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,740
It's better to see for yourselves.

249
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,940
That's

250
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,700
the next frigate.

251
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,220
Same formation,

252
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,940
same mission,

253
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,820
same route,

254
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,340
and same navy uniform.

255
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,860
New warships replace the old.

256
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,940
New soldiers take over the old.

257
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,940
That's what gives us the confidence

258
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,204
to sail boldly into the ocean
in the name of our country.

259
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,060
Now look across.

260
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,340
That's the city.

261
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,980
Our parents, families,
wives, and children

262
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:09,820
are all over there.

263
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,580
Just across the sea.

264
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,340
Warm homes and peace on that side.

265
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,300
Hush winds and humble meals
on this side.

266
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,180
You're all at an age
where you'd want to have fun

267
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,460
and explore.

268
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,540
But once you become a soldier,

269
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,300
the excitement of the outside world
leaves you.

270
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,580
Does it feel unfair?

271
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,220
Sir.

272
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,220
No, Sir.

273
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,700
Because we're here,

274
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,860
they get to enjoy peace.

275
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,860
They may not know

276
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,220
we're out here.

277
00:13:39,648 --> 00:13:40,750
Don't you think it's unfair?

278
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,940
No, Sir.

279
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,700
Because we know

280
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,620
we're here,

281
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,340
and I know I'll always be here.

282
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,540
Captain Tang,

283
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,460
do you remember,

284
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,820
back in 1999

285
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,220
on the dock

286
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,180
when I went to identify
Wu Si's father's body?

287
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,820
I went to your ship that day.

288
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,100
I didn't expect the boy

289
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,820
to secretly follow me.

290
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,700
He must've been shocked.

291
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,980
He started running a fever
when we got home.

292
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,700
He cried in his sleep.

293
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,420
Everything happened too suddenly.

294
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,100
He was too young then.

295
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,340
That's why

296
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,100
he never really got over it.

297
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,940
All these years,

298
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,740
I've always hoped

299
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,700
that someone could stay by Wu Si's side.

300
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,620
I never thought

301
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,820
his girlfriend would be your daughter.

302
00:14:45,026 --> 00:14:46,220
I actually met with Tang Xin

303
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,340
a few days ago.

304
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,340
She's really a good kid.

305
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,300
She didn't say a single bad word

306
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,820
about Wu Si.

307
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,540
I'm truly grateful to her

308
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,300
for being tolerant of Wu Si.

309
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,540
Well,

310
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,100
I'm also a soldier.

311
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,580
I understand how Wu Si thinks.

312
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,340
And I understand how my daughter thinks.

313
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,620
It's simple, really.

314
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,220
They both stick to their own views,

315
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,060
but deep down,

316
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,620
they're doing it for each other.

317
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,489
Yes, right.

318
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,580
They're just being stubborn

319
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,100
- Exactly.
- and got on the wrong path.

320
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,300
But if they keep on going,

321
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,980
- they'll find their way back again.
- Yes.

322
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,460
What couple doesn't go through
twists and turns?

323
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,620
Hearing you say this, I feel relieved.

324
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,700
Captain Tang, I live far away,

325
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,100
so I'm leaving Wu Si in your care.

326
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,300
I've always seen him as my own son.

327
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,700
Thank you so much.

328
00:15:39,826 --> 00:15:41,515
Your training results are impressive.

329
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:43,620
I heard you ranked first
in several events.

330
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,180
What are you smiling about?

331
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:49,204
Do you know why
you were transferred back?

332
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,620
No, I don't, Sir.

333
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,180
Wang Chen has been reassigned

334
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,580
as an instructor at the training base.

335
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,220
Cheng Yuan retired.

336
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,700
Zong Qing is busy training his squad.

337
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,180
With Wang Chen gone,

338
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,220
you're the person closest to Wu Si.

339
00:16:09,937 --> 00:16:10,940
You were transferred back

340
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,740
to help him support Blue Blade.

341
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,860
Brigadier, where's Captain Wu going?

342
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,100
He has other concerns.

343
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,940
Then why is Captain Chen leaving?

344
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,580
She made a good recovery.

345
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,540
Reassignments are decisions from above.

346
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,820
Does that need your approval?

347
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,340
No, Sir.

348
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,940
They looked after you for almost a year.

349
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,700
It's time you stood on your own.

350
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,300
Brigadier,

351
00:16:40,471 --> 00:16:42,160
I'm afraid I won't be good enough.

352
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,340
Look me in the eye.

353
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,220
How old are you?

354
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,820
Sir, twenty.

355
00:16:50,071 --> 00:16:51,515
When Captain Wu was twenty,

356
00:16:51,515 --> 00:16:53,690
he applied for the military school
and became an officer.

357
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:54,700
When Zong Qing was twenty,

358
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,100
he competed abroad for his university.

359
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,700
When Cheng Yuan was twenty,

360
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,060
he was selected for
an international sniper contest

361
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:03,300
and was the first to bring back
Tai'e Sword.

362
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,860
When I first joined Blue Blade,

363
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,660
I wasn't much older than you.

364
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,300
Back then,

365
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,260
you were the youngest in the squad.

366
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,420
They protected you
like a younger brother.

367
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,980
But they can't protect you forever.

368
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,620
It's only natural for soldiers
to follow orders.

369
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,300
From now on,

370
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,860
you're a sniper
on Blue Blade's front line.

371
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,100
Understand?

372
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,180
Yes, Sir.

373
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,180
These two tents, I prepared them

374
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,620
especially for you.

375
00:17:36,137 --> 00:17:36,860
These two tents

376
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,580
are especially prepared for you.

377
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,060
I want to apologize
for the conditions, but

378
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,580
this is the best we could do
on this island.

379
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,740
This is the best we could do
on this island.

380
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,100
William, you're very thoughtful.

381
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,140
Thank you.

382
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,860
My friend. Always.

383
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,380
William.

384
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,260
Johnson, come here.

385
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,980
I thought you were training.

386
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,180
As they said, here they are.

387
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,820
I heard a guest
who came to visit our island.

388
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,580
Let me introduce you.
This is Mr. Han Changzhou.

389
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,100
He's your real boss.

390
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,100
Pleased to meet you, Sir.

391
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,180
How are you?

392
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,980
My name is Johnson.

393
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,860
I'm the security officer here,
waiting for your instructions.

394
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,500
This is the security officer
on the island,

395
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,180
Johnson.

396
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,660
Very good.

397
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,580
I've seen it along the way.

398
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,860
Well done

399
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,820
for your security work.

400
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,580
I've seen it along the way.

401
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,660
Well done for your security work.

402
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,260
Appreciate.

403
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,980
I think you've done too much

404
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,340
on such a desolate island.

405
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,580
Mr. Johnson,

406
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,580
I think you've done too much
on such a desolate island.

407
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,100
I get paid for this. I do my best.

408
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,060
They're paid to be stationed
on this island,

409
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,180
so they're doing their best.

410
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,820
- Good.
- Okay.

411
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,580
Dad.

412
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:04,860
You're back.

413
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,480
It's late. Why are you still up?

414
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,580
What are you doing here?

415
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,580
I met Wu Si's mom today.

416
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:25,820
What did you two

417
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,380
talk about?

418
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,780
What else would we talk about
at this age?

419
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,180
We talked about our kids,

420
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,100
about the past,

421
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,260
and about

422
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,580
the year 1999.

423
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,820
We actually met once

424
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,380
at the dock.

425
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,020
It was because of Wu Si's dad?

426
00:19:53,871 --> 00:19:55,100
A woman raising a child alone.

427
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,300
It's not easy.

428
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,420
I asked your mom

429
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,140
to go talk to Wu Si's mom.

430
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:02,380
But

431
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,100
she was the one who got scared.

432
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,580
A kid was calmer than her.

433
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,620
That...

434
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,100
That boy was...

435
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,660
Yes.

436
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,100
Who are you?

437
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,660
Don't look. Kids shouldn't see that.

438
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,300
Dad.

439
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,580
So Wu Si and I

440
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,820
knew each other long ago.

441
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,100
It's fate.

442
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,540
Don't you have anything to ask?

443
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,100
Yi Nanwang.

444
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,620
Have you ever imagined

445
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,260
what it would be like

446
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:43,900
to have a family?

447
00:21:48,137 --> 00:21:50,060
Sergeant Cheng asked me
the same question.

448
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,740
He asked me

449
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,300
if I'd leave the military
once I had a family...

450
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,260
What did you say?

451
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,580
I said

452
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,580
I'll stay in the army

453
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,820
until I can't run,

454
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,740
jump, or move anymore.

455
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,537
Only then will I think about
getting married.

456
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,340
Captain Wu.

457
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,580
Are you leaving Blue Blade, too?

458
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,060
I know you won't tell me.

459
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,100
Just like Captain Chen.

460
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,580
She never came to see me

461
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:51,820
after she got back.

462
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,900
That's only because
she didn't know you were back.

463
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,160
If she had known,
she definitely would've come to see you.

464
00:22:59,137 --> 00:23:00,580
I don't want Sergeant Cheng to leave.

465
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,500
I don't want Captain Chen to leave.

466
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,271
And I especially don't want you
to leave.

467
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,900
But I know

468
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,500
you're right.

469
00:23:23,337 --> 00:23:24,500
I'm doing the right thing?

470
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,580
Captain Wu.

471
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,900
If you leave Blue Blade,

472
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,340
we'll lose a great captain.

473
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,900
But

474
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,820
there'll be another good husband

475
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,300
and good father.

476
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,300
Don't worry about me.

477
00:23:52,671 --> 00:23:53,820
I promised Sergeant Cheng.

478
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,260
I'll guard Blue Blade for all of you.

479
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,580
He told me

480
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,740
to become the best sniper.

481
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,820
Until I do,

482
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,820
I won't go anywhere.

483
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:20,060
(Counseling Room)

484
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,140
Brigadier.

485
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,820
Finally done?

486
00:24:28,493 --> 00:24:30,580
You've finally let go of that burden,
haven't you?

487
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:33,150
I know you were doing
what's best for me.

488
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,500
What's your next move?

489
00:24:37,471 --> 00:24:38,980
I want to apply to return to the army.

490
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,580
And after that?

491
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,500
Watching you hesitate is frustrating.

492
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,300
Brigadier.

493
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,660
If you were me...

494
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,100
What would I choose?

495
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,340
Stay or get reassigned?

496
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:57,980
Am I right?

497
00:25:00,004 --> 00:25:02,360
That's the big question
you've been hesitating to ask?

498
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,580
I've told you before.

499
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,980
A soldier goes where he's needed.

500
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,540
Which is why

501
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,980
I haven't approved your application.

502
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,020
Understood.

503
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,820
What brings you here, Mr. Tian?

504
00:25:19,004 --> 00:25:20,909
After my repeated persuasion,

505
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,420
the higher-ups have fully considered

506
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,100
your contribution to the case,

507
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,860
and they've agreed to grant your wish.

508
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,860
You'll get to witness the conclusion
of this investigation.

509
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,100
Am I hearing this right, Mr. Tian?

510
00:25:32,404 --> 00:25:33,340
Thank you, Mr. Tian.

511
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,820
I'm not done yet.

512
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,900
Tomorrow, you must gather

513
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,820
at the designated time and location.

514
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,340
Got it.

515
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,420
Hurry home and get ready.

516
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,100
All right.

517
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,900
Why aren't you eating?

518
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,537
Having a date with the noodles?

519
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,060
I don't feel like eating.

520
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,380
As I live and breathe.

521
00:26:07,515 --> 00:26:09,380
Yi Nanwang says
he doesn't feel like eating.

522
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,100
Back then,

523
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,180
everyone used to fight over food.

524
00:26:14,582 --> 00:26:16,604
You'd take from me,
and I'd take from you.

525
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,420
Now?

526
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,060
It's no more fun.

527
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,580
Fine.

528
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,340
I'll force myself

529
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,740
to steal one from you, is that okay?

530
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,580
- Come on.
- I'll take one, too.

531
00:26:34,582 --> 00:26:35,648
Are you really not eating?

532
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,140
Take more.

533
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,100
He's not eating.

534
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,300
Come on.

535
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,300
It's not like you at all.

536
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,580
Don't take everything.

537
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,100
You can't tell I was joking?

538
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,820
You take it all.
What's left for him then?

539
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,660
Air?

540
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,420
He's still growing. Come on.

541
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,420
Eat some meat. Get some protein. Meat.

542
00:26:49,493 --> 00:26:50,340
Have some lean meat.

543
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,740
Come on.

544
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,420
Take this.

545
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,660
Here. Take this.

546
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,820
Happy now?

547
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,100
Eat up.

548
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,100
Didn't bring any wine here?

549
00:27:07,982 --> 00:27:09,140
I'll bring some next time.

550
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,820
It's boring in here.

551
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:16,100
Boss, we found another sunken ship.

552
00:27:16,337 --> 00:27:19,004
It's believed to be a merchant ship
from the Southern Song Dynasty.

553
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,140
But

554
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,340
most of it is buried under mud and sand.

555
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,820
We'll need to clear it
before pulling it out.

556
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,300
What makes you think

557
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,900
it's from the Southern Song?

558
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,660
We measured the ship.

559
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,420
24.2 meters long.

560
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,900
9.15 meters wide.

561
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,048
It matches the size
of the Fujian-ship Type

562
00:27:41,048 --> 00:27:43,180
from the late Southern Song.

563
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,140
Where is it located?

564
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,340
In Chinese territorial waters.

565
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,820
But because of

566
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,780
the Dayan Reef sunken ship incident,

567
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,820
the coast guard stepped up patrols.

568
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,140
That's why

569
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,340
I came here to ask you

570
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,620
whether we should proceed.

571
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,580
That's what we do for a living.

572
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,820
That's what we do for a living.

573
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,820
Such a big boat.

574
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,180
That must be tons of good stuff inside.

575
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,820
Of course, we need to dig it up
as soon as possible.

576
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,340
Such a big boat.

577
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,060
That must be tons of good stuff inside.

578
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:21,271
Of course, we need to dig it up
as soon as possible.

579
00:28:29,871 --> 00:28:30,900
Here's what we'll do.

580
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,580
After clearing off the mud and sand,

581
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,380
proceed as usual.

582
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:37,660
Got it.

583
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,380
I'll arrange it right away.

584
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,100
Bear this in mind.

585
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,100
Once you recover a batch,

586
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,580
send it here immediately.

587
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,340
All right.

588
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,100
Yes!

589
00:29:01,804 --> 00:29:02,740
Deputy Commander Liu,

590
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,180
take the two Interpol officers
to the tent to rest.

591
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:06,900
Yes, Sir.

592
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,180
This way, please.

593
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,180
Director,

594
00:29:26,048 --> 00:29:28,100
the situation on the island
is much more complicated

595
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,140
than we expected.

596
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,740
Now we're understaffed.

597
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,140
Han Changzhou and William

598
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,820
clearly invested heavily.

599
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,060
They hired mercenaries
to guard the island.

600
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,900
How many mercenaries

601
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,100
do you estimate there are?

602
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,980
Based on the drone footage sent back,

603
00:29:45,293 --> 00:29:47,048
there are sentry posts around the island

604
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,900
and signs of mercenary movement
in the rainforest.

605
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,380
There are also two caves.

606
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,580
There are probably a lot of them.

607
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,100
Director Qu,

608
00:29:55,626 --> 00:29:56,693
we're not specialized in

609
00:29:56,693 --> 00:29:58,420
naval operations
and island reconnaissance.

610
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,540
Can you request

611
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,660
reinforcements

612
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,980
from the higher-ups?

613
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,100
I'll request it right away.

614
00:30:54,715 --> 00:30:56,060
(Chinese Navy)
We've just received

615
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,760
a joint operation request
from the Public Security.

616
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,180
We've been ordered to carry out
a combat mission on an island.

617
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:00,980
This operation

618
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,780
will be commanded
by the Public Security.

619
00:31:03,137 --> 00:31:05,340
We and the SWAT
have been assigned separate tasks

620
00:31:05,804 --> 00:31:07,604
and will carry out our own
operational plans

621
00:31:07,604 --> 00:31:09,340
to capture the illegal salvage gang.

622
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,340
Understood?

623
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,380
Fei.

624
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,300
Hello.

625
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,540
It's been a long while.

626
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,340
I've brought them over.

627
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,540
Help make some arrangements.

628
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,300
Sure. No problem.

629
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,020
Only you from your unit?

630
00:31:38,293 --> 00:31:39,020
What about you?

631
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,860
Me too.

632
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,300
Who are they?

633
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,300
Hi, we're reporters from Minghua News.

634
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,100
I'm Tan Hai.

635
00:31:44,204 --> 00:31:46,560
Chief Editor of New Perspective,
Minghua News, Tang Xin.

636
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,500
Jian Ao.

637
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:48,860
Jia Nan.

638
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,620
Nice to meet you.

639
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,860
Reporters, right this way.

640
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:52,900
Let's go.

641
00:31:53,315 --> 00:31:54,780
The dining hall is on the third floor.

642
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,910
Suit yourself.

643
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:56,982
Sure. Thank you.

644
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,780
Officer Chen.

645
00:31:59,140 --> 00:31:59,780
Yes.

646
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,300
Miss Tang?

647
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,100
I want to know

648
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,020
when we'll be able to go to the island.

649
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,582
I'm not sure about the details.

650
00:32:05,604 --> 00:32:07,580
We'll have to wait for instructions
from above.

651
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,780
So we'll be staying here
for a few days?

652
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,900
Yes, a few days.

653
00:32:11,404 --> 00:32:13,060
We'll let you know the exact time later.

654
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,448
Let's go rest in our rooms first.

655
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,540
All right. Let's go.

656
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,580
Comrades.

657
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,900
I'm Qu Gang,
Director of Public Security in Wenzhou.

658
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,140
This is Deputy Commander Liu from SWAT.

659
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,140
And these two are from Interpol,

660
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,140
Thomas and Peter.

661
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,860
I believe you have a general idea

662
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,860
of why you're here.

663
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,380
I've reviewed
the drone surveillance footage.

664
00:32:37,448 --> 00:32:38,860
Please assign the mission, Director.

665
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,780
Not so fast.

666
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,380
Before we launch the operation,

667
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,900
we need to send someone
for reconnaissance on the island.

668
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,900
First, we must get the rough idea
of the number of mercenaries,

669
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,540
their positions,

670
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,780
and whether they're armed.

671
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,300
Leave the island reconnaissance

672
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,100
to the Blue Blade Special Ops Team.

673
00:32:55,404 --> 00:32:57,048
Then I'll take you up on that offer.

674
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,540
Based on the drone images,

675
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,780
here's a hand-drawn map
of the island's terrain.

676
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,540
Please take a look.

677
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,780
Here and here.

678
00:33:09,871 --> 00:33:11,380
There's a sentry post at each location.

679
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,780
Each post

680
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,340
is manned by two mercenaries.

681
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,540
Captain Wu,

682
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,100
this reconnaissance mission

683
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,020
is very important.

684
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,300
Our scouts

685
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,020
must infiltrate the island
without alerting them.

686
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:25,660
Understood.

687
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,260
We'll move tonight.

688
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:28,140
Underwater infiltration

689
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,448
to sneak into the enemy base.

690
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,860
When did you get back?

691
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,300
I waited so long that I fell asleep.

692
00:33:54,471 --> 00:33:55,779
I'll go fix you something to eat.

693
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,580
No need, Mom.

694
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,380
I'm not hungry.

695
00:34:00,026 --> 00:34:02,020
I just want to lie here
with you for a bit.

696
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,260
Sure.

697
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,260
Come.

698
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,140
Here's the blanket.

699
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,660
It's been a long time
since you clung to me like this.

700
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,100
Ever since you got married,

701
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,580
you've always talked about Zong Qing.

702
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,100
You haven't acted like this for so long.

703
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,660
Things were better before.

704
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,980
Carefree.

705
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,900
Whenever something happened,

706
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,580
I could just run to you and Dad,
and it'd all be fine.

707
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,180
Growing up is exhausting.

708
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,500
Marriage is exhausting.

709
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,180
Being a military wife is exhausting.

710
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,460
Being a doctor is also exhausting.

711
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,180
I remember

712
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,900
when I was pregnant with you,

713
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,700
the doctor said my endometrium
was too thick,

714
00:35:00,315 --> 00:35:02,337
and I might not be able
to carry the baby.

715
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,780
I was told to stay in bed rest.

716
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,900
But your dad

717
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,100
was always away on missions.

718
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,660
My parents

719
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,580
lived far away.

720
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,180
I had to do everything myself
with a big belly,

721
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:20,100
running around.

722
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,460
I handled everything

723
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,660
on my own.

724
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,300
Later, the unit sent help.

725
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,140
They assigned a young soldier.

726
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,900
He helped around the house.

727
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:38,500
But how could I ask him

728
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,900
when I went for prenatal check-ups?

729
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:45,420
One day, when I was
walking down the stairs,

730
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,100
I lost my footing

731
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,660
and fell.

732
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,380
Blood started running down

733
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,300
my legs.

734
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,580
I was terrified.

735
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,580
I thought

736
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,940
I'd lost the baby.

737
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,900
I was so scared.

738
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,460
But look,

739
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,300
here you are, safe and sound.

740
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,300
When I saw you for the first time

741
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,900
in the delivery room,
I thought to myself...

742
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,220
"My little princess

743
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,420
is the bravest girl

744
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,500
in the world.

745
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,620
You went through so much
just to come into my life.

746
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,780
I had to be brave,

747
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,780
take great care of you,

748
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,580
love you,

749
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,660
and give you the best life.

750
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,140
I'd do everything in my power

751
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,500
to make you happy."

752
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,660
Mom.

753
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,380
You and Dad

754
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,900
have already protected me so well.

755
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,780
Thank you.

756
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,580
Silly girl,

757
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,980
why are you thanking us?

758
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,460
Actually, deep down,

759
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,060
I really wish
you didn't have to grow up.

760
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:23,420
But becoming independent
and starting a family

761
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,140
is a process in life.

762
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,900
Starting a family isn't hard.

763
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,700
What's hard is

764
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,420
keeping it together

765
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,660
with great confidence.

766
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,500
Honestly, my life

767
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,900
hasn't been smooth either.

768
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,980
But with you

769
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,300
and your dad,

770
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,060
no matter how tough or tiring life is,

771
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,980
it still feels sweet.

772
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,620
I also hope

773
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,382
you and Zong Qing can be like that.

774
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,060
Zong Qing is a good man.

775
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,420
As a soldier,

776
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,620
he's done

777
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,380
the best

778
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,100
he possibly could.

779
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,580
You didn't choose wrong.

780
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,420
I know.

781
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,220
If our roles were switched,

782
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,900
I probably couldn't have done
any better than he.

783
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,140
Your dad's generation of soldiers

784
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,100
grew up alongside

785
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,580
the Navy.

786
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:35,940
I also grew alongside them
as a military wife.

787
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,500
But your generation

788
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,060
is different from ours.

789
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,900
You'll only get better from here.

790
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,100
Always think on the bright side.

791
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,300
Things will slowly improve.

792
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,420
It's the first time

793
00:39:42,626 --> 00:39:44,060
I've tasted such a special red wine.

794
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:44,980
Where is it from?

795
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,100
It's the first time
I've tasted such a special red wine.

796
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,140
Where is it from?

797
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,380
You can't buy this in the market.

798
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,700
A friend of mine has his own winery.

799
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,780
He said his friend made this.

800
00:39:57,826 --> 00:39:59,093
It can't be found on the market.

801
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:02,420
He gives it only
to his best friends and clients.

802
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:05,140
And every year,
you can get only one box.

803
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,220
It's only for his clients and friends.

804
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,940
And everyone gets only one box
each year.

805
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,380
William, this is good of you.

806
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,100
Looks like both my son and I

807
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,980
are so lucky to taste it.

808
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,980
It's our honor to taste it.

809
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,460
You two sneak in through the woods.

810
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,140
We'll cover you from here.
Stay safe.

811
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,420
Don't worry.

812
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,620
You know? When I found out
you were coming,

813
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,300
I put in some effort,

814
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,900
and I managed to exchange
one of my relics

815
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,660
for ten boxes of this wine.

816
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,060
So drink.

817
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,420
When he found out you were coming,

818
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,580
he exchanged one of his relics

819
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,620
for ten boxes of this wine.

820
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,620
That's truly precious.

821
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,500
For the sake of Mr. William's kindness,

822
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,100
we must offer you a toast.

823
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,580
Cheers.

824
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,500
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
