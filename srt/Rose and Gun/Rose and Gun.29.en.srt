18
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,440
All units, prepare for action.

19
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,080
- Copy.
- Copy that.

20
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,850
Move out.

21
00:03:12,248 --> 00:03:14,820
Captain Zong, we've searched everywhere.
No sign of the commander.

22
00:03:14,826 --> 00:03:17,090
The number of vehicles doesn't match.
No sign of 001.

23
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:17,960
Spread out and search.

24
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:18,604
Yes, Sir.

25
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,570
They're surrounding us.

26
00:03:23,293 --> 00:03:24,250
Seize the vehicles.

27
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,360
- Retreat!
- Yes, Sir.

28
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,250
Captain Zong, we're running out of time.

29
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,640
By noon tomorrow, it'll be 48 hours.

30
00:03:47,871 --> 00:03:49,640
They're probably
all hunting us down by now.

31
00:03:50,137 --> 00:03:51,404
Let's ditch the vehicles.

32
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,570
Captain Zong.

33
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,400
That drone has been scouting forever

34
00:04:22,493 --> 00:04:24,150
and still no sign
of the command vehicle.

35
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,080
We're running out of time.

36
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,930
Stay calm.

37
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,130
The island is huge
and densely jungle-covered.

38
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,170
We should still have time.

39
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,170
Hey, soldier.

40
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,370
It's time. I need my medicine.

41
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,010
Shut up.

42
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,170
Squad Leader.

43
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,930
He needs them. His life depends on it.

44
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,400
Two pills.

45
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,200
Can I get some water to swallow these?

46
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:53,840
Captain Zong.

47
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,130
Good news.

48
00:05:55,782 --> 00:05:58,182
Captain Wu and Dai Wei broke free
from Blue Team's control

49
00:05:58,182 --> 00:05:59,650
and sent us a new set of coordinates.

50
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:03,769
They're closing in

51
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,130
on Blue Team's commander.

52
00:06:05,182 --> 00:06:07,350
They want us to regroup with them
as fast as possible.

53
00:06:07,471 --> 00:06:08,950
How far are the coordinates from here?

54
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,840
A forced march of 20 kilometers.

55
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,610
Move out.

56
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,320
Yes, Sir.

57
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,130
Thanks for the birthday present,
Yangyang.

58
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,250
If you've got nothing to do,

59
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,400
go out and take a walk.

60
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,250
You don't have to stay home.

61
00:06:52,893 --> 00:06:53,690
What do you want?

62
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,320
My birthday present.

63
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,610
Didn't get you one.

64
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,130
You're too old for birthday presents.

65
00:06:59,382 --> 00:07:01,170
Now that I'm grown up,
I expect a big present.

66
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,610
I don't want a small one.

67
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,880
Your father's saving all your presents

68
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,400
for his future grandchildren now.

69
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,610
No more for you.

70
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,010
Not yet.

71
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,610
Here.

72
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,010
Let me take this call.

73
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,570
Talk to me, Hai.

74
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,760
Xin,

75
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,610
lucky you weren't at the office today.

76
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,610
Why?

77
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,640
Mr. Han sent you

78
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,690
a big, big gift.

79
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,690
You're famous now.

80
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,250
What did he send me?

81
00:07:30,404 --> 00:07:33,080
Mr. Han sent over a full set
of photography equipment in his own name

82
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,170
to celebrate your birthday.

83
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,080
And you accepted it?

84
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,760
We had to.
It was all dropped off at the reception.

85
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,570
All right. I got it.

86
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:47,840
Who's Mr. Han?

87
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,400
Just a friend.

88
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,520
A friend sent you
expensive presents, huh?

89
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,050
He's into you.

90
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,570
No, he's not.

91
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,490
Xin.

92
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,010
Wu Si is away on exercises.

93
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,382
You ought to be more mindful

94
00:08:03,404 --> 00:08:05,050
of your social circle.

95
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,080
Mom, Dad, I swear.

96
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,400
We're just friends.

97
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
Nothing more.

98
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,370
Never will be.

99
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,880
We're not worried.

100
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,760
But you should make Wu Si feel secure.

101
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,080
That's right. Wu Si trusts you.

102
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,080
But others don't know the full story.

103
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,115
If rumors spread,

104
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,289
it won't reflect well on you.

105
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,448
Okay, okay.

106
00:08:26,448 --> 00:08:27,610
Dad. Mom.

107
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,370
That's enough.

108
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,280
He's not as petty as you think.

109
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,400
Come on. It's time for the next part.

110
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,490
- Okay.
- Okay.

111
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,490
Make a wish and blow out the candle.

112
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,060
Captain Zong,
Captain and Dai Wei are in position.

113
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,160
Move out!

114
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
Blue Team's commander has been spotted.

115
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,400
Do not move.

116
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,450
Chief.

117
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,370
Sorry, Sir.

118
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,680
You've been captured.

119
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,330
Attention.

120
00:10:23,604 --> 00:10:25,848
Blue Blade Special Ops Team has
taken out the leadership.

121
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,560
Order all squads to advance

122
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,280
toward L Island at once.

123
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,160

Mr. Han, what brings you here today?

132
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,330
I came

133
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,680
because I have something very important

134
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,210
to share with you.

135
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,490
Something so important

136
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,210
you couldn't say it over the phone?

137
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,400
It feels

138
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,730
more sincere to tell you in person.

139
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,250
Go ahead.

140
00:11:34,471 --> 00:11:36,450
Changzhou Group has completed
its restructuring.

141
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,850
I've been appointed Chairman

142
00:11:40,093 --> 00:11:41,850
and will oversee
all business operations.

143
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,920
That is important news.

144
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,760
There's one more thing.

145
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,800
No matter

146
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,160
what difficulties you face
in the future,

147
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,610
I hope you will always feel free

148
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,160
to reach out to me for help,

149
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,280
just like before.

150
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,250
Thank you. I appreciate it.

151
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,640
I just wanted to ask.

152
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,680
Now that you've taken over Changzhou,

153
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,610
what about your father and brother?

154
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,640
They've both

155
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,880
stepped back.

156
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,450
You'll soon see a completely clean

157
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,280
and transparent Changzhou Group.

158
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,800
I won't allow

159
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,560
a speck

160
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,370
of corruption.

161
00:12:35,515 --> 00:12:36,490
Please believe me.

162
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,800
Right dress.

163
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,210
Eyes front.

164
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:06,330
At ease.

165
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,560
Attention.

166
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,210
Chief.

167
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,850
Our forces have taken L Island.

168
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,026
Blue Blade Special Ops Team First Squad
has regrouped.

169
00:13:16,026 --> 00:13:17,093
Everyone accounted for.

170
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,280
Awaiting new orders, Chief.

171
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:19,970
Good work, all of you.

172
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,850
Take a good rest,

173
00:13:22,026 --> 00:13:22,920
but remain on standby.

174
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,210
Yes, Sir.

175
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,400
Sir.

176
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,250
Speak.

177
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,130
Chief.

178
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,160
Two marines on exercise duty

179
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,970
were attacked at D Island
by unidentified armed individuals.

180
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,010
After brief contact, they withdrew.

181
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,730
HQ has ordered us to shift
to Level One combat readiness

182
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:46,040
and to dispatch a team
to the island for investigation.

183
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,450
Engagement is authorized if necessary.

184
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,610
I wanted you to get some rest,

185
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,560
but a sudden situation has come up.

186
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,280
This mission to root out
separatist elements

187
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,330
is significantly more dangerous
than the recent exercise.

188
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,680
Can you handle it?

189
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:09,693
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir!

190
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:31,880
Captain.

191
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,850
We've contacted Command Headquarters.

192
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,210
Satellite positioning indicates

193
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,130
the rendezvous point is here.

194
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:42,680
We'll head out along this trail.

195
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,760
Yes, Sir.

196
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:05,330
I've prepared enough for everyone.

197
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,680
Congratulations on your marriage.

198
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,730
- Share the joy.
- Chen Yue. What about me?

199
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,370
Here you go.

200
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,693
- Chen Yue.
- Congratulations!

201
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,010
Tang Xin, you're back.

202
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,210
Give me a second.

203
00:15:14,826 --> 00:15:15,880
Back from your honeymoon?

204
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,010
Wedding sweets for you.

205
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,800
When did you get married?
I didn't even know.

206
00:15:19,982 --> 00:15:21,040
You're so busy all the time.

207
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,448
How can you keep up with everything?
Last month, on the 19th.

208
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,730
Did you handle the wedding

209
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,330
and banquet yourself

210
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,760
or hire a planning company?

211
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,040
Of course, I hired a company.

212
00:15:30,071 --> 00:15:31,550
Way too much trouble to do it yourself.

213
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,490
Even with that,
I was completely wiped out.

214
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,400
Which company did you use?

215
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,210
How was the service?

216
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,026
Were you satisfied?

217
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,850
Why? Are you getting married soon?

218
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,560
Not that soon.

219
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,640
Just asking.

220
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,560
My advice?

221
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,730
Start planning early.

222
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,450
The company I used was quite good.

223
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,680
I'll send you their contact later.
You can check them out.

224
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,400
Sure.

225
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,730
I'll get busy.

226
00:15:51,782 --> 00:15:52,950
- Thanks for this.
- See you.

227
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,970
Who hasn't gotten
the wedding sweets yet?

228
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,450
Me!

229
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:06,930
Get in position.

230
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:15,840
I'm in position.

231
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,840
Cheng Yuan is in position.

232
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,120
All in position.

233
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,320
Move out.

234
00:18:59,337 --> 00:19:00,560
Proceed to the target location.

235
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,280
Don't move!

236
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,650
Come on!

237
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:39,560
Captain!

238
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,600
Captain!

239
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,010
Stop!

240
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,890
There's my blood on the knife.

241
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,760
I have HIV.

242
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:19,320
Hello,
is this the wedding planning company?

243
00:23:11,471 --> 00:23:14,600
(Captain Zong. The doctor says the critical window
for taking post-exposure medication)

244
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,471
(HIV Antibody Test Submission Form)
(is 72 hours.)

245
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,970
(During that time, you need)

246
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,530
(to keep a safe distance from others.)

247
00:23:19,537 --> 00:23:22,250
(The hospital will notify the brigade
as soon as the results are in.)

248
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,840
(Understood.)

249
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,040
(Thank you, Officer Wang.)

250
00:23:26,737 --> 00:23:28,450
(If you've got something to do,
go ahead.)

251
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,537
(I want to be alone for a bit.)

252
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,500
(I just need to get this tube
into his airway like a snake...)

253
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,320
Mom.

254
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,460
Yangyang.

255
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,020
Have you eaten yet?

256
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,380
I'm eating now.

257
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,220
Why so late again?

258
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,020
We had an emergency surgery today,

259
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,380
so I got off late.

260
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,940
You really need

261
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,620
to get your routine together.

262
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,220
I've told you.

263
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,620
With Zong Qing not at home,
you should just move back in.

264
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,140
Your dad and I

265
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,220
have nothing better

266
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,460
to do anyway.

267
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,100
It'd be so lively if you came back.

268
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,220
I can talk to you.

269
00:24:16,293 --> 00:24:18,220
It's better than looking
at your dad's face.

270
00:24:18,426 --> 00:24:20,140
Well,
our place is closer to the hospital.

271
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,620
I save time on my commute.

272
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,140
How's work at the hospital?

273
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,860
Are you adjusting well?

274
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,220
I'm fine.

275
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,140
You and Dad don't need to worry.

276
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,460
Just eat well,

277
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,860
watch some TV,

278
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,140
and try not to fight.

279
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,860
I'll try

280
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,300
to come by early on the weekend.

281
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,980
(Dr. Wan, Anesthesiology Department)

282
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,380
I have to go, Mom.
Got another case. Bye.

283
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,420
(Dr. Wan, Anesthesiology Department)

284
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,020
Yes, Dr. Wan?

285
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,620
Bed 21, epidural anesthesia.

286
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,871
Can you get here in 30 minutes?

287
00:24:51,893 --> 00:24:52,780
I'll be right there.

288
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,537
(Live Surgery Stream #99.)

289
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,860
He's mostly out of danger,

290
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,380
but still needs observation.

291
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,140
Qiu Xiao.

292
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,220
I want the truth.

293
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,380
The truth is

294
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,140
we did everything we could.

295
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,220
We removed

296
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,620
five fragments of varying depth
from his brain,

297
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:50,940
but...

298
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,140
But two small fragments
are still inside.

299
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,540
Those fragments
will compress the optic nerve

300
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,380
and cause gradual vision loss

301
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,380
until it's severed.

302
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,140
You're doctors.

303
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,620
There has to be a way, right?

304
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,860
The optic nerve is part
of the central nervous system.

305
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,020
Once it's severed, it can't be repaired.

306
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,700
The blood vessels there
are thinner than hair.

307
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,460
It's impossible to stitch them.

308
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,340
Not to mention the risk of rejection.

309
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,100
Hello?

310
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,860
It's me.

311
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,140
Zong Qing.

312
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,460
What took you so long to pick up?

313
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,020
Emergency surgery tonight.

314
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,248
Just finished and heading home.

315
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,140
What's wrong?

316
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,220
Nothing. I just wanted to check on you.

317
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,020
I miss you.

318
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,380
I'm doing fine.

319
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,020
When are you coming back?

320
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,620
I miss you so much.

321
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:41,860
Soon.

322
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,140
Our brigade won the exercise this time.

323
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,540
Really?

324
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,380
That's amazing!

325
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,460
Everyone's okay,

326
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,460
right?

327
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,940
No one got hurt?

328
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,700
Zong Qing?

329
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,380
Um, we're about to regroup.

330
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,220
I'll hang up now.

331
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,620
Wait!

332
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:11,940
I'm listening.

333
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,380
Take care of yourself.

334
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,620
Come back soon.

335
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,860
I'll be waiting.

336
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,140
Got it.

337
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,780
Don't worry. Sleep early.

338
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,100
Good night.

339
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:54,860
Tang Xin.

340
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,100
What...

341
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,220
Dad, Mom...

342
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,182
Why aren't you sleeping in your room?
What are you doing out here?

343
00:29:02,137 --> 00:29:03,620
Where have you been messing around?

344
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,140
Who's messing around?
I was working overtime, Dad.

345
00:29:07,182 --> 00:29:09,226
I stayed in the office
so I wouldn't disturb you

346
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,380
when I got home late.

347
00:29:12,471 --> 00:29:14,380
Here.
Check the article I was working on.

348
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,100
Don't need to.

349
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,140
You look like a walking news article.

350
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,380
Seriously, Mr. Tang?

351
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,660
You camping out here

352
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,700
just to roast me?

353
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,620
I've got better things to do
than roast you.

354
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,860
I'm going for a walk.

355
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,420
Who goes for a walk at this hour?

356
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,060
Morning walks are the best.

357
00:29:33,248 --> 00:29:34,940
The day's success starts in the morning.

358
00:29:39,448 --> 00:29:40,750
It's your dad's birthday today.

359
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,800
Did you forget to tell him?

360
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,460
Got it.

361
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:44,860
Dad.

362
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,420
Happy Birthday.

363
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,580
Not happy.

364
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,420
I have a gift for you.

365
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,100
Don't want it.

366
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,900
Wu Si proposed to me!

367
00:29:56,293 --> 00:29:57,239
Say that again.

368
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,180
It's the same
no matter how many times I say it.

369
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,620
Wu Si proposed to me.

370
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,700
Right before he deployed.

371
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,660
Did you say yes?

372
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,660
Did you?

373
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,860
I will say yes, Dad.

374
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,140
I have to go for a walk.

375
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,620
I have to.

376
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,140
He's really going.

377
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,380
Mom, aren't you going to stop him?

378
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,540
Why stop him?

379
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,140
He doesn't want you
to see him wiping his tears.

380
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,140
Mom.

381
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,860
Looks like

382
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,380
I'm really following in your footsteps.

383
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,860
Then

384
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,820
you'd better do even better than I did.

385
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,380
Take it slow.

386
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,100
Looking good.

387
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:29,580
You're doing well.

388
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,620
In a few more days,

389
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,100
you won't need my help.

390
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,382
You'll be walking on your own.

391
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,620
That's great.

392
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,380
No problem.

393
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,940
Call me anytime

394
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,340
if you get any updates.

395
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,380
All right. Thank you.

396
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,580
Goodbye.

397
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:52,940
Mr. Han.

398
00:31:53,048 --> 00:31:55,240
I've found out
where the Chairman and Mr. Yutian are.

399
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:56,860
Where?

400
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,140
They're in Roman.

401
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,420
Roman?

402
00:32:04,893 --> 00:32:07,140
You didn't give us
any prior notice before coming.

403
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,860
Is there an emergency?

404
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,820
Sorry for not notifying you in advance.

405
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,540
Here's the thing.

406
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,380
I've left all the domestic business

407
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,540
to my youngest son.

408
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,100
Now, I can focus entirely

409
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,620
on this business.

410
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,620
So your son's leading
the Changzhou Group now.

411
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,300
Will he still be covering for you?

412
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,900
This time, I'm not leaving.

413
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,380
I'm settling down here.

414
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,620
So, we don't need any cover anymore.

415
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,420
Okay.

416
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,580
Why did you decide to leave the group?

417
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,420
Mr. William.

418
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,140
Since the last time we met,

419
00:32:59,204 --> 00:33:01,450
the location of the shipwreck
still hasn't been confirmed.

420
00:33:02,137 --> 00:33:04,360
I think your efficiency
could use some improvement.

421
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,700
He said that there are many
underwater currents in that sea region,

422
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,860
which complicates the search.

423
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,300
Now that you are
in charge of this operation,

424
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,100
he thinks it's a great development.

425
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,420
Efficiency in all aspects
has been improved.

426
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,940
In that case,

427
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,940
should we revisit

428
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,180
the profit split?

429
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,580
What do you mean?

430
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,100
As you just mentioned,

431
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,860
our involvement has improved efficiency,

432
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,300
so I believe

433
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,380
the profit split

434
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,700
should be adjusted accordingly.

435
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,780
The more relics we recover,

436
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,980
the more work
he'll have to do on the sales end.

437
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,900
His contribution will also increase.

438
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,340
And

439
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,740
without his distribution channels,

440
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,420
no matter how many relics we retrieve,

441
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,460
they would be worthless.

442
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,140
William.

443
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,820
He's too young

444
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,620
to understand.

445
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,580
Please don't mind him.

446
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,700
We're old friends.

447
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,580
What the rules were before,

448
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,340
they still apply now.

449
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:46,660
We can't let a little profit
come between us.

450
00:34:46,848 --> 00:34:47,620
Isn't that right?

451
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,900
Good. Good.

452
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:57,940
Okay?

453
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,700
Okay.

454
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,900
We have to go now.

455
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,060
So, till next time.

456
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,660
My friend.

457
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,340
Young man.

458
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,060
After you.

459
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,740
(Chinese People's Liberation Army)

460
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,060
Captain Zong.

461
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,420
Do you know
what keeping a safe distance means?

462
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,260
Yes.

463
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,180
Don't worry too much.

464
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,060
Sergeant Cheng will be all right.

465
00:35:45,204 --> 00:35:46,940
Once he's better,
I'll take you to see him.

466
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,260
Yes, Captain Zong.

467
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,340
You be careful too.

468
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,610
What do I need to be careful of?

469
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,780
All right. Attention.

470
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,740
About turn.

471
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:03,940
Beat it.

472
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,060
What is the Marine Corps?

473
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,700
What is the Blue Blade Special Ops Team?

474
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,220
The best of the best.

475
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,980
Steel among steel.

476
00:36:21,226 --> 00:36:23,140
Sons of the motherland,
burning with patriotism.

477
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,700
Xin's here.

478
00:36:31,404 --> 00:36:32,740
Sounds like you're plagiarizing

479
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,220
the Marine Corps anthem in your speech.

480
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,060
I'm reporting you.

481
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,900
I did not.

482
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,180
Xin, I heard from your dad
that you're engaged?

483
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,140
Where did you find this military guy?

484
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,071
Hook my second daughter up
with someone too.

485
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,620
Finding someone like Xin's fiancé

486
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,500
won't be easy.

487
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,620
Tell me.

488
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,020
How did my dad brag about my fiancé?

489
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,980
He says the guy treats you really well.

490
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,900
And he's filial toward them too.

491
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,140
Calls three times a day to check in.

492
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,620
Brings food, clothes,
and gifts all the time.

493
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,900
Last time,
the guy even bought him a jacket.

494
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,600
- He didn't.
- I didn't mention the jacket.

495
00:37:06,604 --> 00:37:09,140
Dad, I remember I was the one
who got you that jacket...

496
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,471
I said nothing about the jacket.

497
00:37:10,471 --> 00:37:11,780
I...

498
00:37:11,982 --> 00:37:14,670
I was just coming back from morning
exercise when I ran into them.

499
00:37:14,715 --> 00:37:15,980
I was just introducing Wu Si

500
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,140
to these uncles here.

501
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,060
No mention of a jacket. None.

502
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,180
Fine.

503
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,180
Uncles,

504
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,980
let me make it official.

505
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,180
Yes, I'm engaged.

506
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,420
My dad introduced my fiancé to me.

507
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,260
He is tall, handsome, and dependable.

508
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:33,140
Buys groceries, bags,
and jackets for us.

509
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,060
If your kids

510
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,340
ever need help,

511
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,220
go straight to my dad.

512
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,420
- All right.
- We will.

513
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,140
Aren't congratulations in order?

514
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,140
Congratulations!

515
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:42,700
All right.

516
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,220
You all talk. I'm heading out.

517
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,700
Look at you, showing off like that.

518
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,340
That delivery
was practically stand-up comedy.

519
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,340
Don't worry, Captain Tang.

520
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,900
No matter where I end up,

521
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,060
I'll always be your daughter.

522
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,980
You and Mom can forget

523
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,180
about getting rid of me.

524
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,180
Shoo, shoo!

525
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,460
Don't get all clingy with me.

526
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,700
You think I want you to stay?

527
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,260
I wish you'd get married today.

528
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,660
Oh, really?

529
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,700
You bet.

530
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,460
Mr. Tian.

531
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,140
Have a seat.

532
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,700
As your superior,

533
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,940
I'd like to check in
on your personal life.

534
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,140
My personal life?

535
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,460
Did Hai say something to you again?

536
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,819
If something good's happening,

537
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,980
let everyone share in the joy.

538
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,540
Tell me.

539
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,940
How's it going with that Navy boyfriend?

540
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,260
How's it going?

541
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,260
Let's just say

542
00:38:37,693 --> 00:38:39,180
there's no getting out of it now.

543
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,900
So

544
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,780
you're engaged?

545
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,780
Something like that.

546
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:39,980
Hi.

547
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,340
Is Lan Yangyang inside?

548
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,460
She's performing surgery.

549
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,540
Thanks.

550
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,660
Tired?

551
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,620
Hungry.

552
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,460
Slow down.

553
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,980
Yi Nanwang's not here.

554
00:41:31,671 --> 00:41:33,048
What happened to your hand?

555
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:34,980
It's nothing.

556
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,760
Just a minor injury during the exercise.

557
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,660
Let me take a look.

558
00:41:37,737 --> 00:41:38,620
You don't need to.

559
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:44,600
Let me see it.
What if you didn't wrap it...

560
00:41:44,604 --> 00:41:45,448
