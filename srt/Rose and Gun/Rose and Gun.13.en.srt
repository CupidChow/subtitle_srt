18
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,410
It's not a revolutionary topic,

19
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,370
but there aren't

20
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,370
that many people

21
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,604
doing deep dives on skincare

22
00:01:48,648 --> 00:01:50,160
from a medical ingredients perspective.

23
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,280
Send it to me.

24
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,580
I'll pass it to someone in that field
and get it out there

25
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,090
to see how the public reacts.

26
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:56,710
Then

27
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,600
I'll ask some friends in media

28
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,737
to help polish it up a bit.

29
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,715
Sure. Whatever you think is best.

30
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,493
Once it gets views, I can prove to
my dad I'm not wasting my life.

31
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,610
He keeps saying I do nothing all day.

32
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,990
Well, that's not exactly untrue.

33
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,770
You're supposed to be on my side!

34
00:02:10,804 --> 00:02:13,404
I was planning to take you
on a trip abroad. You're uninvited.

35
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,970
You're just trying to save
your precious piggy bank.

36
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,515
You already spent tens of thousands
on tickets and accommodation.

37
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,790
I'm dying inside.

38
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,870
My other friends just started their jobs

39
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,820
and are too scared to take time off,

40
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,130
so

41
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,530
you're my only hope now.

42
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:31,560
Please.

43
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,430
Yes, yes,

44
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,530
because I'm the backup to the backup.

45
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,490
No sincerity whatsoever.

46
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,760
I'm not going.
Got a bunch of stuff on my plate.

47
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,690
Xin,

48
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,650
give yourself a break.

49
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,970
Work will never stop coming.

50
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,100
Recharge a little.

51
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,137
You have plenty of time
to burn yourself out later.

54
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:03,180
(Wu Si: We've got an emergency mission.
I will contact you if I have a chance.)

55
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,182
(Got it. Stay safe.)

56
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,800
Waiting for someone to call?

57
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,000
No.

58
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:16,650
Wu Si, right?

59
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,730
No.

60
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,090
Then who is it?

61
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,420
You've been staring
at your phone all day.

62
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,715
Must be someone important.

63
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,070
Not important.

64
00:03:28,715 --> 00:03:29,830
Not even a little bit.

65
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,190
Not important? Then put the phone away.

66
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,280
Any more staring
and you'll merge into it.

67
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:45,782
Have some vegetables.

68
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:02,770
I'm done eating.

69
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,810
You really cleaned your bowl.

70
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,370
The number you're calling
is currently unavailable.

71
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,120
Please try again later.

72
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,990
Won't answer anyone's calls...

73
00:04:21,937 --> 00:04:22,893
You're ghosting us now?

74
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,270
Keep this up and I swear I'll...

75
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,240
Are you done using my phone?

76
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,450
What?

77
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,620
Can't get a hold of Wu Si?

78
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,210
He's gone radio silent?

79
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,448
Oh, dear.

80
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,820
He's got you worried, huh?

81
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,330
I'm not worried.

82
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,770
I'm only worried about my article.

83
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,010
Keep telling yourself that.

84
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,050
I'll ask Wang Lang
to look into it for you.

85
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,360
Don't bother.

86
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,450
I don't need to know.

87
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,970
I'm taking a nap, Dad.

88
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,010
Please leave.

89
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,450
Oh, dear.

90
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,450
She says she doesn't care.

91
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,010
But inside? Oh, dear...

92
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,570
Her heart is going through it.

93
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,530
Hurting so bad.

94
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,770
Hurts so much...

95
00:05:33,804 --> 00:05:35,360
Well? Why aren't you calling him?

96
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,250
You said you'd look into it for me.

At ease.

the official list.

Comrades,

138
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,090
this competition is not only a stage

139
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,580
to showcase our military presence.

140
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:18,930
It is also

141
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,930
a real battleground.

142
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,380
In past years,

143
00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:24,560
our forces have delivered
outstanding results

144
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,900
across various events.

145
00:08:26,226 --> 00:08:29,004
We hope this year, you will once again
live up to expectations

146
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,050
and win honor

147
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,260
for the Marine Corps of the Navy.

148
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,330
I heard

149
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:38,680
there's a rookie on the team

150
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:39,900
this time.

151
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:41,520
Sir!

152
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:44,770
Reporting in, Sir!

153
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,250
Private First Class Yi Nanwang,

154
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,380
Blue Blade Special Ops Team,

155
00:08:47,382 --> 00:08:48,120
Marine Corps.

156
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,450
Awaiting orders.

157
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,730
Not bad. You've got good spirits.

158
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:52,880
Fall in.

159
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:53,820
Yes, Sir!

160
00:09:00,604 --> 00:09:01,770
Same routine as always.

161
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,350
Before heading abroad,

162
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,210
you'll all go to the Navy Museum.

163
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,490
Take a look at our ancestors' legacy.

164
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,530
Feel what it means to go from nothing,

165
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,650
to weak, to strong.

166
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,730
Let it teach you something.
Let it shape you.

167
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,560
Yes, Sir!

168
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,090
Yes?

169
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:32,770
Wang Lang.

170
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,770
Finally remembered to call me?

171
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,530
Training just ended?

172
00:09:37,604 --> 00:09:39,848
Just finished lockdown training.
Saw your message.

173
00:09:40,071 --> 00:09:41,330
Wu Si's been at training too.

174
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,648
No cell signal either.
He couldn't receive the messages.

175
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,400
I see.

176
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,120
My daughter's been moping around.

177
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,410
She even lost her appetite.

178
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,660
Wu Si's leading a visit
to the Navy Museum now.

179
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,640
Xin can reach him there.

180
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:01,810
Yes, Dad?

181
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,970
I'm on deadline.

182
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,737
If there's something you need,
just say it.

183
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,710
I'd never dare give you orders.

184
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,730
I'm passing along intel.

185
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,210
Got word from Wang Lang.

186
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,640
Wu Si is currently headed

187
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,290
to the Navy Museum with his unit.

188
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,570
Well? Excited yet?

189
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,610
If you leave now,

190
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,290
you'll make it in time. Get going!

191
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,260
I'm not going.

192
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,150
I've got a mountain of work here.
I'm hanging up.

193
00:10:31,915 --> 00:10:32,810
She says she won't go?

194
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,330
We'll see about that.

195
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,020
(Liberation)

196
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,600
This oil painting tells

197
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,700
a true historical story.

198
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,050
One time,

199
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,570
Commander Xiao Jinguang went
to inspect Liugong Island

200
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,850
and borrowed a small fishing boat
from a local fisherman.

201
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,340
Confused, the fisherman asked,

202
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,810
"You're a Navy Commander,
and you're borrowing my boat?"

203
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,570
Commander Xiao didn't answer.

204
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:16,510
He turned to his aide and said,
"Write this down."

205
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,690
17 March, 1950.

206
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,715
Navy Commander Xiao Jinguang
used a fishing boat

207
00:11:20,715 --> 00:11:22,460
to inspect Liugong Island.

208
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,810
On 10 August 1950,

209
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,510
the Navy held a founding conference

210
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,329
and formally set out
its early strategic goals.

211
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,880
To build a modern,

212
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,010
offensive and defensive,

213
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,840
near-sea, lightweight
naval combat force.

214
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,020
(81192 Copy)

215
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,530
This is the statue of our hero,
Wang Wei, defender of sky and sea,

216
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,360
as honored
by the Central Military Commission.

217
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,060
(Wang Wei, Guardian of Sea and Sky)
On 1 April 2001,

218
00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:56,069
Captain Wang Wei of the 25th Regiment
of Naval Aviation flew fighter jet 81192

219
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,810
(Driving Away Foreign Ships)
over the South China Sea to intercept

220
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,220
a US electronic reconnaissance aircraft.

221
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,382
After a collision,
he was killed in the line of duty.

222
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:08,050
He and his jet never returned.

223
00:12:08,337 --> 00:12:09,690
Every April, people across China,

224
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,170
online and offline,

225
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,580
commemorate him by calling,

226
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,830
"81192, copy."

227
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,130
"81192, copy."

228
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,540
"Return immediately."

229
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,070
"I can no longer return."

230
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,960
"Go on without me."

231
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,570
81192 is a symbol

232
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,910
of the helplessness
and defiance we faced

233
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,370
in the presence of great power.

234
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,210
A warning to never forget
national humiliation

235
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,050
and to rise stronger.

236
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,190
Half left, face.

237
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,110
Uncover.

238
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,860
(People's Liberation Army Navy)

239
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,730
Salute.

240
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,740
(81192 Copy)

241
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,980
(Fighting Valiantly
to Defend Coastal Waters)

242
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,160
No matter how far from home,

243
00:13:16,182 --> 00:13:17,671
or how harsh the conditions,

244
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,382
our navy officers and soldiers
stand strong.

245
00:13:19,426 --> 00:13:21,730
Where the people are on the reefs,
the national flag flies,

246
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,950
and the unwavering belief
to live and die with the islands

247
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,370
remains forever strong.

248
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,129
This was the first generation

249
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,960
of stilt houses used
by reef garrison soldiers.

250
00:13:29,004 --> 00:13:30,404
It was hand-built by Shao Jianmin,

251
00:13:30,404 --> 00:13:32,730
the first commander of
Huayang Reef garrison in the Spratlys,

252
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,010
faithfully modeled
on the original design

253
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,010
from the 1980s.

254
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:36,850
Back then,

255
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,930
Shao Jianmin and his troops lived

256
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,010
and fought with rifles in hand inside

257
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,330
this barely 10-square-meter stilt house.

258
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,826
(Dongmen Reef, Spratly Islands, China)
It is the second-generation stilt house

259
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:47,890
for reef garrison soldiers.

260
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,630
Letters were the most anticipated thing

261
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,010
for every Spratly soldier.

262
00:13:52,071 --> 00:13:53,648
Because communication was so limited,

263
00:13:53,648 --> 00:13:55,250
letters came only every few months

264
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,490
via supply ships.

265
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,080
They'd come in bundles for each person.

266
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:01,090
(Spratly Postal Service)
This is the wooden mailbox from Yongshu Reef.

267
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,010
Small as it is,

268
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,410
it's filled with love

269
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,430
for the motherland
and for family back home.

270
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,410
They are our loyal Spratly defenders.

271
00:14:08,471 --> 00:14:11,004
Generation after generation
of reef soldiers living their oath.

272
00:14:11,004 --> 00:14:11,915
Loyal to the Party.

273
00:14:11,937 --> 00:14:14,610
Devoted to the nation.

274
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,010
In April 2018,

275
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,890
the Central Military Commission held

276
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,893
the largest naval review
in New China's history

277
00:14:33,893 --> 00:14:35,315
in the South China Sea.

278
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,610
48 warships,

279
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,890
76 aircraft,

280
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,330
and over 10,000 sailors
took part in the inspection.

281
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,410
It was a bold demonstration

282
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,700
of China's maritime power

283
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,070
and a solemn commitment

284
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,290
to building

285
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:50,650
a world-class Navy.

286
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:56,930
Stand at attention.

287
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,450
Left turn.

288
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,850
Right dress.

289
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,010
Eyes front.

290
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,650
Now standing beside me is your guide,

291
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,650
who will tell us more
about the submarine in front of us.

292
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,810
Comrades,

293
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,050
this massive vessel in front of us

294
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,770
is Changcheng 200,

295
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,650
China's first domestically developed

296
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,170
conventional submarine.

297
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,950
It's known as the pioneer
of underwater missile testing.

298
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,090
Having been responsible
for test launches of JL-1

299
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,970
and JL-2 submarine-launched
ballistic missiles.

300
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,810
It holds tremendous
scientific significance

301
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,250
and marks the continuous growth

302
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,530
of China's naval power.

303
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:43,010
During the JL-1 launch,

304
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,770
we used underwater pressure

305
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,650
to eject the missile...

306
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,030
March in place.

307
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:35,730
Stand at attention.

308
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,210
Left turn.

309
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,650
Right dress.

310
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,090
Eyes front.

311
00:16:44,893 --> 00:16:45,848
That concludes the tour.

312
00:16:45,893 --> 00:16:46,970
You're now free to explore.

313
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,950
Rendezvous in ten minutes.

314
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:49,890
Dismissed.

315
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,115
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

316
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:36,780
Yes?

317
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:49,540
Why did you hang up?

318
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,715
Oh, I didn't mean to make that call.

319
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,900
Then why'd you come to the Navy Museum?

320
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,010
Am I not allowed to be here if you are?

321
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,890
I thought you came to find me.

322
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:06,850
Um...

323
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,130
Did you read the article I sent you?

324
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,530
You didn't even reply.

325
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,170
Sorry. Things have been busy.

326
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,999
We're about to head overseas

327
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,690
for an international
military competition.

328
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:18,715
Training's been intense.

329
00:18:18,737 --> 00:18:20,970
You're going abroad?
Where? For how long?

330
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,000
I just want to know how soon

331
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,400
you can finish reading that draft.

332
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:29,660
Miss Tang,

333
00:18:30,048 --> 00:18:31,782
I can always count on your reports

334
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,640
to be truthful and reliable.

335
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,871
You don't need my opinion.

336
00:18:35,493 --> 00:18:36,500
What matters more to me

337
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:38,890
is what I said the other day.

338
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:39,770
I meant every word.

339
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,650
I'll be waiting for your answer.

340
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:51,650
Fall in.

341
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,490
Are you leaving now?

342
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,471
Is there something else?

343
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:06,650
No.

344
00:19:09,204 --> 00:19:10,830
I've never been to this museum before.

345
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,330
I wanted you to show me around.

346
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,826
But if you're busy,
I don't want to disturb you...

347
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,650
Right dress.

348
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:28,680
This is for you.

349
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,420
Eyes front.

350
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,550
I'll give you a tour myself

351
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,650
when I come back.

352
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,770
Right turn.

353
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,270
Quick march.

354
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:06,090
One, two, one...

355
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,700
Thinking about someone?

356
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,010
Dad! You scared me.

357
00:20:39,048 --> 00:20:40,115
So, did you see him?

358
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:43,980
Look at you.

359
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,090
A Navy Museum brochure.

360
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,770
And you said you wouldn't go.

361
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,782
I bet you hung up the phone
and ran straight there.

362
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,840
Can't I visit a museum?

363
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,382
- Sure you can.
- I didn't go to see him.

364
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,410
Say whatever you want.

365
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,630
You know exactly

366
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,840
why you went.

367
00:21:04,004 --> 00:21:06,490
You even folded the brochure
into a heart. A heart.

368
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,330
Here you go.

369
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,250
I'll show you some love too.

370
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,920
My little way of showing love.

371
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,100
Love...

372
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,700
(Ingredients
in various skincare products.)

373
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,640
Hello!

374
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,570
I'm your new friend, King Lan.

375
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,100
I'm a recent medical graduate from

376
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,940
a combined bachelor's-master's program.

377
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,970
From now on, I'll be sharing

378
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,530
skincare science with you

379
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,600
from a medical perspective.

380
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:20,730
Today,

381
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,400
let's start

382
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,590
with everyday sun protection.

383
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,510
Let's get to it.

384
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,790
You might not be clear on the difference

385
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,200
between chemical
and physical sunscreens.

386
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,490
It's simple.

387
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,730
Just two key ingredients.

388
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,770
(King Lan)

389
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:36,790
If the product contains

390
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,050
titanium dioxide

391
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,170
and zinc oxide,

392
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,640
it's a physical sunscreen.

393
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,410
If it lacks those,

394
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,610
or they're listed far down
the ingredients,

395
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,890
it's a chemical sunscreen.

396
00:22:46,915 --> 00:22:49,026
Physical sunscreen creates
a reflective barrier

397
00:22:49,048 --> 00:22:51,340
on your skin like a mirror

398
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,050
to bounce off UV rays.

399
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,580
Chemical sunscreen,

400
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,140
on the other hand,

401
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,870
absorbs UV rays within the skin.

402
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,130
Do you understand

403
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,330
the difference now?

404
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,090
My recommendation
is to use physical sunscreen.

405
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:11,210
Captain.

406
00:23:11,271 --> 00:23:11,950
Stay seated.

407
00:23:12,426 --> 00:23:14,093
What are you doing? Are you injured?

408
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,530
Of course not.

409
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,293
I'm prepping an emergency kit
for Yangyang.

410
00:23:23,293 --> 00:23:24,970
She's not going on any wilderness trips.

411
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:25,970
She doesn't need it.

412
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,840
Whether she needs it
or not is her business.

413
00:23:27,848 --> 00:23:28,990
Prepping it is mine.

414
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,470
And knowing her, she'll need it.

415
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:41,570
Povidone-iodine.

416
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,450
Thermometer.

417
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:43,330
Whistle.

418
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,050
Compass.

419
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,010
What's with you?

420
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:51,570
Just looking.

421
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:53,570
"Just looking"?

422
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,430
You're thinking of making one

423
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,930
for Xin too, aren't you?

424
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,770
No.

425
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:06,890
I mean,

426
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,130
she is doing investigative reporting.

427
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,070
She could end up

428
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,570
in some remote, isolated places.

429
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,250
Don't you think she could use

430
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,100
a little emergency love kit?

431
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,530
Or at least a survival guide?

432
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,820
They just want to know you care.

Hello

452
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,620
to all my lovely viewers!

453
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,730
Hi!

454
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:47,010
We've arrived in An.

455
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:50,050
This is the hotel we're staying at.

456
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:50,730
Nice, right?

457
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,640
The environment is amazing!

458
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,970
The pool is beautiful!

459
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,010
Watch out. Sorry.

460
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,440
All right.

461
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,560
Back to business.

462
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,530
Look at my skin.

463
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,970
This is me
after four hours wearing makeup.

464
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,690
Very little oil,

465
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,610
and everything is still in place.

466
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,390
That means this foundation

467
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,220
has great oil control.

468
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,560
Now let's see

469
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,640
what it looks like

470
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,390
after eight hours. See you later!

471
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,880
Not bad, beauty blogger.

472
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,040
You just landed,

473
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,560
didn't even text your mom yet,

474
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,930
but are already chatting with fans.

475
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:30,050
My mom's my biggest fan.

476
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:32,350
She watches my livestreams
more than she checks my messages.

477
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,210
Come on. Let's check out our room.

478
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:34,850
Come on.

479
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:36,910
Let's go!

480
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,120
This is our room, Xin! Come on!

481
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,330
This is gorgeous!

482
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:48,650
Xin!

483
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,050
This room is so pretty!

484
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:53,690
It's not bad.

485
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:56,090
The roof's made of straw,
and it's shaped like a boat.

486
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,200
Time out.

487
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,490
After that long flight, I'm beat.

488
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,410
I'm taking a nap.

489
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:00,870
Wait!

490
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,210
Let's take photos first.

491
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,450
No photos. I'm sleeping.

492
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:09,750
You're on vacation!
Who sleeps on vacation?

493
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,690
Come on!

494
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,690
Got it.

495
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,740
Now help me take one.

496
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,570
I want a photo with the pool.

497
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,715
Don't sit like that.
Makes your legs look short.

498
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,871
You know your good sides.

499
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,160
It's sunny.

500
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,450
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

501
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,690
Cheers, Xin!

502
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:33,780
Cheers!

503
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:47,170
Three, two, one, cheese!

504
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:47,810
All right.

505
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:49,410
Give me a different pose.

506
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,120
Bigger smile.

507
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,460
I'm out of ideas.

508
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,440
Xin, look. They're selling skincare

509
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,170
and beauty products by the pool.

510
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,120
I have to check them out.

511
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,570
Come on.

512
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:04,890
- Hi, ladies.
- Hi.

513
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:05,890
Can I help you?

514
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:09,850
We would like to buy some...

515
00:29:10,693 --> 00:29:12,160
How do you say "after-sun recovery"?

516
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,650
After-sun recovery?

517
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,460
I understand Chinese.

518
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:17,940
See?

519
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,410
Chinese is a global language now.

520
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,130
Thanks.

521
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:24,450
Thank you.

522
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:29,140
I don't see
an ingredients label on this.

523
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,000
Is it some kind of plant extract?

524
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:33,870
It comes from the seed of a fruit.

525
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,410
We extract it ourselves.

526
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,182
It's a traditional local formula.

527
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,060
It's very good.

528
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,230
Really?

529
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,370
Sounds like magic.

530
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:46,370
So where can I buy this fruit?

531
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:47,810
No need to buy.

532
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:48,890
We harvest it ourselves.

533
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,540
It grows in the forest.

534
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,890
You harvest it yourself?

535
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:54,740
Yes.

536
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,330
Is the forest far?

537
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,537
Is the fruit easy to find?

538
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,010
That I'm not sure about.

539
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,890
You can ask the front desk.

540
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:04,830
Okay, thanks.

541
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,620
Let's go, Xin.

542
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,010
Go where?

543
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:09,340
The front desk, of course!

544
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,090
Excuse me.

545
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,770
Hi.

546
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,570
Is the forest far from here?

547
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,610
Very close. Only a few minutes' drive.

548
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,530
Are you going there?

549
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,650
Yes, of course. It's famous.

550
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:24,970
Yes,
but tourists don't usually go there.

551
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,020
Do you have a guide?

552
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,520
It's okay. She's just kidding. Thanks.

553
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,310
You're welcome.

554
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,610
Xin, come with me, please?

555
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:32,740
It's so close to us.

556
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,937
I could gain some followers!

557
00:30:34,004 --> 00:30:35,700
Followers? Are you serious?

558
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,850
We're overseas. We don't know the area.

559
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,530
Besides, Lan Yangyang,

560
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:42,650
do you have
any wilderness survival skills?

561
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:45,050
I kind of do.

562
00:30:45,271 --> 00:30:46,420
Zong Qing taught me to carve

563
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,093
letters into tree bark
if I ever get lost.

564
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,170
Wow, exactly one skill.

565
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,210
Xin, come on. Please.

566
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:55,190
Hi.

567
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,410
Do you know
where the outdoor supplies store is?

568
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,150
Turn right,

569
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,770
go past the street,
and you'll arrive at your destination.

570
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:04,760
Okay. Thank you!

571
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:06,048
- Let's go!
- Are you serious?

572
00:31:06,048 --> 00:31:07,580
Hey, it's better

573
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,982
if you don't stay there overnight.

574
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,410
Ding.

575
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,180
Mr. Han.

576
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,610
I saw on Miss Tang's Moments

577
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:29,890
that she's currently overseas.

578
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:30,980
Find out

579
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,170
when she left,

580
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,115
and where she went.

581
00:31:33,137 --> 00:31:33,826
Okay.

582
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,970
Slow down, Yangyang!

583
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:49,290
Xin, look at all these trees!

584
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,330
I'll find that fruit!

585
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,730
Where are you hiding?

586
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,850
Wait up! Be careful.

587
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:09,050
Hello,

588
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:11,370
everybody! Hi!

589
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,380
Today,

590
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,480
I'm taking everyone

591
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,890
on a spontaneous,

592
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,090
unplugged adventure.

593
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,280
Let me show you real quick.

594
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,490
- This...
- Don't film me.

595
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:26,810
This is one of An's most famous

596
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,000
natural forests.

597
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,930
(Hello. I'm a friend of Miss Tang's.)

598
00:32:57,982 --> 00:32:59,379
(Miss Tang is away on assignment)

599
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,570
(and won't be back anytime soon.)

600
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,669
(She asked me to contact you)

601
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,580
(and request that you continue
providing leads to me.)

602
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,937
(I'll investigate on her behalf.)

603
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:16,570
(May I ask what your profession is?)

604
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,610
(I run a business.
I've got an extensive network.)

605
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,790
(I can help Miss Tang in a lot of ways.)

606
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,170
(I've helped her before too.)

607
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,180
(Did Miss Tang give you
this email address?)

608
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,810
(Yes. Can you send me the lead now?)

609
00:33:58,570 --> 00:33:59,250
(Miss Tang,)

610
00:33:59,293 --> 00:34:00,200
(someone contacted us)

611
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,050
(through the email we used before,)

612
00:34:02,093 --> 00:34:03,290
(claiming to be your friend)

613
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,340
(and asking for the lead.)

614
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,170
(Is that true?)

615
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,050
Lan Yangyang,

616
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,670
what does that fruit

617
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,240
look like?

618
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:23,330
I sent you a photo of it, didn't I?

619
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:25,530
Did you?

620
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,110
I did.

621
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:27,820
Let me see...

622
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:34,330
Is this it?

623
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:35,400
Is this the fruit?

624
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:39,640
No.

625
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,930
This is it!

626
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:47,930
Look, Xin!

627
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:52,030
We won't find anything

628
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,770
with your questionable eyesight.

629
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:55,850
The shape clearly doesn't match.

630
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,240
It's fine. We just started.

631
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,550
We'll keep going. Come on!

632
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:03,850
Come on!

633
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,570
Everyone,

634
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:08,850
we've hit

635
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:11,210
a slight obstacle.

636
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,360
We haven't found it yet.

637
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:14,650
But if we do,

638
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,690
I'll show you

639
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:18,930
right away

640
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:21,230
what it looks like.

641
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:21,850
Okay?

642
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,290
Stay tuned!

643
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:31,510
Xin, it's lagging.

644
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,580
No signal?

645
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:35,710
I'll check my phone.

646
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:41,650
Yangyang,

647
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,400
we should turn back.

648
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,830
Looks like we're out of range.

649
00:35:44,982 --> 00:35:46,137
Let's not go any deeper.

650
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,030
No way.

651
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,820
What if there's a signal further in?

652
00:35:49,826 --> 00:35:52,093
How are we going to find it
if we don't go further?

653
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,330
Come on!

654
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,550
I'm sure it'll be fine in there.

655
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:59,170
Do we have to find that fruit?

656
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,010
Yes!

657
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:25,690
Do this

658
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,090
and then this...

659
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:31,810
Done.

660
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:39,050
Yangyang!

661
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:40,930
Wait for me!

662
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:50,140
This mission is about
a submerged search.

663
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:53,829
We've installed field mission boxes

664
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,370
all over the bottom of the ocean.

665
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:59,490
You must find them all

666
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:02,130
according to the time and route.

667
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,890
The shortest time wins.

668
00:37:05,782 --> 00:37:07,930
You cannot switch people.

669
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:10,450
If you have a risky situation,

670
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,330
you call the rescue team.

671
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,320
If you call the rescue team,

672
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,190
you lose.

673
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:16,490
So,

674
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:19,090
do you understand me?

675
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,730
Yes, Sir.

676
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:21,810
Again!

677
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,220
I can't hear you!

678
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,250
Do you understand me?

679
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,550
Yes, Sir!

680
00:37:49,826 --> 00:37:51,320
Wang Chen and I will be the first team.

681
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,204
Zong Qing and Yi Nanwang,
you two provide backup.

682
00:37:54,382 --> 00:37:56,337
Wang Chen,
we'll split up once we're underwater.

683
00:37:56,382 --> 00:37:58,570
Three, two, one.

684
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,570
Go, go, go!

685
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:28,300
(Underwater in An, Wu Si)

686
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:53,350
Captain Zong.

687
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:55,315
Captain Wu brought up
a member of An's navy.

688
00:40:55,337 --> 00:40:56,850
There's a problem with his oxygen tank.

689
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,226
I hope Captain Chen's doing okay.

690
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,740
