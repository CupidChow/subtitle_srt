00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,226
(Nanhai One)
Have you heard of the Nanhai One wreck?

19
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:48,790
I've heard of it.

20
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,240
The government spent 300 million yuan

21
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,120
to salvage it.

22
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,620
Do you know the story behind it?

23
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,550
I'm not sure.

24
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,840
Have you heard of a man?

25
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,520
A Brit named Mark Hatcher.

26
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,220
I saw his name

27
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,493
during my sunken ship research.

28
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,750
He was a professional looter.

29
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,300
In 1986 alone,

30
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,390
he stole over a million

31
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,650
Chinese porcelain relics.

32
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,880
Over 600,000 of them were destroyed.

33
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,750
The remaining 239,000 were taken

34
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,090
to the Netherlands for auction.

35
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,580
(Minghua News)

36
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,290
Chinese cultural relics experts

37
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,280
also attended the auction.

38
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,280
They brought 30,000 dollars,

39
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,440
but that money wasn't enough to buy

40
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,560
even one porcelain item

41
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,060
that should've belonged to us.

42
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,010
This could be called

43
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,420
a humiliation and painful memory

44
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,110
in Chinese archaeology.

45
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,690
Because of this,

46
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,090
our country founded

47
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,090
the Center for Underwater Archaeology
in 1987.

48
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,010
Coincidentally,

49
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,460
we also found a sunken ship

50
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,470
(Wu Si)
that same year.

51
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,530
In 1989,

52
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,690
China and Japan conducted a joint study

53
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,970
on that shipwreck.

54
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,780
That study marked the start

55
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,220
(Wu Si: Still mad at me?)
of China's underwater archaeology.

56
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,990
The founder
of our underwater archaeology field,

57
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,100
Mr. Yu Weichao,

58
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,570
named that ship

59
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,510
(Tang Xin: Busy, in a meeting.)
Nanhai One.

60
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,000
So that's where the name
Nanhai One came from.

61
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:25,810
Yes.

62
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,250
Underwater tech back then

63
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,220
was very limited.

64
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,250
So it took nearly 20 years

65
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,230
from discovery to fully recover

66
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,170
the ship.

67
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:50,350
This August,

68
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,250
Cultural Relics Bureau
officially announced

69
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,870
the results
of the Nanhai One excavation.

70
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,020
Over 180,000 relics were recovered.

71
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,300
Mostly ancient ceramics.

72
00:03:59,337 --> 00:04:01,380
(Wu Si: Haven't you wondered)
Some were made of gold and silver.

73
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,250
(who kidnapped you at Roman Islands?)
Experts estimate

74
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,370
(If we meet, I can analyze it.)
that just the porcelain items

75
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,320
(I'll send the location tomorrow.)
of the Nanhai One relics

76
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,180
(I'll be waiting whether you come.)
are worth 300 billion.

77
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,290
300 billion yuan?

78
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,560
Dollars.

79
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,410
That's a huge amount of money.

80
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,310
And this value

81
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,337
will only grow over time.

82
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,550
Tang Xin, your investigation

83
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:24,010
into illegal shipwreck relic salvage

84
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,180
and your show

85
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,110
on promoting underwater relic protection

86
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,730
are culturally

87
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,640
and economically

88
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,030
valuable.

89
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,900
Thank you, Mr. Bai.

90
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,090
Why didn't you call first?

91
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,970
Didn't you say you'd be waiting
whether I come?

92
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,130
So why call?

93
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,070
Seeing how sincere I am,

94
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,300
are you still mad?

95
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,530
That depends on
how well you analyze it today.

96
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,450
If it's bad, you just tricked me here.

97
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:05,670
Alright.

98
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,210
Listen and judge if my analysis is good.

99
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:10,990
Go on.

100
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,800
First, let's analyze

101
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,470
who drugged your drink.

102
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,370
Was it a waiter

103
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,670
or the bartender?

104
00:05:20,026 --> 00:05:22,226
They were the ones
with the best chance to act.

105
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,010
Why would they harm me?

106
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,680
They weren't targeting you.

107
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,090
Someone else was.

108
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,450
They were just bribed.

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,250
The one who paid them

110
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,810
knew your every move.

111
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,848
They knew you frequented that place.

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,290
Who bribed them?

113
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,000
I know.

114
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,510
Are you going to say

115
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,250
they're not regular traffickers?

116
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,630
If they were traffickers,

117
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,690
you'd be on the ship,

118
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:45,860
not locked up.

119
00:05:47,893 --> 00:05:49,648
That's what I couldn't figure out.

120
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,290
If it were Han Changzhou and the others,

121
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,170
why would they drug me

122
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,000
instead of...

123
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,030
They just hadn't decided
what to do with you.

124
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,050
And

125
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,620
they didn't want you ruining their plan,

126
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,290
so they had you captured first.

127
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,860
Why not just kill me

128
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,970
if they wanted to stop me?

129
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,250
Miss Tang.

130
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,730
I know you're fearless and brave,

131
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,850
but they

132
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,000
don't want to be dragged down
by your courage.

133
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:14,730
What do you mean?

134
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:15,840
It's simple.

135
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,280
Your colleagues

136
00:06:17,337 --> 00:06:18,800
all knew what you were doing in Roman.

137
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,000
If anything happened to you there,

138
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,340
the people you investigated

139
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,530
would be the first suspects.

140
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,090
So if they wanted you
out of the country,

141
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,340
they must have had

142
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,560
a way to keep you from ever coming back.

143
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,420
If it really were Changzhou Group,

144
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,780
why was Han Yuhang taken too?

145
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,230
Maybe something unexpected happened.

146
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,590
But he probably went to save you.

147
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,000
So I blamed him wrongly?

148
00:06:50,048 --> 00:06:51,810
He wasn't the one who touched my laptop?

149
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,570
Where did he get the email then?

150
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,330
Even if he was saving me,

151
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,270
he's still suspicious.

152
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,290
He may seem suspicious,

153
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,010
but I still think he's different

154
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,970
from his brother and father.

155
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:18,430
Do you agree with my analysis?

156
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,220
Partly.

157
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,930
You didn't trick me here after all.

158
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,000
So you're not mad anymore?

159
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:40,020
(PLA Joint Logistics
Support Force 928 Hospital)

160
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,660
(Outpatient Department)

161
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,080
Zong Qing.

162
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:43,890
Brigadier.

163
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:45,750
Here to see Wang Chen?

164
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,450
Brigadier,
why didn't you pick up Mrs. Wang?

165
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,480
I was just about to go.

166
00:07:50,493 --> 00:07:51,715
It's been nearly two weeks.

167
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,570
Well...

168
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,640
I heard about Yangyang's miscarriage.

169
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,010
Is she alright?

170
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,490
She's okay. Don't worry.

171
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,330
My wife told me

172
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,350
she'd have been in danger

173
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,448
without Yangyang's help.

174
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,250
And Yangyang had helped

175
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,330
look after Wang Chen's mother-in-law.

176
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,240
So I want to thank you.

177
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,620
I'm grateful
that your wife helped my wife.

178
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,130
I thank her even more

179
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,810
for helping other military families

180
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,560
while we were away.

181
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:30,850
Zong Qing.

182
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,690
My wife and I talked it over.

183
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,570
We really like the name, Xi.

184
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,004
If you're okay with it,

185
00:08:39,226 --> 00:08:40,300
we'd like to use it.

186
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:44,620
Well...

187
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,490
Can I be her godfather?

188
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,990
If you're willing,

189
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,100
she'll always be your daughter.

190
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,490
Alright, go on.

191
00:08:54,982 --> 00:08:56,090
I'll wait here for you.

192
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,320
We'll go pick up

193
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,560
my wife and baby together.

194
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,560
Yes.

195
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,271
How cute.

196
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,480
Come on, Yi Nanwang.

197
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,590
I'll help you take a photo.

198
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,130
Come here.

199
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,330
Smile.

200
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,560
I told you to smile.

201
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,470
Mrs. Wang, I'll go get Brigadier.

202
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,490
Don't go.

203
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,720
You two can't just
focus on taking photos.

204
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,100
Let Captain and his future wife
take a photo together.

205
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:42,920
Quick.

206
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,204
Mrs. Wang, I can skip the photos.

207
00:09:44,226 --> 00:09:45,204
- Go on.
- It's fine.

208
00:09:45,248 --> 00:09:46,360
Hurry. Come on. Hurry.

209
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:46,800
Take more.

210
00:09:46,826 --> 00:09:48,520
- Wang Zhaoyang, take the photos.
- Here.

211
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,210
Alright.

212
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,090
Come on.

213
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,050
Can you two stand closer?

214
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,310
- Closer.
- Look more intimate.

215
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,730
- Closer.
- Smile.

216
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,160
Okay.

217
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,830
One, two, three... Cheese.

218
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,050
You're all here.

219
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:03,750
Brigadier.

220
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,560
- Brigadier.
- Dad.

221
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:07,840
Zong Qing.

222
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,715
Hello, Mrs. Wang.

223
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,310
Is Yangyang feeling better?

224
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,110
She's doing much better.

225
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,810
She asked me to say hello to you.

226
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,970
Good. Tell her to get better.

227
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,320
Once she's better, come visit us.

228
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,260
Sure, we will.

229
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,230
Mr. Wang, you two came just in time.

230
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,220
Take a family photo.

231
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:22,982
Come on, Mrs. Wang.

232
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,370
- No, let's do it together.
- Look at the baby.

233
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,240
Alright.

234
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,930
Jeez, I can't believe you.

235
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,930
Hurry up.

236
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:32,830
Exactly.

237
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,680
Look at me.

238
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,620
One, two, three.

239
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,690
Good, one more.

240
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,960
Smile. One, two, three... Smile.

241
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:44,770
Good.

242
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,400
Miss Tang.

243
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:50,940
Did Captain upset you?

244
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:52,520
No.

245
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,300
Let me show you a video.

246
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:57,890
What video?

247
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,990
During our escort mission,

248
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,470
we celebrated a group birthday.

249
00:11:03,737 --> 00:11:05,440
Captain was one of the birthday stars.

250
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,460
Brigadier permitted them

251
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,620
to call home.

252
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,910
Captain gave his slot to Zong Qing.

253
00:11:12,937 --> 00:11:14,604
He recorded a video just for you.

254
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,890
Tang Xin, you're probably

255
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,720
fast asleep right now.

256
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,800
We just entered the Indian Ocean.

257
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,030
Today,

258
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,360
we had a group birthday party
on the ship.

259
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,360
This is my first birthday

260
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,470
since we got together.

261
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:35,740
So

262
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,100
I have some things I want to say.

263
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,050
That direction leads to Wenzhou.

264
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,130
Every morning

265
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,090
and every time I end my shift,

266
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,026
I face that direction

267
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:51,710
and say good morning and good night.

268
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,950
After so many years on missions,

269
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,100
I only think
about completing the mission

270
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,670
when I look toward the horizon.

271
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,210
But now it's different.

272
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,770
Now,

273
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:07,471
I know you're waiting for me
in the far distance.

274
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:11,340
Good night.

275
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,450
I love you.

276
00:12:16,004 --> 00:12:17,130
See you in my dreams.

277
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,737
I'm here to take the phone.

278
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,130
Not mad anymore?

279
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:47,870
Who said I was mad?

280
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,130
Imagine this.

281
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,210
After landing on the beach,

282
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,180
you're under heavy enemy fire.

283
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,170
The only way through

284
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,150
is to crawl fast and low.

285
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,010
If you're too high or too slow,

286
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,130
you're dead.

287
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,040
Understand?

288
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,880
- Yes!
- Yes!

289
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,140
I'll demonstrate once.

290
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,280
Watch carefully.

291
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:46,990
Captain Wang.

292
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,710
You've done enough
physiotherapy for today.

293
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,000
Any more will overdo it.

294
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,330
It'll backfire.

295
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:54,490
Dr. Yang.

296
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,300
I have a solid foundation.

297
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,060
You don't need to worry.

298
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:06,410
Dr. Yang.

299
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:07,700
Mr. Bai.

300
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,800
How are you feeling today?

301
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,370
Not bad.

302
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,120
Mr. Bai.

303
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,382
Come here for a bit.

304
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,390
Mr. Bai.

305
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,490
We all want Captain Wang
to recover soon,

306
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,410
but being too eager

307
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,120
will only backfire.

308
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,650
Talk to her.

309
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:24,690
Okay, got it.

310
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,982
You've really thought it through?

311
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,140
Yes.

312
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,960
I just haven't told my dad yet.

313
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,690
Tell him?

314
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,170
You want to join our unit?

315
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:43,690
No.

316
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,690
I haven't decided

317
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,620
whether to work at a military hospital

318
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,120
or a civilian hospital.

319
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,270
I want to hear your opinion.

320
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,920
Each has its pros and cons.

321
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,290
If you choose a civilian hospital,

322
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,770
there are fewer regulations.

323
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,620
The work environment is freer.

324
00:14:58,737 --> 00:15:00,400
You'll also meet
a wider range of people.

325
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,530
But if you choose a military hospital,

326
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,780
you can wear a military uniform,

327
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,790
get the chance to join Peace Ark

328
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,680
and see another side of Zong Qing.

329
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:11,880
Another side?

330
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,650
For example,

331
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,010
fractured sole,

332
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:15,960
torn ligaments,

333
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,240
mild concussion,

334
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,490
tendon strain,

335
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,430
fractured foot

336
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,460
and so on.

337
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,570
What are these?

338
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:28,190
Zong Qing's medical records.

339
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,630
These are just the ones I remember.

340
00:15:32,915 --> 00:15:35,471
When it's a minor injury,
he'll leave after getting the medicine.

341
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,100
With how often

342
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,350
he shows up in the infirmary,

343
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,460
no one can keep track.

344
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,350
I know.

345
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,070
Every time

346
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,280
he says he suddenly has a mission

347
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,520
and can't come home,

348
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,270
I can already guess it.

349
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,280
If it's a small injury,

350
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,910
they might groan a bit.

351
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,360
But if it's serious,

352
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,220
he won't even let you see him.

353
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,530
Yangyang.

354
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,040
Did you hear Zong Qing

355
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,250
groan even once this time?

356
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,080
Zong Qing

357
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,660
couldn't fully understand

358
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,160
the pain you went through this time,

359
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,290
but I believe he tried his best

360
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,380
to share it with you.

361
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,470
I've wanted to move past this.

362
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,130
Hurry, let me show you something.

363
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,370
I went shopping today

364
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,580
and bought

365
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,150
some items I really like.

366
00:16:59,182 --> 00:17:00,693
You're not allowed to dislike them.

367
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,200
And then,

368
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,810
I don't know

369
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,210
our baby's gender,

370
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,310
so I bought clothes in neutral colors.

371
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,480
Look. Navy blue. Is it cute?

372
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:23,980
Cheng Yuan.

373
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,180
You rarely go out to play.

374
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,950
He isn't out to play.

375
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,730
He's going to the Marine Corps'
staff department to see his girlfriend.

376
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:33,880
Girlfriend?

377
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,350
Is she in the military too?

378
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,340
Yes.

379
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:39,850
A conscript in communications.
She's discharging this year.

380
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,180
Discharging this year?

381
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,448
You two probably
haven't seen each other in a while.

382
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,460
Almost half a year.

383
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,004
Our schedules can never match.

384
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,300
I'm training when she's off.

385
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,910
I'm on duty when she trains.

386
00:19:53,204 --> 00:19:55,071
We can't even find time
to talk on the phone.

387
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,160
Captain Wu, you're at fault.

388
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,140
You should at least
let him use the phone.

389
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,520
I never stopped him.

390
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,660
Wu Ke'er is a conscript.

391
00:20:03,893 --> 00:20:05,930
She barely gets to touch her phone
during the week.

392
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:07,337
And our schedules

393
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:08,680
never match.

394
00:20:09,071 --> 00:20:10,560
So they might not even get to meet

395
00:20:10,604 --> 00:20:11,693
even if he went.

396
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:13,426
It's not Captain's fault.

397
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:16,000
We talked on the phone
during the escort mission.

398
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,660
There are some things
we couldn't discuss.

399
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:21,980
Why?

400
00:20:25,848 --> 00:20:26,910
Let's get in the car first.

401
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:28,960
You drive.

402
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,850
Ms. Lan Yangyang.

403
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,440
You scared me.

404
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,720
Why didn't you make a sound?

405
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,420
Reading?

406
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:01,690
Let me see.

407
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,950
What book is making my wife so focused?

408
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,350
A specialized book?

409
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:14,640
Honey.

410
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,800
I've thought it through seriously.

411
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,693
I want to return to my profession.

412
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:21,720
Will you support me?

413
00:21:23,537 --> 00:21:24,990
When have I ever not supported you?

414
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,250
Here, take a look at my résumé.

415
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,410
What do you think?

416
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,270
Let me see.

417
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,620
(Lan Yangyang's Résumé)

418
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,210
Your résumé

419
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:46,970
probably

420
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,690
could use a little...

421
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:49,800
What are you doing?

422
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,071
Just say what's on your mind.

423
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:51,848
I'll go ahead then.

424
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,090
I think your résumé

425
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,440
lacks some specificity.

426
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,140
If you take it to an interview,

427
00:21:58,204 --> 00:21:59,715
it won't give you much of an edge.

428
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:01,980
You know your stuff.

429
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,270
How about this?

430
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,050
I'll help you amend it a little.

431
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,810
Continue reading your specialized book.

432
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,450
I promise you'll have a brand new résumé

433
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,930
when you finish this chapter.

434
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:31,648
Thank you, Captain.

435
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:37,540
(Chinese People's Liberation Army)

436
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,170
Thank you.

437
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:06,760
I'm sorry.

438
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,370
Cheng Yuan.

439
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,450
It's been two years since boot camp.

440
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,590
After two years,
all you can do is apologize?

441
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,230
I promise

442
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,380
to spend more time with you, okay?

443
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,850
Even if I delay the discharge,

444
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,290
it would only be until December.

445
00:23:22,382 --> 00:23:25,382
When I discharge in December,
how are you going to spend time with me?

446
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,200
Ke'er.

447
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,350
I really can't discharge.

448
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,140
From the first day I joined Blue Blade,

449
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,740
I had already made up my mind.

450
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:44,850
What about us?

451
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,000
I'm not trying to pressure you.

452
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,740
I just want to know

453
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,180
what your plan is for our future.

454
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,650
Are we going to break up

455
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:06,800
or get married?

456
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,248
Do you want me to wait for you,

457
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,730
join the military,

458
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,582
or stay apart forever?

459
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:30,930
Cheng Yuan.

460
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,850
I respect all your choices.

461
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,960
But first,

462
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,580
you owe me an answer.

463
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:47,610
I'll head back first.

464
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,600
Next time we meet,

465
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,693
you have to answer my question.

466
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,000
Eat up. You two should eat more.

467
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,982
You've both lost weight.

468
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:35,880
Exactly.

469
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,810
Zong Qing lost weight

470
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:38,960
taking care of Yangyang.

471
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,210
Eat more.

472
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:41,980
Mom, I'm not tired.

473
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,300
I lost weight from training.

474
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,090
Yangyang

475
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,080
needs to eat more. Here.

476
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:53,070
Seeing you two like this,

477
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,530
your dad and I feel reassured.

478
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,170
Dad, Mom.

479
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,040
I have something to discuss.

480
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,270
I want to study medicine.

481
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,490
That's great.

482
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,360
That's wonderful news.

483
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,600
What's so wonderful about it?

484
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,800
Her health matters the most.

485
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,320
Yangyang.

486
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,250
You can't wear yourself out again

487
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,720
before you recover fully.

488
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,530
Zong Qing, keep an eye on her.

489
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,410
Mom.

490
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:34,590
Look at me. I've recovered.

491
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,120
I made this decision
after serious consideration,

492
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,840
so I hope you'll all support me.

493
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,110
I support you. I fully support you.

494
00:26:43,337 --> 00:26:44,671
Let me say something too.

495
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:45,970
As long as you're healthy,

496
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:47,950
I'll support whatever you do.

497
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,920
I also support you,
no matter what you do.

498
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:53,730
Just take good care of your health.

499
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,680
I know, Mom. Rest assured.

500
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:58,970
Okay.

501
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,140
It's a unanimous approval. Here.

502
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,370
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

503
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,370
This trip to Roman was eventful,

504
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,140
but at least we got some results.

505
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:11,920
I still want to thank you.

506
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,480
By the way,

507
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,150
since you came back
from the Roman Islands,

508
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,160
have you thought about

509
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,800
your informant's

510
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,650
identity?

511
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,560
I asked him before.

512
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:28,330
He refused to tell me.

513
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,930
He wants to give you tips

514
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,240
but not reveal himself.

515
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,060
It's understandable.

516
00:27:33,604 --> 00:27:34,760
But this time it's different.

517
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,030
He was able to accurately track

518
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,060
Han Changzhou's coordinates
in the Roman Islands

519
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,210
and also

520
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:40,860
knew which hotel he stayed in.

521
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,840
This isn't something
the average person could know.

522
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,150
Which means

523
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,160
he knows everything happening
around Han Changzhou.

524
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:51,160
The more he knows,

525
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,540
the greater the risk.

526
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,640
Han Changzhou and the rest

527
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,520
must want to find out who he is too.

528
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:00,440
You're saying
they're investigating him as well?

529
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,370
Only five people in the company

530
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,810
have access to top-secret information.

531
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,730
Who else could it be?

532
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,850
Mr. Han, there's one more person.

533
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,450
Who?

534
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:28,970
Xu Genshui.

535
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,890
Didn't he die a long time ago?

536
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:33,930
Yes,

537
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,900
but he also knew our core secrets.

538
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,700
It just suddenly came to my mind.

539
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,220
Yes.

540
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,670
Xu. Xu Genshui.

541
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,960
That was years ago.

542
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,840
Did he have any family?

543
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,790
No. Xu had no children.

544
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,120
His parents passed away long ago.

545
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:58,530
Here.

546
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,220
Send someone

547
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,390
to visit his parents' graves

548
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:04,680
and leave a bouquet.

549
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,340
After all,

550
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,137
Xu contributed a lot to the company.

551
00:29:12,137 --> 00:29:14,170
Speaking of,
I have one more thing to tell you.

552
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,004
Since coming back from Roman,

553
00:29:17,026 --> 00:29:19,210
Han Yuhang keeps asking me
to set up a meeting with you.

554
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,515
He wants to treat you to a meal.

555
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,250
Why treat me to a meal?

556
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,360
I'm not even close to him.

557
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,880
He said

558
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,930
you saved him,

559
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,690
no matter what.

560
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,810
He insists on thanking you properly.

561
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,420
It wasn't me who saved him.

562
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,980
It was the Chinese Navy escort fleet.

563
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,440
Aren't you the captain?

564
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,070
Besides,

565
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,400
he won't know where to find the others

566
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,826
even if he wants to invite them.

567
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,810
Next time he brings it up,

568
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:46,700
just tell him

569
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:49,190
I appreciate the gesture,
but I'll skip the meal.

570
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,650
It's just a meal.

571
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:55,210
He's not a bad guy.

572
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,940
I know that.

573
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,120
He's not a bad guy.

574
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,680
He just doesn't like me much,

575
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:08,800
yet likes you too much.

576
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,130
That's why

577
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,650
having a meal is perfect.

578
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,670
Let him see our relationship
with his own eyes.

579
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,115
Then he'll stop bothering me.

580
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:25,640
Mr. Han.

581
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,140
Mr. Han.

582
00:30:30,048 --> 00:30:30,920
You wanted to see me?

583
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:32,910
Sit.

584
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:41,820
Lately, I've tried many ways

585
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:45,530
to get close
to my dad and my brother's computers.

586
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:48,150
But they guard them too tightly.

587
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,390
I haven't had any chance.

588
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,360
Not to mention their phones.

589
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,480
I asked you here today

590
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,960
to help me think of a way.

591
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,860
See if there's

592
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,280
a better

593
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,500
or more direct way.

594
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,170
Do you get it?

595
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:02,780
There's definitely a way.

596
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:07,093
But it'll require the right opportunity.

597
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,290
How about this? Let me handle it.

598
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,915
It's easier for me to handle this.

599
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,650
Alright.

600
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:15,871
(The tomb of the late mother Li Shumin
The tomb of the late father Xu Linshan)

601
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:22,660
(Blessings to Future Generations)

602
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:26,660
I've long heard

603
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,750
about Wenzhou Marine Museum.

604
00:32:28,093 --> 00:32:29,626
I just never had the chance to come.

605
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:30,860
It's quite pretty.

606
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:31,650
Yes.

607
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,030
Hello.

608
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,170
Can I ask

609
00:32:37,537 --> 00:32:39,480
which exhibition hall
has the underwater relics?

610
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,620
Halls 3 and 6 both have them.

611
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:42,680
Okay, thanks.

612
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,671
After following
the underwater relics smuggling cases

613
00:33:05,715 --> 00:33:06,470
for so long,

614
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,100
this is the first time

615
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,740
I've seen so many real relics.

616
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:10,800
Yeah.

617
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:14,190
There are still so many
sleeping under the sea.

618
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:17,050
Alright. Come along, follow me.

619
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,860
These sunken ship relics here

620
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,460
were just recently salvaged.

621
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,130
It's said that a reporter

622
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:25,300
provided the lead
to Cultural Relics Bureau.

623
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,404
Come and take a look.

624
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,840
Come over here and take a look.

625
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,710
These sunken ship relics

626
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,940
are from a Song Dynasty merchant ship

627
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,782
that has been lying underwater
for 800 years.

628
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:40,210
You're saying

629
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,880
someone had already

630
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,100
visited the grave and left flowers
when you got there?

631
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,010
Yes.

632
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:50,493
Are you sure
you didn't find the wrong grave?

633
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,240
Mr. Han, we checked.

634
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:54,210
It was the gravestone of Xu's parents.

635
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:57,960
We all know

636
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,230
that Xu and his parents

637
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,550
had no other relatives.

638
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,610
Who visited the grave

639
00:34:02,671 --> 00:34:03,590
and left the flowers?

640
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:07,510
Go keep watch.

641
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,820
See who left the flowers.

642
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,080
Yes, Mr. Han.

643
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,860
Mr. Han, are you thinking that this...

644
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,050
Let's wait and see.

645
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,360
Feeling better?

646
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,280
I'm fine now.

647
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,830
We should've visited you much earlier.

648
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,970
Sorry we took this long.

649
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,630
Actually,

650
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:40,220
it should've been me visiting you first.

651
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,160
I need to take care of the baby.

652
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,737
Wang Lang wouldn't let me go either.

653
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,520
I felt embarrassed too.

654
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,650
What kind of superior's wife am I?

655
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,050
Mrs. Wang.

656
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,760
I already told Zong Qing

657
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,190
not to bring this up again.

658
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,200
Leave it in the past.

659
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,290
Yangyang.

660
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,320
Are you feeling better?

661
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,770
Much better.

662
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,730
Zhaoyang, take me to see your sister.

663
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:10,170
Sure.

664
00:35:16,204 --> 00:35:17,870
Mrs. Wang,
I'll help you wash the fruits.

665
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:18,570
No need.

666
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,610
- Really.
- It's alright.

667
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,330
Xihe.

668
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:43,290
You need to grow up healthy and happy.

669
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:51,850
Mr. Han.

670
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,210
Captain Wu.

671
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,050
Hello.

672
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,760
I finally got you to meet me.

673
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,570
Mr. Han, you're too polite.

674
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,050
My distinguished guests, please sit.

675
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,410
Drinking is against
military regulations.

676
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,210
Not even a sip?

677
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,560
Here's the thing, Captain Wu.

678
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,671
Please don't misunderstand.

679
00:36:23,671 --> 00:36:25,490
I just wanted to offer you
a proper toast

680
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,690
to thank you for saving my life.

681
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:31,010
Let me make this clear.

682
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:32,850
It wasn't me who saved you.

683
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:35,170
It was the Chinese Navy escort fleet.

684
00:36:35,382 --> 00:36:37,089
We just responded
to the distress signal.

685
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,490
We didn't know
who was on the ship.

686
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:38,890
Yes.

687
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,410
From your perspective,

688
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:42,530
that's what happened.

689
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:43,850
But in my eyes,

690
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,780
it was you who saved my life.

691
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:47,910
It's just that

692
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,560
I don't have the ability

693
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,410
to invite everyone who helped me.

694
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,410
But speaking of thanks,

695
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,370
I also need to thank you.

696
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,300
What for?

697
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,130
I heard from Tang Xin

698
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,850
that if you hadn't risked yourself

699
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,730
to save her in the Roman Islands,

700
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,010
you wouldn't have ended up
in danger yourself.

701
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,980
What I did doesn't even compare

702
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,290
to what you all did.

703
00:37:13,782 --> 00:37:14,804
How about this?

704
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:16,410
I'll toast you with water

705
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:17,570
on behalf of Tang Xin.

706
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:18,530
No.

707
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,530
I must be the one to toast you.

708
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:21,610
Mr. Han.

709
00:37:22,182 --> 00:37:23,850
Wu Si and I will toast you together.

710
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:26,690
Alright, here.

711
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,170
Bottoms up.

712
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,290
Sit.

713
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:43,850
Why are you here?

714
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,880
I was dining nearby

715
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,290
and heard Yuhang was here,

716
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,570
so I came to say hi.

717
00:37:51,871 --> 00:37:53,170
I haven't introduced myself yet.

718
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:56,010
Han Yutian, Yuhang's older brother.

719
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,700
Yuhang, why didn't you introduce me?

720
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:06,970
This is Tang Xin,
a reporter for Minghua News.

721
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,010
Hello.

722
00:38:08,248 --> 00:38:09,860
And this is the one
I mentioned before...

723
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,400
Wu Si.

724
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:14,370
Captain Wu? Pleasure to meet you.

725
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,010
I didn't expect to meet you here.

726
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,290
Pleasure to meet you.

727
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,130
Yuhang, you didn't tell me in advance

728
00:38:22,248 --> 00:38:24,115
that you have such an important guest.

729
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:26,850
Hello, Miss Tang.

730
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,730
My brother talks about you all the time.

731
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,290
No time like the present.

732
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,570
I must toast you today. Here.

733
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,680
Thank you for saving my brother's life.

734
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,050
You probably didn't hear earlier.

735
00:38:37,093 --> 00:38:38,671
We have strict rules in the military.

736
00:38:38,693 --> 00:38:39,570
No drinking at all.

737
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,610
There's a saying

738
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,140
that a general may disregard orders
when he's in the field.

739
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:45,715
Come on.

740
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:47,930
Mr. Han.

741
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,560
Military rules are strict.

742
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,490
I'll drink this for my boyfriend.

743
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:55,610
Alright.

744
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:57,130
Good for you.

745
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,610
Sit.

746
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,840
Yuhang told me

747
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,810
you're the captain
of Blue Blade Special Ops Team.

748
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,050
Your family

749
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,200
must be proud of you.

750
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:19,370
Mr. Han.

751
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,490
The four of us are here.

752
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:22,760
Why are you

753
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,330
only talking to my boyfriend?

754
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,710
I ran into a savior, didn't I?

755
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,450
That's why
I chatted with him a bit more.

756
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:32,690
Is your family in the military too?

757
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,130
It's almost time.

758
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,400
Sorry, I'm on duty today.

759
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,537
I have to return to the base.

760
00:39:41,537 --> 00:39:42,515
You guys can eat first.

761
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,490
Leaving so soon?

762
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,930
Tang Xin, call me if anything happens.

763
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:49,170
Goodbye.

764
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,850
Did I say something wrong?

765
00:40:02,315 --> 00:40:03,720
Military is strict with timing.

766
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,715
Don't take it personally.

767
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,690
I understand.

768
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:08,920
Alright then.

769
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,280
I have another table of guests.

770
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,250
I'll head over first.

771
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:12,690
Yuhang.

772
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:14,370
Take care.

773
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:22,370
I'm sorry.

774
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,010
How did your brother
know we were eating here?

775
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:29,290
He was probably eating next door

776
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:30,690
and happened to see us.

777
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:31,930
Forget him.

778
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:33,810
Let's enjoy our meal. Come on.

779
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,490
Try this.

780
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,290
It's their specialty.

781
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,570
Mr. Han.

782
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:45,810
I wanted to ask something.

783
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,280
Your family business is so big.

784
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,130
How do you and your brother
divide things?

785
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:54,360
How else can it be divided?

786
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,690
It's all up to my dad.

787
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,610
After I came back from abroad,

788
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:59,930
my dad gave me

789
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,490
some of the more charitable operations.

790
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,330
Like the foundation
and the retirement homes.

791
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,300
All those don't focus on profits.

792
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,500
As for the core businesses

793
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,930
like ocean shipping, fishing

794
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,960
and aquatic farming,

795
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,490
they're managed by my dad and brother.

796
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:22,480
Report.

797
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,060
Enter.

798
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,490
Lin Lan steamed buns for you.

799
00:41:30,515 --> 00:41:31,915
She asked me to bring them for you.

800
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:32,930
You visited her again?

801
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,610
I went with Yangyang.

802
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,250
How is Yangyang?

803
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:40,170
She told me
she wants to go back to being a doctor.

804
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:43,490
I think
she has moved on from the miscarriage.

805
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,080
What do you think?

806
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,480
I just want her to be okay.

807
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,610
I've already sworn to myself

808
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:58,480
never to let her get hurt again.

809
00:41:59,337 --> 00:42:00,730
She can do whatever she wants to do.

810
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:03,182
No matter how big of a deal it is,
I've got it covered.

811
00:42:06,226 --> 00:42:07,737
Why are you looking at me like that?

812
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,720
I think you've changed.

813
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,370
You've matured.

814
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:22,170
Do you remember when we first met?

815
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,730
You had just joined the company.

816
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,590
You thought the legendary Marine Corps

817
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,490
was not what you had imagined.

818
00:42:30,537 --> 00:42:32,826
The difference was too drastic
that you wanted to quit.

819
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,720
But Brigadier

820
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,080
thought you had great potential

821
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,180
and insisted on keeping you.

822
00:42:38,582 --> 00:42:40,250
So I sent Cheng Yuan to spar with you.

823
00:42:40,604 --> 00:42:41,893
I also specifically told him

824
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,490
you were a spoiled recruit

825
00:42:43,737 --> 00:42:45,250
and that he should drill you hard

826
00:42:45,315 --> 00:42:46,404
and train you properly.

827
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,970
But you gave up
halfway through the match.

828
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,850
I was wondering

829
00:42:51,004 --> 00:42:53,337
why Cheng Yuan
wasn't even calibrating his gun.

830
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,120
He fired blindly
and still hit the target.

831
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,600
Turns out you teamed up to humiliate me.

832
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:01,610
Cheng Yuan was young.

833
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,090
He's grown up now.

834
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:06,330
Seeing you all grow up

835
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:07,930
makes me happy.

836
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,570
Hold up.

837
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:12,170
Your tone doesn't sound right.

838
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:14,210
We're the same age.

839
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:16,040
Don't take advantage of me.

840
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:25,450
Almost a decade has passed in a flash.

841
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:29,690
You, me,

842
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:33,930
Cheng Yuan, and Wang Chen...

843
00:43:35,026 --> 00:43:36,915
We've all known each other
for a long time.

844
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:43,290
Alright.

845
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:44,970
Don't overthink it.

846
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:46,890
