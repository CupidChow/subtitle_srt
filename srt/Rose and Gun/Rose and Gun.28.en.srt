00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,530

Double-time march!

45
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,250
This drill is to follow
real combat standards.

46
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,690
One hit equals elimination.

47
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,290
If captured, tearing off your armband
means elimination.

48
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,390
Keeping your armband
means you're a hostage.

49
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,520
Focus on combat.

50
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,490
Aim for results.

51
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,890
Dad, Mom.

52
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,890
What? He fell asleep?

53
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,050
Look at him.

54
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,210
Tang.

55
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,490
Look at his finger.

56
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,050
- He's sleeping so soundly.
- He didn't know you were coming home.

57
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,310
You're recovering fast.

58
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,570
Yeah, I've been discharged, haven't I?

59
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,770
Next time, leave the TV volume on.

60
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,170
He snores so loudly.
I don't think he'll wake up.

61
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,450
It's fine.

62
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,730
I can read the subtitles.

63
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,160
If it's really bad,
tell him to sleep in the room.

64
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,290
It's okay.

65
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,730
Your dad's used to sleeping
on the couch.

66
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,160
Fine?

67
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,920
You always spoil him.

68
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,170
How?

69
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:46,690
Look at you.

70
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,450
You're too used to it,
and you don't even notice it.

71
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,930
A marriage

72
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,770
is all about compromise.

73
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,370
But you've been compromising
for half your life.

74
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,930
What are you getting out of it?

75
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,940
You youngsters nowadays

76
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,230
always wonder,

77
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,680
"What's in it for me?"

78
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,530
Well,

79
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,690
I care about nobody

80
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,370
but your dad.

81
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:19,570
Mom.

82
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,330
I want to tell you something.

83
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,170
Here.

84
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,130
Listen carefully. Don't be surprised.

85
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,290
Okay, go ahead.

86
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,770
Wu Si proposed to me.

87
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,410
Did... Did you say yes?

88
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,370
I said I'd give him an answer

89
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,715
after he returns from the drill.

90
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,490
Well, once he's back from the drill...

91
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,770
When he's back from the drill...

92
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,530
Are... Are you sure?
Have you thought it through?

93
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:55,810
Mom.

94
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,530
Well...

95
00:04:59,293 --> 00:05:01,290
Do you and Dad agree
with us getting married?

96
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,610
Of course your dad will approve it.

97
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:07,950
If you went over

98
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,370
to whisper in his ear

99
00:05:09,404 --> 00:05:11,090
and tell him that Wu Si proposed to you,

100
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,190
I bet he would shoot right up

101
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,370
and start laughing.

102
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,090
What about you?

103
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,330
Do you approve of it?

104
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,250
Me?

105
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:27,850
Xin.

106
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,650
Are you mentally prepared for this?

107
00:05:34,204 --> 00:05:35,570
Being a military wife isn't easy.

108
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,330
There, there, Mom.

109
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,370
It's nothing. I'm happy.

110
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,250
Do you remember

111
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,537
there was this one time
when you got in trouble in school?

112
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,540
When was that?

113
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,280
When you were in first grade,

114
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,650
your teacher gave you

115
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,170
a word-matching exercise.

116
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,360
"Little goldfish", "Dad",

117
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,570
"playing basketball",
and "swimming in the sea."

118
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,120
You were the only kid in class
who got it wrong.

119
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,330
"The little goldfish
is playing basketball."

120
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,570
"Dad is swimming in the sea."

121
00:06:16,271 --> 00:06:17,090
Swimming in the sea.

122
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:17,810
Right?

123
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,130
How could you be laughing?

124
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:27,570
Mom...

125
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,530
You have no idea

126
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,970
how my heart

127
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,670
ached

128
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,530
when I heard that.

129
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,090
Mom.

130
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,530
There's something else.

131
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,490
I think we should keep the proposal

132
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,090
from Dad now.

133
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,850
- Why?
- Well,

134
00:06:53,915 --> 00:06:55,610
his birthday
is around the corner, right?

135
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,130
I want to make it

136
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,330
a birthday surprise for him.

137
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,330
Okay?

138
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:02,850
That's a good idea.

139
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:03,770
Great.

140
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,930
Good day, Chairman.

141
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,940
Greetings, Chairman.

142
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,130
There are two items

143
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,530
on today's agenda.

144
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,090
Number one.

145
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,610
Regarding what the former chairman
and Mr. Yutian did,

146
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,090
it's in the past now.

147
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,770
From now on,

148
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,770
I don't want anyone

149
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,770
to bring it up or gossip about it again.

150
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,330
Number two.

151
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,270
Since we're restructuring,

152
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,940
our focus shouldn't just

153
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,410
be on business operations.

154
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,700
The HR system and personnel structure

155
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,170
must also be core areas of reform.

156
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,030
The reform plans

157
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,370
have already been sent to you all.

158
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,650
Please review them right after this.

159
00:07:56,693 --> 00:07:57,871
If there are any concerns,

160
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,630
let's discuss and resolve them together.

161
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,250
From now on,

162
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,890
I don't want to see anyone

163
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,330
in the Changzhou Group

164
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,650
doing dirty or shady things

165
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,130
under the name of the group.

166
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,570
This isn't just about individuals.

167
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,330
It concerns
the group's entire reputation.

168
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,050
So I urge you all

169
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,570
to take this seriously...

170
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:23,290
Dad.

171
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,250
Aren't you going
to say goodbye to Yuhang?

172
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:28,890
Let's go.

173
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:51,460
(Red Team)

174
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,570
Align to the right.

175
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,010
Eyes front.

176
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:02,890
At ease.

177
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,090
Attention.

178
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:05,370
Reporting in!

179
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,250
Come in.

180
00:09:06,448 --> 00:09:07,330
Permission granted.

181
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,570
Chief.

182
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,930
Blue Blade First Squad, assembled.

183
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:11,850
Awaiting orders.

184
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,426
Our forces will begin the assault
on L Island in two days.

185
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,530
To ensure the main force lands safely,

186
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,120
you are ordered to infiltrate L Island

187
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,530
and carry out a decapitation strike.

188
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:20,410
Yes, Sir!

189
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,640
You have only 48 hours.

190
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,080
You must complete the mission

191
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,120
within those 48 hours.

192
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,850
Yes, Sir!

193
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,570
Here.

194
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,490
Let's take a look at L Island's terrain

195
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,170
and study the landing points.

196
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,120
Tang Xin?

197
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,515
You're out of the hospital?

198
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,360
Yeah, I'm out.

199
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,530
Tang Xin!

200
00:09:42,226 --> 00:09:43,510
You really are something else.

201
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,370
You always managed to cause a commotion.

202
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,840
We were all worried sick about you.

203
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,290
I'm fine. Don't worry.

204
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,770
Tell me.

205
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,490
Who was really behind this?

206
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,120
Get back to work.

207
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,170
Don't crowd her

208
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,190
the moment she's back.

209
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:57,960
Get to work.

210
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,650
Go on now.

211
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:03,910
How's your recovery going?

212
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,010
Almost there.

213
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,670
While you were hospitalized,

214
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,490
the Public Security Bureau
came looking for me.

215
00:10:09,493 --> 00:10:11,010
They wanted to thank you

216
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,982
for the intel you gave.

217
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,330
Any updates on the case?

218
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,010
They didn't say anything.

219
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,130
And I didn't press.

220
00:10:17,137 --> 00:10:19,315
But they asked me
to pass this message on to you.

221
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,070
Well,

222
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,290
for your own safety,

223
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,330
you should

224
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,004
stay out of this case
as much as possible.

225
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,370
Just provide intel

226
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,450
if you have it.

227
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,890
Let's hope I even get the chance
to help again.

228
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,290
Dr. Wan.

229
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,740
Anesthesiology resident Lan Yangyang

230
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,090
reporting for duty!

231
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,370
Great!

232
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,090
Looking sharp.

233
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,330
Everyone, spare me a second.

234
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,850
Let me introduce a new colleague.

235
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:52,920
Lan Yangyang,

236
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,822
a graduate of Wenzhou University
Medical School,

237
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,050
anesthesiology major.

238
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,450
She's our department's new resident.

239
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,520
Hello, everyone.
My name is Lan Yangyang.

240
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,090
I'm looking forward to working with you.

241
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,130
Welcome!

242
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,650
Welcome!

243
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,010
Stop.

244
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:30,930
Into the water.

245
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,330
Let me emphasize again.

246
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:05,930
For this battle,

247
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,280
we must fully embrace the spirit
of coordinated operations.

248
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,200
No squad or individual is allowed
to act rashly for personal credit.

249
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,404
- Understood!
- Understood!

250
00:12:12,693 --> 00:12:14,560
Return to camp
and check on all deployments.

251
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,850
Correct any problems immediately.

252
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,690
Yes, Sir.

253
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:20,930
Chief.

254
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,200
Blue Blade Special Ops Team,
First Squad,

255
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,850
has successfully landed on L Island.

256
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:25,450
Noted.

257
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,050
Yes, Sir.

258
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,130
Captain, to bypass
the Blue Team's defense line,

259
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,450
we'll have to cross this forest

260
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,290
to reach their command center.

261
00:13:15,782 --> 00:13:17,848
Everyone, be extra careful
during the operation.

262
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,960
The Blue Team will never
abandon this forest's defense.

263
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,320
If it were me,

264
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,230
I'd ambush here, here,

265
00:13:26,782 --> 00:13:28,137
- and here.
- Captain.

266
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,490
Six Blue Team soldiers

267
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,010
are moving in from the northwest.

268
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,680
Distance, 250 to 300 meters.

269
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,050
Take cover. Prepare for an ambush.

270
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,170
What are you doing, Chen?

271
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:48,880
Mom...

272
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,100
What is this, Chen?

273
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,890
I was just out grocery shopping,

274
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,810
and you threw away your support gear?

275
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,450
You can't walk on your own yet.

276
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,650
Not only what you're doing

277
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,530
isn't helping,

278
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,810
but it might cause contractures

279
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,810
in your knee or ankle joints.

280
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,450
If you keep this up,

281
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:10,050
all your past rehab efforts
will go to waste.

282
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,610
Mom, I just wanted
to try walking without the support.

283
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,850
It's okay, Mom. Let me do it.

284
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,000
It's not my first injury.

285
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,730
I can handle it.

286
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,560
Mom, you do know dead weights
have no place

287
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,450
in the Marine Corps.

288
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,810
If I don't recover soon,

289
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,970
I'll be a burden to them.

290
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,210
I understand how you feel.

291
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:34,490
When you were out on escort duty,

292
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:35,800
Zijian

293
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,800
told me a lot about you.

294
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,050
I know how hard you've worked

295
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,330
for the honor of being a soldier.

296
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,930
But I'm a doctor.

297
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,730
And I urge you

298
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:52,210
to do rehab scientifically.

299
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,850
The more impatient you are,

300
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,930
the worse the outcome.

301
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,450
Mom.

302
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,210
Let me try again.

303
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,770
Just this once.

304
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:06,850
No way.

305
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,930
You have to use the equipment to walk.

306
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,930
Come on. I'll watch you.

307
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,170
Here. Go slowly.

308
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,010
Take it slow.

309
00:17:54,604 --> 00:17:55,530
What's the situation?

310
00:17:57,293 --> 00:17:58,960
The military dogs
are searching up ahead.

311
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,290
Everyone, attention.

312
00:18:02,337 --> 00:18:03,893
Quickly pass through the forest ahead.

313
00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:04,893
Watch out for the dogs.

314
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,010
Move out!

315
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,090
There's no deployment
in that area, right?

316
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,471
Reporting in!

317
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:14,410
Come in.

318
00:19:15,204 --> 00:19:17,130
A small enemy unit
has entered the forest ahead.

319
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,330
Keep watching.

320
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:18,970
Yes, Sir!

321
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:20,890
Here,

322
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:21,370
Chief.

323
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,360
A small enemy unit, huh?

324
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:27,770
What's your take?

325
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,000
I think

326
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:30,770
the red team

327
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,490
broke through our blockade

328
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,570
and infiltrated our command center.

329
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:37,050
They're likely attempting
a decapitation mission.

330
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,570
If so, let's lure them here

331
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,090
from there.

332
00:19:43,137 --> 00:19:44,050
We'll wipe them out

333
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,160
right there and then.

334
00:19:46,737 --> 00:19:48,270
(Tang Xin: Are you still busy?)

335
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:50,660
(Captain Wu, where are you now?)

336
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,890
(Today marks your seventh day out.)

337
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,370
(Your girlfriend's birthday
is coming up.)

338
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,982
(Will you show up unexpectedly?)

339
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06,170
(I guess not. Never mind, then.)

340
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:07,890
(As long as you're safe,)

341
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,170
(we can celebrate it later
when you're back.)

342
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,810
Hello, Mr. Han?

343
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,890
Your birthday's coming up.
How are you planning to celebrate it?

344
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,330
How did you know?

345
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,890
If you care enough,

346
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,570
you'll definitely find out.

347
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,240
Care to do me the honor?

348
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,570
Let me host your birthday this year.

349
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,570
You're so busy.
I wouldn't want to trouble you.

350
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,240
I've already made plans
to eat at home with my parents.

351
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,170
You can invite them too.

352
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,160
I went through a lot of trouble

353
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,330
to book this restaurant.

354
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,290
Trust me,

355
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,170
you'll all love it.

356
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,190
But my dad insists

357
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,930
on cooking me a birthday meal at home.

358
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,250
He already bought the ingredients.

359
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,490
Maybe next time. Thanks for remembering.

360
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,130
Alright.

361
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,890
I won't force it.

362
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:11,890
Bye.

363
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,170
Search team, listen up!

364
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,450
Split into two teams,
and advance in a triangle formation!

365
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,330
Team One to the left!
Team Two to the right!

366
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,540
Keep advancing!

367
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,190
Expand the search coverage!

368
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:59,370
Looks like

369
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,370
we've been exposed.

370
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:02,690
That makes no sense.

371
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,370
We didn't mess up any part of the plan.

372
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,540
The enemy probably had infrared sensors

373
00:22:06,915 --> 00:22:09,610
or some similar tech installed
in the dense forest we passed through.

374
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:10,648
And we didn't notice them.

375
00:22:10,671 --> 00:22:12,530
Captain, should we avoid them or engage?

376
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,650
Since they've found out, let's engage.

377
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,970
We can't let them block our objective.

378
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,090
Fall back to the forest
and prepare for combat.

379
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:25,250
Move.

380
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,340
(Chinese Naval Special Forces)

381
00:24:47,493 --> 00:24:48,737
(Chinese Naval Special Forces)

382
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:38,490
All units, attention!

383
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,570
Intel reports a red team squad

384
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,910
has infiltrated our camp.

385
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,260
Report any developments to each other.

386
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:46,490
Team Two, copy that.

387
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:48,170
Captain.

388
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:51,090
The forest is now
the blue team's primary sweep zone.

389
00:25:51,137 --> 00:25:52,530
We can't always stay ahead of them.

390
00:25:52,537 --> 00:25:53,915
And we don't have time to stall.

391
00:25:54,071 --> 00:25:55,604
In that case, we'll take a shortcut.

392
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:58,048
We circle
to the outer east perimeter of HQ.

393
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:58,850
Captain.

394
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,320
The drone just picked up

395
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,410
an electric fence ahead.

396
00:26:01,471 --> 00:26:03,804
Also, multiple patrols are active
in front of the fence.

397
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:05,850
Everyone, listen up.

398
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,330
We'll cross the fence in secret.

399
00:26:08,048 --> 00:26:09,760
We can't leave any trace
for the blue team.

400
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,150
That's the only way to move safely.

401
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,530
Zhou Keyang, Dai Wei, and Ye Haiyang.

402
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,330
Seize some of the blue team gear

403
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:15,970
for backup.

404
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:16,930
Yes, Sir!

405
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,490
That patient today was so strange.

406
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,670
Yeah, I thought so too.

407
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,360
- Right? It's...
- Miss. You're off work.

408
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,330
Let's go home.

409
00:27:07,537 --> 00:27:08,850
This is my husband.

410
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,382
He picks me up every day after work.

411
00:27:10,426 --> 00:27:11,448
Where's your husband?

412
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,810
He can't make it today.

413
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,210
I'll head back alone.

414
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:17,450
Then let us give you a ride.

415
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:19,170
No need. We're not going the same way.

416
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,550
That's okay. The car's downstairs.

417
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:23,090
It's really okay.
I'm used to going alone.

418
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:24,740
You go ahead.

419
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,440
See you tomorrow.

420
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,490
At least share your ride status with me.

421
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,700
Let me know when you get home.

422
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:29,770
Will do. Don't worry.

423
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:30,410
Bye.

424
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:31,290
- Bye.
- Bye.

425
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:31,930
Bye.

426
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,930
There's a three-minute gap
between the two patrol teams

427
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:25,650
crossing paths.

428
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,410
We must pass during that window.

429
00:28:28,204 --> 00:28:29,410
- Understood.
- Understood.

430
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,650
Ye Haiyang, Dai Wei. Go!

431
00:28:54,137 --> 00:28:55,570
Everyone, move through one by one.

432
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:19,290
Reporting in!

433
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:20,280
Come in.

434
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,250
Chief, reporting in.

435
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,370
Search Team Six

436
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,330
found no enemy activity.

437
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,290
Understood. Return to base.

438
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,170
Yes, Sir!

439
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:35,890
Chief, aside from the team
that was completely wiped out,

440
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:38,410
the other five teams reported nothing.

441
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:41,210
Given the red team's combat discipline,

442
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:42,350
it's very likely

443
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,848
they've already infiltrated the camp.

444
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,170
Since they're here,

445
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,890
let's welcome them properly.

446
00:30:00,337 --> 00:30:01,410
Something's off, Captain.

447
00:30:01,471 --> 00:30:03,030
The blue team knows we've infiltrated,

448
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,250
so why such loose defenses?

449
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,071
Be on guard. It might be a trap.

450
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:08,493
We'll observe first before acting.

451
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:09,410
Captain.

452
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,020
Their camp is heavily guarded
on the outside, but lax inside.

453
00:30:13,026 --> 00:30:14,182
There's definitely an ambush.

454
00:30:14,337 --> 00:30:15,880
We don't have a good opening right now.

455
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,530
If so, we'll hold position overnight

456
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,671
and wait for the opportunity.

457
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:19,293
Understood.

458
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:14,930
You two may go now.

459
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,410
Leave the car.

460
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:19,490
I'll drive myself.

461
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,740
(Is Wu Si coming back today?)

462
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:14,410
Captain.

463
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:15,930
Morning is coming.

464
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:17,910
Should we make a move?

465
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,226
Otherwise, we'll lose our chance.

466
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,770
No, that's too risky.

467
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,370
If we all go in at once,

468
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,210
we could be wiped out.

469
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,250
Send in two men in disguise
to sneak in.

470
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:33,170
Wait until the blue team changes shifts.

471
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,848
We then infiltrate the command center.

472
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,130
Captain, I'll do it.

473
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,210
I'll go with Dai Wei.

474
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,070
No need. I'll go with Dai Wei.

475
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,570
You stay.

476
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:40,290
Captain.

477
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,040
Don't worry.

478
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,130
If we don't get a shot,

479
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,010
we'll stay inside.

480
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,670
It might even work as a surprise move.

481
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,570
If it's really a trap,

482
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,537
the blue team
won't declare us dead just like that.

483
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,290
Zong Qing, hold your position.
No rash moves.

484
00:32:49,293 --> 00:32:51,010
Your mission is to keep watch

485
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,515
and keep your eyes
on the highest commander.

486
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:54,730
Understood.

487
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:55,370
Dai Wei.

488
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,000
Here.

489
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,026
Change into a disguise.

490
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,250
Captain and Dai Wei are inside.

491
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:17,010
Let's go!

492
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:33,370
Captain Zong.

493
00:34:33,626 --> 00:34:35,090
Judging by the blue team's reaction,

494
00:34:35,293 --> 00:34:37,490
Captain and Dai Wei were spotted
as soon as they got in.

495
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:39,890
They've truly turned the tables on us

496
00:34:40,137 --> 00:34:42,050
by making Captain and Dai Wei
go in on purpose.

497
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,010
That proves Captain
was right all along.

498
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:45,930
If we'd all gone in,

499
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,140
we would've been wiped out.

500
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,090
Call Lan Yangyang.

501
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,170
Reporting to Miss Tang.

502
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,770
Your gift's been bought.

503
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,490
I didn't forget your birthday.

504
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:12,810
Pretty thoughtful, Lan Yangyang.
Well done.

505
00:35:13,226 --> 00:35:15,248
It's the weekend.
You're not at work, right?

506
00:35:15,271 --> 00:35:17,730
Come on, I'm treating you to a feast.

507
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,850
Can we make it dinner instead?

508
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:24,010
I need to attend a meetup with Lin Lan
and the other military wives.

509
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,610
A military wives' meetup?

510
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:29,210
You mean one of those
where only military wives are allowed?

511
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,690
Why? You want to join us?

512
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,210
Kind of.

513
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,120
Honestly, that sounds more fun
than having a feast.

514
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:37,800
So?

515
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,250
You're a new military wife.
Can you sneak me in?

516
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,770
Why not?

517
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:45,640
You're practically
a military wife-to-be.

518
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,810
Of course you're qualified to join us.

519
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:48,970
Fine.

520
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,440
Wait for me. I'll come to pick you up.

521
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,604
Is there any point
in keeping them alive?

522
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:57,010
Given their tactical training,

523
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:59,160
even if they know
their teammates are still alive,

524
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,750
they won't take the risk and charge in.

525
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:05,210
If so, let's change tactics

526
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:07,080
to draw them out.

527
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,010
Spread the word.

528
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:14,271
Two of the red team members
are captured alive.

529
00:36:14,315 --> 00:36:15,537
They're to be transferred.

530
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,540
(Blue Team)

531
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:30,330
Captain Zong.

532
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,770
The blue team
is transferring Dai Wei and Captain.

533
00:36:33,582 --> 00:36:34,820
We can't play surprise anymore.

534
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,729
Should we rescue them?

535
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,870
Capturing POWs
and transferring without interrogation

536
00:36:37,871 --> 00:36:38,871
sounds like bait.

537
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:40,850
Let's follow Captain's plan.

538
00:36:41,426 --> 00:36:43,360
As long as their commander
doesn't get to move,

539
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,426
we hold our position here.

540
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,460
(Mixer)

541
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,020
(Military Wives' Mixer)
Hello, ladies!

542
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:56,150
(Military Wives' Mixer)
Welcome, fellow military wives!

543
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,250
Supporting our troops and their families

544
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,170
has always been

545
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,130
one of our community's key missions.

546
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,290
Today, we're honored

547
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:06,930
to host this event thanks to Lin Lan

548
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,290
to help you all connect and bond.

549
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,530
First, on behalf of all military wives,

550
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,890
I'd like to thank our community leaders
for their support.

551
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,090
Honestly,

552
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,370
we military wives

553
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,210
aren't the average spouses.

554
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:19,890
Life throws us

555
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:20,930
unexpected challenges.

556
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,050
We either overcome them alone

557
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,490
or we lean on each other.

558
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:25,820
Now,

559
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:28,250
thanks to our community's care
and support,

560
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,020
I believe

561
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,280
life as a military wife

562
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,370
will grow more harmonious
and fulfilling.

563
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,810
This time, we're also responding

564
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:36,010
to the community leaders' call

565
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:38,340
to help connect single ladies
in our community

566
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:39,850
with service members.

567
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:41,226
But I've thought it over.

568
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,800
We can't just

569
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,170
match people up casually.

570
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:47,690
If we introduce someone
to become a military wife,

571
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,370
we're responsible for it, right?

572
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:51,920
As veterans of this life,

573
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,410
we should share our stories

574
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,440
and experiences

575
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,182
with the leaders.

576
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,210
Anyone?

577
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,520
Well, let them go first!

578
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,210
You guys are always teasing.

579
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,210
I'm telling you.

580
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,330
One's a new military wife,

581
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,250
and the other is soon to be one.

582
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:07,730
Go on now.

583
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:11,890
Reporting in!

584
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:12,970
Come in.

585
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:13,850
Yes, Sir.

586
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,560
An update from the front.

587
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,420
The enemy didn't pursue
or intercept the convoy.

588
00:38:17,426 --> 00:38:18,330
Understood. Dismissed.

589
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:18,850
Yes, Sir!

590
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:24,370
Chief.

591
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:28,410
Looks like they've got their eyes

592
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:29,810
locked on you.

593
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,570
The battle could start at any moment.

594
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,700
Deploy all of our troops.

595
00:38:34,004 --> 00:38:35,271
Go all out to hunt them down.

596
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:39,770
All units, right face!

597
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:46,090
We've been lying in wait since morning.

598
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,530
Finally, they've moved.

599
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,260
They're launching

600
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,337
a carpet-style search.

601
00:38:57,648 --> 00:38:59,530
The more scattered the enemy,
the better for us.

602
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:01,920
If we get past this wave of searching,

603
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,382
we'll strike back from the shadows.

604
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:04,130
Understood.

605
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:05,930
Everyone.

606
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:08,690
Move out!

607
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:17,010
Actually, my husband and I
are kind of cool.

608
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,610
We had a flash marriage.
It's been less than a year.

609
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,490
Before we got married,

610
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:24,250
my dad kept telling me

611
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,370
to think it through.

612
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,370
And I thought,

613
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:30,130
"What's there to think about?

614
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,950
I've found someone I love.

615
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,130
What else matters?"

616
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:34,450
But later,

617
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:37,890
I slowly started to understand.

618
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:41,130
When my dad asked me
to think through it,

619
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:43,170
it wasn't just for my sake.

620
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,170
It was for my husband's too.

621
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:46,930
After all,

622
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,780
marriage is between two parties.

623
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:52,410
Both of us need to be mature enough

624
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,410
to make it work.

625
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:00,410
I respect every woman
who chooses a soldier.

626
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:03,860
But if I had to give

627
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,610
just one piece of advice,

628
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:06,930
I'd say

629
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:10,250
don't rush into it like I did.

630
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:11,930
Grow up first.

631
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:12,930
Be mature.

632
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:15,370
Learn to love independently.

633
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,600
That way,
you can be responsible for yourself

634
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,610
and your marriage.

635
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,650
Great! Well said!

636
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,050
Your turn.

637
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,450
I don't think I should do this.

638
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:26,580
Why not?

639
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,115
You and Wu Si are basically official.

640
00:40:28,137 --> 00:40:29,360
You're almost there.

641
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,650
Let's hear it from her. Go ahead.

642
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:31,370
Come on!

643
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:51,680
Just like Yangyang,

644
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,690
I also grew up in a military family.

645
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,290
My mom raised me on her own.

646
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:57,480
Anyway, I barely remember

647
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,810
my dad being around when I was a child.

648
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:01,690
There was this one time

649
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:03,610
when a huge typhoon hit.

650
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:05,770
That night, my mom had a high fever.

651
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:07,090
But the whole unit

652
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:09,330
was out on disaster relief.

653
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:12,450
There was no one in the camp.
And there were no cars.

654
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:14,970
Even the emergency hotline was busy.

655
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:18,210
I didn't know what to do.

656
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:21,050
So I went around the family quarters
looking for help.

657
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:23,530
Eventually, I found

658
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:26,050
a grocery cart.

659
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,315
I thought I could get my mom
to the hospital with that.

660
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:30,100
But I was too little back then.

661
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:33,010
I kept working on it,

662
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:35,920
but it just wouldn't move.
I got panicked.

663
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,770
Finally, I made it to the street

664
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:40,400
and ran into a traffic officer
on patrol.

665
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,560
He was driving a patrol car.

666
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:43,210
He then drove us to the hospital.

667
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,850
In fact, that was just

668
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:46,550
one of the many little struggles

669
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:48,040
my mom and I faced.

670
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,870
I'm sure you all

671
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,900
have your own stories like that.

672
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,460
But that incident

673
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,970
stuck with me.

674
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:59,210
Because from that day on, I understood

675
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:00,840
that a military marriage

676
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,770
isn't just a sweet romance.

677
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,530
There are typhoons.

678
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:06,840
And you'd better have a cart
at home too!

679
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:13,590
Well, I wouldn't say
I'm experienced in all this.

680
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:14,210
However,

681
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:18,010
when it comes to dating a soldier,

682
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:20,090
my advice

683
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,250
is to love the uniform

684
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:25,840
as well as the one wearing it.
