18
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,650
Honey.

19
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:53,970
I'm sorry about today.

20
00:01:57,693 --> 00:01:59,693
I was the one who insisted on going out.

21
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,310
Why are you apologizing?

22
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,490
I just feel sorry

23
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,130
for making you upset for nothing.

24
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:11,330
It's not like only parks have kids.

25
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,210
Am I going to get upset each time?

26
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:18,580
I'm already feeling better these days.

27
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,470
Seeing kids doesn't break me anymore.

28
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,570
Don't worry, it'll be okay.

29
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:32,090
You must be tired
after walking all day.

30
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,471
Get up, I'll massage your legs.

31
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:34,750
Here.

32
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,040
Honey.

33
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,860
Why are you so good to me?

34
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,370
The better you treat me,

35
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,250
the sadder I feel.

36
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,470
Lan Yangyang.

37
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,030
Look at me.

38
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,390
You're my wife.

39
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,250
Never say such things again.

40
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:09,360
If I don't treat you well, who will?

41
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,026
This is the machine.

42
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:33,420
Okay, the doctor will be here soon.

43
00:03:33,426 --> 00:03:34,471
- Okay, thanks.
- Thanks.

44
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:37,630
Don't be nervous.

45
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:41,770
Captain Wang.

46
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,810
- Dr. Yang.
- Mr. Bai.

47
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,590
Today's physiotherapy

48
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,850
will use this restraint-style table.

49
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,850
Relax your mind.

50
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,137
Loosen up your body.

51
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,700
Try to maintain a balanced standing

52
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,410
for ten minutes on this machine.

53
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:54,680
I can do it.

54
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,200
Good luck.

55
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:41,820
Captain Wang.

56
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,850
Get ready. We're starting soon.

57
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,090
Good luck.

58
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:03,640
Can you keep going?

59
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,180
Doctor, will it be too intense?

60
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,090
Probably not for now.

61
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,360
Wang Chen, don't push it.

62
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,626
Tell us if you can't take it.

63
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,480
- Come on!
- Come on!

64
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,150
- Go, Captain Chen!
- Hurry!

65
00:05:30,293 --> 00:05:31,860
- Go, Captain Chen!
- Go, Captain Chen!

66
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,770
- Go!
- Ready!

67
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,480
- Captain Chen, go!
- Run!

68
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:41,290
- Captain, go!
- Captain, go!

69
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:45,130
Captain Chen, go!

70
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,130
Go, Captain Chen! Go!

71
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,530
Go!

72
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,330
Captain Chen, go! Run!

73
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,650
Go!

74
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,130
Our team won!

75
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,610
The first day is always the hardest.

76
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,530
It'll get better soon.

77
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,560
Honey.

78
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,610
Are you going back to the unit tomorrow?

79
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,360
Ten days passed so fast.

80
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,400
Honey.

81
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,530
How about I ask Brigadier
for a few more days leave?

82
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,360
I'll stay with you a few more days?

83
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,580
Don't.

84
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,440
You should go back first.

85
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,530
I already feel bad
about you asking for ten days off.

86
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,040
Honey.

87
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,100
How about you

88
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,890
go stay with your parents?

89
00:07:28,826 --> 00:07:30,582
At least someone's looking after you.

90
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,850
If you really worry,

91
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,580
install a camera at home.

92
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,720
Watch me eat and sleep every day.

93
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,410
How about that?

94
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,620
You have a point.

95
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,850
Don't worry, Honey.

96
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,630
I'll stay healthy, just like

97
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:00,990
when you're home with me.

98
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,940
(Chinese People's Liberation Army)

99
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:34,880
Captain Zong.

100
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:37,800
You're awake.

101
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,380
Captain Zong.

102
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,990
What's up? What are you all waiting for?

103
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:53,600
Alright.

104
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:54,890
Don't do this.

105
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,648
Run ten kilometers with me
if you insist.

106
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:57,580
Captain Zong.

107
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,040
I already ran ten kilometers
this morning.

108
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:00,760
Yi Nanwang.

109
00:09:02,693 --> 00:09:05,250
Comrades, Captain Zong wants us
to run ten kilometers with him.

110
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,060
Are we doing it?

111
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,050
- Yes!
- Yes!

112
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:10,980
I brought this for you.

113
00:09:19,137 --> 00:09:19,990
What are you doing?

114
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,150
You stopped?

115
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,530
He swore on the company flag

116
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,520
that he wouldn't eat snacks

117
00:09:26,782 --> 00:09:27,890
until Captain Chen recovers.

118
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,740
I went to visit Captain Chen.

119
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,380
She's recovering...

120
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,190
Emergency assembly!

121
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:05,640
Quick!

122
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,210
Did you hear the whistle?

123
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,320
Yes.

124
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,390
Did everyone hear the whistle?

125
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,250
- Yes!
- Yes!

126
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,150
Everyone heard it?

127
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,790
Why did no one pass then?

128
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,670
Could it be

129
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,080
that you thought
I wouldn't interrupt nap time

130
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,570
or

131
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,910
that I wouldn't throw tear gas

132
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,710
at you babies?

133
00:10:27,204 --> 00:10:28,693
You're familiar with this, right?

134
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,530
Because it's too familiar,

135
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,280
we nearly lost the whole squad!

136
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,170
Why?

137
00:10:36,848 --> 00:10:37,790
Because you're slow.

138
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,960
Slow enough to get us all killed.

139
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,160
With full gear,

140
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,130
run 15 km while you cry.

141
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,150
- Yes!
- Yes!

142
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,590
Remember, Blue Blade

143
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,893
doesn't tolerate soldiers
who forget their punishments.

144
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,290
Use your head from now on.

145
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,230
Got it?

146
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,140
- Yes!
- Yes!

147
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,730
Attention!

148
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,460
Turn left!

149
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,370
Turn left, march!

150
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,460
Hello, Mom?

151
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,650
Yangyang.

152
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,590
Did Zong Qing go back?

153
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,770
Yeah, his leave ended.

154
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,820
Move back home then.

155
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,110
I worry about you being alone.

156
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,020
How about I come to take care of you?

157
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,570
No need.

158
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:25,840
What?

159
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,510
Why can't I take care of her?

160
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,770
No need, Mom. I can manage.

161
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,570
Zong Qing prepared everything
before leaving.

162
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,130
You two don't need to worry.

163
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,770
We'll visit you together on the weekend.

164
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,090
Alright.

165
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,530
Tell me about your health.

166
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,450
If you feel unwell,

167
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,680
you must let us know.

168
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,650
Okay, stop nagging.

169
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,010
Don't think I'm nagging you.

170
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,730
Take good care of yourself
during this mini confinement.

171
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,060
You don't understand

172
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,340
how harmful it can be.

173
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,040
After Mrs. Wang in the front unit

174
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,300
had her miscarriage...

175
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,700
Don't go into that.

176
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,120
Dad, Mom, I'm fine.

177
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,740
Life still has to go on.

178
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,570
Yes.

179
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,500
Yangyang, that's the right mindset.

180
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,540
Health matters the most.

181
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,410
Skip the assessment

182
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,600
for now.

183
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:14,970
Yes.

184
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,300
Your dad's right.

185
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,550
You got into some trouble because of it.

186
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,570
Never mind if it earns money or not.

187
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,360
All the fuss isn't good for you.

188
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,210
Why not use this time

189
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,820

It'll also help you build a routine.

193
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:37,840
Got it.

194
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,050
I'll hang up now.

195
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,810
- Hurry up!

196
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,050
Hurry up!

197

- Hurry up!
- Hurry up!

198
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,410
Hurry! Keep up!

199
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,280
Hurry up!

200
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:57,820
Five kilometers left!

201
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,810
Hurry!

202
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,540
Go!

203
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:01,650
Hurry up!

204
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,130
You can't take it anymore? Hurry!

205
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,490
Go!

206
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,160
Wait for me!

207
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:10,370
Hurry up!

208
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,330
Hurry!

209
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,560
- Keep going!
- Hurry!

210
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,700
Hurry up!

211
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,870
Can't take it anymore?

212
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,330
Hurry up!

213
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,790
Keep up!

214
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:20,750
Those at the back.

215
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,220
Whoever's last skips a meal!

216
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:23,910
Hurry up!

217
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:30,760
Those at the back, catch up!

218
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:35,930
At the back!

219
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:45,490
Hurry up!

220
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:46,970
Hurry up!

221
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,330
Pick up the pace!

222
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:54,650
Hurry up!

223
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:55,810
Hurry up!

227
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,490
Hello, Ms. Wang. What's up?

228
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,950
Tang Xin, are you busy right now?

229
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,870
Is it something about Yangyang?

230
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,680
You know Yangyang's condition.

231
00:14:46,248 --> 00:14:47,982
Zong Qing has been taking care of her

232
00:14:48,026 --> 00:14:49,070
in the past few days,

233
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,050
but he already went back
to the unit yesterday.

234
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,010
I asked Yangyang to move back,
but she refused.

235
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,680
I wanted to take care of her,

236
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,520
but she rejected.

237
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,690
I'm just really worried.

238
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:00,540
So...

239
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,626
I understand, Ms. Wang.

240
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,690
Don't worry.

241
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,230
I'll stay with Yangyang for a few days.

242
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,110
I've been meaning to visit her.

243
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,690
Thank you.

244
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,170
Not at all. I'll hang up now.

245
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:11,690
Goodbye, Ms. Wang.

246
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,050
Hello, Mr. Han?

247
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:23,850
Tang Xin.

248
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,850
Since we came back from Roman,

249
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,390
we haven't seen each other.

250
00:15:31,115 --> 00:15:32,426
Come have a meal with me.

251
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,370
Let's chat, okay?

252
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,410
Mr. Han, bad timing today.

253
00:15:36,448 --> 00:15:37,720
I made plans with my best friend.

254
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,090
I have to keep her company tonight.

255
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,210
It's just a meal.

256
00:15:41,604 --> 00:15:43,626
It won't get in the way
of you accompanying her.

257
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,470
Here's the thing.

258
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,970
You might not know.

259
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:47,960
My best friend

260
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,810
is going through
something special lately.

261
00:15:50,604 --> 00:15:52,293
Next time, I promise.

262
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,330
Today's my birthday.

263
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,820
Considering that we

264
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,830
have experienced life and death,

265
00:16:03,026 --> 00:16:04,537
celebrate my birthday with me.

266
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,382
I didn't invite anyone else.

267
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:10,880
Mr...

268
00:16:36,404 --> 00:16:37,300
Extra training alone?

269
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,270
Report, Captain Zong seems upset.

270
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,671
He's been shooting for a while.

271
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,380
Zong Qing.

272
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,140
Captain.

273
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,180
Just let me be today.

274
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,820
Punish me however you want later.

275
00:16:49,293 --> 00:16:51,604
Is the training ground
your personal place to vent?

276
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,060
Who would trust you to have their back?

277
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,982
Can you act more mature
and be responsible for your own actions?

278
00:16:57,871 --> 00:16:59,071
Inspect your gun and stand up!

279
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:02,820
Yes!

280
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,337
This way, please.

281
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,500
Mr. Han.

282
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,250
I knew you'd come.

283
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,248
I didn't know it was your birthday,
so I didn't prepare anything in advance.

284
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,060
I bought a cake.

285
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,226
I hope you like it.

286
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:29,250
Thank you.

287
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:30,440
Sit.

288
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,580
Only a few people in the company

289
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,660
have access

290
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,220
to core secrets.

Zhao Zishan, Zhang Xuming)

292
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,460
Focus all your energy

293
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,700
on investigating these five people.

294
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,580
I don't care how you do it.

295
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,780
Find the mole

296
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,580
within one week.

297
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:05,780
Boss,

298
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,580
we'll need to check
their phones and computers.

299
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,220
Wouldn't that

300
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,780
alert them?

301
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,340
Use your brain.

302
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,820
How did we get the email address

303
00:18:16,871 --> 00:18:18,380
from that female reporter's computer?

304
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,780
Right, got it, boss.

305
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,260
Mr. Han, one more thing.

306
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,540
Except Li Wang and Zhang Xuming,

307
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,980
the rest are at sea.

308
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,420
One week may not be enough time.

309
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,460
Don't worry.

310
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,100
Ms. Zhou.

311
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:32,780
Yes.

312
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,220
Call them immediately

313
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,220
and tell them to return to headquarters.

314
00:18:36,337 --> 00:18:37,140
Alright, Mr. Han.

315
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,460
Finding this person

316
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,700
is critical to the company.

317
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,493
I hope I don't need to explain why.

318
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,220
If we still can't find the mole,

319
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,140
you're all fired.

320
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,220
There's something I've said

321
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,700
countless times.

322
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,710
But since it's my birthday,

323
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,340
I want to ask again.

324
00:19:00,426 --> 00:19:02,382
Will you consider accepting my feelings?

325
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,980
Mr. Han, I've told you many times.

326
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,740
You've helped me a lot.

327
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,020
You even saved me.

328
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,760
I'm truly grateful to you.

329
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,180
But about what you said...

330
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,860
To be honest,

331
00:19:25,182 --> 00:19:26,715
we're not meant to be.

332
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,180
Like you said,

333
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,300
we've known

334
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,140
each other for quite a while now.

335
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,140
We've also been through
some things together.

336
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,620
It's exactly

337
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,300
those shared experiences

338
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,420
that made me realize

339
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,140
we do share an understanding.

340
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,540
But I already have a boyfriend.

341
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,180
Even if I didn't,

342
00:19:50,582 --> 00:19:52,382
we still wouldn't be right
for each other.

343
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,820
You should know why.

344
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:04,700
I see.

345
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,100
If your investigation

346
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,220
is true,

347
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,700
my family

348
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,340
is basically a den of thieves.

349
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:17,880
No decent girl

350
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,620
would marry into that.

351
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:20,940
I get it.

352
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,340
Mr. Han, I...

353
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,460
No need to explain.

354
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,000
You're not wrong.

355
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:29,940
But Tang Xin,

356
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,480
I must tell you.

357
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,860
I didn't get to choose

358
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,893
the family I was born into.

359
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,180
I didn't get to choose

360
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:42,693
the environment I grew up in either.

361
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,980
But from now on,

362
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,100
I can choose

363
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,050
my own future.

364
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,220
So don't reject me yet.

365
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,100
Give me time.

366
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,210
I'll prove it to you.

367
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,140
Happy birthday again.

368
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,740
Can you keep going?

369
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:15,860
Look.

370
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,250
It's been an hour and a half.

371
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,860
Enough.

372
00:21:19,893 --> 00:21:21,760
The doctor said
you only needed half an hour.

373
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,980
It's okay. I can do it.

374
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,740
Chen, listen to the doctor.

375
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,310
That's enough for today.

376
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,620
Mom, I'm really fine.

377
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,930
Look, I'm much better now.

378
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,260
Compared to when I started,

379
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,020
I'm way stronger.

380
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,100
Zijian.

381
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,100
Don't keep troubling Mom.

382
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,010
I can train by myself.

383
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,340
It's fine.
I've got nothing to do at home anyway.

384
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,260
I just didn't want you to worry.

385
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,180
Fine. At this rate,

386
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,580
she'll be sprinting tomorrow.

387
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,740
Listen to yourself.

388
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,330
Last five minutes.

389
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,220
I'll time it.

390
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,700
Five, four, three, two, one.

391
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,420
Time's up. Launch the rocket.

392
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:19,780
- I'll get the doctor.
- Alright.

393
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,500
Stop.

394
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,180
I knew you'd come.

395
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,980
My mom sent you, right?

396
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,500
It doesn't matter who sent me.

397
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,700
Your husband's gone,

398
00:22:30,715 --> 00:22:32,004
but your best friend's here.

399
00:22:32,048 --> 00:22:33,293
What? Not happy about it?

400
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,420
I'm happy.

401
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,700
Where is your stuff?

402
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,040
I put everything away.

403
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,120
You put everything away?

404
00:22:42,782 --> 00:22:43,980
Done being a content creator?

405
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,980
I started creating content

406
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,300
partly to spite my dad.

407
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,280
But in the end,

408
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,330
it wasn't fulfilling at all.

409
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,700
Sounds like

410
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,980
you're trying something new.

411
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,570
I'm a doctor who failed

412
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:08,940
to save my own child,

413
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,980
but I can help other mothers

414
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,500
keep theirs safe

415
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,220
and help more little ones

416
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,820
come to this world safely.

417
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,140
It's the only thing

418
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,280
I can do and want to do.

419
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,980
Otherwise, I'd fail Xi.

420
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,390
You've decided?

421
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,620
Lazy Goat.

422
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,530
Good luck.

423
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:44,420
Good luck.

424
00:23:52,404 --> 00:23:53,520
Mr. Han, no more drinks.

425
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,260
Time to rest.

426
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:54,840
Put them down.

427
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,120
I'm not finished talking.

428
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,760
I always thought my life was perfect.

429
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,700
I was born

430
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,300
with a silver spoon in my mouth.

431
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,290
I'm smart too.

432
00:24:12,115 --> 00:24:14,060
Later, I got into
the University of Hong Kong.

433
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,580
After getting my degree,
I went to Boston

434
00:24:18,004 --> 00:24:19,740
to pursue a master's degree in finance

435
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,420
at Boston University.

436
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,190
My dad and brother

437
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,140
doted on me growing up.

438
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,040
Whether

439
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,120
at home, at work,

440
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,860
or anywhere outside,

441
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,980
people respected me.

442
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:37,940
Right?

443
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,500
Yes.

444
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,700
Ding, you

445
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,060
must envy my background, right?

446
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,900
But let me tell you.

447
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,180
I carry a lot of pain in my heart.

448
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,980
I get that.

449
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,540
Really?

450
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,540
As far as I remember,

451
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:11,700
my dad

452
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,260
wasn't just a successful businessman,

453
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,460
he was also

454
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,020
a philanthropist.

455
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,660
He's always

456
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,860
donating, doing charity

457
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,620
and building schools and hospitals.

458
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:27,940
But the truth

459
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,380
is that he and my brother
had another side.

460
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,410
That's their true colors.

461
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,380
They're them. You're you.

462
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,740
I still see you
as someone with integrity.

463
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,460
What's the point?

464
00:25:42,204 --> 00:25:43,020
What's the point?

465
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,500
I was born into this family.

466
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,420
I can't change that fact.

467
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,300
Can you understand?

468
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,180
Ding, how about you teach me?

469
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,980
What should I do?

470
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,180
See?

471
00:26:11,026 --> 00:26:12,500
Even you don't know what to do.

472
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,540
Last glass. Finish it,

473
00:26:26,604 --> 00:26:28,004
and you can go home to rest.

474
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,870
(928th Hospital of People's Liberation
Army Joint Logistics Support Force)

475
00:26:57,871 --> 00:26:59,580
(Outpatient Department)

476
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,500
Mr. Bai.

477
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:13,740
Tang Xin.

478
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,020
I came to visit Wang Chen.

479
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,780
Sit, sit down quickly.

480
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,700
Wang Chen fell asleep
right after finishing physiotherapy.

481
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,700
It's okay. I'll visit her again later.

482
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:28,980
How have you been?

483
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,900
Are you okay?

484
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,330
I'm doing fine.

485
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,540
Since we got married,

486
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,940
we haven't spent

487
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,180
this much time together.

488
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,620
I'm really forgetful.

489
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,380
I forgot to tell you

490
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,471
something really important.

491
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,260
What is it?

492
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,780
The Dayan Reef
underwater archaeology operation

493
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,950
is nearly complete.

494
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,380
The team has located the ship.

495
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,500
However,

496
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,980
all the relics on board

497
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,380
were looted and taken.

498
00:27:57,404 --> 00:27:58,537
There's almost nothing left.

499
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,640
That's such a shame.

500
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,740
Yes, it's truly a shame.

501
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,500
But there's good news too.

502
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,740
Cultural Relics Bureau has reported this

503
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,040
to the police.

504
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:09,980
And the police

505
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,580
are taking this very seriously.

506
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,270
Didn't you send a photo

507
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,580
from Roman?

508
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:14,980
Yes.

509
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,500
Through facial recognition,

510
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,580
we confirmed the man's identity.

511
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,500
His name is William.

512
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,500
He's the leader of a gang that ICPO

513
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:25,740
has been pursuing

514
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,580
for stealing and smuggling
cultural relics.

515
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,250
The police have officially
launched an investigation

516
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,260
into Changzhou Group
for suspected looting

517
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,160
of underwater relics.

518
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,170
That's great.

519
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,330
Tang Xin.

520
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,650
You did most of the work here.

521
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,860
You kept giving and persevering.

522
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,140
You've got the results now.

523
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,110
Where were you?

524
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,226
Why are you back so late?

525
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,300
(New Perspective)

526
00:28:50,337 --> 00:28:52,030
I ran into Mr. Bai Zijian
at the hospital.

527
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,270
He told me

528
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,760
about the police's investigation
into our Roman incident.

529
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,180
Do the police
have any progress on the case?

530
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,110
(Wu Si: It's the weekend today.
Let's meet up.)

531
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,700
I've got an idea for a topic.

532
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,660
I want to make a show

533
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,980
on protecting underwater relics.

534
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,260
That sounds like a big topic.

535
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,940
One or two episodes won't do it.

536
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,380
We can make it a series.

537
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,180
From the Maritime Silk Road

538
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,500
to the origins of sunken ship relics,

539
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,760
then about criminals

540
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,071
looting the sunken ship relics,

541
00:29:23,115 --> 00:29:24,337
causing national losses.

542
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,180
That's a good idea,

543
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,060
but

544
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:31,600
we don't have experts for that.

545
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,180
(Wu Si: Why are you ignoring me?)

546
00:29:33,182 --> 00:29:35,871
(Are you mad because I criticized you?)
(Tang Xin: In a meeting.)

547
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,870
Underwater relic looting is old news.

548
00:29:38,893 --> 00:29:39,860
You can find it online.

549
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,070
We're just doing general promotion

550
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,140
and public education.

551
00:29:44,204 --> 00:29:45,260
We're not targeting anyone.

552
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,180
I'd like to invite Mr. Bai

553
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,470
to join our planning session.

554
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,540
He can offer advice and a lesson.

555
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,660
I think that's a good idea.

556
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,100
Alright, I'll get everyone ready.

557
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:57,980
Go on.

558
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,180
Bye.

559
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,460
(Wu Si: It's the weekend.
I have the day off.)

560
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,070
(Captain Tang called
and invited me to dinner.)

561
00:30:12,248 --> 00:30:13,340
(Want me to pick you up?)

562
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,350
(Tang Xin)
No thanks.

563
00:30:21,004 --> 00:30:22,004
Thanks, Mrs. Tang.

564
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:26,900
Wu Si.

565
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,330
You've been back for a while.

566
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,260
If I hadn't called you,

567
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,780
you wouldn't even come for dinner.

568
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,940
No, Captain.

569
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,300
I called Tang Xin several times.

570
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,300
She's been busy.

571
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,420
Yes.

572
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,780
Tang Xin is always busy.

573
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,340
She's busy during the day.

574
00:30:50,204 --> 00:30:51,648
She has no time at night either.

575
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,020
Xin is really

576
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,460
capable now.

577
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,260
Her show has even gone international.

578
00:31:02,315 --> 00:31:03,382
When will it be on air?

579
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,860
Where can I watch it?

580
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,610
What's going on?

581
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,420
You've been quiet all evening.

582
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,780
Did you and Wu Si have a fight?

583
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:27,940
No.

584
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,500
Maybe she's just tired from work.

585
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,140
If you're tired, eat more.

586
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,026
- Okay.
- Here, Captain.

587
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,420
- Mrs. Tang.
- Eat up.

588
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,500
Well, the fruit...

589
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:01,780
Here.

590
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:02,900
Wu Si.

591
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,300
Xin has always been hot-tempered.

592
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,248
Sometimes, don't take it to heart.

593
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,340
But you can't spoil

594
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,100
women.

595
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,580
Captain, it's okay.

596
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,540
I trust Tang Xin

597
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,660
is reasonable

598
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,540
and sensible.

599
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,620
Good.

600
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,740
Time for our daily walk.

601
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,020
My wife and I never miss it.

602
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,700
Yes, let's go walk. Let's go.

603
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,300
Sit down. No need to be formal.

604
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:17,860
Let me ask you.

605
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,860
Did you talk to my dad earlier?

606
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:21,620
I didn't.

607
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:23,340
I said nothing.

608
00:33:23,471 --> 00:33:25,182
No? Then why did he
ask me that just now?

609
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,500
With Captain...

610
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,570
With Captain Tang's experience

611
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,060
and your lack of composure,

612
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,100
you gave yourself away.

613
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,620
I always thought
Miss Tang was experienced

614
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,300
and mentally strong.

615
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,780
Who knew

616
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,500
that's not the truth.

617
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,340
You only take praise

618
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,493
and can't handle criticism.

619
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,780
Yes.

620
00:33:58,026 --> 00:33:59,240
I was always a model student.

621
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,180
Teachers praised me.

622
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,110
No one criticized me.

623
00:34:01,693 --> 00:34:02,620
What about your parents?

624
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,820
They praised me too.

625
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,550
I was showered with praise
since childhood.

626
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,160
Now I know the problem.

627
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,100
I realize my mistake, Miss Tang.

628
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,100
From now on,

629
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,500
I'll talk to you differently.

630
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,100
No need.

631
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,360
Don't bother.

632
00:34:23,826 --> 00:34:24,715
Suit yourself.

633
00:34:35,248 --> 00:34:36,493
Let me help you carry that.

634
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,860
No, I've got it.

635
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,260
I brought some materials.

636
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,060
Thank you very much.

637
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,940
I feel a bit bad.

638
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,350
Wang Chen is still in hospital.

639
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,300
She still needs care,

640
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,900
yet I asked you to come here.

641
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,820
I can't do much there anyway.

642
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,900
Alright, I won't hold back.

643
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,137
Let's go to the meeting room.

644
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,220
Sure. I'll follow your lead here.

645
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:54,820
Great.

646
00:34:56,382 --> 00:34:58,204
(Minghua News)
During the Song Dynasty,

647
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,770
the compass

648
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,810
was applied to navigation.

649
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,340
It greatly boosted China's ability

650
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,490
to sail long distances.

651
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,100
The Song Dynasty

652
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,790
also valued commerce

653
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,540
and encouraged maritime trade,

654
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,980
so maritime trade

655
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,180
expanded across
Asia, Africa, and Europe.

656
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,640
No wonder

657
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,580
ancient Chinese sunken ships

658
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,260
are found in many foreign waters.

659
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,200
Indeed.

660
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,850
The Maritime Silk Road

661
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:25,850
has another name.

662
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,420
In 1913,

663
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,890
French sinologist Édouard Chavannes
proposed it.

664
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,820
He called it the Maritime Spice Route

665
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,580
and the Maritime Porcelain Route.

666
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,860
Based
on the Maritime Porcelain Route idea,

667
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,670
ceramics took up

668
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,060
a large proportion of China's exports.

669
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,660
Yes. Ceramics are unlike other goods.

670
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,980
They're highly resistant to corrosion.

671
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,340
That's why

672
00:35:47,382 --> 00:35:49,004
they can be well preserved underwater.

673
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,580
In recent years,

674
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,900
ancient Chinese ceramics
have become very valuable

675
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,100
at auctions.

676
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,620
It's why

677
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,310
antique smugglers

678
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,300
and criminals

679
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,190
have targeted sunken ship relics.

680
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,500
Of course,

681
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,500
many sunken ships also contain

682
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:05,382
many valuable gold, silver, and jewels.

683
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,730
How is Yangyang doing?

684
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,820
She pretty much recovered,

685
00:36:14,293 --> 00:36:15,700
but she's still affected mentally.

686
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:18,970
It takes time to heal.

687
00:36:19,515 --> 00:36:20,493
It's not your fault.

688
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,280
But as a man,

689
00:36:22,537 --> 00:36:23,782
you must be responsible.

690
00:36:25,737 --> 00:36:27,204
Take good care of Yangyang.

691
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,300
Tell me if you need anything.

692
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,380
I need something right now.

693
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:37,740
Time me.

694
00:36:44,026 --> 00:36:45,100
How are you feeling today?

695
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,620
The doctor said
she has started physiotherapy,

696
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,020
and it's going pretty well.

697
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,060
Not enough.

698
00:36:52,915 --> 00:36:53,700
I'm still far off.

699
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,420
That's not up to you.

700
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,980
It's up to the doctor.

701
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,720
I told you last time.

702
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,380
Soldiers follow orders.

703
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,380
Patients follow the doctor's advice.

704
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:03,940
Understand?

705
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,140
Yes.

706
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,140
Louder.

707
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,380
Yes!

708
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,860
That's more like it.

709
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,660
You were hurt saving someone.

710
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,980
A heroic wound heals faster.

711
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,910
Listen, Blue Blade

712
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,260
is now full of hot-headed kids.

713
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,420
You can't fall behind.

714
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,750
Do what the doctor says.

715
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,760
I'll be expecting
to spar with you next year.

716
00:37:23,004 --> 00:37:24,350
I promise to complete the mission.

717
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,820
Alright, lie down and rest.

718
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,450
I feel relieved seeing you.

719
00:37:29,693 --> 00:37:30,626
By the way, Bai,

720
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,780
tell me immediately

721
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,093
if she doesn't follow orders.

722
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,460
Let's see if she obeys her brigadier.

723
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,660
Alright, great.

724
00:37:39,826 --> 00:37:41,180
I'm leaving. You worked hard.

725
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,450
Thank you, Brigadier. Thank you.

726
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,690
- I'm off.
- Let me walk you out.

727
00:37:43,693 --> 00:37:44,404
No need.

728
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:48,900
I figured it out.

729
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,600
Only Brigadier can handle you.

730
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,900
Didn't I say the same things?

731
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,960
Why won't you listen to me?

732
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,220
You even saluted.

733
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,982
You never saluted me.

734
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,380
How long?

735
00:39:06,782 --> 00:39:07,540
I didn't time it.

736
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,420
It must be

737
00:39:13,715 --> 00:39:15,137
at least four and a half minutes.

738
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,060
Feeling better?

739
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:23,940
Captain.

740
00:39:28,648 --> 00:39:29,780
It hurts inside.

741
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,460
Zong Qing.

742
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:39,980
I...

743
00:39:41,315 --> 00:39:42,820
I don't know how to comfort you.

744
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,180
If it were me in your shoes,

745
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,780
no one could comfort me either.

746
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,540
But

747
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,540
just say the word

748
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,426
if you ever need help.

749
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:55,620
I'm here.

750
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:02,580
Captain.

751
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:11,780
You know what?

752
00:40:12,537 --> 00:40:14,930
I've had this scene
stuck in my head for the past two days.

753
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,090
It's when I called Yangyang

754
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,420
back on the ship.

755
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:29,000
Just to get Yangyang to eat well.

756
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,940
I told the baby

757
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,700
on the phone

758
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,100
not to bully Mom

759
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,940
and let her eat well.

760
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,540
I was so loud.

761
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,537
The first and last things

762
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,060
the baby heard from me

763
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,820
were fierce.

764
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,500
Do you think

765
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,493
I'm the worst dad ever?

766
00:41:08,915 --> 00:41:10,620
Yangyang and the baby did nothing wrong.

767
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,582
I'm the one at fault.

768
00:41:15,871 --> 00:41:17,515
I didn't take good care of them.

769
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,300
You two have just started.

770
00:41:29,448 --> 00:41:30,540
There's a long road ahead.

771
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:32,700
Live well.

772
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,540
