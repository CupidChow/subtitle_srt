18
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,160
Talk to Ms. Zhou about this.

19
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,440
Welcome, my friend.

20
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,537
Hello, hello, my friend.

21
00:02:33,537 --> 00:02:34,289
Hello, hello.

22
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,220
- How are you?
- Welcome.

23
00:02:35,226 --> 00:02:36,200
Yeah, I'm fine.

24
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,570
You've lost some weight.

25
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,530
You look nice.

26
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,090
Yeah?

27
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,600
Very good.

28
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,760
Your father is still there?

29
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,410
Yeah, there, there.

30
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:47,212
It's been a while
since I saw him last time.

31
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:03,320
Alright.

32
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,160
Come in.

33
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:11,860
My old friend.

34
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,740
- William.
- We meet again.

35
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,320
We meet again.

36
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,760
We're old friends. Sit and talk.

37
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,370
Sure.

38
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,480
Please.

39
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,440
William.

40
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,600
This is the tea you like.

41
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,250
This is the tea you like.

42
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,530
I hope you can enjoy it.

43
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,920
Thank you. Thank you very much.

44
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,290
William.

45
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,290
Why did you call us here

46
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,410
today?

47
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,200
You got us here in Roman.

48
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,600
Is there something important?

49
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,970
Yeah, the scout group

50
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,290
discovered some artifacts.

51
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,410
I've already sent a ship

52
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,440
to locate the sunken ship.

53
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,090
They found some artifacts underwater

54
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:54,970
and have

55
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,530
begun locating the sunken ship.

56
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,290
Yes.

57
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,090
Trust me. It's not going to take long

58
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,600
before we locate the ship.

59
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,920
This time, it's going to be a jackpot.

60
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,370
I'm sure we'll have good news soon.

61
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,410
We'll make a fortune by then.

62
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,370
Very good.

63
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,290
Good.

64
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,840
Once we confirm the sunken ship,

65
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,840
we'll salvage it immediately.

66
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,400
Once we find the location,

67
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,200
then we do the salvage immediately.

68
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:25,370
Here's to a successful partnership.

69
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,170
Okay.

70
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,610
Okay.

71
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:29,960
Mr. Han.

72
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,960
I investigated what you asked me.

73
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,050
Atocha Company was started

74
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,930
by some foreigners and one Chinese.

75
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,170
Chinese?

76
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,760
Do you know who the Chinese person is?

77
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,100
Due to company registration

78
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,760
and management rules here,

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,760
we couldn't find a name. Sorry.

80
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,760
Don't say that.

81
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,490
You've been a great help.

82
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,640
How about this? We'll talk again

83
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,130
if there's any update. Alright?

84
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,010
Sure. Goodbye.

85
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,730
Goodbye.

86
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,200
Mr. Han.

87
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:03,960
What do you think?

88
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,280
Tang Xin first followed
my dad and brother

89
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,730
from China to abroad.

90
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,400
Now she's interested in Atocha Company.

91
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,640
Do you think Tang Xin

92
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,080
will find anything in Roman?

93
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,170
Miss Tang's been investigating
for a while.

94
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,280
Someone's giving her clues too.

95
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,610
She'll find something eventually.

96
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,050
But even if she came here,

97
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,520
trying to find anything

98
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,520
on the chairman is difficult.

99
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,050
She can't even get near him.

100
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,840
I'm actually worried.

101
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,370
If Tang Xin keeps watching
my dad and brother,

102
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,830
sooner or later

103
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,960
they'll notice her.

104
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,490
So keep an eye on Miss Tang

105
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,400
during this time.

106
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,610
If my dad or brother

107
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,080
discovers her,

108
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,280
tell me immediately.

109
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,610
Got it.

110
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,280
Xin, who do you think

111
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,730
those foreigners meeting Han Changzhou

112
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,930
are?

113
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,960
They must be business associates.

114
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:22,840
What a pity.

115
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,200
We didn't get a photo.

116
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,280
Next time.

117
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,640
They'll probably meet again.

118
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,810
Cease fire.

119
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,200
The drill is over.

120
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,170
Results.

121
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,250
Good.

122
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,810
Comrades.

123
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,440
Since setting off from Wenzhou,

124
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,440
we've braved the waves

125
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,170
and traveled day and night.

126
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,080
We passed Paracel Islands

127
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,200
and Spratly Islands.

128
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,610
Today,

129
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,730
we've officially arrived

130
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,010
at our historical territorial line.

131
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,010
Beyond this point,

132
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,230
the coastal sea is behind

133
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,060
while the open ocean is ahead.

134
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,520
Beyond this point,

135
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,440
our homeland is behind

136
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,730
while our peaceful journey lies ahead.

137
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,250
We're the Chinese Navy escort fleet.

138
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:10,050
We'll soon cross our historical
territorial line and sail.

139
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,320
Here, we solemnly
bid farewell to our nation.

140
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,960
We salute our homeland

141
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,080
and solemnly swear
to the national and military flags.

142
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,170
Sail into the ocean.

143
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,720
Be loyal to the party.

144
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,080
Honor our mission.

145
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,320
Be brave and strong.

146
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,880
Bring honor
to the people and the nation!

147
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,370
Attention all ships.

148
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,880
Prepare to cross
the historical territorial line.

149
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,130
Face the national flag.

150
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,130
Salute!

151
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:06,760
At ease!

152
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,920
Wherever the country sends us,

153
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,240
our escort fleet will follow through.

154
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,671
- Wherever the country sends us,
- Wherever the country sends us,

155
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:17,680
- our escort fleet will follow through.
- our escort fleet will follow through.

156
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,660
(People's Liberation Army Navy)

157
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,760
I feel conflicted.

158
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
I

159
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,210
hope Tang Xin finds something.

160
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,520
But then again,

161
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,880
I'm also worried

162
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,160
if she really finds something.

163
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,920
What do you think I should do?

164
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,130
I think...

165
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,210
Whether Miss Tang finds anything,

166
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,370
this matter

167
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,520
is basically out in the open.

168
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,210
For you,

169
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,040
the more you know,
the worse you'll feel.

170
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,730
Let's go back home.

171
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,090
So you won't be stuck in the middle.

172
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,400
We can't leave.

173
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,640
I should at least find out

174
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,610
why my dad and brother

175
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,040
came to Roman.

176
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,330
Ask him

177
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,160
if he brought my dad's favorite wine.

178
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,800
William, did you bring
my boss's favorite drink?

179
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,210
Of course. Don't worry.

180
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,560
Look.

181
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,090
Good.

182
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,210
Yes.

183
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,800
Look.

184
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,560
Let's take our seats.

185
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,970
(Xin: Hai, I'm at the hotel lounge.)

186
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:10,850
(Come quickly.)

187
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,730
Enjoy the meal.

188
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,400
What's wrong, Xin?

189
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,370
Let's dig in.

190
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,210
Okay.

191
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,610
May we drink

192
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,850
to our successful journey
to the Roman Islands.

193
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:52,490
Yeah?

194
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:53,680
Yeah.

195
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,560
Cheers.

196
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,210
Take a look first.

197
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,500
(Miss Tang)

198
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,880
(Mr. Bai, Han Changzhou)

199
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,090
(often meets these foreigners in Roman.)

200
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,640
(Please give these photos
to the police.)

201
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,970
(See if they'll give us
any valuable leads.)

202
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:25,800
Okay, got it.

203
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:33,880
Dad.

204
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,920
The company just called and said

205
00:12:38,715 --> 00:12:41,360
Cultural Relics Bureau has formed
an underwater archaeology team.

206
00:12:41,404 --> 00:12:43,404
They've already started
underwater archaeology

207
00:12:43,426 --> 00:12:44,448
at Dayan Reef.

208
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,280
We gave up that ship,

209
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,130
but they'll still realize
it was tampered with.

210
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,010
They'll definitely report

211
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,160
this to the police.

212
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,760
They have no solid proof.

213
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,920
What can the police do to us?

214
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,730
I warn you.

215
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,920
Be more careful from now on.

216
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,010
Yes.

217
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:34,610
Dad.

218
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,010
Yuhang has also come to Roman.

219
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,160
And

220
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,730
he's staying at our hotel.

221
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,330
Mr. Han.

222
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,450
From what I've observed these days,

223
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,920
Chairman mostly stays in his room

224
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,010
and rarely goes out.

225
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,400
It's hard to know
what's going on inside.

226
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,560
What about Miss Tang?

227
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,760
Miss Tang goes out often.

228
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,850
I've seen her at the outdoor bar

229
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,330
drinking coffee and reading books.

230
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:08,800
I see.

231
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,850
I really can't show my face,

232
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,490
so I need you to watch them closely.

233
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,160
Got it.

234
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,450
Mr. Yutian.

235
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,370
Yutian?

236
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,490
Why are you in Roman?

237
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,680
Why didn't you tell me?

238
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,450
You didn't tell us
your trip here either.

239
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,090
What? If I hadn't knocked on your door,

240
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,680
would you have avoided Dad and me?

241
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,250
Of course not.

242
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,730
Dr. Meng, what does high risk mean

243
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,280
in the Down syndrome screening?

244
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,730
It means there's a chance

245
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,760
that the fetus

246
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,640
is at risk of teratogenic disease.

247
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,090
It could be

248
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,250
caused by genetics,

249
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,010
inflammation,

250
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,640
drugs, infection,

251
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,520
or radiation.

252
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,560
But the screening rate

253
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,560
isn't 100% accurate.

254
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,090
Even healthy couples

255
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,850
can have a child with Down syndrome.

256
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,250
You can do an amniocentesis

257
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,850
or non-invasive DNA test

258
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,850
to conduct a prenatal diagnosis

259
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,490
to determine

260
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,610
if the fetus
has chromosomal abnormalities.

261
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,370
What if there's an abnormality?

262
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,560
From a medical point of view,

263
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,850
if the baby is confirmed
to have Down syndrome,

264
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,090
we suggest
early termination in early pregnancy

265
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,680
for someone like you.

266
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,010
Mom.

267
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,280
I suddenly remembered

268
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,280
that a former roommate
from medical school

269
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,250
works here.

270
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,610
I want to chat with her.

271
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,160
Look. You're pregnant.
Don't wander around.

272
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,130
I'll go with you.

273
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,800
No need, Mom. Go home.

274
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,400
I'll chat with her myself.

275
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,450
I'll be back soon.

276
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,330
Call me when you're done.

277
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:22,850
Sure.

278
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,280
You...

279
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,090
Take this with you.

280
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,400
No, there's water there. Go.

281
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,330
Be careful.

282
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,210
You...

283
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,280
Go on. Hurry up.

284
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,920
Okay, I'm going.

285
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,490
Hello.

286
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,970
I'd like to ask

287
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,920
where I can schedule an amniocentesis.

288
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,160
Sure, one moment. Let me check.

289
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:00,880
Dad.

290
00:17:03,204 --> 00:17:05,450
No wonder
I couldn't book the presidential suite.

291
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,560
Turns out

292
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,890
you two booked it.

293
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:08,800
You like it?

294
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,490
Move in.

295
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,410
No thanks.

296
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,170
Dad.

297
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,080
Come, have a seat.

298
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,560
We have a great view, look.

299
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,360
You punk.

300
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,410
What are you doing here?

301
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:22,210
I'm here on business.

302
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,040
Business?

303
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,970
How come Dad and I didn't know

304
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,690
you're doing business in Roman?

305
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,970
I'm just in the early preparation phase.

306
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,080
Preparation?

307
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,410
Are you here

308
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:39,730
with that female reporter?

309
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,170
You're good.

310
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,650
I can't keep anything from you.

311
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,560
Yes, I came with her.

312
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,410
But I'm mainly here for business.

313
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,730
I'll spend a few days with her
in my spare time.

314
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,450
Dad, Yutian.

315
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,320
Why are you two here?

316
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,970
I'm here with Dad to talk business.

317
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,080
How come I don't know Changzhou Group

318
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,410
has business here?

319
00:18:07,782 --> 00:18:08,890
What kind of business?

320
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:09,930
Can you tell me?

321
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:12,280
Maybe I can give some ideas.

322
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,280
I want to establish

323
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,360
an offshore fishing hub here.

324
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,560
What do you think?

325
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,970
Any good suggestions?

326
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,490
Tell us. We'll discuss it.

327
00:18:21,693 --> 00:18:22,693
I do have some ideas.

328
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,410
If you ask me,

329
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,450
Changzhou Group should just open

330
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,410
a branch office here.

331
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,040
You two are usually busy back home.

332
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,890
I'm idle anyway.

333
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,730
I can stay in Roman permanently, right?

334
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,840
I'll help share your burden.

335
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,210
Forget it.

336
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,890
You don't know this field.

337
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:40,730
I can learn.

338
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,930
I'm a top student, okay?

339
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,210
It's not that simple.

340
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,040
Right, Dad?

341
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,120
Enough.

342
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,690
How about this?

343
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:48,840
Your brother and I

344
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,080
might stay here for a while.

345
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,930
When you're done having fun,

346
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,280
head back home sooner.

347
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,800
The three of us are abroad.

348
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,890
If anything happens to the company,

349
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,493
someone has to be there to handle it.

350
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,970
You're right.

351
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,520
Once I'm done here, I'll go back first.

352
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,080
Good.

353
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,320
Alright, I won't keep you two
from talking business.

354
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,450
I'll go now.

355
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,170
Okay.

356
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,250
The view here is great.

357
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,560
Take care of yourself.

358
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:31,930
Mr. Han.

359
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,010
Did it not go well with Chairman?

360
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,930
My dad and my brother

361
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,010
know Tang Xin is in Roman.

362
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:46,970
If you're worried,

363
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,360
I can warn Miss Tang.

364
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,120
Not yet.

365
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,760
Let me think about it first.

366
00:19:56,804 --> 00:19:57,982
You can get back to work.

367
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,600
Got it.

368
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,730
How about switching seats with him?

369
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,840
You two switch seats.

370
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,040
This won't work.

371
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,650
Look at that.

372
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,320
- Hello, Chief!
- Hello!

373
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:23,930
Hello, Chief!

374
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:24,800
Hello, comrades!

375
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,450
Today is October 1st, 2019.

376
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,120
It's National Day,

377
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,930
celebrating 70 years of New China.

378
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,650
It's also the 70th anniversary

379
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,080
of the People's Navy.

380
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,560
At this moment,

381
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,930
we're performing escort duty offshore.

382
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,410
Through our actions,

383
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:43,120
we safeguard the nation's dignity
and the people's safety.

384
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,010
This is the best blessing

385
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,490
and the best birthday gift
to our country

386
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,840
that we can offer as soldiers.

387
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,182
- Well said!
- Well said!

388
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:54,900
Alright.

389
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,040
After having dumplings,

390
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,890
we'll watch the military parade
from Tiananmen Square!

391
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,080
- Sure!
- Sure!

392
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:21,520
♪It's your birthday today, China♪

393
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:29,730
(It's your birthday today, China.)

394
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,080
(On this special day,)

395
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,360
(I believe every Chinese)

396
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,800
(will sincerely say,)

397
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,080
("I love you, China.")

398
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:46,210
(70 years of trials and triumphs.)

399
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,450
(The red ribbon over Tiananmen Square)

400
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,210
(symbolizes the red gene)

401
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:55,600
(connecting history,
the present, and the future.)

402
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,320
Dad.

403
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,250
What do you think

404
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,600
about what Yuhang said?

405
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,360
He said he came here for a girl.

406
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,890
But why is she here?

407
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,080
I have a feeling

408
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,360
that this female reporter

409
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:28,080
knows a lot about us.

410
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,120
We need to think of a solution.

411
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,890
Yeah.

412
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,650
How did she know we came to Roman?

413
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,360
Since she followed us here,

414
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,600
why don't we settle her here?

415
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,410
No.

416
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,410
Our trip here can be traced.

417
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,890
If she's really investigating us,

418
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,080
someone close to her must know.

419
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,080
If anything happens to her here,

420
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,650
we'll be the prime suspects.

421
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,120
How about this?

422
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,450
Think of another plan.

423
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,930
Capture her first.

424
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:26,080
Hello.

425
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,760
Hello.

426
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,840
Coffee again?

427
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,210
Or do you want to try our new cocktail?

428
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,690
- New cocktail?
- Yeah.

429
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,450
Okay.

430
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:37,320
Please check the menu.

431
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,690
Okay, this one.

432
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,840
Wait a moment, please.

433
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,760
Hello, Princess Yangyang. Miss me?

434
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:59,120
When are you coming back?

435
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,890
They should be back
from their escort mission soon.

436
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,210
What if Captain Wu can't get in touch

437
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,520
with you?

438
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:09,280
Him? He doesn't even miss me.

439
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:11,930
Tang Xin.

440
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:14,690
Do you notice your tone

441
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,280
whenever Captain Wu is mentioned?

442
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,170
That bitterness sounds like
someone who failed to win affection.

443
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,410
Alright.

444
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,210
Zong Qing told me everything.

445
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,690
He said they're all doing well.

446
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,120
Zong Qing called you?

447
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,120
When and from where?

448
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,120
From the sea, of course.

449
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,690
He hung up after a few sentences.

450
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,250
Captain Wu didn't call you?

451
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,080
No, not even once.

452
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,560
Guess I'm just

453
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,360
a disposable online friend.

454
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,730
Maybe Captain Wu

455
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,120
gave up his spot.

456
00:25:45,137 --> 00:25:46,120
He gave it to Zong Qing.

457
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,080
Look, I'm a special case.

458
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,520
Speaking of which, Lan Yangyang,

459
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,450
you look like you lost weight.

460
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,560
What's going on?

461
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,280
Have you been eating well lately?

462
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,280
Ms. Wang's a great cook,

463
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,650
yet you're not gaining weight.

464
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,250
Don't bring up my mom.

465
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,648
I haven't even started worrying,

466
00:26:02,671 --> 00:26:03,840
and my mom already is.

467
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,730
I want to move back to my place.

468
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,490
No way.

469
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,250
Don't even think about it. I object.

470
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,890
Don't worry.

471
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,280
Even if I move back,

472
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,280
my mom won't leave me alone.

473
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,520
She'll deliver my meals on time
each day.

474
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,600
I just want some peace.

475
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,280
What's wrong? Are you okay?

476
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,210
How's your prenatal checkup? Did you go?

477
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:27,890
Yes.

478
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,410
It went pretty well.

479
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,250
Really?

480
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,890
Really.

481
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,040
Don't worry. I can take care of myself.

482
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,450
I've got to go. It's nap time.

483
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,600
Sure, wait for me to come back.

484
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:41,490
Bye.

485
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:42,280
Bye.

486
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,560
Stop walking. Let's take a break.

487
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,970
Slow down.

488
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,970
Does it hurt? Hold on.

489
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,210
The ride is almost here.

490
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,650
Go to the hospital for a scan.
You'll be fine.

491
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,080
Here, make way. Cake coming through.

492
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,550
(Ride the Waves)
Careful.

493
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,170
This cake looks good.

494
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,930
Of course, it took all afternoon.

495
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,170
Nice work.

496
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,560
Good job on the cake.

497
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:42,650
Brigadier.

498
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,280
- Keep prepping, everyone.
- Well...

499
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,490
Give us a short speech today.

500
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,250
Later.

501
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,840
- Just a few words.
- Just a few words.

502
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:55,520
Don't cause a scene.

503
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,170
Well...

504
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,250
This escort mission has been tough.

505
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,080
We kept postponing birthdays.

506
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,730
We finally made it today.

507
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,560
Resources on board are limited.

508
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,360
I discussed with Captain.

509
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,520
We

510
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,490
prepared a birthday gift for you later.

511
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,840
If it's your birthday,

512
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,040
you won't need to wait in line.

513
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,582
Go to the commanding officer's cabin

514
00:28:16,582 --> 00:28:17,930
and call your family.

515
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,320
Tell them

516
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,600
that the unit remembered their birthday.

517
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,840
The navy is celebrating it for them.

518
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,709
Thank you, Brigadier!

519
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:25,890
- Thank you, Brigadier!
- Good!

520
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,120
Keep prepping.

521
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,040
- Okay.
- Okay.

522
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,960
Come here, Zong Qing.

523
00:28:30,004 --> 00:28:30,693
Come here.

524
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,010
Where's Yi Nanwang?

525
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,560
He's at the promotion ceremony.

526
00:28:34,915 --> 00:28:36,320
He's becoming a sergeant, right?

527
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,800
Once he's done,

528
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,280
have him eat longevity noodles.

529
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,170
From now on, include him

530
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,560
in the birthday parties.

531
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,320
Yes.

532
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:48,600
Captain.

533
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,250
Why didn't you go to the cafeteria?

534
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,360
Report!
I'll go after I finish writing my diary.

535
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,490
Congratulations.

536
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,840
For what?

537
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,760
You're now officially a sergeant.

538
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,970
Thank you, Captain.

539
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,120
Hello.

540
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:19,930
Hello.

541
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,120
What do you want to drink?

542
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,410
California Sunset.

543
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,120
Okay.

544
00:29:38,186 --> 00:29:38,580
Please.

545
00:29:38,626 --> 00:29:39,210
Thank you.

546
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,804
Here, have some warm water.

547
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:06,800
Thanks.

548
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,382
What did the doctor say?

549
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,970
It's good. Everything's normal.

550
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,010
Look,
I picked these clothes for the baby.

551
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,280
- This color is nice.
- This one's not bad.

552
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,660
(Zong Qing)

553
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,320
Hello.

554
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,650
The number you dialed is powered off.

555
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,520
Sorry.

556
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:40,650
The number you dialed is powered off.

557
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:49,260
(Chat With Big Big Wolf)

558
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,430
(I'm going to sleep. Goodnight.)

559
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,810
(Busy? Take care of yourself.)

560
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:58,370
(I'm so tired today. Goodnight.)

561
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,840
(Went out for dinner with Xin.)

562
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,220
(Let's come together next time.)

563
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:04,137
(Stayed home today. I kind of miss you.)

564
00:31:04,137 --> 00:31:05,248
(Do you miss me? I miss you.)

565
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,410
(Discovered a pretty milk tea shop.)

566
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,890
(It's a great photo spot.
I took many photos with Xin.)

567
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,540
(I'm doing well. I just miss you.)

568
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:44,410
Ding.

569
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,490
Get me a car

570
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,137
and pick me up at the hotel back door.

571
00:32:47,137 --> 00:32:48,520
Yes, immediately. Hurry.

572
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:53,780
(Chinese Navy Wenzhou Ship
Wishes You A Happy Birthday)

573
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,210
Happy Birthday.

574
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:55,800
Good!

575
00:32:56,671 --> 00:32:58,560
Squad Leader.
Say some blessings to your family.

576
00:32:58,582 --> 00:32:59,820
Such a good atmosphere.

577
00:32:59,826 --> 00:33:00,493
Let others speak.

578
00:33:00,493 --> 00:33:01,080
Don't film me.

579
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,800
Don't film.

580
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,210
Come on, say something.

581
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,490
Come on. Haiyang, speak.

582
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,080
Okay.

583
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,320
Families and comrades, don't worry.

584
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,080
We're training hard at sea.
It's been good.

585
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,560
And we get energy
from the kitchen all the time.

586
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,040
Dai, let me say something.

587
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,730
To our families across the ocean,

588
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:16,560
best wishes to you.

589
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,293
- Good.
- Beautiful.

590
00:33:17,293 --> 00:33:17,826
Happy Chinese New Year?

591
00:33:17,826 --> 00:33:20,040
Who hasn't recorded yet?
You two. Stop chatting.

592
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,600
I won't say anything. Let him speak.

593
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,040
Let me see.

594
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,800
Mom and Dad, aside from my hairline,

595
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,280
everything's fine. Don't worry.

596
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,320
You're self-aware.

597
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,250
- Go.
- Bravo.

598
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,650
Go there.

599
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,760
Don't just laugh. Here.

600
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,080
Say something.

601
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,730
Say a few words. Come on.

602
00:33:36,937 --> 00:33:38,760
- Come on, say something.
- What's going on?

603
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:41,800
Say something.

604
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
Say something nice.

605
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,440
Say something to Xin.

606
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,560
Prove you're thinking of her even when you're
in the middle of nowhere. How romantic.

607
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,970
I have a phone. Why use a camera?

608
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,490
It's high definition, bro.

609
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,040
Yeah, besides,

610
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,760
why should I let you hear what I say?

611
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,730
Go.

612
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,120
How annoying.

613
00:33:59,280 --> 00:33:59,840
Go.

614
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,360
Yi Nanwang, hurry up.

615
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,210
- Yes.
- Come here.

616
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:04,520
Attention.

617
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:06,800
Take this opportunity today

618
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,720
to give your family some blessings.

619
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,890
My family?

620
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:18,380
(Tang Xin)

621
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,240
Captain Wu, what are you doing?

622
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,080
Can you take leave this week?

623
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,720
(Tang keeps nagging me)

624
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,520
(to bring you home for dinner.)

625
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,850
(If you can't come, tell him yourself.)

626
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,810
(I was in a meeting
and missed your call.)

627
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,680
(Is your phone off again?)

628
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,370
Why did you call? What's up?

629
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:48,160
(Why suddenly ask if I ate?)

630
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,890
(You can't even bring me food.)

631
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:54,770
Did you learn some tricks online again?

632
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,560
Stop learning all that nonsense.

633
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,200
You know what I want to hear.

634
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,160
(Where did you run off to again?)

635
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,890
(I haven't heard from you for days.)

636
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,560
Did you have a sudden mission again?

637
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:10,520
Next time before you go,

638
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,290
just give me a heads-up.

639
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:18,930
Wu Si, when are you coming back?

640
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:24,970
Tang Xin.

641
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:28,770
I love you.

642
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,850
Sorry.

643
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:08,810
The number you dialed is unavailable.

644
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:09,970
Please try again later.

645
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,160
Sorry.

646
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,370
I just got an expert report today.

647
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,640
This porcelain
is from Song Dynasty's official kiln.

648
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,330
The relic's price is very high.

649
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,720
Experts confirmed

650
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:25,240
it was
from a Song Dynasty official kiln.

651
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,600
It's very valuable.

652
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,330
Was it discovered near the sunken ship

653
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:33,290
we've been searching for?

654
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,200
Is this found
near the sea area of the sunken ship?

655
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:37,640
Yes.

656
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,770
I suppose it was thrown out of the ship

657
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,040
when it was sinking.

658
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:45,160
I guess the ship
is full of stuff like this.

659
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:45,890
He thinks

660
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:48,720
this porcelain
fell out during the sinking.

661
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:51,330
There must be many more on that ship.

662
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,770
Hearing you say that,

663
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,080
I'm really excited.

664
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,560
I hope our investigation team

665
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,810
brings back good news soon.

666
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:07,370
We can't wait. And expecting good news
from the investigation team.

667
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,640
Oh yeah. It will be.

668
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,680
Chairman, a word please.

669
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,770
Say it here.

670
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,850
We've got her.

671
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,200
Where is she now?

672
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,770
At a temporary location.

673
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,120
Was it handled cleanly?

674
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,640
Don't worry, all good.

675
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:29,040
We just gave her a strong dose.

676
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,080
She'll sleep a bit longer.

677
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,770
Keep a close eye on her.

678
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,160
Make sure there are no mistakes.

679
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,200
Got it.

680
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,660
My friends, are you having troubles?

681
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,260
Are we having trouble?

682
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,660
We

683
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,980
are being watched.

684
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:59,300
They've been watching us since China.

685
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,540
We are being watched from China

686
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,540
all the way here.

687
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,780
How is it possible?

688
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,260
William, don't worry.

689
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:17,100
We've already caught that person.

690
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:22,420
I do need to trouble you for something.

691
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,580
I don't want this person
to return to China.

692
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,620
Here you go.

693
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,660
Thank you.

694
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:11,940
Cheers.

695
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,260
Tang Xin.

696
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:26,940
Tang Xin.

697
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,740
Mr. Han?

698
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,780
Shh.

699
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,660
Where are we?

700
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,900
On a cargo ship.

701
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,900
Probably heading overseas.

702
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,900
Cargo ship?

703
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:03,660
Why am I on a cargo ship?

704
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,060
You were drugged in Roman,

705
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,260
kidnapped by traffickers,

706
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,620
and brought here.

707
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,700
Why are you also here?

708
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,420
I tried to save you,

709
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,540
but I failed.

710
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,900
So they caught me as well.

711
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,300
Is that a trafficker?

712
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:42,100
No. Probably just one of their lackeys.

713
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,060
He's guarding us.

714
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,540
Mr. Han.

715
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,260
I know you followed me to Roman.

716
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,460
