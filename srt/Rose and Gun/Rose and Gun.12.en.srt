18
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,090
Don't eat that, Honey.
It must taste awful.

19
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,610
Let's just order takeout.

20
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:57,770
Not at all.

21
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,350
My wife cooked this herself.

22
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,582
How can I say it tastes bad?

23
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,770
I'll eat all of it.

24
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,610
Order whatever you want for yourself.

25
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,170
Seriously, stop. Let's just go out.

26
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,300
What about all this food then?

27
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,493
It would be such a waste.

28
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,840
You've never done any survival training.

29
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,290
Food is precious.

30
00:02:19,493 --> 00:02:20,860
Fine, I'll eat it with you.

31
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,410
I mean,

32
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,450
it is a little bit bitter.

33
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:41,570
Is it good?

34
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,537
Yeah. It's good.

35
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,410
Dear,

36
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,730
I feel like

37
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,130
I aged two years
just by putting on this ring.

38
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,650
No way. I don't see that.

39
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,650
My Zong looks good no matter what.

40
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,060
I think so too.

41
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,130
Shameless.

42
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:14,490
Honey,

43
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,850
do you have any plans

44
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,000
for our honeymoon?

45
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,400
I do.

46
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,290
However you want to spend it,
that's how we'll do it.

47
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,880
Can't you have
your own opinion for once?

48
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,370
With this block of wood for a brain?

49
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:33,970
I'll just listen to you.

50
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,770
Wherever you want to go, we'll go.

51
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,950
I knew you'd say that.

52
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,890
Good thing I came prepared.

53
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,290
Look.

54
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,700
Hangzhou, Xi'an, and Dali.

55
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,410
Lhasa could work too.

56
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,450
Just the two of us. How does that sound?

57
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,030
Dear.

58
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,090
You're getting carried away.

59
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,320
Let's pick somewhere closer.

60
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,190
Why?

61
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,140
Think about it.

62
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,130
What if we're halfway through the trip,

63
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,720
and I suddenly get called back to base?

64
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,110
That'd be so awkward.

65
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,690
Nothing works for you.

66
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,400
Plan it yourself. I'm out.

67
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:19,970
I've got it.

68
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,820
Don't worry, Honey.

69
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,940
I'll come up

70
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,070
with the perfect
honeymoon itinerary for you.

71
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,000
If you aim too long,

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,204
you're more likely to miss.

73
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:53,860
Got it?

74
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:55,390
Got it.

75
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,970
You sure you got it?

76
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,890
Captain Tang just called.

77
00:05:00,982 --> 00:05:02,250
He wants to speak to you.

78
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,390
Call him back after training.

79
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,380
(Wu Si)

80
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,290
The number you're calling
is currently unavailable.

81
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,170
Please try again later.

82
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,810
Sorry. The number you have dialed...

83
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,980
("New Perspective"

84
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,980
(and Second-Half Work Plan,
presented by Tang Xin)

85
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,820
(Wu Si: Are you asleep?
If not, let's talk.)

86
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,404
(I've thought about the question
you asked me at the Mazhan Town.)

87
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:46,900
(I want to see you.)

88
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:52,700
(Notifications muted)

89
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,330
Zong Qing!

90
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,050
This isn't a field drill.

91
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,280
Can you slow down?

92
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,070
You're the one who overslept.

93
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,640
We agreed to head out by 6 AM.

94
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,160
Any slower and we'll miss everything.

95
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,970
Miss what? We're on our honeymoon,

96
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,710
not rushing to a morning market.

97
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,004
Sorry, force of habit.

98
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:43,780
I'm tired.

99
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,410
We're almost at the top.

100
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,582
Just a few more steps.
The view is amazing up there.

101
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:50,580
Come on!

102
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:52,350
No.

103
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:53,320
How about

104
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,680
I sing something to hype you up?

105
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,400
Ready? Go!

107
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,093
♪Our song is loud♪

108
00:08:03,093 --> 00:08:04,410
Zong Qing, this is our honeymoon!

109
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,910
Can't you sing something romantic?

110
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,850
What even is this place?
Just mountains and wilderness.

111
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,410
Don't say that.

112
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,870
I came here
during a training exercise once.

113
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,770
It used to be way wilder back then.

114
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:16,050
Just forests everywhere.

115
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:17,390
Also,

116
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,160
if you ever get lost in the woods,

117
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,260
carve something

118
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,170
into the trees.

119
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,450
I'm not getting lost. Who'd get lost?

120
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,160
Right. You're the smartest.

121
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:27,870
Come on.

122
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,050
Look.

123
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,760
There's a waterfall up ahead! Hurry!

124
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,290
You see it?

125
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,530
Wow, there really is a waterfall!

126
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,560
What do you mean "really"?
I'd never lie to you.

127
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,970
Three, two, one, cheese!

128
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:45,810
Cheese!

129
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,130
Got it.

130
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:49,071
Come on! Let's take a selfie!

131
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:49,680
Okay.

132
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:53,048
Here we go.

133
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,270
Three, two, one.

134
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:58,270
One more.

135
00:09:02,337 --> 00:09:03,550
Pay attention to the technique.

136
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:20,620
Yi Nanwang.

137
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,250
Here.

138
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,640
Forgot the basics?

139
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,630
Sir.

140
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:24,790
For some reason,

141
00:09:24,915 --> 00:09:26,350
the gun just won't cooperate today.

142
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,010
Then feed it.

143
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,360
It's a starving beast.

144
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,810
You need to feed it bullets

145
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,380
that weigh 10, 20 times more than you.

146
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,140
(People's Liberation Army Navy)

147
00:09:36,115 --> 00:09:36,760
Sergeant Cheng.

148
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,130
He's been overworked.

149
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,290
He never got a break in the Mazhan Town.

150
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:45,610
Yi Nanwang.

151
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,110
Here.

152
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,248
Inspect your weapon. Stand up.

153
00:09:47,271 --> 00:09:47,671
Yes, Sir.

154
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,590
Return your firearm.

155
00:09:57,004 --> 00:09:58,160
Head to the infirmary.

156
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:01,710
Come on.

157
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,620
You've got this.

158
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,320
- Honey, I can't walk anymore.
- Keep going.

159
00:10:08,537 --> 00:10:09,790
We're almost there. Come on.

160
00:10:18,382 --> 00:10:19,010
Push yourself.

161
00:10:19,737 --> 00:10:20,740
I can't go on, Honey...

162
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,610
There are still so many steps...

163
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,179
I can't go any further. I'm exhausted.

164
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,140
Just hold on a bit longer.

165
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,410
The view up top is even better.

166
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,050
No, I can't.

167
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,080
Just a bit more.

168
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,350
No!

169
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,900
Then what do you want to do?

170
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,630
I want to find a homestay

171
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,320
and crash in a bed.

172
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,380
Honey, this is a hiking trip.

173
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,090
Yes,

174
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,320
but it's also our honeymoon!

175
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,410
It's not military training.

176
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,640
Let's go find a homestay

177
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,740
and just rest, please?

178
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,560
Please.

179
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:52,480
No.

180
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,420
Please, Honey.

181
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,710
Come on. Please?

182
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,330
Please...

183
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,330
- Okay, okay.
- Pretty please...

184
00:11:01,915 --> 00:11:02,960
Hurry up and find one.

185
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,330
A homestay, right?

186
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,810
Does it hurt here?

187
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,280
No.

188
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,030
Here?

189
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:17,970
No.

190
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,410
Be honest.

191
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:23,740
Does it hurt?

192
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:24,360
Yes.

193
00:11:27,626 --> 00:11:30,026
I'll give you some medicine
to help with circulation first.

194
00:11:30,071 --> 00:11:32,337
Take it easy and stay warm
these next couple of days.

195
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,750
Avoid putting strain on your arm.

196
00:11:35,137 --> 00:11:36,760
You'll need three to five days of rest.

197
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,070
Three to five days?

198
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,660
But I still have training.

199
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:42,000
Do you want your arm to fall off?

200
00:11:42,004 --> 00:11:43,810
Didn't you hear?
A few of the female soldiers

201
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,640
who went to Mazhan Town ignored the pain

202
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,204
and ended up with full-on tendonitis.

203
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:48,690
Are they

204
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:50,840
our female soldiers?

205
00:11:51,915 --> 00:11:52,826
What are their names?

206
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,670
Why are you so worked up?

207
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,248
Sergeant Cheng's girlfriend works
in our staff department.

208
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,990
They've been out of contact for days.

209
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,130
You have a girlfriend?

210
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,448
His girlfriend's pretty well-known.
Her name is...

211
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,269
As far as I know,
she's not from the staff department.

212
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,950
I'll help you ask around
if I get a chance.

213
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,810
Thanks, I appreciate it.

214
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:23,570
Ms. Wu,

215
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,650
let me confirm

216
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,700
what you just

217
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,890
told me.

218
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,850
You signed up on a dating website,

219
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,960
and they matched you
with several people.

220
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,490
And you kept in touch

221
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,760
with three of them.

222
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,460
Yes.

223
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,050
And out of the three,

224
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,050
two scammed you

225
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,048
and then disappeared?

226
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,360
Yes, that's what happened.

227
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,140
One didn't

228
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,410
scam much.

229
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,740
But the other one was horrible...

230
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:50,920
Ms. Wu,

231
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,080
no need to be vague.

232
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,970
Can you give us their names
and phone numbers?

233
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,493
We'll note them down and follow up.

234
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:57,610
Well...

235
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,230
The names were fake.

236
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,760
The numbers are all out of service now.

237
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,090
If I could find them myself,

238
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,670
I wouldn't have come to you.

239
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,570
How much did the one

240
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,530
who scammed you the most take

241
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,520
from you?

242
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,300
About 70,000 to 80,000 yuan.

243
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:17,690
That's quite a bit.

244
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,270
Did you report it?

245
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:20,320
I did.

246
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,200
The local station logged it,

247
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,440
but they still haven't found him.

248
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,760
Can you give us a physical description

249
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,680
of the guy?

250
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,870
He was tall

251
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,480
and slim.

252
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,280
Fair-skinned.

253
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,200
Wore glasses.

254
00:13:36,804 --> 00:13:38,182
Looked gentle and polite.

255
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,520
Didn't look like a scammer at all.

256
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,604
And he had the smoothest way of talking.

257
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,530
Who would've thought

258
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,830
he'd turn out to be so heartless?

259
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,150
That's exactly how these people work.

260
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,890
They act all harmless

261
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,800
to target kind-hearted women like you.

262
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:55,970
We've recorded everything.

263
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,710
Why don't you head home for now?

264
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:58,540
All right.

265
00:13:58,970 --> 00:13:59,860
Please make sure

266
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,790
to expose

267
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,520
these fake daters.

268
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,000
So others don't get duped like I did.

269
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,330
We will.

270
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,870
Thank you.

271
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,715
You can go back now.

272
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,120
I'll head out, then.

273
00:14:11,182 --> 00:14:12,071
This way, please.

274
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,830
This one's tricky.

275
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,700
I heard that site's

276
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,530
still running matchmaking events.

277
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,390
Maybe we should check it out
and try our luck?

278
00:14:25,737 --> 00:14:27,093
We could do a feature on this.

279
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:28,240
Hai.

280
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:29,940
Get the gear ready.

281
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,880
This homestay isn't bad. It's pretty.

282
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,226
- Let's check it out.
- Come on.

283
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,160
Slow down.

284
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:01,420
Done.

285
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:01,980
Okay.

286
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:03,530
Take a look.

287
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,850
There's a bird's nest over there!

288
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:05,850
Come on!

289
00:15:06,182 --> 00:15:07,710
Aren't you going to check the pictures?

290
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,350
Sure.

291
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,290
Later.

292
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,940
I'm a bird!

293
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,470
Honey.

294
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:28,610
Honey.

295
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,580
Zong Qing!

296
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,010
Why did you drop me?

297
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,610
Honey, I didn't mean to.

298
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,048
I didn't expect you to be that heavy.

299
00:15:35,048 --> 00:15:35,604
Excuse me?

300
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:36,810
I... I meant

301
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,450
I didn't expect the thing
to be so flimsy.

302
00:15:39,582 --> 00:15:40,410
Where does it hurt?

303
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,880
My lower back.

304
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,040
I'll rub it for you.

305
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:45,890
Help me up.

306
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:46,800
Okay.

307
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:52,920
You okay, Honey?

308
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:00,650
Come in.

309
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,090
Room service.

310
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:05,810
Dressed up so nicely

311
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,090
on a weekend.

312
00:16:09,582 --> 00:16:11,330
You even did your eyebrows and eyeliner.

313
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,170
You're all dolled up.

314
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,050
What big event are you going to?

315
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,900
Nothing major.

316
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,410
It's just a small event.

317
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:21,810
What kind of event?

318
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,470
Dad, can you not ask?

319
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,370
I'm an adult.

320
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,690
Can I not have a little privacy?

321
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,737
You're not leaving the house
until you tell me.

322
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,330
Fine.

323
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:38,910
Come here.

324
00:16:41,915 --> 00:16:43,050
I'm going on a blind date.

325
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,937
You've got to be kidding me.

326
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:46,680
Nope.

327
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:47,610
Tang Xin,

328
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,180
are you doing this just to spite me?

329
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,080
I introduced you

330
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,109
to a great guy like Wu Si

331
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,915
and you didn't even
give him a proper chance.

332
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,493
And now you're going on a blind date?

333
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,300
I refuse to believe

334
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,940
you'll find anyone better than Wu Si.

335
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,330
You never know.

336
00:17:03,782 --> 00:17:05,150
You're going to be the death of me!

337
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,410
Finally, a bed! This feels amazing.

338
00:17:26,426 --> 00:17:27,720
- Feels good, right?
- So good.

339
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,110
- Miss.
- Join me, Honey.

340
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,770
Get up.

341
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:32,770
Let's unpack first.

342
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,070
Whenever we arrive somewhere,

343
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,050
we get in the habit
of unpacking right away. Got it?

344
00:17:41,782 --> 00:17:42,610
What do you think?

345
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,220
Not a bad choice, right?

346
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,160
It's beautiful, huh?

347
00:17:45,293 --> 00:17:47,426
My wife picked this place.
Of course it's beautiful.

348
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:51,430
I need to use the bathroom.

349
00:17:53,248 --> 00:17:54,250
This is a big room.

350
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:00,380
Honey!

351
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,570
What is it?

352
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,700
Honey! Honey!

353
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:03,620
A bug!

354
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,610
Where?

355
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:05,820
Under the pillow!

356
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,570
Wait. Don't go near it.

357
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:08,660
It's fine. I'll take a look.

358
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:12,850
Where was it?

359
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,720
Right under that pillow!

360
00:18:14,915 --> 00:18:15,890
There's nothing here.

361
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:17,850
There is!

362
00:18:17,915 --> 00:18:18,970
How big is the bug?

363
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,610
This big.

364
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,410
This big.

365
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,010
How big exactly?

366
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,030
This big!

367
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,250
Listen.

368
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,210
Back in survival training,

369
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,210
we had to eat bugs that size raw.

370
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,890
That's gross.

371
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,650
You're not scared, but I am.

372
00:18:34,671 --> 00:18:37,490
Ever since I was a kid, the one thing
I've been terrified of is bugs.

373
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,570
Don't worry. Come sit.

374
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,140
No way! What if it bites me?

375
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,430
If it bites anyone,
it'll bite me first. Sit.

376
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,250
Trust me.

377
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,440
Before you go to sleep tonight,

378
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,626
I promise
I'll eat every single bug in this place.

379
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:54,350
Honey,

380
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,050
maybe

381
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,030
we should just go home.

382
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:18,320
So much for an internet-famous homestay.

383
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,760
Many cockroaches and mosquitoes.

384
00:19:19,804 --> 00:19:20,960
Uh-huh. One-star.

385
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,270
Home is still the best.

386
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,170
And home has you,

387
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,910
my super handsome husband.

388
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:38,530
What is it?

389
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,850
I might have to go back for training.

390
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,090
Honey?

391
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,140
Princess?

392
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:06,850
Don't be like that.

393
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,010
Don't touch me.

394
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:10,620
What did I do?

395
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,440
I'm not mad.

396
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:13,582
Just go back to the unit.

397
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:17,610
Okay.

398
00:20:19,315 --> 00:20:21,271
I'll call the base
and request leave right now.

399
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,290
I'll skip the training.

400
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,160
What are you doing?

401
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,810
You can't just skip training.

402
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,093
If my dad finds out, he'll say
I'm being irresponsible again.

403
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,530
I knew my Yangyang was the best.

404
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:30,930
You'll understand me, right?

405
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:31,850
You owe me big time,

406
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,740
you know that?

407
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,490
Honeymoon, trips, movies,

408
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,990
snacks, and a camping trip.

409
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,740
I've got three hours left

410
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,160
before I have to head back to base.

411
00:20:46,226 --> 00:20:47,404
Subtract travel time,

412
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:49,900
and that leaves us two hours.

413
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,090
What do you want to do

414
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,250
with those two hours?

415
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,010
We have two hours.

416
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,115
I want to take you camping. Right now.

417
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:08,410
Thanks.

418
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,640
Hey, can I get to know you?

419
00:21:36,826 --> 00:21:38,090
Sorry, I'm here to meet someone.

420
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,350
We can add each other on WeChat?

421
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,130
I won't bother you.

422
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,650
I'm not comfortable adding strangers.

423
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,515
Maybe we can follow each other on Weibo?

424
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,170
I don't have a Weibo account.

425
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,130
Sorry.

426
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:15,860
Honey!

427
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:16,740
Do you like it?

428
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,680
I love it! This is so romantic.

429
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:20,780
Come on. Let's go inside.

430
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,040
How did you set all this up?

431
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,160
And all these snacks!

432
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,590
They're all your favorites.

433
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,090
Young man.

434
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,250
Can I call you that?

435
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,290
I'm probably a few years older than you.

436
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,560
I'm not here for a date.

437
00:22:59,010 --> 00:22:59,980
I'm looking for someone.

438
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,090
Everyone here is looking for someone.

439
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,300
Let's have a quick chat.

440
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:05,370
You probably

441
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,110
just graduated not long ago, right?

442
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,150
In your early 20s?

443
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:11,810
My last name's Li.

444
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,850
I started my own business years ago.

445
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,890
I've got a few small companies now,

446
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,640
plus some online platforms.

447
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:18,770
They're doing decently.

448
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,090
Can I ask

449
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,410
what you do?

450
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:26,448
I'm a member of the military.

451
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:27,290
The military?

452
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,750
What's the point

453
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,382
of joining the military
in today's world?

454
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,330
I heard

455
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,770
training is brutal,

456
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,370
and you hardly get to go home.

457
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,040
Ma'am,

458
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,271
if you don't understand the military,

459
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:40,930
please don't speak on it.

460
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:44,970
I may not know the military,

461
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,610
but I sure know society.

462
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,370
Without a solid financial foundation,

463
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,730
you're not going to make it far.

464
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,450
I've seen plenty of guys

465
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:52,730
like you.

466
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,450
Why'd you join the military?

467
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,610
You look sharp.

468
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,250
Don't you want to get rich?

469
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,970
I'm just kidding.

470
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:11,380
Honey.

471
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,330
Are we just going to spend
this precious hour

472
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,140
snacking?

473
00:24:19,537 --> 00:24:20,737
What else do you want to do?

474
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:25,930
Look at me.

475
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:33,870
Hold on.

476
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,050
Honey,

477
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,250
your skin is way too rough.

478
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,400
Close your eyes.

479
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,070
All set, Honey. Come at me.

480
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,050
Cold! Cold! Cold!

481
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,570
- Don't move.
- Cold!

482
00:24:58,610 --> 00:24:59,826
- Cold...
- Stay still.

483
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,970
This is an emergency mask.

484
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,770
It hydrates, moisturizes,

485
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,380
and soothes the skin.

486
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,540
Your face

487
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,780
is cracking from dryness.

488
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,450
If you don't start taking care of it,

489
00:25:12,671 --> 00:25:14,315
I might not want you anymore.

490
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,090
In my unit,

491
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,610
I'm known for having baby-soft skin.

492
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,030
The others are much worse.

493
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,900
Nobody says they're unwanted.

494
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:22,670
Even better.

495
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,530
Take all these masks back with you.

496
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,730
Use them together.

497
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:26,730
Especially your captain.

498
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,730
His skin needs serious help.

499
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,590
He won't win over Xin, otherwise.

500
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,490
Well,

501
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,370
I'm curious about your plans.

502
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,570
These days young people
are all chasing money.

503
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,420
Why are you toughing it out
in the military?

504
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,530
What do you get out of it?

505
00:25:44,671 --> 00:25:45,780
I know at least one benefit.

506
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,220
I don't have

507
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:50,780
to talk to you.

508
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,290
Oh, come on.

509
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,780
When I was your age,

510
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,410
I was already out hustling.

511
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,020
Everyone starts off

512
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,140
with dreams and ambitions.

513
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,600
Then reality hits, and you grow up.

514
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:13,450
With your looks, you'd have

515
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:14,570
no problem finding someone

516
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:15,826
if you weren't in the military.

517
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:18,070
But hey, you chose this,

518
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,310
so don't be surprised
if people are a bit picky.

519
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,130
It's fine for men

520
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,770
to be poor when they're young.

521
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,680
We're both adults here.

522
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,530
I'll cut to the chase.

523
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,610
I like your vibe.

524
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:31,530
I'm interested.

525
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,740
I want to get to know you.

526
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,170
They say it's better to marry well
than to be raised well.

527
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,330
But for men,

528
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,915
marrying well is even more important.

529
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,810
I'm 35.

530
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:40,870
Divorced.

531
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:41,890
Childfree.

532
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,690
Started my business young,

533
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,410
now financially free.

534
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,160
From the moment I saw you,

535
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:50,630
I liked you.

536
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,570
I doubt you get paid much.

537
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,050
So, how about you come be with me?

538
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,780
It's better than wasting away
in the military.

539
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:01,230
Even if we break up later,

540
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,850
you can always go back to it.

541
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,490
We taxpayers

542
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,250
are still footing your salary.

543
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,290
Wow. You really know how to talk.

544
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,460
Never in my life have I met someone

545
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,450
who's so good at making a point.

546
00:27:15,204 --> 00:27:16,493
But perhaps you've never heard

547
00:27:16,493 --> 00:27:18,170
of the Law on the Protection
of the Status and Rights

548
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,810
and Interests
of Military Personnel of China?

549
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,530
A soldier's honor and reputation

550
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:22,970
are protected by law.

551
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,960
No organization or individual is allowed

552
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,610
to slander or diminish

553
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,140
a soldier's dignity in any form.

554
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,610
We were having a conversation.

555
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,120
What's it got to do with you?

556
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,770
I'm a single woman here

557
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:39,850
for the matchmaking too.

558
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,690
But hearing you try

559
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,540
to "poach" someone from the military?

560
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,100
It absolutely

561
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,130
blew my mind.

562
00:27:46,448 --> 00:27:47,190
What's it to you?

563
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,410
The military owes you or something?

564
00:27:50,115 --> 00:27:52,960
If it weren't for people like him
toughing it out in the military,

565
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,040
you wouldn't even be here

566
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,050
enjoying the freedom to judge and pick.

567
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,740
Fine.

568
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,590
You can have my seat.

569
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:03,210
Whatever.

570
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,780
I'll just walk away.

571
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:18,720
What's this now?

572
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,060
You just sent me your dating profile
a few days ago.

573
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,020
And now you're sending it out

574
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:25,760
to someone else?

575
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,870
Sending profiles in bulk, huh?

576
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:30,470
Tell me.

577
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,330
How many people

578
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,230
have your number now?

579
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,870
I didn't leave a profile,
and I didn't give my number.

580
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,540
I'm here for you.

581
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,210
You're a terrible liar.

582
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,671
If you're already here,
what's so hard about admitting it?

583
00:28:48,671 --> 00:28:49,715
You're here for me?

584
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,170
How'd you even know I was here?

585
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,570
I got intel and took leave

586
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:53,980
to come.

587
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,070
Figures.

588
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:00,760
My dad

589
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,970
sold me out again.

590
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:05,050
Okay. Even if you did come for me,

591
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,060
what's so urgent that you had
to show up at this event?

592
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,300
I just want to ask

593
00:29:16,115 --> 00:29:17,760
how you jumped into a new date so fast

594
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,920
right after going on one with me?

595
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,740
I'm not actually here for a blind date.

596
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,340
Then why are you here?

597
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,890
That's classified information.

598
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:32,810
I can't disclose it.

599
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,850
What are your hobbies?

600
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,150
I like sports.

601
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,730
Playing ball. Swimming.

602
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:50,650
That kind of stuff.

603
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,690
Sometimes, I just go along

604
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,150
with whatever my friends have planned.

605
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,090
Sorry. I didn't know time was up.

606
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:01,550
No problem.

607
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,690
Hi. Can we get to know each other?

608
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:09,370
Sure.

609
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,250
I'm Sun Qing.

610
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,650
I studied art design in college.

611
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:16,290
Now I work as a freelance designer.

612
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,290
I'm Li Xiangdong. 28.

613
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:19,850
I majored in finance.

614
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,980
I'm the general manager

615
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,260
at Tongyuan Securities.

616
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,540
That's an impressive job.

617
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,210
It's all right.

618
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,330
Can I see your work ID?

619
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:27,960
Sure.

620
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,550
That's the guy!

621
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,020
He scammed me out of 60,000 yuan!

622
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,410
Finally caught him!

623
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,250
Who are you?

624
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,130
Ouch!

625
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:46,293
Call the police.

626
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,210
You finished your mission.

627
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,660
Now it's time I finish mine.

628
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,210
Yi Nanwang!

629
00:31:10,737 --> 00:31:13,048
I asked for Yi Nanwang.
What are you doing here?

630
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:17,310
Sir.

631
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:18,920
You're well-trained.

632
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:21,426
Come in, you two.

633
00:31:22,404 --> 00:31:24,269
Captain Zong,
you bring anything good to eat?

634
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,620
All you ever think about is food.
Would you eat a big ol' slap?

635
00:31:26,626 --> 00:31:27,420
Easy on him.

636
00:31:27,493 --> 00:31:29,620
He just got back from Mazhan Town
with a muscle strain.

637
00:31:29,626 --> 00:31:30,871
He's technically injured.

638
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,880
Oh, you feel bad for him now?

639
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,648
Here, it's all yours.

640
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,120
Can I eat it then?

641
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,000
Cured already, huh?

642
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:42,860
What is this stuff?

643
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:45,610
This is an "essence face mask."

644
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:48,250
Go grab the captain.

645
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,426
Let him show you
what a real miracle looks like.

646
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,130
Yes, Sir.

647
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:57,530
Captain Zong,

648
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,230
are you not telling me something?

649
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,140
You actually use this stuff?

650
00:32:22,804 --> 00:32:25,026
(What I did at Dayan Reef
was just my duty.)

651
00:32:26,582 --> 00:32:28,260
(I don't need you to repay me for it.)

652
00:32:32,471 --> 00:32:33,990
But I did keep the truth from you,

653
00:32:34,382 --> 00:32:36,204
and for that, I owe you an apology.

654
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:40,230
I know military men are not on your list
when it comes to choosing a partner.

655
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,850
But there's something
I have to tell you.

656
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,610
I don't care

657
00:32:45,693 --> 00:32:48,182
whether you like me for the uniform
or for me as a person.

658
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:49,970
I don't care

659
00:32:50,248 --> 00:32:52,826
whether you came to me
out of gratitude or curiosity.

660
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:54,610
But I do care,

661
00:32:56,026 --> 00:32:57,537
and it does matter to me,

662
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,560
that you're here going on a date
with someone else.

663
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:06,510
I like you.

664
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,170
Now,

665
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:13,950
the choice is yours.

666
00:33:31,026 --> 00:33:32,182
Captain, I'm telling you

667
00:33:32,204 --> 00:33:33,010
this mask is amazing.

668
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,080
It brightens, hydrates,

669
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,620
and even repairs...

670
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,330
You can stop.

671
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,210
Let me finish.

672
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,110
It brightens, hydrates,

673
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,210
and repairs the scars

674
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:40,060
on your face...

675
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,226
I said that's enough!

676
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,420
You yelled at me.

677
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,120
You actually yelled at me.

678
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,510
Did I?

679
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,010
Anyone hear me yell?

680
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,330
No, Sir.

681
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,810
Wow.

682
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,050
You're all eating snacks I brought.

683
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,290
Mouths full

684
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,830
but no gratitude?

685
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:11,170
Zong Qing.

686
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,530
Keep your masks to yourself.

687
00:34:13,693 --> 00:34:15,210
We won't judge you for your skincare.

688
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,450
No making fun of comrades.

689
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:18,330
Is that clear?

690
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:19,210
Yes, Sir.

691
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,210
You know,

692
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,204
I heard Xin likes guys
who are into face masks.

693
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,730
You know what Yangyang told me?

694
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:29,610
She said Xin hoards sheet masks.

695
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:30,500
And

696
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,900
do you really think
a guy can meet her family

697
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,240
with a face

698
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,330
as rough as sandpaper?

699
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:49,530
I have sensitive skin.

700
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,610
Why does it sting

701
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:52,020
after applying the mask?

702
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,520
That's because your skin's too dry.

703
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:57,470
This product's hydration is strong.

704
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,840
It fills up your skin
with moisture right away.

705
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,400
It's normal for it to sting a little.

706
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,030
Your skin just needs

707
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:05,560
to adjust.

708
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:08,810
That's a load of nonsense.

709
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:11,040
If it stings,

710
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,250
it's not your skin adjusting.

711
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,560
It means the formula's packed

712
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,090
with harsh, irritating ingredients.

713
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:16,110
What ingredients?

714
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:18,970
This product

715
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:21,280
does hydrate well,

716
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,400
but it also

717
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,480
contains aggressive agents.

718
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:26,600
Its principle is

719
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,520
to force your pores open

720
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:29,820
and shove the ingredients

721
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,990
deep into your dermis.

722
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,720
It's unsuitable for sensitive skin.

723
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,360
I'm a certified med school graduate.

724
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:37,810
I stand by everything I just said.

725
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,230
You guys heard that?

726
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,160
A medical expert

727
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,130
just confirmed our product

728
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,580
has incredible hydration.

729
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:47,280
Highly recommended
for non-sensitive skin types.

730
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,210
And it's 20% off

731
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,570
right now!

732
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:50,770
I didn't recommend anything.

733
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:51,730
Let me see the product.

734
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:52,720
Give me one.

735
00:35:53,004 --> 00:35:54,040
Which one's discounted?

736
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:56,780
Hand me that one too.

737
00:35:58,570 --> 00:35:59,730
Miss! Wait!

738
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:02,610
What do you want?

739
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,500
Thanks for the earlier.

740
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:06,330
You just have quick thinking

741
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,660
and selective hearing.

742
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,510
You turned a harmful product

743
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,693
into an "expert-recommended" miracle
in seconds.

744
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:12,850
Respect.

745
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:16,170
I think we'd make a good team.

746
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:17,780
Want to go into business together?

747
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:18,730
What business?

748
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,150
You want me to scam people with you?

749
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,890
These days,
selling online is the real goldmine.

750
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:24,680
What do you say?

751
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,970
If I ever start a public channel,

752
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,570
it's going to be dedicated

753
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,110
to exposing shady beauty influencers.

754
00:36:44,248 --> 00:36:45,040
Sergeant Cheng.

755
00:36:45,782 --> 00:36:48,010
What's up with Captain Zong lately?
He's been out of it.

756
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,330
Newlywed troubles.

757
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,320
Love's taken a toll.

758
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:58,250
Suit up!

759
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:58,890
Assemble!

760
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:00,280
Move it!

761
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:01,620
Don't dawdle!

762
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,230
Reached designated location.

763
00:37:13,004 --> 00:37:13,804
Prepare yourselves.

764
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,380
(Wu Si)

765
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,940
(Wu Si)

766
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:06,471
All that smooth talk
during the confession,

767
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:07,980
then he disappears.

768
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,226
What does that mean, huh?

769
00:38:10,493 --> 00:38:11,515
Was he just playing me?

770
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:20,550
I can contact him

771
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,250
for work reasons, right?

772
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,940
Matchmaking.

773

783
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,850
I told you.

784
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:53,810
He's in training.

785
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,450
He's always training.

786
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,715
I'm starting to forget
what Zong Qing even looks like.

787
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,220
We couldn't go overseas
for our honeymoon.

788
00:40:00,248 --> 00:40:01,940
Now we can't even
have a weekend together.

789
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:03,570
You wanted to go overseas?

790
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,570
That's cute.

791
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:06,050
Where'd you want to go?

792
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:06,970
An.

793
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,250
I heard
there's this popular lotion,

794
00:40:09,315 --> 00:40:11,004
but it hasn't hit the market here yet.

795
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,240
I was planning to review it
while traveling

796
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,090
before I start work.

797
00:40:14,315 --> 00:40:15,800
But that's all gone down the drain.

798
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,540
Review it?

799
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,271
You're using professional lingo now

800
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:21,580
just to buy skincare.

801
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,780
I haven't told you yet.

802
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:26,120
I want to start livestreaming
a skincare segment.

803
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:27,870
Livestreaming?

804
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,880
I want to use my medical knowledge

805
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,880
to educate the public
about proper skincare.

806
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:35,440
No selling.
Just pure educational content.

807
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:38,900
What triggered this?

808
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,660
I ran into a beauty influencer

809
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:43,890
while shopping the other day.

810
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:45,850
She was straight-up lying to consumers

811
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:47,090
in broad daylight.

812
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:47,820
I went home

813
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,620
and binge-watched her streams.

814
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:51,050
I was shocked.

815
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,110
That's when I realized

816
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:54,490
how many skincare scams
there really are.

817
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:57,980
So I decided to fight magic with magic.

818
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,230
I'll use the power of science
to take down those shady influencers.

819

820
