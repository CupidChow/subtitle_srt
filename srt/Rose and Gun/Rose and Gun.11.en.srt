The pharmacy wasn't open.

have put the reservoir

That would cause major damage
to the cities downstream.

To protect the city,

129
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,760
the soldiers must block every stream

130
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,960
that flows into the Shiqiao Dam.

131
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,490
For every stream they block,

132
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,200
the dam becomes a bit safer.

140
00:08:28,582 --> 00:08:30,050
We don't have many sandbags left.

We're running out of time.

142
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,040
We need to block the breach first,

143
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,680
or we can't stack the sandbags.

144
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,280
Exactly.

145
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,090

00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:34,920
I'm a friend of Tang Xin.

190
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,090
My name is Lan Yangyang.

191
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,160
You're friends with Miss Tang?

192
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,920
What do you need?

193
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,560
Here's the thing.

194
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,400
Tang Xin hasn't been in contact

195
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,680
since she went to Mazhan Town.

196
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,010
Her phone's unreachable too.

197
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,090
She's fine.

198
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,915
We've been in touch
with the other reporters.

199
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,130
Mr. Tian, the supplies we're donating

200
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,693
to the disaster zone can head out soon.

201
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,330
- Good. Get them moving.
- Got it.

202
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,680
Alright, I must get going.

203
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,210
Mr. Tian.

204
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,880
I'd like to ask a favor.

205
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,760
If you have a truck going
to Mazhan Town this afternoon,

206
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,760
could I come along?

207
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,460
(United in the fight against floods,
working together to rebuild.)

208
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,160
Hand these out first.
Keep your voice down.

209
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,160
Yangyang?

210
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,730
Time to eat!

211
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,520
Yangyang?

212
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:48,880
This kid...

213
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,090
You had to make me come drag you here?

214
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:55,880
Yangyang?

215
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,970
Where did she go during lunch time?

216
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,700
(Supply Donations

217
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,250
Sir, could you please pull over?

218
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,560
Thank you.

219
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,330
Excuse me, comrade.

220
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,400
Can I ask you something?

221
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,090
Do you know where Zong Qing is?

222
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,490
Zong Qing is over at the tent up ahead.

223
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,610
Alright, thanks.

224
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,400
Thanks a lot, Sir. Bye!

225
00:14:43,493 --> 00:14:44,560
It's nothing, Miss Tang.

226
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,370
You go ahead.

227
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,210
- Okay.
- Bye.

228
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,130
Miss Tang.

229
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,210
Heading out?

230
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,880
We're about to head back.

231
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:54,640
Let's go.

232
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,250
Miss Tang.

233
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,880
We need to talk.

234
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,330
Do you have something to tell me?

235
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,420
Yes.

236
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:07,940
With you.

237
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,220
Sorry.

238
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,804
You two talk, and I'll wait in the car.

239
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:13,980
Goodbye, Captain Wu.

240
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,740
Let's talk here?

241
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,693
How about over there?

242
00:15:25,715 --> 00:15:32,340
(Blue Blade Special Ops Team)

243
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,220
You shouldn't have jumped in back then.

244
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,300
It was too dangerous.

245
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,740
But I was already there.

246
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,248
I couldn't just stand by and watch.

247
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,700
I had to do what I could.

248
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,160
That's what you wanted to tell me?

249
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,820
Not just that.

250
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,700
Then what?

251
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,420
Actually, I wanted to tell you...

252
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,220
The person who saved you
at Dayan Reef...

253
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,300
It was me.

254
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,100
I'm sorry.

255
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,820
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

256
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,740
Can I know

257
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,740
why you kept it from me all this time?

258
00:16:35,893 --> 00:16:37,860
Because protecting civilians
is a soldier's duty.

259
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,740
I didn't want you to feel

260
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,537
grateful or indebted to me for it.

261
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,700
And I didn't want you

262
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,060
to approach me

263
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,820
just because I saved you.

264
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,180
I wanted you to see

265
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,340
the real me in everyday life.

266
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,340
So why are you admitting it now?

267
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,580
Did you think I had just recognized you?

268
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,337
And figured you couldn't
hide it anymore?

269
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,740
Actually, all this time

270
00:17:08,982 --> 00:17:10,740
while we've been
spending time together,

271
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,780
I had a feeling back the person

272
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,540
who saved me was you.

273
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,820
So now that I know,

274
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,410
I'm really not surprised.

275
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,780
I just didn't want you
to care only about the uniform.

276
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,580
I get it.

277
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,820
That's why you kept it from me.

278
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,540
And I understand.

279
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:42,980
Alright.

280
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,060
So today,

281
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,860
I want to formally thank you.

282
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,140
No need for that.

283
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,340
Thank you

284
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,660
for saving my life that day
at Dayan Reef,

285
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,180
and for everything you did afterward.

286
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:08,620
Alright.

287
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,580
Now that we've
cleared the air, that's good.

288
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,100
I have a question for you.

289
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,180
Go ahead.

290
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,580
Back then,

291
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,580
we pretended to be dating

292
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,340
for my father's sake
and for your mission.

293
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,980
So now...

294
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,900
Is there still a reason to keep up
this matchmaking ruse?

295
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,060
Hello, comrade.

296
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,740
Hi there.

297
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,180
I'm looking for someone.

298
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,340
Do you know where Zong Qing is?

299
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,800
You must be Yangyang.

300
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,740
What are you doing here?

301
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,910
You are...

302
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,340
I'm Yi Nanwang.

303
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,300
Yi Nanwang?

304
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,300
Where is Zong Qing?

305
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,469
A few civilians got hurt.

306
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,210
Captain Zong is helping
at the medical tent.

307
00:19:15,226 --> 00:19:16,470
- I'll take you there.
- Okay.

308
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:17,071
This way.

309
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,300
Captain Zong.

310
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,260
Have fun.

311
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,180
What's wrong?

312
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,580
Guess who's here.

313
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,180
I finally found you.

314
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,300
What are you doing here?

315
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:41,980
I missed you.

316
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,300
Let go.

317
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,340
No.

318
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,500
Let go.

319
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,180
No.

320
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:55,850
Lan Yangyang!

321
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,460
Stand still.

322
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,340
What are you doing here?

323
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,300
This place is not safe for you!

324
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,500
I'm on duty here.

325
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,260
Why did you come?

326
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,740
Why are you yelling at me?

327
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,260
Why are you so mad at me?

328
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,260
Do you know how hard it was
for me to get here?

329
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,180
It took a lot to hitch a ride out here.

330
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,340
Listen, go back the same way you came.

331
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,740
Captain Zong,
your wife came all this way.

332
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,537
- Maybe keep her company.
- Just do your job.

333
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,540
Yes, Sir.

334
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,180
Zong Qing.

335
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:28,740
Here.

336
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,540
Captain.

337
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,220
What's the noise about?

338
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,700
Can't you speak nicely?

339
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,460
Yangyang.

340
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,180
You shouldn't be here.

341
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,060
It's dangerous.

342
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,260
Go back for now.

343
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,020
Yi Nanwang.

344
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,700
Yes!

345
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,820
See Yangyang out.

346
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,180
Yes, Sir.

347
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:51,820
Come on, Yangyang.

348
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,740
Yangyang!

349
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,700
Return to your post.

350
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,580
Yes, Sir.

351
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,300
Xin, why are you zoning out?

352
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,740
What's on your mind?

353
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,500
Sorry if this is out of line...

354
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,540
Is it about Captain Wu?

355
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,180
You sure your footage is okay?

356
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,500
Check yours.

357
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,740
Mine is definitely fine.

358
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,060
Stop changing the subject.

359
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,100
Is it about Captain Wu or not?

360
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,180
Yangyang?

361
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,220
Yangyang!

362
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,500
- Xin...
- What are you doing here?

363
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,020
What happened?
Who upset you?

364
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,700
What's wrong?

365
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,940
She came to the disaster site

366
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,660
without telling Captain Zong.

367
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,500
So he gave her a scolding.

368
00:22:27,671 --> 00:22:29,093
Got it. You head back first.

369
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,740
Okay.

370
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,940
I'm off, Hai.

371
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,740
Hey, Yangyang.

372
00:22:32,115 --> 00:22:33,819
Captain Zong is just worried about you.

373
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,960
Don't take it to heart, okay?

374
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,540
I'll head out now. Bye.

375
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,220
Poor little princess.
You must be heartbroken.

376
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,660
These are all typical straight guys.

377
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,020
He doesn't understand women.

378
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,260
But I do admire you.

379
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,740
How'd you even manage
to find your way to Mazhan Town?

380
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,820
I hitched a ride with your supply truck.

381
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,660
Thanks.

382
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,980
Here, have some water.

383
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,540
Listen up.

384
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,500
I know you came all this way,

385
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,660
and you're probably feeling really hurt.

386
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,100
But look around. Where are we?

387
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,020
This is a real disaster relief site,

388
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,100
not some romantic drama where you
chase your man across the country.

389
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,260
Besides, you're married now.

390
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,780
You have your own family.

391
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,180
You're not alone anymore.

392
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,460
Think from Zong Qing's perspective too.

393
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,260
You think he doesn't miss you every day?

394
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,460
But he's a soldier.

395
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,700
He has a duty to fulfill.

396
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,460
Hai, bring over the footage.

397
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,300
Take a look.

398
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,660
This is the footage we shot
over the last couple of days.

399
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,020
These are all frontline soldiers
fighting to save lives.

400
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,260
What we captured here

401
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,740
might not show Zong Qing,

402
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,700
and maybe not Wu Si either.

403
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,100
But all of them...

404
00:24:07,893 --> 00:24:10,020
are definitely out there
in more dangerous places.

405
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,020
Come on in, Mom. Take a look.

406
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,460
This is my new home in Wenzhou.

407
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,740
What do you think?

408
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,580
It's got a sea view, right by the ocean.

409
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,700
Not impressed.

410
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,090
If I hadn't kept calling and asking,

411
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,550
I wouldn't even know

412
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,671
that you moved both
your job and your home to Wenzhou.

413
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,100
I just wanted to wait

414
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,460
until everything was settled here

415
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,020
before giving you an update.

416
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,060
I didn't want you to worry.

417
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,060
Sit.

418
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,580
Sounds to me like you were dead set

419
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,260
on hiding it from me.

420
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,740
My son's not reliable,

421
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,180
and neither is my daughter-in-law.

422
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,740
She dragged you over here,
and where is she now?

423
00:24:51,848 --> 00:24:53,100
Off running around on her own?

424
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,460
Mom, you can't say that.

425
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,700
We're a married couple
trying to live together.

426
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,820
That's not wrong, is it?

427
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,220
No, it's not.

428
00:25:00,404 --> 00:25:02,740
There's nothing wrong
with living together as a couple.

429
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,330
But why is it you're coming to her,

430
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,300
instead of her coming to you?

431
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,500
She has her career.

432
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,920
And you don't?

433
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,720
Tell me the truth, Zijian.

434
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,590
Was it her idea?

435
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,560
Did she push you to transfer to Wenzhou?

436
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,700
I'll be honest with you.

437
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,020
Transferring to Wenzhou

438
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,740
was my own decision.

439
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,540
I don't believe it.

440
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,660
Seems like you don't even
want your mother anymore.

441
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,660
Come on, don't say that.

442
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,780
No matter where I go,

443
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,260
I'll never leave you behind, Mom.

444
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,460
Don't try to fool me.

445
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,700
I'm not fooling you.

446
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,660
I came to Wenzhou this time

447
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,660
mainly because

448
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,460
I want to have a child
with Wang Chen soon.

449
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,540
Are you saying

450
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,980
that you moved to Wenzhou

451
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,020
so you two could try for a baby?

452
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,660
It's already been decided?

453
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,740
It's been decided.

454
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,500
That's more like it.

455
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,780
You're not getting any younger.
It's about time.

456
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,980
Wang Chen's health

457
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,100
is good,

458
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,780
but she needs to take care of herself.

459
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,660
She definitely will.

460
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,780
Are you happy now?

461
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,500
Not mad that I transferred my job here?

462
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,300
After what you just said,
if I were still angry,

463
00:26:17,382 --> 00:26:19,340
I'd look like someone
completely unreasonable.

464
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,700
My mom is the most
reasonable person I know.

465
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,020
But about this matter,

466
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,315
you two had better get a move on.

467
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,940
Don't fool me again.

468
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,420
I won't. I promise.

469
00:26:31,471 --> 00:26:32,740
I'm going to take a look around.

470
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,540
Go ahead, check the place out.

471
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,060
This here is the kitchen.

472
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,660
There are two rooms inside.

473
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,660
Let's start with the kitchen.

474
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,580
Did you find anything in that email?

475
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,420
No.

476
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,500
It's not easy to trace.

477
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:52,580
Maybe I can find
a professional to look into it?

478
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,020
No need for now.

479
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,060
Alright, I'll try something else.

480
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,260
You don't need to
worry about it for now.

481
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,820
Yangyang, Mom's coming in.

482
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,700
Still mad?

483
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,580
Aren't you hungry?

484
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,460
Alright.

485
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,820
You were clearly in the wrong.

486
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,100
Zong Qing's not wrong for saying that.

487
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,740
Now you're taking his side too?

488
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,700
Zong Qing says I'm wrong,
so does Xinxin.

489
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,260
Everyone's blaming me.

490
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,582
How many times have I told you?

491
00:27:45,626 --> 00:27:47,100
I didn't go there for fun.

492
00:27:47,471 --> 00:27:49,300
We all know you were
worried about Zong Qing.

493
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,740
It wasn't some joy trip.

494
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,660
But shouldn't you consider

495
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,020
the timing and the place?

496
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,540
That was a typhoon disaster zone.
It was dangerous.

497
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,940
You showed up out of the blue.

498
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,540
Of course he'd be worried.

499
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,540
Do you expect him to take care of you
or focus on his work?

500
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,660
I get all that.

501
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,500
But did he have to scold me
in front of everyone?

502
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,940
That was embarrassing.

503
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,260
You were wrong to begin with.

504
00:28:13,493 --> 00:28:15,671
And now you're worried
about saving face?

505
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,940
Besides, you two just got married.

506
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,700
It takes time to adjust.

507
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,100
When Zong Qing comes back,

508
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,940
I'm going to make him do 500 push-ups.

509
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,471
Let's see if he'll yell at me again.

510
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,100
Fine. Make it a thousand. Wear him out.

511
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,700
Captain.

512
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,900
Third unit is assembled.

513
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,540
All 20 accounted for, 20 present.

514
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,220
Awaiting orders.

515
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,340
Yes, Sir.

516
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,660
- One, two, three, four.
- Captain.

517
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,780
Second unit is assembled.

518
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,300
All 20 accounted for, 20 present.

519
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,060
Awaiting orders.

520
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,260
Stand at attention.

521
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,420
Everyone, align to the right.

522
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,980
Look forward.

523
00:28:47,182 --> 00:28:49,020
This mission has been
successfully completed.

524
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,260
Good work, everyone.

525
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,540
Rest well.

526
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,900
All units, fall out.

527
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,460
First unit, right rear turn.

528
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,740
Third unit, left rear turn.

529
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,740
- March.
- March.

530
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,740
One, two, one.

531
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,060
(United through the storm,
battling the flood together.)

532
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,580
(Have no fear to protect the people.)

533
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:18,900
Here they come!

534
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:19,780
They're here!

535
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,580
Thank you, soldiers!

536
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,740
Thank you, soldier!

537
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,900
Thank you, soldier!

538
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,940
Thank you, soldier!

539
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,740
Thank you, soldiers!

540
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,100
Thank you, soldier!

541
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,980
Thank you.

542
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,540
Thank you. We're so grateful to you all.

543
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,260
Thank you so much.

544
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,300
Thank you.

545
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,180
- Thank you for everything, comrades.
- Amazing work out there!

546
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,940
Thank you for your service.

547
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,260
- Thanks.
- Goodbye, comrades!

548
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,300
Thank you, soldier!

549
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,100
Goodbye.

550
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,420
Goodbye!

551
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,260
- Soldier!
- Goodbye!

552
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,940
- Bye!
- Thank you all!

553
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:05,300
- Goodbye, soldiers!
- Goodbye, soldiers!

554
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,660
It's alright.

555
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,260
Take care, all of you.

556
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,820
- Thank you.
- It's okay, really.

557
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,220
Just a small token of thanks.

558
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,740
Thank you so much.

559
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,737
Great work out there!

560
00:30:14,782 --> 00:30:16,500
Thank you, comrades.

563
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:59,740
One, two, three, four.

564
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,740
March in place.

565
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,660
Halt.

566
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,460
Align front.

567
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,740
March in place.

572
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:11,740
At ease.

573
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,500
Yes, Sir.

574
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,340
At ease.

At ease.

580
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,420
Yes, Sir.

581
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,780
At ease.

582

Good work, everyone.

This mission

595
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,660
was a job well done.

596
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,780
No need for a long debrief.

597
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,220
I'll keep it short.

598
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,780
Get back and get some sleep.

599
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,220
Mom, I'm home.

600
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,260
Daddy is coming!

601
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,500
Go, go to him.

602
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,740
Daddy!

603
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,420
Finally got to see Daddy, huh?

604
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,180
Come on, quick.

605
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,660
Get down. Don't tire him out.

606
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,420
Okay.

607
00:33:57,915 --> 00:34:00,260
Look at you, all scruffy and unshaven.

608
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,700
I'm finally home.

609
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,740
Come on in.

610
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,180
Let's go.

612
00:34:07,515 --> 00:34:08,580
Are you behaving well?

613
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,300
Yes.

614
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,140
Mom, did you sleep well last night?

615
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,982
How are you adjusting
to the climate here?

616
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,860
It's alright.

617
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,140
You came all the way to Wenzhou
and I didn't even get to pick you up.

618
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,860
No need for that.

619
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,500
You weren't around when I arrived.

620
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,300
Right, we were in
the disaster zone at the time.

00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:40,940
Chen.

622
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,420
Mom saw your unit on TV, you know.

623
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,140
Really?

624
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,460
Mom, did you see Wang Chen?

625
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,220
Her? I didn't catch her on screen.

626
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,360
I saw the soldiers though.

627
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,300
They had it so rough.

628
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,620
Sleeping in the mud
with their clothes still on.

629
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,420
The water was rising too fast.

630
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,900
We had to be ready at any moment
to respond to emergencies.

631
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,100
There was no other way.

632
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,500
Alright.

633
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,820
You're back now,
so no need to talk about that stuff.

634
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,380
Let's get down to business.

635
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,940
You two,

636
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,300
put having a baby

637
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,140
on the agenda.

638
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,820
While I'm still healthy,

639
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,820
I can help raise your kid
for a few years.

640
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,100
Don't you agree?

641
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,420
Alright, don't worry, Mom.

642
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,900
I'm done eating.

643
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,780
You two take your time.

644
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:30,100
Wang Chen, eat more, alright?

645
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,500
Take care of your body.

646
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,500
Mom, take it slow.

647
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,620
You told Mom we're having a kid?

648
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,020
Bai Zijian.

649
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,140
You know very well

650
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,900
the doctor clearly told us

651
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,440
we can't have children.

652
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,620
But the doctor didn't say
it was a hundred percent impossible.

653
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,500
Bai Zijian,

654
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,420
you can't lie to her like this.

655
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,900
Just think of it as
making an old lady happy.

656
00:36:06,115 --> 00:36:07,540
Let's put on a little show for Mom.

657
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,620
Here.

658
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,420
Have a drumstick.

659
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,500
Don't overthink it.

660
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:34,060
(Under the Party's Command,
Winning With Excellent Conduct)

661
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,060
Lost contact again, Sergeant Cheng?

662
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,340
Back at Mazhan Town,

663
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,860
did you even get through to her?

664
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:43,940
No, I didn't.

665
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,780
I called, but she didn't pick up.

666
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,860
Then she called back, but I missed it.

667
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,060
A military couple, huh?

668
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:54,980
So brutal.

669
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,500
You got time to sit around?

670
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,340
Come on, five kilometers.

671
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,380
Come on, seriously?

672
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,260
Move it.

673
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,780
No, I just finished training.

674
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,160
How about three kilometers?

675
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,048
Move it. Come on.

676
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,220
Tell me something.

677
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,740
Did you learn anything

678
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,220
working with Wu Si?

679
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,260
So, Dad...

680
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,380
I'm not seeing Wu Si anymore.

681
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,860
You and Mr. Wang
can stop trying to set us up.

682
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:36,740
Wait, what?

683
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,460
Why not?

684
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,860
Did Wu Si do something?

685
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,100
No, not at all.

686
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,460
We're just not a good match, that's all.

687
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:48,060
Better to split early
than waste each other's time.

688
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,740
Still, there has to be a reason.

689
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,780
Exactly.

690
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,100
Hey, I'm asking you a question.

691
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,460
You just...

692
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,260
I already told you.
You just weren't listening.

693
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,260
I said I didn't want

694
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,220
to date a soldier.

695
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,937
But you insisted on
introducing me to one.

696
00:38:01,937 --> 00:38:03,940
I asked for an apple
and you gave me an orange.

697
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,460
Were you even listening to me?

698
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,100
Wu Si didn't do anything wrong.

699
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,220
I admit, he's great.

700
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,200
But for me,

701
00:38:12,671 --> 00:38:13,980
there's just no future there.

702
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,460
I'll ask Wu Si.

703
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,260
It won't matter if you do.

704
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,380
He doesn't know.

705
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,940
It's not about him. It's all me.

706
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,260
Give me your hand.

707
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,060
Come on, give it here.

708
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,020
Honey.

709
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,380
Honey, look. It's so beautiful!

710
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,100
Come on, get up. Time to wake up.

711
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:31,260
I didn't get a full night's sleep
the whole time we were in Mazhan Town.

712
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,980
Let me sleep a bit more.

713
00:39:35,671 --> 00:39:38,648
It's the first day of our honeymoon
and you're sleeping through it?

714
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,020
Come on, get up and spend time with me.

715
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,740
Alright, I'm up.

716
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,420
(Zookeeper)

717
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,580
Hello, Mom?

718
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,100
Yangyang.

719
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,460
Are you up yet?

720
00:40:08,471 --> 00:40:10,560
I've been up for a while.
Zong Qing's still sleeping.

721
00:40:10,626 --> 00:40:11,737
I can't wake him up.

722
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,300
He just got back. He's exhausted.

723
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,515
Let him sleep a little longer.

724
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,140
Have you eaten?

725
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,020
Not yet. I was planning
to order some takeout.

726
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,420
Don't always rely on takeout.

727
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,220
You should learn
to cook something yourself.

728
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,420
Takeout isn't good.

729
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,900
Cook my own meals?

730
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,700
But I don't know how.
I don't think Zong Qing does either.

731
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,140
Lan Yangyang, you're married now.

732
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,140
You need to learn

733
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,020
how to be a good housewife.

734
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,940
Cooking's not that hard.

735
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,940
You just need to learn.

736
00:40:36,693 --> 00:40:38,115
Stop ordering takeout all the time.

737
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,540
Yangyang?

738
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,140
Yangyang?

739
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,220
Babe, what happened?

740
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,820
Honey?

741
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,540
What happened?

742
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,540
Did you burn yourself?

743
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,700
