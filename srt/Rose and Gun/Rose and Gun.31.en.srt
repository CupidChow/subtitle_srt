I just got here a few days ago.

44
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,870
I heard Wu Si was coming back,

00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,260

00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,180
Yes, I have.

56
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,260
I was right there the day

57
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,700
you two were on the phone.

58
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,420
Tang Xin, can I ask you something?

59
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,740
What exactly

60
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,060
happened between you two?

61
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,740
Auntie, actually,

62
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,260
before Wu Si left,

63
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,620
he proposed to me.

64
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,180
At the time,

65
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,260
I wanted to wait
until he got back safely

66
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,500
before I said yes.

67
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,500
But I didn't expect

68
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,620
things would be so different

69
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,300
after he came back.

70
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,620
The proposal doesn't count anymore.

71
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,060
He keeps avoiding me.

72
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,730
I honestly don't know why.

73
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,060
Tang Xin.

74
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,580
Wu Si's father

75
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,060
died when Wu Si was still very young.

76
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,620
Wu Si told me about him once.

77
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,740
His dad used to be in the Navy.

78
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,380
Then, he switched careers
and became a police officer.

79
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,860
He specialized in cracking down
on maritime smuggling.

80
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,420
Because of work,

81
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,560
he went undercover
under a false name for ten months.

82
00:06:42,626 --> 00:06:44,940
I waited all that time for him
to come back

83
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,860
so we could be a family again

84
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,060
and finally live a normal life.

85
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,860
But then one day...

86
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,700
Hello?

87
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,180
Hello? Son?

88
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,140
Dad!

89
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,140
Mom, come quick! It's Dad!

90
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:01,700
I'm coming!

91
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,060
Dad, when are you coming home?

92
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,820
Do you want a game console or something?

93
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,620
No, I don't want a game console.

94
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,500
I just want Dad to come home.

95
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,420
Dad, when are you coming back?

96
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,740
Here, let me talk.

97
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,060
Hello?

98
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,820
Tongshu?

99
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,380
I got the day off today.

100
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,850
Which store were you thinking of?

101
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,260
I'll take our son.

102
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,020
I compared prices
at a bunch of places last time.

103
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,180
That shop near Liubu was selling it
for 273 yuan.

104
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,260
The one in Luzhuang was 238 yuan.

105
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,020
None of them would bargain.

106
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,500
Even after talking it over,

107
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,820
they only knocked off five yuan.

108
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,820
(Hospital memo)

109
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,860
You have to buy the battery-powered
game card separately.

110
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,260
And if you end up with a fake one,

111
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,982
the battery drains super fast.

112
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,380
You'll need a new battery
every seventeen or eighteen hours.

113
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,420
There are so many types

114
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,260
of game consoles now.

115
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,820
Which one are you looking for?

116
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,380
That photo Liu
gave me has its picture.

117
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,060
There are tons of stores.
It's hard to find.

118
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,500
I even started off
walking the wrong way.

119
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,180
You should ask someone.

120
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,260
Okay.

121
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,500
I got it.

122
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,140
Honey.

123
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,620
I had a dream about you and our son.

124
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,620
I really wish I could come home.

125
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,060
I just want to see you both again.

126
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,804
Can you put our son on the phone?

127
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,020
Sure.

128
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,380
Hey, sweetheart.

129
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,340
The sun is shining so brightly today.

130
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,140
I'm going to take a little nap.

131
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,860
Say goodnight

132
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,650
to Daddy.

133
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,380
Goodnight, Dad. Goodnight. Goodnight.

134
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,500
Tongshu...

135
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,620
Tongshu!

136
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,380
Before he went undercover,

137
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,140
we made a deal
to use "game console" as a code word.

138
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,260
If he ever called

139
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,620
and said he was buying one for our son,

140
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,100
that would mean his cover was blown.

141
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,340
That was the last call he ever made.

142
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,900
He slipped in a message

143
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,260
with the coordinates for Liubu Reef
and Luzhuang Reef.

144
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:32,540
He was off by just a few degrees.

145
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,780
The smugglers' boat was
moving at 17 or 18 knots.

146
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,500
I told Liu right away that the coast
guard had gone the wrong way.

147
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,340
I called the police immediately,

148
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,020
but by the time they got there,
it was already too late.

149
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,260
Tang Xin...

150
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,860
The reason I came to talk to you today

151
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,220
is because of all this.

152
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,100
The way Wu Si changed after the drill...

153
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,980
might be connected

154
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,140
to everything our family has
gone through over the years.

155
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,340
During this exercise,

156
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,500
he probably went through

157
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,020
some danger or loss
we'll never know about.

158
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,260
That could be why he changed.

159
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,740
I think

160
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,780
maybe he's scared.

161
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,460
He's afraid that one day,

162
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,340
he might not come home,
just like his father.

163
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,740
He's also afraid

164
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,080
that your future

165
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,540
might end up like mine.

166
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,100
Brigadier.

167
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,020
It's me.

168
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,937
The Armed Police called.

169
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,780
It's about Zong Qing?

170
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,260
Put it through now.

171
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:40,780
Yes, Sir.

172
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,020
The reason I brought all this up today

173
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,340
is just to remind you

174
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,740
that before you decide

175
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,260
to marry a soldier,

176
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,740
you really should

177
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,540
think everything through carefully.

178
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,260
Auntie,

179
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,780
allow me to ask a serious question.

180
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,260
If I want to marry Wu Si,

181
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,380
would you approve?

182
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,380
As a soldier's wife?

183
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,980
No, I wouldn't.

184
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,460
Because if someone objects,

185
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,260
it'll push you both
to think it over more seriously.

186
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,260
But as Wu Si's mother...

187
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,340

my test results aren't back yet.

199

No need to wait for them.

200
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,780
You're fine.

201
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,740
Really?

202
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,020
How can that be?

203
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,380

double-checked everything.

206
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,380
Understood. I'll get ready to head back.

207
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,740
That's a relief.

208
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,020
I was terrified.

209
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,380
Lan Yangyang,

210
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,380
that was not how you sounded.

211
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,740
I really thought
you weren't scared at all.

212
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,780
Of course I was scared.

213
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,660
I just didn't want you
to get more nervous.

214
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,660
You were already so worried.

215
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,260
If I panicked too,
you'd be even worse off.

216

Alright.

217

But...

222
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,020
I've given it some serious thought.

223
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,500
I want to be better prepared

224
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:31,980
this time.

225
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,620
I don't want to be
all over the place like last time.

226
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,980
I want to grow up first,
and stand on my own two feet.

227
00:13:41,182 --> 00:13:42,740

to win back the Tai'e Sword.

371
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,740
Sign your name in the guest book.

372
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,060
Yes, Sir.

373
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,260
Sir, Wang Chen reporting for duty.

374
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,500
Fall in.

375
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,300
Yes, Sir.

376
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,340
(Entry: "If there's war, I'll return."
Signed, Cheng Yuan)

377
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,500
Captain Chen.

378
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,300
I understand.

379
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,100
Come back and visit us.

380
00:25:30,137 --> 00:25:31,260
We'll all be waiting for you.

381
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:33,820
I will.

382
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,700
Didn't we agree not to cry?

383
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,420
Stop crying.

384
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,500
Alright, it's okay.

385
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,740
You're now the youngest
sharpshooter here.

386
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,500
From now on,

387
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,260
don't just aim to be Blue Blade's best.

388
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,100
Be the best in the entire Navy.

389
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:18,780
Got it?

390
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,180
Keep in touch.

391
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,700
Yeah, keep in touch.

392
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,493
Visit us sometimes.

393
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,500
I will.

394
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,060
Captain Zong.

395
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,460
You're the only marksman we've got now.

396
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,780
Train that kid well.

397
00:27:03,671 --> 00:27:05,020
You don't need to remind me.

398
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,900
Cheng Yuan.

399
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,460
Lieutenant, Blue Blade Special Ops Team.

400
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,300
Eight years of service.

401
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,340
You are hereby approved

402
00:27:47,426 --> 00:27:48,915
to retire from active duty

403
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,700
as of today.

404
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,740
Yes, Sir.

405
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,380
(Tai'e Sword, one of the Ten
Legendary Swords of Ancient China)

406
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,810
(Forged in the Eastern Zhou Dynasty
by Ou Yezi of Yue and Gan Jiang of Wu.)

407
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:11,059
(First to win the Tai'e Sword
in an international sniper competition:)

408
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:12,180
(Cheng Yuan, PLA Navy Unit 91358)

409
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,500
Stand tall, everyone.

410
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,900
What's with the long faces?

411
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,180
Have you forgotten who you are?

412
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,560
- Blue Blade Special Ops Team!
- Blue Blade Special Ops Team!

413
00:28:24,604 --> 00:28:25,309
I can't hear you!

414
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,550
- Blue Blade Special Ops Team!
- Blue Blade Special Ops Team!

415
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,220
Wu Si.

416
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:28,940
Yes!

417
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,500
Call the roll. Snap them out of it.

418
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,260
Yes, Sir.

419
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,100
Zhou Yixuan.

420
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:38,940
Yes!

421
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,420
Xu Jianhua.

422
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:40,980
Yes!

423
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,500
Bai Keming.

424
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,260
Yes!

425
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,180
Zong Qing.

426
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:44,740
Yes!

427
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,580
Wang Chen.

428
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,220
Yes!

429
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,180
Cheng Yuan.

430
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,980
Yes!

431
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,540
Cheng Yuan.

432
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,900
- Yes!
- Yes!

433
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,280
Slow down. You could choke.

434
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,180
Are you too busy to have your meals?

435
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,020
I'm in a rush to switch shifts.

436
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:14,740
I can't slow down.

437
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,020
Even if you're rushing, you should eat.

438
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,260
How about I cook for you tomorrow

439
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,300
and bring it over?

440
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,020
No, please.

441
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,540
That would look bad.

442
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,260
What's bad about it?

443
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,340
You're not in an army.

444
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,020
What is it about?

445
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,500
Dad, Mom wants to give me
special treatment.

446
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,540
Talk some sense into her.

447
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,940
That's not okay.

448
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,700
Special meals are favoritism.

449
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,500
Seriously?

450
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,020
I can't stand you two.

451
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,540
You're both model employees.

452
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,260
Just eat already.

453
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,060
Zong Qing's heading off
for training for a few days.

454
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,180
Have you two talked?

455
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,300
Yeah, he told me.

456
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,740
I don't ask much about what he's doing.

457
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,020
I just stay home
and wait for him to come back.

458
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,260
I'm done, Mom.

459
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,300
I'm heading to work.

460
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,700
There is one bite left! Finish it.

461
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,420
No thanks.

462
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,226
Dad, I'm off.

463
00:30:06,226 --> 00:30:07,780
Even if you're busy, you should eat up.

464
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,540
Your health...

465
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,540
It's my capital for life.

466
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,740
Thanks for the pep talk.

467
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:13,940
Mr. Han.

468
00:30:14,248 --> 00:30:15,460
I've been following up closely

469
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,740
regarding the investigation.

470
00:30:17,137 --> 00:30:19,426
Your dad and brother are
still in the Roman Islands.

471
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,070
Besides the Aston Hotel,
they're mainly active

472
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,500
around the Atocha Company.

473
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,020
Mr. Lin.

474
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,500
Did you find anything else

475
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,590
that is suspicious?

476
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,980
There's a foreigner
who meets him at the hotel a lot.

477
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,780
His name is William.

478
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,060
I had a friend help me look into him.

479
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,580
Turns out he runs a smuggling ring.

480
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,300
He's on Interpol's wanted list.

481
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,500
Seriously, Zong Qing?

482
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,260
This is the dinner
you're treating me to?

483
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,420
Fine, just spill it.

484
00:30:57,426 --> 00:30:58,893
I know you have something to say.

485
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,060
You know me too well.

486
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,540
Captain is not joining

487
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,404
this round of training.
He's still recovering.

488
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,500
That's his business.
You don't need to tell me.

489
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,540
Xin...

490
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,540
Just give him one more chance.

491
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,340
It's not that I won't give him a chance.

492
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,020
He is choosing to give up on me.

493
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,780
And here I am,

494
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,300
still daydreaming
about a future with him.

495
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,340
But I was never even part of his plans.

496
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,300
What's this?

497
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,740
He wrote it.

498
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,260
For you.

499
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,500
(To Tang Xi.
If you're reading this, I'm with you.)

500
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,580
(If you got this letter,)

501
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,780
(you've probably
also gotten some bad news.)

502
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,300
(I'm sorry I left
without saying goodbye.)

503
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:19,740
(Life wasn't long,
but I gave it my all.)

504
00:32:20,693 --> 00:32:22,260
(I don't regret joining the military.)

505
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,980
(I don't regret meeting you either.)

506
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,220
(I fought the battles I had to.)

507
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,180
(I kept the right values.)

508
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,740
(I've loved with all I had.)

509
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,420
(The ending doesn't really matter.)

510
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,020
(Whenever you miss me,)

511
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,100
(I'll come back to see you.)

512
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,020
(My pure and loyal love for you)

513
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,500
(will never end. Salute.)

514
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,180
What's this?

515
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,300
It's a military tradition.

516
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,100
When we get assigned to

517
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,020
special missions,

518
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,740
we write letters of intent.

519
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,780
Then,

520
00:33:04,137 --> 00:33:06,100
they're usually addressed
to immediate family.

521
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,500
If we make it back,

522
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,180
the letter just gets returned to us.

523
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,740
But if we don't...

524
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,300
It gets delivered

525
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,740
with the notice of death.

526
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,060
Xin.

527
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,060
The letters Captain wrote
to his mom...

528
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,260
barely changed over the years.

529
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,740
But ever since you two got together,

530
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,700
he's wanted to add you to the letter.

531
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,740
Honestly,

532
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:35,780
he was ready

533
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,540
to say goodbye to you the hard way.

534
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,740
He told us

535
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,820
that if anything ever happened to him,

536
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,020
we should give you
the most recent letter.

537
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,780
(Wu Si)

538
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,780
How many letters has he written?

539
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,340
Scroll through and see.

540
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,860
(To Tang Xi.
If you're reading this, I'm with you.)

541
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,100
Xin.

542
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,580
To be honest, every time

543
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,900
he had to leave you,

544
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,060
he acted like it was the last goodbye.

545
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,540
Like he still had more to say.

546
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,340
That is why the letters

547
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,540
just kept getting longer,

548
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,060
like each one was the last one

549
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,820
he'd ever write.

550
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,060
We used to tease him all the time.

551
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,140
"Captain, it's not the end of the world.

552
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,820
What's with all the dramatic letters?"

553
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,020
But you know...

554
00:34:27,782 --> 00:34:29,448
You'll get it once you read it.

555
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,259
(If my sacrifice
can buy you peace, it's worth it.)

556
00:34:32,259 --> 00:34:33,860
(To Tang Xin.
This letter isn't a goodbye.)

557
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,300
Go ahead and read it.

558
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,380
All of these

559
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,340
are the future he didn't get to live.

560
00:34:45,226 --> 00:34:46,700
The ones he imagined with you.

561
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,140
Xin.

562
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,020
There's one thing
I should correct you on.

563
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,220
To Captain,

564
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,540
you've already been part of his future.

565
00:35:03,493 --> 00:35:05,020
It's not that he didn't trust you.

566
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,780
He just didn't trust himself.

567
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,340
This might sound kind of dramatic,

568
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,380
but for people in our line of work...

569
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,820
Finding a sense of safety
in the person you love

570
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,540
means everything.

571
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,980
Dating someone like you guys

572
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,340
doesn't even feel like dating.

573
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,780
It's like being tested to the core.

574
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,100
And marrying someone like you guys

575
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,300
is basically a survival challenge.

576
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,620
If it's a challenge,

577
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,937
then why not go all in, right?

578
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,020
Your relationship with Captain

579
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,140
is not too late to be fixed.

580
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:13,780
Honey.

581
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,620
Make sure you eat well while I'm gone.

582
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,060
I made your favorite dumplings.

583
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,060
They're in the freezer.

584
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,271
Boil them when you're hungry.

585
00:36:19,293 --> 00:36:20,020
Honey.

586
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,580
When you get back this time,

587
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,580
let's move somewhere new.

588
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,220
I don't want to stay here anymore.

589
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,820
Why?

590
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,500
Didn't you decorate this place yourself?

591
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,820
Why don't you want to stay?

592
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,420
This place is full of
memories of us being apart.

593
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,060
We barely

594
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,100
had any time together here.

595
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,340
You were always leaving
or reporting back in.

596
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,020
At first, I was the one
always home alone.

597
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,060
Now I'm working,

598
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,020
and you're the one here by yourself.

599
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,820
I don't like it here anymore.

600
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,620
Honey.

601
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,060
Don't get stuck on the sad stuff.

602
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,060
Think about all the good times we had.

603
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:08,780
Right?

604
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,820
You remember?

605
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,500
We played games together,

606
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,500
cooked meals together,

607
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,780
and you even blew up the pot once!

608
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,540
We cuddled up to sleep.

609
00:37:16,604 --> 00:37:17,620
Those were good times.

610
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,540
But you're leaving again.

611
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,220
I don't want to be here alone.

612
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,420
This place just feels empty.

613
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,620
If that's how you feel,

614
00:37:27,671 --> 00:37:29,500
you could stay
with Mom and Dad for a while.

615
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,700
I promise I'll be back real soon.

616
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:32,700
Once I'm back,

617
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,340
we can move wherever you want.

618
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,060
I'll help you set the place up, okay?

619
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,100
Stay safe.

620
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,100
Got it.

621
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,020
I've taken the members away,

622
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,315
so think about your future.

623
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,660
What future?

624
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,820
Don't play dumb with me.

625
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,020
Yangyang told me everything.

626
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,700
We're all waiting for you to marry Xin.

627
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,715
You'd better step up.

628
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,620
Get lost.

629
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,020
I'm off.

630
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:17,900
All missions

631
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,004
must be carried out
with safety as the top priority.

632
00:38:20,026 --> 00:38:20,780
Got that?

633
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:21,820
Yes.

634
00:38:21,982 --> 00:38:23,300
You don't have to see me off.

635
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,620
Go for it. I believe in you.

636
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,300
Hurry up.

637
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,900
I'll keep this for him.

638
00:38:36,004 --> 00:38:37,980
If you train hard,
you'll earn your snacks.

639
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:38,900
Yes!

640
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,300
(Tang Xin: Didn't you want to break up?)

641
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,980
(Let's meet and talk it through.
Then I'll agree.)

642
00:38:44,982 --> 00:38:45,671
Get on the truck.

643
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,980
I'm off then, Captain Chen.

644
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:48,900
Bye.

645
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,500
Go on.

646
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,180
Ke'er.

647
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,340
Cheng Yuan, you're here.

648
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,540
Why'd you ask me to meet here?

649
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:14,860
Where is this anyway?

650
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,020
It's a park.

651
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,220
You finally caught a break from work,

652
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,340
and I've been discharged too.

653
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,100
We finally have time together at last.

654
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,580
Yeah, that doesn't happen often.

655
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,380
So where do you want to go today?

656
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,460
I'll go with you.

657
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,620
I've served in this city for two years.

658
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,220
You could say I know it well,

659
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,780
but it still feels unfamiliar somehow.

660
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,900
We've never had time

661
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,980
to just walk around
and explore together.

662
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,020
Before I leave,

663
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,180
I want us to say goodbye
to Wenzhou together.

664
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,580
And how do we do that?

665
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,700

666
