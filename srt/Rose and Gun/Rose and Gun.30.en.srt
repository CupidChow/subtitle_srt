18
00:01:59,420 --> 00:01:59,980
Honey.

19
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,260
You don't look very energetic today.

20
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:04,900
I'm fine.

21
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,980
Are you feeling sick?

22
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,460
No.

23
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,500
Then, what's going on with you?

24
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:17,740
Let me see your hand.

25
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,740
It's nothing.

26
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,500
- It's not...
- Honey, wait.

27
00:02:25,382 --> 00:02:26,782
Sit down. I'll explain.

28
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,500
I need to come clean.

29
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,260
During this last mission,

30
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,940
I got a small cut.

31
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,260
After that,

32
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,340
I found out the other person
might have HIV.

33
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,020
Did you get tested?

34
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,260
Yeah, I did.

35
00:02:56,715 --> 00:02:58,020
I'm waiting for the results now.

36
00:02:59,315 --> 00:03:00,750
Did you report it to the unit?

37
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,582
Yes, I already did.

38
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,820
They arranged for me to do a local test.

39
00:03:03,871 --> 00:03:06,050
The brigadier and commissar
approved my rest at home.

40
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,900
Because of that,

41
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,220
I think we should

42
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,260
keep some space for now.

43
00:03:12,204 --> 00:03:14,460
Tonight you sleep in the bed,
and I'll take the couch.

44
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:15,860
Only for tonight.

45
00:03:15,982 --> 00:03:17,293
Tomorrow, I'll stay at a hotel.

46
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,260
Did you forget I studied medicine?

47
00:03:32,804 --> 00:03:34,115
Let me explain a few things.

48
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,900
HIV...

49
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,715
You don't need to.
I already looked it up.

50
00:03:37,937 --> 00:03:39,540
If you know, why are you avoiding me?

51
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,020
Right now, it's only a possibility.

52
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,260
Even if you caught it,

53
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,820
I'll go through it with you.

54
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,100
I'm not going anywhere.

55
00:03:55,426 --> 00:03:56,804
You're not allowed to push me away.

56
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,060
Mr. Han.

57
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,220
(Document Envelope)

58
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,420
I've nearly finished the investigation.

59
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,740
Nothing unusual.

60
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,100
However,

61
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,460
one thing really stood out.

62
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:24,740
What is it?

63
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,600
The group's largest
deep-sea fishing vessel,

64
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,300
the Bo'xing,

65
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,780
was transferred to Atocha Company

66
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,980
right before you took control.

67
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,180
Atocha Company?

68
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,500
The one based in Roman?

69
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,260
Yeah.

70
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,140
Dad,

71
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,180
the Bo'xing has arrived
at the shipwreck site.

72
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,550
They're planning to dive in
as soon as possible.

73
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,340
Good.

74
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:08,700
Hello?

75
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:10,500
Dad,

76
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,220
I need to ask you something.

77
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,220
There was a deep-sea fishing vessel
in the company.

78
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,380
The Bo'xing.

79
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,020
Why was it transferred to Atocha Company

80
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,900
before I took over the company?

81
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,420
What's wrong with that?

82
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,060
Your brother and I pulled out midway.

83
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,700
We had to give the partner
some form of explanation.

84
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,900
He asked for that fishing vessel
as compensation.

85
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,020
Then, why are you both still in Roman?

86
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,500
Your brother and I
are handling that situation right now.

87
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,910
Once it's all settled,

88
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,140
we'll head back to Hong Kong.

89
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:51,980
Dad,

90
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:55,420
he already has the whole group.
What more does he want?

91
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,300
Your brother is still wavering.

92
00:06:01,315 --> 00:06:03,860
He doesn't know whether we're still
in this business or not.

93
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,220
He's just looking out for us.

94
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:18,248
You're back.

95
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,420
Mr. Han, did you come here
just to see me?

96
00:06:27,048 --> 00:06:27,980
There are a few things

97
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,660
I need some answers.

98
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,180
You've always known

99
00:06:33,404 --> 00:06:34,671
that I've been chasing you.

100
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,060
But whenever you don't need my help,

101
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,540
you never even think of me.

102
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,580
So I really want to understand

103
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,620
what I actually mean to you.

104
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,940
Mr. Han, I...

105
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,020
In your eyes,

106
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,382
I'm just Mr. Han, isn't that right?

107
00:07:01,693 --> 00:07:03,100
You don't want anything from me.

108
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,115
All you want is Wu Si.

109
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,580
Deep down, you know that

110
00:07:08,248 --> 00:07:09,500
whatever Wu Si can give you,

111
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,680
I can give it too.

112
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,020
And I can do it even better.

113
00:07:13,915 --> 00:07:15,140
But the things I can give

114
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:16,980
are things Wu Si can never give.

115
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,100
So you can be honest with me

116
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,660
and tell me what it is you really want.

117
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,540
I don't need to tell you.

118
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,710
Because everything I want,

119
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,850
I can achieve it on my own.

120
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:27,980
And Mr. Han,

121
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,420
I hope that from now on,

122
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,820
we can keep a proper distance.

123
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,460
Wu Si and I are already engaged.

124
00:07:40,004 --> 00:07:42,226
If that's all, I'm going upstairs now.
- Let me finish.

125
00:07:44,026 --> 00:07:44,820
You already know

126
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,180
that I like you.

127
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,300
But I also know

128
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,980
why you don't choose me.

129
00:07:51,426 --> 00:07:53,100
It's because of my family's business.

130
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,780
But I've already told you.

131
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,050
I'm now fully in charge

132
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,770
of running the Changzhou Group.

133
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,660
I will build

134
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,380
a clean and honest Changzhou Group.

135
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,420
And throughout this entire journey,

136
00:08:06,493 --> 00:08:07,980
I hope you'll be part of it too.

137
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,940
Let's witness it together, alright?

138
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,660
I believe in your promise.

139
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,180
But that's not my concern.

140
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,580
I've already made myself clear just now.

141
00:08:18,737 --> 00:08:19,860
Please show some respect.

142
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:23,300
Han Yuhang, let go of me.

143
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,340
No, I won't.

144
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,740
When did you get back?

145
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,540
Head home.

146
00:08:40,848 --> 00:08:41,900
I'll walk Mr. Han out.

147
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:51,780
Mr. Han,

148
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,420
you know the way out.

149
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,340
Tang Xin said you two got engaged.

150
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,500
Is that true?

151
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,100
Yes.

152
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,500
In that case,

153
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,500
stop showing up at night

154
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,020
to see my girlfriend.

155
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:07,070
But I can give her a better life.

156
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,580
I can give her things that you can't.

157
00:09:11,604 --> 00:09:12,660
And what exactly is that?

158
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,380
More moments like today,

159
00:09:16,337 --> 00:09:17,540
where you leave without a word

160
00:09:17,871 --> 00:09:19,220
and suddenly come back again?

161
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,620
Maybe Tang Xin could wait for you

162
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:22,980
once or twice,

163
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,140
or time and time again.

164
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:24,960
But what about you?

165
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,500
Are you okay with wasting her time?

166
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:33,340
Even if she is willing to wait,

167
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:34,937
what about you?

168
00:09:36,537 --> 00:09:38,020
Are you really at peace with that?

169
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,580
Do you have any idea

170
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,660
what she has

171
00:09:46,582 --> 00:09:47,580
on her computer screen?

172
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,580
It's a screenshot of a memo.

173
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,820
It has just one sentence.

174
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,048
"Did Wu Si come back today?"

175
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,460
When you're not around,

176
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,020
she stares at that screen every day.

177
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,500
She counts the days,
she whispers, she hopes,

178
00:10:02,204 --> 00:10:03,715
as she waits for you.

179
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,540
But what if one day,

180
00:10:08,026 --> 00:10:08,900
the worst happens

181
00:10:10,671 --> 00:10:11,960
and you never return?

182
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,004
What about her?

183
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,420
How is she

184
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,900
supposed to carry on?

185
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,071
Did that cross your mind?

186
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,700
Thanks for telling me
how much she loves me.

187
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,560
What about you?

188
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,300
Do you love her just as much?

189
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,460
If you do,

190
00:10:35,204 --> 00:10:37,604
shouldn't you think
about what's best for her?

191
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,940
Tang Xin is still young.

192
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,020
She could have so many more options.

193
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,940
She could have better choices.

194
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:49,893
Let me say this again.

195
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,460
If you love her,

196
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,700
then you shouldn't let her spend

197
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,460
the rest of her life
living in fear and worry.

198
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,860
You didn't go home?

199
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,290
I was waiting here for you.

200
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,020
Is Han Yuhang gone?

201
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,580
Nothing happened between you two, right?

202
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,580
Nothing at all. Don't worry.

203
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,140
When did you get back?

204
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,420
Why didn't you tell me?

205
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,140
Let's go upstairs and talk.

206
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,540
I'm not going up.

207
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,180
I have unit work later.

208
00:12:25,715 --> 00:12:26,660
I just came to see you.

209
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,300
What's wrong?

210
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,610
You haven't seen me
for such a long time,

211
00:12:31,648 --> 00:12:33,137
but you don't seem happy at all.

212
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:34,980
You have no idea

213
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,500
what I went through during this time.

214
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,660
I even changed my wallpaper.

215
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,540
Wait...

216
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,060
Wu Si,

217
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,940
what got into you today?

218
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,300
I've thought it over.

219
00:13:13,248 --> 00:13:15,337
I proposed to you
right before the exercise...

220
00:13:19,204 --> 00:13:20,382
That was rushed.

221
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,937
I didn't think it through.

222
00:13:28,782 --> 00:13:30,182
Wu Si, what are you saying?

223
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,740
Are you trying to say

224
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,093
that the proposal back then

225
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,260
doesn't count anymore?

226
00:13:39,471 --> 00:13:40,648
That you regret it?

227
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,271
Is that it?

228
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,100
Do you have any idea
how much I've changed

229
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,660
since I got together with you?

230
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,510
All of my friends know this.

231
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,780
I've said it so many times.

232
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,100
I, Tang Xin, would never

233
00:13:58,248 --> 00:13:59,493
get involved with a soldier.

234
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,380
But somehow, I met you anyway.

235
00:14:05,848 --> 00:14:07,160
When you're busy with the unit,

236
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,260
I wait for you.

237
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:10,100
When you're on escort duty,

238
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,340
I wait for you.

239
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,900
When you're in training, I wait for you.

240
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,190
I know being with you

241
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,626
means I have to face all of that.

242
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,260
I can endure it.

243
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,620
I can accept it.
I can make room for you.

244
00:14:22,115 --> 00:14:23,620
But I also want you to understand

245
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,620
that everything I've done...

246
00:14:29,582 --> 00:14:31,226
I've done it because I love you.

247
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:40,740
I'm sorry.

248
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,300
I don't want your apology.

249
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,220
I only want one thing.

250
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,460
Before you left,

251
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,626
you proposed to me.

252
00:14:57,493 --> 00:14:59,337
Do you still want my answer?

253
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,490
I think it would be better

254
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,715
if we took some time apart.

255
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,620
I need to sort myself out.

256
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:24,660
♪Goodbye... Goodbye...♪

257
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,180
♪When I stride alone in the world♪

258
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:34,820
♪The farther I go,

259
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,700

260
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,340
Honey.

261
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,020
I think

262
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:49,940
this is still the better way.

263
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,860
Because the doctor told me

264
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,860
we still need to maintain

265
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,020
some level of safety distance.

266
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:01,030
Do you even know
what the safety distance

267
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,740
actually is?

268
00:17:36,004 --> 00:17:37,140
Why did you come over here?

269
00:17:38,248 --> 00:17:39,271
I walked, obviously.

270
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,380
You can walk without crutches now?

271
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:47,970
Surprised?

272
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,460
Totally surprised, Honey.

273
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,300
You certainly gave me a start!

274
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,260
This calls for a celebration.

275
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,590
You're amazing.

276
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,530
You're amazing. Absolutely amazing.

277
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,620
Alright, enough.

278
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,760
- Take it easy.
- Okay, put her down before she falls.

279
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:01,970
Put me down now.

280
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:02,860
Okay.

281
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:04,500
Are you alright?

282
00:18:05,204 --> 00:18:06,760
You really are from special forces.

283
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,360
You walk without making a sound.

284
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:11,500
Mom.

285
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,660
Can you just stop already?

286
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,340
You're not even sick,

287
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,871
but you're scaring yourself sick.

288
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,580
Did everything I told you mean nothing?

289
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,980
Didn't you already take

290
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,226
the emergency meds in time?

291
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,340
HIV is controllable now.

292
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,930
I am a doctor.

293
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,026
I wouldn't lie to you.

294
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,700
But what if...

295
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,140
If something really happens...

296
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,900
Then, we'll go get treated.

297
00:19:01,204 --> 00:19:02,660
We trust doctors. We trust science.

298
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:03,580
Alright?

299
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,470
Look what time it is.

300
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,460
I can't believe her.

301
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:17,990
What a scene.

302
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,340
Wearing sunglasses indoors?

303
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,100
Xin, come on, eat something.

304
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:22,604
I'm not eating.

305
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,460
Tang Xin.

306
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,020
Can you work on your temper a bit?

307
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,100
Only your mom and I can put up with it.

308
00:19:28,115 --> 00:19:30,310
- Or poor Wu Si would suffer...
- What are you yelling for?

309
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,669
At least yell at the right person.

310
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,710
Fine, who should I yell at?

311
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,460
Go yell at Wu Si.

312
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,020
He proposed to you!

313
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,100
Why would I yell at him?

314
00:19:38,493 --> 00:19:39,300
He took it back.

315
00:19:48,137 --> 00:19:49,293
How is Wu Si doing?

316
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,420
Captain Wu's external injuries
have been treated.

317
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,370
But the more serious issue

318
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,990
is his emotional state.

319
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,100
Qiu Xiao.

320
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:05,700
Generally speaking,

321
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,900
how long does it take
for HIV to show up in a test?

322
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:10,580
Brigadier...

323
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,020
Just answer me.

324
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,900
In theory,

325
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,930
after someone gets infected with HIV,

326
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,340
there's an incubation period

327
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,340
before antibodies appear in the blood.

328
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,940
That window period

329
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,871
is usually between
two weeks and three months.

330
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,460
If a blood test is done
around the sixth week,

331
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,140
and the result is negative,

332
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,920
then the infection is

333
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,980
mostly ruled out.

334
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,780
Six weeks.

335
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:41,580
Captain Tang.

336
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,580
Wang Lang.

337
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,980
What's going on with Wu Si?

338
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,340
Captain Tang, please calm down.

339
00:20:47,382 --> 00:20:48,900
I'll have Wu Si come to you right now.

340
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,140
I'll go find him.

341
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,780
Just tell me where he is.

342
00:20:52,004 --> 00:20:52,900
He's at the hospital.

343
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,580
Surprise!

344
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:48,660
Xin.

345
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,700
Can you even see us
through those sunglasses?

346
00:21:52,426 --> 00:21:53,780
Seriously, it's broad daylight.

347
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,980
Why are you wearing sunglasses?

348
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,170
If you saw us,

349
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,750
at least give us a reaction.

350
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,870
Tang Xin, tell us

351
00:21:58,870 --> 00:21:59,860
about the engagement.

352
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:08,140
- Tell us everything!
- Tell us everything!

353
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,300
Thank you, everyone.

354
00:22:12,982 --> 00:22:14,340
I appreciate the kind wishes.

355
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,220
But...

356
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,460
I might have to disappoint you all.

357
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,940
Wait, what do you mean?

358
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,980
I mean...

359
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:30,940
The engagement is off.

360
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:32,860
I'm sorry

361
00:22:32,915 --> 00:22:34,380
you prepared this for nothing.

362
00:22:37,493 --> 00:22:38,940
Tang Xin, stop messing around.

363
00:22:39,137 --> 00:22:40,740
This isn't something to joke about.

364
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,700
Well, what can I say?

365
00:22:43,515 --> 00:22:45,093
That slap in the face came fast.

366
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,648
Pretty convincing act.

367
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,671
Everyone, help yourselves.

368
00:23:06,715 --> 00:23:07,848
Don't waste the food.

369
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:13,580
Tang Xin?

370
00:23:25,026 --> 00:23:25,980
Captain Tang.

371
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,460
I didn't come here to scold you.

372
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,030
Your relationship with her
is your personal matter.

373
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,940
You must have your reasons.

374
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,280
But I want to hear
those reasons from you.

375
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,580
How could you propose
and then back out?

376
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,100
She...

377
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,970
She deserves something better.
A better life...

378
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:55,580
Nonsense.

379
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,620
I don't think I can make Tang Xin happy.

380
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,300
Why didn't you think of that

381
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,340
when you proposed?

382
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,580
You already proposed.
What are you afraid of now?

383
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:17,693
You already know
about Cheng Yuan's injury.

384
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:20,820
What if I'm next?

385
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,820
Soldiers aren't invincible.

386
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,620
We're just human.

387
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,980
A bullet hits you,

388
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,293
and this uniform won't stop it.

389
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,150
That's something
you should have accepted

390
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:35,860
before joining.

391
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,380
I understand. I really do.

392
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,700
But what if

393
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,300
something does happen to me?

394
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,220
What will Tang Xin do, then?

395
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,460
How will she go on?

396
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,980
So while I still can,

397
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,060
I want her to forget me.

398
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,420
I want her to live the life

399
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,448
she truly deserves.
A safe life, Captain Tang.

400
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,100
This is the first time

401
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,300
I've felt real fear.

402
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:18,740
I was a soldier too.

403
00:25:20,471 --> 00:25:21,580
I've been to the battles.

404
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,460
I've lost comrades too.

405
00:25:24,737 --> 00:25:26,500
I get where you're coming from.

406
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,300
But as a father, let me say this.

407
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,460
My daughter

408
00:25:36,715 --> 00:25:38,804
chose to marry a soldier
and become his wife.

409
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,860
She knows exactly
what comes with that choice.

410
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,220
Life is full of hard choices,

411
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,380
especially for soldiers.

412
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,980
Don't take what you see as a burden

413
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:01,380
and throw it onto the one
you love the most.

414
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:05,460
If you do that,

415
00:26:06,915 --> 00:26:08,115
then you're no soldier.

416
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,460
Captain Wang.

417
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:25,980
Dr. Yang.

418
00:26:26,515 --> 00:26:27,760
How are you feeling?

419
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,010
Not bad.

420
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:30,420
Try moving it. Let me see.

421
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,540
Raise it a bit higher.

422
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:37,540
Very good.

423
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,380
Have a seat.

424
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,740
Any sharp pain when walking?

425
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,620
What about soreness?

426
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,020
If the training lasts long,

427
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,004
there's a little.

428
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,700
You're recovering
even better than I expected.

429
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,380
Cases that recover this quickly

430
00:26:54,515 --> 00:26:55,340
are really rare.

431
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:57,900
Dr. Yang,

432
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,500
if I keep pushing myself in rehab,

433
00:27:00,604 --> 00:27:02,960
how soon could I return
to the Marine Corps?

434
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,700
(Let me be straight with you.)

435
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,340
(The way you've recovered so far)

436
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,980
(is already a miracle.)

437
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,420
(Even if you continue rehab,)

438
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,515
(you'll only be able
to live like a normal person again.)

439
00:27:16,937 --> 00:27:18,980
(Meeting the physical standards
of the Marines)

440
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:21,093
(is basically impossible now.)

441
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:21,980
Chen?

442
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,060
Chen, you're zoning out.

443
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,900
It's windy. Don't catch a cold.

444
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:29,900
Come on.

445
00:27:30,004 --> 00:27:31,420
Let's get to training. Let's go.

446
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,620
I'm a bit tired today.

447
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,420
I think I'll skip training.

448
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,030
That's not okay.

449
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,900
Even though you're healing well,

450
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,160
you still can't slack off.

451
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,260
This is your golden window for recovery.

452
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,900
You only get a few months.

453
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,620
If you miss it,

454
00:27:45,848 --> 00:27:47,060
you won't get another shot

455
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,530
down the line.

456
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:49,420
Come on. Let's go.

457
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,100
Mom, the doctor already told me

458
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,700
that no matter how hard I train,

459
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,140
my body

460
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,460
can only recover
to a regular person's level.

461
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,780
I can never

462
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,260
be a Marine again.

463
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,740
Hello? Mom, what's up?

464
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,540
Why didn't you tell us

465
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,900
about Zong Qing's situation?

466
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,260
So you already know?

467
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,950
Your dad heard it from Wang Lang.

468
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,260
Something this serious
and you kept it from us?

469
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,900
He just got back.

470
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,260
We're still waiting on the results.

471
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,660
I didn't want you two to worry.

472
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,420
We're your parents.
Of course we'll worry.

473
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,950
Dad, I must get to work.

474
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:46,871
I'll talk to you later.

475
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,300
Don't bring it up with Zong Qing.

476
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,380
I'll explain everything when I get home.

477
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,260
That girl...

478
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:00,660
Silly girl.

479
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,500
No.

480
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,780
I'm calling Zong Qing.

481
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,140
Didn't you hear what she said?

482
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:09,500
Let's wait till she gets home.

483
00:29:15,937 --> 00:29:17,493
Captain Tang was looking for you.

484
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,020
Yes, Sir.

485
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,260
How are things with Tang Xin?

486
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,115
Because of Cheng Yuan?

487
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,100
Because of myself.

488
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,180
Alright.

489
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,500
Take this time to recover.

490
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,420
I've arranged it for you.

491
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,780
Three therapy sessions a week.

492
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,900
Brigadier, I don't need that.

493
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,390
It's not up to you to decide.

494
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,100
Let out whatever's weighing

495
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:49,740
on your mind.

496
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:52,660
Yes, Sir.

497
00:29:57,871 --> 00:29:59,740
You only have five minutes
for your visit.

498
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,380
You can talk to him now.

499
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,380
Cheng Yuan.

500
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:25,780
Still sleeping?

501
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,260
Get up.

502
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,671
You were the best sharpshooter
I ever trained.

503
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,420
But look at you now.

504
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,020
You're lying here and sleeping all day.

505
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,980
Trying to waste all that potential?

506
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:43,860
Cheng Yuan, listen up.

507
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,830
I'll give you two days to sleep in.

508
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,260
After that, when I come back,

509
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:49,880
I want to see you on your feet!

510
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:51,500
Cheng Yuan!

511
00:30:52,604 --> 00:30:54,020
Every time I called your name,

512
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,380
before I even said what I needed,

513
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,780
you'd always answer, "Got it."

514
00:31:01,915 --> 00:31:03,804
You were the Brigadier's best shot.

515
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,900
And the most
dependable soldier I ever led.

516
00:31:10,182 --> 00:31:11,140
No question about it.

517
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:15,740
Do you remember

518
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,980
the first time we met?

519
00:31:18,937 --> 00:31:20,582
You were the same age as Yi Nanwang.

520
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,740
Time really flew.

521
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,100
Zong Qing always says

522
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,020
I act like a mother hen.

523
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,380
Seriously.

524
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,500
Every time we went on a mission,
I was a wreck.

525
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,660
Always afraid one of you
would get sick or hurt.

526
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,860
But in the end,

527
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,140
Wang Chen got hurt,

528
00:31:47,937 --> 00:31:48,900
and then it was you.

529
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,020
Come on, enough.

530
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,780
Don't be so negative.

531
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,500
Brigadier.

532
00:32:03,182 --> 00:32:04,780
You were the one who sent Cheng Yuan

533
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,660
to Blue Blade.

534
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,620
He was your best sniper.

535
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:10,620
Your best shooter.

536
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,380
And I failed to protect him.

537
00:32:13,471 --> 00:32:14,660
This happened on my watch.

538
00:32:17,537 --> 00:32:18,471
Brigadier...

539
00:32:20,626 --> 00:32:21,671
Captain...

540
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:25,660
Cheng Yuan.

541
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,140
Cheng Yuan, can you hear me?

542
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,180
Captain, there's no response.

543
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,380
Cheng Yuan?

544
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,140
Cheng Yuan, can you hear me?

545
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,510
Cheng Yuan?

546
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,071
Visiting hours are over. Please leave.

547
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:41,940
Cheng Yuan.

548
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,070
- Out.
- Cheng Yuan!

549
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:45,580
Cheng Yuan!

550
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,140
Can you hear me?

551
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,140
Cheng Yuan?

552
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,380
Cheng Yuan?

553
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,140
Listen to me.

554
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,100
I need you to stay awake
as best you can.

555
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,660
Can you do that?

556
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,980
Mom, Dad.

557
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,980
Didn't I already tell you?

558
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,660
Right now,

559
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,540
everything is still okay.

560
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,820
We're waiting on the results.

561
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:11,660
Zong Qing is in a good mental state too.

562
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:13,700
We've already agreed

563
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,860
that no matter what happens,

564
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,420
we'll face it together.

565
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:20,780
Just...

566
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,140
Just what did he do to deserve this?

567
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,740
Why must he go through this?

568
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,900
Mom, calm down.

569
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:29,940
You and Dad

570
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,940
have always taught me to be strong.

571
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,620
Right now,

572
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,740
I'm officially a soldier's wife.

573
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,960
We were prepared for this.

574
00:33:42,715 --> 00:33:44,140
If Zong Qing can think that way,

575
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:45,580
it means he's strong.

576
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,740
He's a real soldier.

577
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,310
Good for him.

578
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,140
You're all grown up.

579
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,380
Good for you.

580
00:34:11,826 --> 00:34:12,900
His condition is stable.

581
00:34:13,071 --> 00:34:15,140
We'll keep him
under observation for 24 hours.

582
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,340
If everything looks good,

583
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,900
he can be moved to a regular ward.

584
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,660
When are you planning

585
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,140
to tell him about it?

586
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:25,740
The bandages

587
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,740
will be taken off tonight.

588
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:45,980
Wu Si...

589
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,820
Before Cheng Yuan moves
to the regular ward,

590
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:56,860
don't come visit again.

591
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,560
You always ramble.

592
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,340
Got it.

593
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,380
Cheng Yuan's one of Blue Blade's vets.

594
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,050
You think when he covered you,

595
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,060
he didn't know what danger

596
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:13,980
he was walking into?

597
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,340
I didn't know.

598
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,900
You didn't know?

599
00:35:22,026 --> 00:35:23,660
After all the missions you've done,

600
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,160
you're telling me you didn't know?

601
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,420
That's a battlefield.

602
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,470
That's where anything can happen

603
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:31,060
at any moment.

604
00:35:32,271 --> 00:35:34,340
Once you're out there,
it's no longer up to you.

605
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,580
If you insist on taking all the blame

606
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,700
onto yourself,

607
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,060
then fine, carry it.

608
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,100
Yes, Sir.

609
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:46,900
Yes what?

610
00:35:47,204 --> 00:35:48,226
Lost your soul?

611
00:35:48,693 --> 00:35:49,604
Stand up straight!

612
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:52,980
Zong Qing is on leave too.

613
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:54,300
You know why?

614
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,560
He got scratched

615
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,380
while arresting a dealer.

616
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,400
Just a small cut.

617
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,620
It's nothing.

618
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,100
However,

619
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,100
that dealer

620
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,120
might have HIV.

621
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,340
The test results aren't back yet.

622
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:14,340
The virus has an incubation period.

623
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,420
Feeling guilty?

624
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,380
I feel guilty too.

625
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,340
But does it help?

626
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,740
Accidents like this
could still happen again.

627
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:26,140
So what then?

628
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,140
You just back out?

629
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,660
You quit because you know the risks?

630
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,300
Get out of here.

631
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,860
Listen up.

632
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:43,860
For now,

633
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,620
focus on resting up.

634
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,740
Do your counseling too.

635
00:36:46,982 --> 00:36:48,140
Stop visiting Cheng Yuan.

636
00:36:48,737 --> 00:36:50,248
Keep your distance from Zong Qing.

637
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:51,620
Yes, Sir.

638
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:53,580
Now scram.

639
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:01,980
(Century Bridge)

640
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:34,190
Wu Si.

641
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:34,900
Mom.

642
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:37,660
You lost weight.

643
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,220
Not eating properly, huh?

644
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,380
Come on, let's go inside.

645
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,980
Did you tell Tang Xin you're back?

646
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,580
When are we meeting?

647
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,220
Meeting who?

648
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,800
Her parents, of course. Who else?

649
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,060
You silly boy.

650
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,260
The whole reason I came this time

651
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,820
was to talk about your engagement.

652
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,000
Once you two are engaged,

653
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,860
I'll finally feel at ease going home.

654
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:13,780
Mom...

655
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,580
What's the rush?

656
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,920
How can I not be in a rush?

657
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,660
Why aren't you answering the call?

658
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,660
It's nothing. I'll get it later.

659
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:43,540
Who is it?

660
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:46,900
Your fiancée?

661
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,180
(Fiancée)

662
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,460
Why aren't you answering?

663
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:52,860
Go on, pick up.

664
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,500
(Fiancée)

665
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:56,540
Answer it.

666
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,340
It's connecting.

667
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:03,820
Hello?

668
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,890
How long are you planning to avoid me?

669
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,900
Is it that hard to just talk to me?

670
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,540
I'm busy right now.

671
00:39:15,982 --> 00:39:16,740
We'll talk later.

672
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,260
Alright, I'm hanging up.

673
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,460
Wait, you're not busy with anything.

674
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,300
You just hung up like that?

675
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,660
That was not right.

676
00:39:26,337 --> 00:39:27,140
What's going on?

677
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:29,300
Mom,

678
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,820
maybe you should head back.

679
00:39:32,115 --> 00:39:34,604
The proposal was a rash decision.

680
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,140
Neither of us was ready.

681
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,340
We need more time.

682
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,580
Son,

683
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,260
what really happened?

684
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,380
Tell me the truth.

685
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,660
Cheng Yuan got hurt.

686
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,860
Because of me,

687
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,340
he's still lying in the ICU.

688
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:05,500
But what if it hadn't been him, but me?

689
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,820
He made it back this time.

690
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,100
But next time...

691
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,300
What if I end up like my dad?

692
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,540
Have you notified my family

693
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,380
and my girlfriend?

694
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:48,820
Not yet.

695
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:56,820
Qiu Xiao.

696
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:58,900
I'm here.

697
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,570
I'm no longer a sniper anymore,

698
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,300
am I?

699
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,540
We won!

700
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,950
