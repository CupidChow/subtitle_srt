00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,880
Why are you spacing out?

19
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,440
Stay calm.

20
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,290
Brigadier, what can I do for you?

21
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,440
Saturday.

22
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,130
6 PM, the usual time.

23
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,810
Pinzhen Restaurant.

24
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,760
Remember to take leave.

25
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,130
Brigadier...

26
00:02:18,293 --> 00:02:19,560
About the blind date,

27
00:02:19,582 --> 00:02:21,515
maybe you should set it up
for Zong Qing instead.

28
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,690
Zong Qing doesn't need
me playing matchmaker.

29
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,370
Just worry about yourself, will you?

30
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,320
You'd better dress nicely.

31
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,715
- Captain Zong.
- Captain Zong.

32
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:45,970
Looking sharp!

33
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,210
For a blind date?

34
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,130
Don't ask questions you shouldn't ask.

35
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,720
Where's my camera?

36
00:02:51,293 --> 00:02:52,970
Why do you need a camera
for a blind date?

37
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,530
I have to see someone first.

38
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,200
Hello? Who's this?

39
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,160
I'm the guy from the Marine unit.

40
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,720
Your camera's fixed.

41
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,040
I can drop it off tonight.

42
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,570
Or if that's not convenient for you,

43
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,550
I can deliver it instead.

44
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,690
Let's just meet in person.

45
00:03:26,782 --> 00:03:28,693
I actually have something to ask you.

46
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,880
I told you last time.

47
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,570
Our unit follows strict rules.

48
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,040
I can't talk about
any classified missions.

49
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,970
It's confidential.

50
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,570
I got it. Don't worry.

51
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,480
I've always respected the military.

52
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,160
My dad's in the service too.

53
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,880
After what happened last time,

54
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,370
he gave me a whole lecture about it.

55
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,804
I actually feel really bad about it.

56
00:03:47,804 --> 00:03:48,720
Don't be.

57
00:03:49,204 --> 00:03:50,480
I'm the one who should feel bad.

58
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,160
Let's not keep passing
the blame back and forth.

59
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:54,850
How about this?

60
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,515
Text me your address.
I'll find you.

61
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,600
Pinzhen Restaurant.

62
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,320
I'll text you once I'm done.

63
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,160
Isn't Pinzhen Restaurant...

64
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,720
Are you ready?

65
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,440
Just changing into a dress...

66
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,600
Yes, I'm ready.

67
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,370
Come in.

68
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,570
How is this ready?

69
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,004
I clearly told you to wear a dress!

70
00:04:22,026 --> 00:04:22,729
You...

71
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,010
Why are you holding those pants?

72
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:24,760
Fine...

73
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,130
Dad, let me ask you something.

74
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,730
We're having dinner
with Mr. Wang tonight at...

75
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,130
Pinzhen Restaurant, right?

76
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,010
That's right. Why?

77
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,250
Don't tell me you've got other plans.

78
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,570
You little rascal, I'm telling you,

79
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,880
you're not going anywhere tonight!

80
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,080
Dad, why are you holding me so tight?

81
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,200
Tight?

82
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,010
I'll let go once we're inside the room.

83
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,520
You think I like dragging you around?

84
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,570
Once we're in there,

85
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,170
show some manners. Greet everyone.

86
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,690
Don't go in all wild and flailing.

87
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,400
I don't want people
saying my daughter...

88
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,200
I'm talking to you!

89
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,610
I heard you!

90
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,340
(Heroic Journalist:
Comrade, where are you?)

91
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,700
(Heroic Marine Man: Pinzhen Restaurant,
but I can't get away right now.)

92
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,840
Slow down!

93
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,160
I'm wearing heels!

94
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,620
My legs aren't in great shape either!

95
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,440
(Heroic Journalist: Something came up on
my end too. Can you come see me?)

96
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,980
(Heroic Marine Man: I can only
buy a few minutes.)

97
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,700
(Heroic Journalist: Should be enough.
Meet me at the front desk.)

98
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,010
Where are you going?

99
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,280
The restroom, Sir!

100
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,570
Don't take too long.

101
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,810
Don't... Don't resist.

102
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,026
My legs are not doing great.

103
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,010
Just slow down.

104
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,440
We're here.

105
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:50,930
Dad...

106
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,400
Captain Tang.

107
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,880
Well, say hi!

108
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,050
Brigadier!

109
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,570
Seriously!

110
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,760
Hi, Mr. Wang.

111
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,570
You've gotten prettier.

112
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,370
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

113
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,050
Sit down, please.

114
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:06,610
Okay.

115
00:06:07,293 --> 00:06:09,240
Where's Wu Si?
[*Sounds like numbers five and four.]

116
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:09,960
Dad,

117
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,250
are you guys speaking in code now?

118
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,010
What codes?

119
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,490
His name is Wu Si.

120
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,560
Oh, come on.

121
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,200
Who would give
their kid that weird name?

122
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,960
Hey, that's rude!

123
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,880
It's okay.

124
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,840
Xin, that really is his name, Wu Si.

125
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,400
Captain of the Blue Blade Special
Ops Team in the Marine Corps.

126
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,009
One of the best soldiers
I've ever trained.

127
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:29,559
I brought him here to join our dinner.

128
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,640
Where is he?

129
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,010
He's in the restroom.
He'll be back any second.

130
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,010
Don't worry.

131
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,930
Well then, excuse me...

132
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,640
What are you doing?

133
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:42,930
Blocking me won't help.

134
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,115
He's not here yet.
I just need to touch up my makeup.

135
00:06:45,137 --> 00:06:46,840
It's smudged because
of the run just now.

136
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,248
Do you want me to see him like this?

137
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,440
No.

138
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,080
Look at my dad, Mr. Wang!

139
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,200
Let her go, Captain.

140
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,280
Girls care about how they look.

141
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,880
Mr. Wang, you really get it.

142
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,640
What now?

143
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,320
Hand over your phone.

144
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,170
What if you don't come back?

145
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,930
Fine!

146
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,170
My god, this is harder
than leading troops.

147
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,050
Don't stress.

148
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,400
She's here now, right?

149
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,010
Miss Tang.

150
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,810
Did something unexpected happen to you?

151
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,610
It's a long story. Not important.

152
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,426
You look like you've got
something going on too.

153
00:07:40,448 --> 00:07:41,440
Here, this is for you.

154
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,840
Check it.

155
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,880
You didn't go through
what's inside, right?

156
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,570
No.

157
00:07:46,693 --> 00:07:47,693
A buddy helped fix it.

158
00:07:47,715 --> 00:07:48,200
Okay.

159
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,640
Any other questions?

160
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,370
Yes.

161
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,570
I just want to know,

162
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,250
you know the person

163
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,248
who carried out the Dayan Reef Rescue,
don't you?

164
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,280
You haven't answered my question.

165
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,570
Why do you want to know?

166
00:08:10,137 --> 00:08:11,400
Because I was there that day too.

167
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,730
I know exactly

168
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,400
how dangerous it was.

169
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,671
The reports shouldn't have
been about some "superwoman."

170
00:08:17,715 --> 00:08:20,137
They should've been about
the marine soldier who was there.

171
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,250
I want to report the truth.

172
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,050
Please give me that chance.

173
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,730
A soldier's duty

174
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,330
is to follow orders
and complete the mission.

175
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,450
According to regulations,

176
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,960
I'm not allowed to tell you.

177
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,582
So the rules say you can't talk, huh?

178
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,280
How about just a little hint?

179
00:08:51,537 --> 00:08:53,560
I'm not letting you go until
you give me something.

180
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,130
A little hint, right?

181
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,760
Yes.

182
00:08:59,010 --> 00:08:59,730
Fine.

183
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,400
Buzz cut.

184
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,330
Tanned skin.

185
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,450
Broad shoulders.

186
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,760
And?

187
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,680
That's it.

188
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,010
That's it?

189
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,160
That could describe
every Marine guy out there!

190
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,850
You're totally brushing me off.

191
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,800
Sorry, I really have to go.

192
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,920
Goodbye.

193
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,280
I heard Lin Lan's application to
join the military posting got approved.

194
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:30,970
It did.

195
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,560
She has quit her job.

196
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,690
She'll be here in a few days.

197
00:09:34,693 --> 00:09:35,293
Good.

198
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,400
You're finally reuniting.

199
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,130
Two people have to stay together

200
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,400
to make a home.

201
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,490
We've been waiting for this day.

202
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,280
Oh, gosh.

203
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,730
Captain Tang.

204
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:53,450
Wu Si.

205
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:54,920
Hi.

206
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:55,850
Hi.

207
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,010
Please sit.

208
00:09:58,970 --> 00:09:59,880
Go on, sit down.

209
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:00,800
Captain.

210
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,330
Dad, I'm back.

211
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,090
What are you doing here?

212
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,560
Miss Tang?

213
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,640
They know each other?

214
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,400
I don't know.

215
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,280
Have you

216
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,520
ordered the food?

217
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,130
No.

218
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,160
Let's go then.

219
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,560
We have to order food.

220
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,010
That's important.

221
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:10,640
Captain...

222
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,520
Captain, this is improper.

223
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,850
Right, you're right.

224
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,450
You can listen better. You do it.

225
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:17,850
Come.

226
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,520
Uh...

227
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,160
- Do it.
- This is improper.

228
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,370
Just do it.

229
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,850
What are you doing here?

230
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,893
I'm here for a blind date.

231
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,560
Who's talking now?

232
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,800
I can't hear anything.

233
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:52,640
Wu Si.

234
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,970
Captain of the Blue Blade
Special Ops Team.

235
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,490
Don't tell me you weren't

236
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,760
part of the Dayan Reef Rescue?

237
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,250
I didn't expect that my

238
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,010
blind date would
turn out to be you.

239
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,730
Since we're here on a blind date,

240
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,560
let's talk.

241
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,490
Talking is fine,

242
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,937
but just don't try to fish for info.

243
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,130
Relax, Captain Wu. I won't.

244
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,010
It's obvious you took this
blind date pretty seriously.

245
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,370
You trimmed your nails,

246
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,490
ironed your shirt,

247
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,160
and even shaved.

248
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,550
But you didn't want it to look
like you were trying too hard.

249
00:12:43,582 --> 00:12:44,610
So earlier,

250
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,610
you tugged at your shirt sleeves,

251
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,970
trying to seem more casual.

252
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,250
Maintaining a sharp appearance
is part of combat readiness.

253
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,370
And in the Marine,

254
00:12:57,404 --> 00:12:59,782
we've placed extra importance
on grooming and presentation.

255
00:13:00,137 --> 00:13:01,370
Take Captain Tang for example,

256
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:03,970
has he ever left the house without
razor-straight trouser creases?

257
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,680
Can we not talk about my dad?

258
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,280
Captain.

259
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,520
This is improper.

260
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,820
If we don't know what
they're talking about,

261
00:13:15,826 --> 00:13:17,520
how can we help them speed things up?

262
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,090
Come on...

263
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,250
Captain Wu,

264
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,040
I'll be straight with you.

265
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,800
I really did come here
hoping to get to know you.

266
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,640
But if you keep dodging my questions,

267
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,048
this conversation's going nowhere.

268
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,730
You've got a boyfriend.

269
00:13:38,004 --> 00:13:39,560
So why are you even on a blind date?

270
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,130
Han Yuhang said that himself.

271
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,680
I never said we were a thing.

272
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,210
But honestly, Captain Wu,

273
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,520
you're pretty much my type.

274
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,880
What's your type?

275
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,160
Clean look.

276
00:14:01,426 --> 00:14:02,280
Doesn't talk too much.

277
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,730
Easy on the eyes.

278
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,400
Since fate brought us together,

279
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,330
how about we try dating?

280
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,490
It's been a while.

281
00:14:18,537 --> 00:14:19,730
Why hasn't she come back yet?

282
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,850
I'm still a little worried.

283
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,450
Maybe I should give her a call.

284
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,090
Relax.

285
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,970
She's with a military guy.

286
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,160
She's perfectly safe.

287
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,250
Maybe they are hitting it off right now.

288
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,130
How was it?

289
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,370
We didn't connect at all.

290
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,640
We hit it off right away.

291
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,680
And?

292
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,250
Terrible with words.

293
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:49,970
A boring guy.

294
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:50,760
Smart.

295
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:51,680
Confident.

296
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,520
Pretty interesting.

297
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,400
Keep bringing up confidentiality rules.

298
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,490
Keep asking about the Dayan Reef.

299
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,520
It's like he doesn't want me to find out

300
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,640
who rescued me that day.

301
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,160
So,

302
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,850
at the end of the day...

303
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,210
Yes, are you...

304
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,280
Are you going on a date or not?

305
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,730
Going on a date or not?

306
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:17,970
Captain,

307
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,800
since fate brought us together,

308
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,370
how about we try dating?

309
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,130
Okay.

310
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,760
You agreed so easily.

311
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:34,760
I know you weren't exactly
thrilled about this blind date,

312
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,680
but we have to keep seeing each other.

313
00:15:39,493 --> 00:15:41,982
Because you've got to complete
the "blind date mission" too, huh?

314
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,850
My name is Wu Si,

315
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:46,680
a military officer.

316
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,893
A major, deputy battalion level.

317
00:15:47,893 --> 00:15:50,290
(Military ID)
Captain of the Blue Blade Special Ops.

318
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,980
Enlisted in high school,
served for a decade.

319
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,710
Got into a military academy
while in the force.

320
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,960
Why are you telling me all this?

321
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,610
Didn't we say we'd
keep seeing each other?

322
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,040
Figured we should be prepared.

323
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,160
Trade intel in advance.

324
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,130
Better safe than sorry.

325
00:16:02,582 --> 00:16:03,920
Because of the nature of my job,

326
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,250
I won't be able

327
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,560
to go shopping with my girlfriend.

328
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,800
I'll often go off the grid,

329
00:16:07,848 --> 00:16:10,030
and I can't really share
anything about my daily life.

330
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:12,330
No matter what, I'm a soldier first,

331
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,490
then a boyfriend or husband second.

332
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,090
Okay.

333
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,760
Captain Wu, let's save
the serious talk for later.

334
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,130
Let's unify the message.

335
00:16:21,293 --> 00:16:22,693
Why did we decide to start dating?

336
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,920
Didn't you say I fit your type?

337
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,490
That won't work.

338
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,400
My dad knows

339
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,520
I've never considered
military men my type.

340
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,715
Unless there's an exception.

341
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,840
What exception?

342
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,250
Unless...

343
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,730
You're the Marine

344
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,471
who saved me during
the Dayan Reef Rescue.

345
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,210
A lifesaving favor is too big to repay.

346
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,610
Only fair I marry you.

347
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,400
It'd be a super convincing reason.

348
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,330
No way.

349
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,160
Leave Dayan Reef out of this.

350
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,370
That's my hard line.

351
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,370
Fine, you come up with one then.

352
00:16:53,426 --> 00:16:55,693
But it better be good
because my dad's not easy to fool.

353
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:58,760
Just say

354
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,182
I was the one chasing you.

355
00:17:00,404 --> 00:17:02,760
You only agreed to give it
a shot and see how things go.

356
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,170
You serious?

357
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,360
Okay, deal!

358
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,210
No take-backs.

359
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,210
I'd like to officially announce

360
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,080
Captain Wu and I will be
getting to know each other

361
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,840
with dating as the goal.

362
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,730
Really?

363
00:17:29,693 --> 00:17:30,871
- That's wonderful!
- Okay.

364
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,410
Chill.

365
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
(Tang Xin)

366
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,780
(Wu Si)

367
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,604
He's quite handsome,
but he's too old-fashioned.

368
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:05,020
(Tang Xin: Let's make a good team.)

369
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,980
(Wu Si)

370
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,740
(Chinese People's Liberation Army)

371
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,840
Hi, Chief!

372
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,010
Salute!

373
00:18:29,271 --> 00:18:30,450
Why are you standing here?

374
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,490
Wu Si or disciplinary officer?

375
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,080
The disciplinary officer, Sir.

376
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,800
Dress code violation?

377
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,730
And running in the hallway.

378
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,930
You mess around all the time,

379
00:18:44,448 --> 00:18:47,204
and now you've got the guts to pull
this right under Chief's nose?

380
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:56,490
Report!

381
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,560
Come in.

382
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,320
Yes, Sir!

383
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,760
You know what I'm here for?

384
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,560
Yes, Sir.

385
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,560
It's about the press.

386
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,410
Keep going.

387
00:19:10,693 --> 00:19:11,599
Yes, Sir.

388
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,450
During this week's
amphibious landing exercise,

389
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,970
our unit received a distress call.

390
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,360
Per higher-up orders,

391
00:19:16,515 --> 00:19:17,930
the Blue Blade Special Ops team was...

392
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,320
Don't gloss over the details.

393
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:21,560
Tell me what I don't already know.

394
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:22,930
Yes, Sir.

395
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,970
During the rescue,
a reporter fell into the water.

396
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,010
Blue Blade team members
responded quickly on-site.

397
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,170
No injuries, just a scare.

398
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,970
The individual was safely rescued.

399
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,210
Afterward,

400
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,890
relevant personnel
conducted a debrief and review.

401
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,537
Draw appropriate attention
to the matter.

402
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,670
Avoid letting the media
blow it out of proportion.

403
00:19:39,671 --> 00:19:41,040
We don't need unnecessary trouble.

404
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,970
Yes, Sir.

405
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,360
Sir,

406
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,170
there were a few complications
during the operation.

407
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,410
If there are any negative repercussions,

408
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,760
I'll take full responsibility.

409
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,650
No need to completely dodge the issue.

410
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:57,040
Go over it
with your political commissar.

411
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,800
You can accept

412
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,560
some official media interviews.

413
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,426
Positive exposure
for the unit is a good thing.

414
00:20:02,448 --> 00:20:04,271
Just make sure to
maintain confidentiality.

415
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:05,115
Don't go too far.

416
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,010
Yes, Sir.

417
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,280
Hi, Chief!

418
00:20:16,804 --> 00:20:18,293
Are you being punished to stand here?

419
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,930
Chief,

420
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,320
I'll learn from punishment!

421
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,010
How old are you?

422
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,120
19, Sir!

423
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,170
Are you tired?

424
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,120
No, Sir!

425
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,690
Are you hungry?

426
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,320
I am...

427
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,280
Why don't we let him go eat first?

428
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,010
Yes, Sir.

429
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,040
Come stand here again

430
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,410
tomorrow morning.

431
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,760
Yes, Sir.

432
00:20:54,460 --> 00:21:01,460
(Chinese People's Liberation Army)

433
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,730
The soldiers these days

434
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,650
keep getting younger every year.

435
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,210
Just 19,

436
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,600
but already looks like a grown man.

437
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,250
Meanwhile, my daughter
never seems to grow up.

438
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,450
Sir,

439
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,210
isn't Yangyang graduating soon?

440
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,840
She just had her graduation ceremony.

441
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,560
She's joining the society soon.

442
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,080
Time flies.

443
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,170
What does she plan to do?

444
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,840
What plan could she possibly have?

445
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,690
(Honey,)

446
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,182
(I know
that military marriages aren't easy.)

447
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,840
(But I've never once
regretted marrying you.)

448
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,520
(On our wedding day, I vowed)

449
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,360
(to share the good and the bad,
and spend my life with you.)

450
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,320
(I'm going back.)

451
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,890
(See you again in a few days.)

452
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,460
(Wenzhou Marine Museum)

453
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,210
Mr. Bai, we're so glad
you could join us.

454
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:19,970
Thank you.

455
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,360
It's truly an honor for us to have

456
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,490
someone with your expertise.

457
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,560
The honor is mine.

458
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,890
Come on. Let me show you to your office.

459
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:26,410
Okay.

460
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,660
(Luck)

461
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,740
(Mailbox, One notification)

462
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,840
(The information I provided last time
about the underwater)

463
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,330
(cultural relics being
illegally salvaged near Dayan Reef)

464
00:24:05,337 --> 00:24:06,690
(was to see how sincere you are.)

465
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,760
(The Dayan Reef area is too vague.)

466
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,693
(I'm giving you the exact
coordinates this time.)

467
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,080
We've had our drinks.

468
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,690
Out with it.

469
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:24,280
I need a boat.

470
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,210
Another boat?

471
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,210
What for this time?

472
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,360
Going out to sea.

473
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,600
Miss Tang and I

474
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,520
need to go back to Dayan Reef.

475
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,970
You just had an incident out there!

476
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,450
Now you want to go back?

477
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,800
I told you last time,

478
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,410
stay out of it.

479
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,490
Besides, Dad's overseas right now.

480
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,671
If something happens to you,

481
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:46,982
what am I supposed to tell him?

482
00:24:47,004 --> 00:24:48,560
Calm down, brother.

483
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,520
If it were anyone else,
I wouldn't bother.

484
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,250
But this is about Miss Tang.
I can't sit this one out.

485
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,080
Think about it,

486
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,450
the boat I borrowed for her
was one of ours from Changzhou.

487
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:57,410
It caught fire.

488
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,040
She nearly lost her life out there.

489
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,560
Didn't she?

490
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,040
I feel responsible.

491
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,010
Plus, we've got our city's reputation
to think about.

492
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:04,970
I need a chance

493
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,410
to make it right.

494
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,690
Make it right how?

495
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,280
That whole area's massive.

496
00:25:09,515 --> 00:25:10,582
Where are you going to look?

497
00:25:10,626 --> 00:25:11,410
Stop kidding.

498
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,690
This time it's different.

499
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,600
We've got coordinates.

500
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,650
That whistleblower

501
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,730
sent a precise location

502
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,120
to Miss Tang's email.

503
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,650
We'll go straight there.

504
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,890
I've made up my mind.

505
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,210
This is the last time.

506
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,280
If we find something,

507
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,490
everyone wins.

508
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,010
If not,

509
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,600
I think Miss Tang
will finally let it go.

510
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
So, please,

511
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,490
you have to help me.

512
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,250
It's a win-win-win kind of deal, right?

513
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,250
Come on, bro.

514
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,450
Just so we're clear,

515
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,450
this is the last time.

516
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,210
After this, you're done.

517
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:53,730
Hurry!

518
00:25:54,426 --> 00:25:55,804
Those behind, try to catch up!

519
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,890
Run faster! Faster!

520
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,120
Hurry up!

521
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,450
Come on!

522
00:26:08,204 --> 00:26:09,490
Those in the back, didn't you eat?

523
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,010
Come!

524
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:10,730
Faster!

525
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,490
You both are 26.

526
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,210
Good job.

527
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:17,337
Are you sure I'm not even
a little faster than him?

528
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,650
Come on, faster!

529
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,410
Report!

530
00:26:20,804 --> 00:26:22,982
- I thought we were jogging today?
- Faster!

531
00:26:23,004 --> 00:26:25,010
This is jogging for Captain.

532
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,120
Yes.

533
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,210
For you,
it's more like a full-on sprint.

534
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:29,760
Hurry up!

535
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,150
When am I going to be fast enough
to catch up with Captain Chen?

536
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,450
You can jog all the way back

537
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,170
to base and ask her yourself.

538
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,010
Forget it.

539
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,337
She can run faster than you
even with her eyes closed.

540
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,315
(Captain, message from command,)

541
00:26:55,315 --> 00:26:57,490
(you're to return to base
immediately upon receipt.)

542
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,600
Copy that.

543
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,730
Fall in!

544
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:14,450
Orders from command,

545
00:27:14,471 --> 00:27:16,760
our unit is to regroup and
return to base immediately.

546
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,970
Right face!

547
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,970
Eyes front!

548
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,360
At ease!

549
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:22,650
Attention!

550
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,800
Right turn!

551
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,970
Double time, march!

552
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,250
Grab your gun.

553
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,360
Right dress!

554
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,040
Eyes front!

555
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,040
At ease!

556
00:27:47,293 --> 00:27:49,182
According to a report
from the Maritime Authority,

557
00:27:49,182 --> 00:27:50,800
local fishermen recently turned in

558
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,250
several suspicious detection devices.

559
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,730
They also observed unknown

560
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,040
vessels dumping
unidentified objects in certain waters.

561
00:27:56,204 --> 00:27:57,970
Preliminary assessment showed
foreign agents

562
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,720
may have infiltrated
for intelligence gathering.

563
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,150
It concerns
national maritime security.

564
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,210
The Coast Guard has
requested our support.

565
00:28:03,804 --> 00:28:05,280
Higher command has ordered our team

566
00:28:05,337 --> 00:28:07,080
to proceed immediately
to the designated area

567
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,730
and assist in underwater
special operations.

568
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,490
Is that clear?

569
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:11,600
- Yes, Sir!
- Yes, Sir!

570
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,800
Right turn!

571
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:14,560
Left rear turn!

572
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
Double time, march!

573
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,250
Liu Qi,

574
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,120
why'd you bring me all the way out here?

575
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,210
You don't know?

576
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,760
Baitun Bay is a newly
developed tourist spot.

577
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,730
The guesthouses here
are always fully booked.

578
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,840
I thought I'd get your opinion on it.

579
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,280
If it looks promising, I'm
thinking of opening one myself.

580
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,600
You want me to weigh in?

581
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,520
You must really trust my judgment.

582
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,010
You're a well-traveled reporter!

583
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:47,970
You've definitely got a
better eye than I do.

584
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,650
Honestly, this place
does have a nice vibe.

585
00:28:50,915 --> 00:28:52,120
Let's find a guesthouse first

586
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,010
and drop off our bags,

587
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,026
then we can go explore.

588
00:28:54,048 --> 00:28:55,226
- What do you say?
- Sure.

589
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,210
This is your room. What do you think?

590
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,760
It looks nice.

591
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,120
Put your things down first.

592
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,490
My room is next to yours.

593
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,250
Take a break.

594
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,800
We'll go grab some food later.

595
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,840
Sure.

596
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,760
I'm hungry.

597
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,520
See you later.

598
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,360
Okay, see you.

599
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:22,930
Please enjoy.

600
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:23,600
Thank you.

601
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:24,650
Thank you.

602
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:25,690
Cheers!

603
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,930
Tang Xin, look,
there's a souvenir booth over there.

604
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,280
Let's check it out.

605
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,490
- Come on.
- There.

606
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,982
I want to get something for my husband.

607
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,150
Haven't seen him in a few days,
and I really miss him.

608
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,250
And you want to open a shop here?

609
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,248
Just bring him along
and open it together.

610
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,930
Officer, how many
times do I have to say it?

611
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,160
That thing isn't mine!

612
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,930
This is your bag, right?

613
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,120
Yes, it's mine.

614
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,450
What is this then?

615
00:30:10,782 --> 00:30:11,650
How should I know?

616
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,250
I told you, the bag is mine,

617
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,520
but that isn't.

618
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,930
Please come with us to the
station for further investigation.

619
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:17,730
Let's go.

620
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,690
Officer, please listen,

621
00:30:20,715 --> 00:30:22,120
I'm a reporter with Minghua News.

622
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,270
I've got my press
credentials in my bag. I can show you.

623
00:30:24,271 --> 00:30:25,560
I'm here with a friend!

624
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,715
She just went to the restroom!

625
00:30:26,737 --> 00:30:28,280
Liu Qi!

626
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,040
Wu Si?

627
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,170
What are you doing here?

628
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:34,730
Please talk to them.

629
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,626
They're insisting there's
contraband in my bag.

630
00:30:36,671 --> 00:30:37,582
Officer,

631
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,890
you'd trust a soldier, wouldn't you?

632
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,690
Ask him, he knows me.

633
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,560
I'm his girlfriend!

634
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,280
Honey...

635
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,840
Honey,

636
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,250
they're about to take me away.

637
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,970
Say something, will you?

638
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:02,730
Sir,

639
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:05,320
we're just doing our job.
We hope you understand.

640
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:07,970
Wu Si?

641
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,170
Wu Si? Hang on...

642
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,010
Wu Si?

643
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:13,730
Let them through.

644
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,490
Wu Si!

645
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:15,410
You...

646
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:18,210
Say something! Don't you know me?

647
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,890
Wu Si!

648
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,840
Say something! Are you serious?

649
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,960
Did she just say
she was your girlfriend?

650
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,730
Captain Tang's daughter.

651
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:36,890
Who?

652
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,490
Captain Tang's daughter?

653
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:41,210
Shouldn't we try to do
something to help her then?

654
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,760
You think I don't want to help?

655
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,930
We have to figure out
what's going on first.

656
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:49,671
Yes, Sir.

657
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,660
(Press Card)

658
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,140
(Tang Xin, Minghua News)

659
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,120
Explain now,

660
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,650
why would a reporter

661
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,040
have contraband in her bag?

662
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,970
Officer,

663
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:12,520
I've explained this many times
on the way here.

664
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,040
That stuff is not mine.

665
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,410
Whose is it then?

666
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,693
How did it end up in your bag?

667
00:32:16,693 --> 00:32:17,930
How would I know?

668
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,730
Someone must've slipped it in

669
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:20,890
when I wasn't looking.

670
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:22,250
Why would someone do that?

671
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,280
Isn't it obvious?

672
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,730
I must've pissed someone off.

673
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:28,360
In our line of work, it happens.

674
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,250
You step on toes now and then.

675
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,970
We want to believe you,

676
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,320
but until we have evidence, you'll need

677
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,760
to cooperate with the investigation.

678
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,800
Got it. I'll cooperate.

679
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,182
Sir, I'd like to ask you something.

680

(Sea Story)

681
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,930
That girl who was just
taken away by the police...

682
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:48,840
What happened?

683
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,970
What did she do?

684
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,360
You know her?

685
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,390
Yes.

686
00:32:52,448 --> 00:32:54,071
She's the daughter
of our former captain.

687
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,250
I know her case.

688
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,210
She's suspected of
possessing contraband.

689
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,370
She's now being
questioned by the police.

690
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,930
Possessing contraband?

691
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,650
Captain Huang,

692
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,040
I know her.

693
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,800
She wouldn't hide anything illegal.

694
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,760
Someone must've
planted it to set her up.

695
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:10,280
Words alone won't clear her.

696
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,520
We need evidence.

697
00:33:15,071 --> 00:33:16,730
Captain Wu, what are you looking for?

698
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:17,690
Security cameras?

699
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,210
Don't bother.

700
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,382
I know this place well.

701
00:33:20,382 --> 00:33:21,848
There aren't any cameras here.

702
00:34:09,937 --> 00:34:11,870
(For Police Network Use Only)
Officer Han,

703
00:34:11,871 --> 00:34:13,200
this is footage from a dashcam

704
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,040
near the scene.

705
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:15,080
Okay.

706
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,160
Slow it down, Officer Han.

707
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,970
That man in the footage, Captain Huang.

708
00:34:28,271 --> 00:34:29,160
Right at that moment,

709
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,520
he's slipping unidentified items

710
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,200
into Miss Tang's bag.

711
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:56,560
What are you doing here?

712
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,450
I took time off from the unit.

713
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:00,080
I'm here to pick you up.

714
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,200
(Police)

715
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,720
Coming to pick me up in the morning?

716
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,448
You just want to see me
embarrassed, right?

717
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:05,200
Let me ask you,

718
00:35:05,493 --> 00:35:07,560
when the police took me away,
I called out to you.

719
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,770
Why didn't you help me?

720
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:09,850
What was I supposed to do?

721
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,093
Snatch you back from the police?

722
00:35:11,137 --> 00:35:12,970
But you knew I was innocent!

723
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,640
I did.

724
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,640
But the police need evidence.

725
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,520
You could've at least told them

726
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,240
you knew me,

727
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,970
that I'm not a criminal, right?

728
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,890
Didn't you already tell them that?

729
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,200
You were yelling it loud enough.

730
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,200
Yes, you heard me,

731
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,490
and you didn't help me.

732
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,080
I'll apologize to you.

733
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,290
Miss Tang...

734
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,810
Save it.

735
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,120
But

736
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:42,770
you can tell me

737
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:44,640
who was involved in
the Dayan Reef Rescue.

738
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:45,850
No way.

739
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,579
Then your apology means nothing.

740
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,715
It means something,
but it doesn't override principle.

741
00:35:49,715 --> 00:35:51,820
Oh, so it's principle now
to let the cops haul me away?

742
00:35:51,826 --> 00:35:53,120
You know, thanks to you,

743
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,599
I've been detained twice.

744
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,040
If they hadn't found the evidence,

745
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,600
I'd be getting slapped
with drug charges right now.

746
00:35:59,337 --> 00:36:01,290
Would you take responsibility
if I went to jail?

747
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,600
Would you take care of my parents?

748
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,110
If my future kids couldn't get
a government job because of this,

749
00:36:05,115 --> 00:36:06,248
would you help them?

750
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,290
Miss Tang,

751
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,330
let me break it down for you.

752
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:13,560
First, it was the police
who took you in,

753
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,330
because there was

754
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:16,120
suspicious contraband in your bag.

755
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,410
Second, if you're in possession
of that kind of material,

756
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,080
you are a suspect, period.

757
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,240
Third, you won't go to jail,

758
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:24,080
because I will find the evidence.

759
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,810
No "what ifs."

760
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,560
You're even "breaking it down"
to me right now?

761
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,120
However,

762
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,680
impersonating a soldier's girlfriend

763
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,893
and resisting arrest in public?

764
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,850
That's enough to land
you a few days in detention.

765
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,770
While you're learning your lesson
at the station,

766
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:39,120
I'll take good care of
Captain Tang and your mom.

767
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:40,370
As for your future kids,

768
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:41,848
we can worry about their job prospects

769
00:36:41,848 --> 00:36:42,720
after you have one.

770
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,720
Wu Si!

771
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,640
Wu Si...

772
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,490
Come on, please just tell me.

773
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,270
I need to find the person
who saved me...

774
00:36:52,271 --> 00:36:53,330
It's really important.

775
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,640
Whatever kind of help you need,

776
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,720
start by speaking normally.

777
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,010
Fine.

778
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,890
Alright, back to the point.

779
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,080
Whether you accept it or not,

780
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,600
I owe you an apology.

781
00:37:05,804 --> 00:37:07,026
But now I have work to do.

782
00:37:07,048 --> 00:37:08,604
I have to return to my unit. Bye.

783
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,080
No! You can't just leave!

784
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,770
You let the police drag me off

785
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:12,890
in front of everyone that day!

786
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:13,930
I was humiliated!

787
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,450
What do you want me to do then?

788
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,515
I've told my parents

789
00:37:23,515 --> 00:37:25,680
that we're still getting
to know each other.

790
00:37:25,737 --> 00:37:28,382
Even if it's just pretend, don't we
at least make it look believable?

791
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,290
Make it look believable?

792
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,490
Let's meet this weekend.

793
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,850
Mr. Han.

794
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:58,120
Mr. Han, you called for me?

795
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,600
I need you to trace

796
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,330
the owner of this email account.

797
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:07,720
The sooner, the better.

798
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,720
Also,

799
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:13,040
keep this among us for now.

800
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,240
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

801
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:14,930
Go on.

802
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,740
(Inbox)

803
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:38,160
Dad, Mom, I'm home.

804
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,930
Where have you been?

805
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600
Baitun Bay.

806
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,370
What were you doing there?

807
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,040
I was there for a vacation.

808
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,490
Vacation in the police station?

809
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,770
How did you guys find out?

810
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,810
Wang Lang called earlier,
asking if you were back yet.

811
00:38:58,515 --> 00:38:59,410
Dad, I'm telling you,

812
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:00,982
this time it really wasn't my fault.

813
00:39:01,026 --> 00:39:01,970
I was framed.

814
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,890
Right, you're always being framed.

815
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,160
His unit was out there on duty.

816
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,200
Why did you disturb him?

817
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,120
I disturbed him?

818
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,810
I just ran into him, okay?

819
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,720
It was totally a coincidence.

820
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:16,010
I didn't even know
they were out on a mission there.

821
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,010
Good thing you didn't get in their way.

822
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,471
If Wu Si had brought you back,

823
00:39:19,493 --> 00:39:21,040
I would've sent you back
to the station

824
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,520
and let them lock
you up for a few days.

825
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:22,970
Go on then!

826
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:23,560
Take me back

827
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,520
right now.

828
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,560
Tough mouth, soft heart.

829
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,080
I'm going to bed.

830
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:30,720
Didn't sleep a wink last night.

831
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,640
I'll be in my room, Mom.

832
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,080
Alright now.

833
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:42,490
My finger is stuck again.

834
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,450
100 more.

835
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,240
Hang in there.

836
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,930
Squad Leader Zhou,
didn't you owe me a bottle of water?

837
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,471
Once we're done with this, we're even.

838
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,450
Stand up!

839
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,490
Where is Yi Nanwang?

840
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:18,450
Sir,

841
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:19,970
Captain took him.

842
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:20,970
What's going on?

843
00:40:21,048 --> 00:40:23,560
Now we have to compete just
to give the rookie extra training?

844
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,426
I finished putting together
a whole training plan.

845
00:40:25,426 --> 00:40:26,640
We even had snacks prepped.

846
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,600
Still waiting in line.

847
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:29,600
Yi Nanwang's entire schedule

848
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,093
is booked until the day after tomorrow.

849
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,550
Tomorrow has assigned to Captain Cheng.

850
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,048
Then he's mine the day after tomorrow.

851
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,020
No, he's mine that day.

852
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,250
You'll get him next time.

853
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:47,120
Captain!

854
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:48,520
Sit!

855
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,970
How are you?

856
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:53,370
I'm fine, Captain. Just a minor injury.

857
00:40:58,493 --> 00:41:00,204
Switch to a different drill
this afternoon.

858
00:41:00,248 --> 00:41:01,137
Yes, Sir.

859
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,040
Thanks, Captain.

860
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,080
Captain,

861
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,930
am I the worst soldier
you've ever trained?

862
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,720
I don't train bad soldiers.

863
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:16,930
You're not bad at all.

864
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:19,370
You've just never
been put in the right role.

865
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:24,040
I'm not even sure
what role I am right for.

866
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,410
Why are you being dispirited?

867
00:41:27,626 --> 00:41:30,204
Have you forgotten what you did
the day I came to your unit

868
00:41:30,204 --> 00:41:31,490
to pick recruits?

869
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:45,450
What do you want?

870
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,040
Captain Wu,

871
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,770
I'd like to join Blue Blade!

872
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:52,160
I have to join Blue Blade!

873
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,930
I remember, Captain.

874
00:41:59,671 --> 00:42:00,890
I meant every word back then.

875
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:02,330
And I meant it when I picked you

876
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:03,640
