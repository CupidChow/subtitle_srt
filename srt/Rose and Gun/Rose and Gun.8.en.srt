18
00:01:48,537 --> 00:01:49,960
I'll go to the bow to take a look.

19
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,480
I'm taking pictures of the sea.

20
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:20,720
I won't block you then.
Take the pictures.

21
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,370
You can stand there.

22
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,010
It's okay.

23
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:48,440
I'm taking pictures of the sea.

24
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,240
(City Meteorological Observatory
issued a yellow thunderstorm warning.)

25
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,720
The wind is coming.

26
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Let's go back.

27
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,920
Okay.

28
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,570
So much fuss.

29
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,640
Okay, let's have a drink together.

30
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,640
See you tonight.

31
00:03:41,226 --> 00:03:42,004
Mr. Han.

32
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,040
The female reporter
rented a fishing boat

33
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,480
with a man and went out to sea.

34
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,810
They should be
heading toward Dayan Reef.

35
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,250
But they're unlucky.
The wind is picking up at sea,

36
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,640
so they turned back.

37
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,570
What does the man who went to sea

38
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,200
with her do?

39
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,530
It's unclear at the moment.

40
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,693
I'll check it out immediately.

41
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,715
(Tang Xin: Captain Wu, thank you for today.)

42
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,640
You asked me to come in such a hurry,

43
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,560
yet you're on your phone
as soon as I'm here.

44
00:04:52,604 --> 00:04:53,960
Tell me what happened.

45
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,520
Today,

46
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,930
Zong Qing

47
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,250
proposed to me.

48
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,690
Aren't you going to say you found a job?

49
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,280
Why did you get proposed?

50
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,960
What's this reaction?

51
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,280
Shouldn't you be happy for me?

52
00:05:17,293 --> 00:05:19,200
Isn't marriage
more important than finding a job?

53
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,370
What's going on?

54
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,170
Why did you get proposed suddenly?

55
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,640
He proposed to me
when the time was right.

56
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,200
You said yes?

57
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,200
Why not?

58
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,960
What I hate the most

59
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,200
is draggy relationships.

60
00:05:33,204 --> 00:05:35,160
You're just wasting
other people's time and your own.

61
00:05:36,204 --> 00:05:38,520
I want a relationship that goes all in
from the start.

62
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,400
Love at first sight,

63
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,640
propose, get married,

64
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,170
and live happily ever after.

65
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,250
Lan Yangyang.

66
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,690
Do you really want to get married?

67
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,440
Tell me the truth.

68
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,960
How far have you and Zong Qing

69
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,690
gotten?

70
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,930
What are you thinking?

71
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,960
You think we got married
because I'm pregnant, are you?

72
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,130
No, absolutely not.

73
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,520
I just want to marry Zong Qing.

74
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,170
Is it so hard to understand

75
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,337
that I want to marry for love?

76
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,320
Put your love aside for now.

77
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,570
Marriage is different from dating.

78
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,000
There are a lot of real-world issues.

79
00:06:10,004 --> 00:06:11,170
Have you thought it through?

80
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,520
I've thought it through.

81
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,760
I'll tell my parents later.

82
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,400
Tomorrow, I'll go wedding dress
and wedding ring shopping.

83
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,320
Speaking of,

84
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,840
I have something else to tell you.

85
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,730
Bridesmaid duties.

86
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,010
Just being a bridesmaid

87
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,930
is a waste of talent

88
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,730
for Miss Tang.

89
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,010
I also want you

90
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,400
to help me plan
the most romantic wedding in the world.

91
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,370
Help me prepare everything

92
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,490
for the beach, forest

93
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,640
and meadow-style venues.

94
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,570
Handle the arrangements.

95
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,250
By the way,

96
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,370
I also want to prepare

97
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,960
a confession video for the wedding.

98
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,730
Of course

99
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:52,960
I'm counting

100
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,760
on my favorite Miss Tang for this.

101
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,520
I need you to put
that dream wedding on hold

102
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,930
for now.

103
00:06:58,982 --> 00:07:01,050
Let me ask you.
How many relationships have you had?

104
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,080
Just this time, right?

105
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,050
You couldn't even tell
that someone had a crush on you.

106
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,170
Zong Qing's

107
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,570
dating experience probably

108
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,880
isn't much different
from yours.

109
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,610
How dare you two get a shotgun wedding?

110
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,010
One dared to propose
and the other dared to say yes.

111
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,840
Tang Xin.

112
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,690
You're a buzzkill.

113
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,170
Either way, I won't regret it.

114
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,490
As long as Zong Qing is around,

115
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,810
I'm not afraid of anything.

116
00:07:36,537 --> 00:07:37,930
Why are you looking at me like that?

117
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,930
Did I misjudge you?

118
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,810
Lan Yangyang, you're so cool.

119
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,490
I don't care.

120
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,880
You're now

121
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,130
my wedding planner.

122
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,280
When did she start dating?

123
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,320
How come we don't know?

124
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,315
We really don't know
when she started dating.

125
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,570
They were having a secret relationship.

126
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,610
Besides you two,

127
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,182
Mr. Lan and his wife don't know either.

128
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,390
Let's see how Lan Yangyang explains it
when she gets home.

129
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,960
Lan Weiguo is so lucky.

130
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,840
He just sits at home

131
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,370
and somehow gains a son-in-law.

132
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,080
Dad, what's that stance?

133
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,170
Why do you seem relieved?

134
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,200
Does my expression seem relieved?

135
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,880
Hey, my little troublemaker.

136
00:08:20,093 --> 00:08:21,960
If you're half as easy to deal with
as Yangyang,

137
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,320
I'll be relieved.

138
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,170
Look at Yangyang.

139
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,880
She quietly pulled off something huge.

140
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,880
What about you?

141
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,160
Have you and Wu Si

142
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,280
- met?
- Dad.

143
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,010
Have you contacted him?

144
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,090
I'm a career-oriented woman.

145
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,970
I don't have the time to contact him.

146
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,280
I'll go.

147
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,640
Career-oriented?

148
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,760
Yes.

149
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,610
Dad.

150
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,680
Mom.

151
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,210
I'll formally report it to you.

152
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,400
This is Big Big Wolf.

153
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,560
His name is Zong Qing.

154
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,450
He's from the Marine Corps.

155
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,730
Blue Blade Special Ops Team
in the Marine Corps.

156
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,490
Yes.

157
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,382
He's excellent. He joined the Party
in his second year of enlistment.

158
00:09:27,426 --> 00:09:29,382
He's also been awarded
third-class merit twice.

159
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,210
He even saved a child from drowning
before proposing.

160
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,400
When I first met him,

161
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,850
I liked him very much.

162
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,800
I think he's handsome. Just like...

163
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,010
Just like Dad when he was young.

164
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,160
He understands me, is protective of me,

165
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,730
tolerates me and treats me well.

166
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,730
That's why I'm willing to marry him.

167
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,560
Mom and Dad.

168
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,250
Say something.

169
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,450
We're serious.

170
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:06,850
You...

171
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,400
What do you want us to say?

172
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
You're serious?

173
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,130
It's a big deal.

174
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,004
You can't just go ahead
and tell us afterward.

175
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,090
But it happened suddenly.

176
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,130
I won't regret it anyway.

177
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,850
And I never will.

178
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,130
I really...

179
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:29,610
Yangyang.

180
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:32,970
I'm sorry.

181
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,370
I

182
00:10:34,782 --> 00:10:36,271
shouldn't have looked at your phone.

183
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,370
Dad.

184
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,370
Don't do this.

185
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,370
I was wrong.

186
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,800
I shouldn't have
kept delaying the job search

187
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,800
and not told you
that I have a boyfriend.

188
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,130
I shouldn't have decided to get engaged
without asking you.

189
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:53,730
I've

190
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,010
figured out what you should do

191
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,010
after graduation.

192
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,970
You should have

193
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,280
the right to choose
your own future and career.

194
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,970
But what I don't understand

195
00:11:06,026 --> 00:11:07,515
is why you have never told us

196
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,610
what you actually want

197
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,130
after so many years?

198
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,610
You

199
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,160
didn't even tell us
about something as important

200
00:11:16,226 --> 00:11:17,626
as dating or getting engaged.

201
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,010
We're not old-fashioned parents.

202
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,130
We're not against you dating freely,

203
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,250
but we can't just entrust our daughter

204
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,730
to a man

205
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,920
whom we haven't even formally met.

206
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,760
Have you thought it through?

207
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:37,970
I'm willful, spoiled,

208
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,880
jobless

209
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,130
and can't do housework.

210
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,090
- I don't care.
- I don't care.

211
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,090
- Marry me!
- Marry me!

212
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,130
You've nailed the imitation.

213
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,560
- Yes, of course.
- Yes.

214
00:11:49,937 --> 00:11:51,370
- Did I imitate him well?
- Yes.

215
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,800
- Marry me!
- Marry me!

216
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,040
Dad.

217
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,920
Whether it's my career choice

218
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,760
or relationship,

219
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,130
I've never thought

220
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,800
about deliberately hiding it from you.

221
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,490
I was really scared to tell you.

222
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,680
I know you still consider me a child,

223
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,160
arranging this and that for me.

224
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,130
But I have grown up.

225
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,040
I want to go my own way now.

226
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,680
Like Xin.

227
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,370
Like Zong Qing.

228
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,610
Do what I want to do.

229
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,010
Marry the one I love.

230
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,920
Do you understand

231
00:12:40,915 --> 00:12:42,730
what being in a military marriage
involves?

232
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,850
Do you know what it means

233
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,250
to marry a frontline soldier?

234
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,160
Do you know the consequences
of an impulsive marriage?

235
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,280
You just graduated.

236
00:12:54,626 --> 00:12:56,560
Zong Qing has just been enlisted
for a few years.

237
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,370
Have you two

238
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,250
really prepared yourselves
for the future?

239
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,680
Married life

240
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,040
isn't as romantic as you imagine.

241
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:06,800
You...

242
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,370
Are you capable of handling it?

243
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,280
Dad.

244
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,280
I didn't have time
to consider all of that,

245
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,370
but I'm sure that Zong Qing is the one.

246
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,680
He's kind, dependable, and responsible.

247
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,010
He loves his job.

248
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,040
He also loves
the honor of being a soldier.

249
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,010
He loves me more.

250
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,370
So I believe him.

251
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,680
I'm not afraid of anything.

252
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:53,730
Move back home.

253
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,160
Stop staying in someone else's house.

254
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,130
It's inappropriate.

255
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,400
Yangyang.

256
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,280
Come here.

257
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,730
Do you really want

258
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,210
to marry a soldier?

259
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,640
I want to marry Zong Qing.

260
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,800
You've grown up.

261
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:43,970
You've grown up.

262
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,004
I'll congratulate you first.

263
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,370
Hello, Miss Tang?

264
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,130
What's wrong?

265
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,210
Captain Wu.

266
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:18,490
Today,

267
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,730
Zong Qing proposed to Yangyang.

268
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:22,040
You knew about this, right?

269
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,160
Yes.

270
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,490
What do you think?

271
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,760
I agree, of course.

272
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,760
Both parties are willing.

273
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,680
What can I say?

274
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,010
What? You have an issue with it?

275
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,330
It's not that I have an issue.

276
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,610
But marriage is a big deal.

277
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,370
I have to help her
screen him a little more.

278
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,610
Zong Qing is my subordinate,

279
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,210
but I will never favor him.

280
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,490
Whether

281
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,250
in life or at work,

282
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,610
he's exceptional

283
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,210
in terms of ability and character.

284
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,370
He's from a wealthy family,

285
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,130
but he's not pampered.

286
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,610
He's willing
to work hard and study hard.

287
00:15:55,626 --> 00:15:56,970
He's not arrogant, not selfish,

288
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:57,730
and is kind.

289
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,370
If he sets his mind to something,

290
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,250
he'll make it happen.

291
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:01,970
The same goes
for the person he has chosen.

292
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,850
He hasn't known Yangyang
for a long time,

293
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,330
but he's been dating
with marriage in mind.

294
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,130
He proposed
only after careful consideration.

295
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:12,471
He wants to settle down
with the person he loves.

296
00:16:13,026 --> 00:16:14,090
It wasn't an impulse.

297
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,610
And you said you didn't favor him?

298
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,450
All you've done is list his strengths.

299
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,490
Doesn't he have any flaws?

300
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,680
He does.

301
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,250
He's a soldier.

302
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,370
A soldier on the front line.

303
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,850
A soldier who leads troops.

304
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,130
A soldier who goes to the battlefield.

305
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,010
A soldier who can't stay
with the one he loves.

306
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:40,450
Besides that,

307
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:41,970
I can't think of any other flaws.

308
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:44,850
Got it.

309
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,850
How is it? Has he passed the vetting?

310
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,400
He passed for now.

311
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,250
For now?

312
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,370
He passed then.

313
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,850
Captain Wu, good night.

314
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,450
I never thought

315
00:17:13,293 --> 00:17:15,026
being a soldier was a flaw.

316
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:21,970
Weiguo.

317
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,760
Just say what's on your mind.

318
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,360
Don't hold it in.

319
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,840
The two of us

320
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,210
dated secretly

321
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,970
for five years.

322
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,650
Things aren't the same
as they used to be.

323
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,490
These kids...

324
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,800
Sounds to me

325
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,560
like you disapprove.

326
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,840
No.

327
00:17:48,182 --> 00:17:49,360
I'm not optimistic about it.

328
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,250
They're young

329
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,600
and have only been dating
for a short while.

330
00:17:54,737 --> 00:17:56,450
Yet they're already
talking about marriage.

331
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,250
Have they thought about their future?

332
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,010
You know best

333
00:18:06,693 --> 00:18:08,450
how tough it is to be a soldier's wife.

334
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,210
We pampered Yangyang
since she was little.

335
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,600
Can she bear the grievances
you've suffered?

336
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,650
Besides, Zong Qing is my subordinate.

337
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,271
I feel sorry for my subordinates too.

338
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,890
We spoiled her.

339
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,010
Can she handle
being the wife of a soldier?

340
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,210
After hearing everything Yangyang said,

341
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,080
I think Zong Qing's

342
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,120
quite brilliant.

343
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,010
He's young and ambitious.

344
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,730
Didn't he save
a child who fell into the water?

345
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,010
He seems decent.

346
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,200
(Role Evaluation Mobilization Meeting)

347
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,080
Two, three, four.

348
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,320
One, two, three.

349
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,040
Hurry up!

350
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,760
The minefield has been marked.

351
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,890
I was running some errands nearby,

352
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,600
so I stopped by to see you.

353
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:17,930
Sorry, Mr. Han.

354
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,320
I've been really busy lately.

355
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,930
I said I'd treat you
to a meal last time,

356
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:21,970
but I never got the chance.

357
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:22,840
This isn't important.

358
00:21:23,204 --> 00:21:25,426
How's the investigation
into the sunken ship relics

359
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,040
coming along?

360
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,210
We went out to sea twice in a row

361
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,320
but found nothing.

362
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,410
I guess
even the whistleblower doesn't think

363
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,840
I can keep investigating.

364
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:38,930
Well.

365
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:39,930
How about this?

366
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:41,930
If you don't mind,

367
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,210
give me the email address.

368
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:44,450
I'll help you investigate.

369
00:21:44,715 --> 00:21:45,715
One way or another,

370
00:21:45,715 --> 00:21:47,450
my family has some social connections.

371
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:50,210
It'll be a lot easier for me
than for you.

372
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,930
Mr. Han, here's the thing.

373
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,800
There are some unspoken rules

374
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,800
in our line of work.

375
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:59,040
Besides, he gave me very little info

376
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,040
to begin with.

377
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:04,010
But I appreciate your kindness.

378
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,520
If I ever need it,

379
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:06,970
I hope you'll help me.

380
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,040
No problem.

381
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,930
If you need anything, just let me know.

382
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,800
Thank you.

383
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:14,840
Don't mention it.

384
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,020
(Obey and Follow the Party, Win Fights,
Uphold Strict Discipline and Conduct)

385
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:19,970
At ease.

386
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,360
Attention.

387
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,690
Chief.

388
00:22:27,048 --> 00:22:28,250
Blue Blade Special Ops Team's

389
00:22:28,293 --> 00:22:29,960
members for the evaluation
are in position.

390
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,040
Your instructions, please.

391
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:31,730
Let's get started.

392
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:32,320
Yes.

393
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,410
The evaluation scenario is

394
00:22:36,537 --> 00:22:38,600
that our troops
have been ordered to seize H Island.

395
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,760
The troops have landed on the beach,

396
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,760
but they're suppressed
by the enemy's heavy artillery.

397
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,700
We need to call the fleet
for artillery support.

398
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,860
The enemy destroyed
our communication equipment.

399
00:22:50,048 --> 00:22:51,071
The beach assault team

400
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,740
is in urgent need
to get in touch with the troops.

401
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,860
You are ordered
to restore communications immediately.

402
00:22:56,871 --> 00:22:57,671
Do you understand?

403
00:22:57,693 --> 00:22:58,337
- Yes!
- Yes!

404
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,980
To better align

405
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,660
with actual combat demands,

406
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,660
this evaluation is given orally,

407
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,660
but everything

408
00:23:05,782 --> 00:23:08,180
must be completed to the standards
of an actual combat drill.

409
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,460
You will encounter many difficulties

410
00:23:11,204 --> 00:23:12,660
that you need to solve on your own.

411
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,740
This mission is led by Zong Qing.

412
00:23:16,337 --> 00:23:17,660
Wu Si will supervise from behind.

413
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,660
- Yes.
- Yes.

414
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,180
The evaluation begins.

415
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,580
Yes.

416
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,580
Wu Si, present the tasks.

417
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:46,940
Yes.

418
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,420
All units, stand by.

419
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,420
Move in an S-shape to evade fire.

420
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,260
Please respond quickly.

421
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,740
- Roger.
- Roger.

422
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,340
Unit A1, attention.

423
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,700
Your assault boat
has been hit by shrapnel.

424
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:54,620
It lost power
and is unable to move forward.

425
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:58,026
Time is running out. Please find another way
to reach the island as soon as possible.

426
00:24:58,515 --> 00:24:59,271
Stop the boat.

427
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,500
Sink the assault boat completely.

428
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,020
Yes.

429
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,220
Unit A1, attention.

430
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,140
Your assault boat
has been completely sunk.

431
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,420
Jump into the sea before it sinks.

432
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:29,900
Hurry.

433
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,020
Wang Chen,
our assault boat has been sunk.

434
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,420
Quickly return to help.

435
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,380
Turn around to save them!

436
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,900
They cooperated quite well.

437
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,380
Blue Blade is quite professional.

438
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,180
Being professional alone isn't enough.

439
00:26:59,471 --> 00:27:00,940
The battlefield is unpredictable.

440
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,100
Being able to deal with sudden changes

441
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,380
is more important.

442
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,893
Implement electromagnetic interference
immediately.

443
00:27:06,915 --> 00:27:07,560
Yes!

444
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,380
Implement
strong electromagnetic interference.

445
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,700
Huang Shan.

446
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,700
Set it upright.

447
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,940
Huang Shan.

448
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,100
Please reply if you copy.

449
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,700
What's going on?

450
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,420
The enemy activated
strong electromagnetic interference.

451
00:27:39,426 --> 00:27:40,600
We can't get any signal out.

452
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,260
Then we can't restore communications

453
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,940
within the time limit.

454
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:47,980
How about this?

455
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,020
We use flag signals

456
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,760
to convey information to the mothership.

457
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:52,980
It's too far.

458
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,360
It may be difficult for the mothership
to see the flag signals.

459
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,180
Wang Chen, put the radio away.

460
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:58,940
Yes.

461
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,020
Send the flag signals.

462
00:28:01,115 --> 00:28:02,626
I'll relay the message from the sea.

463
00:28:02,693 --> 00:28:03,293
Understood.

464
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,620
Dai Wei.

465
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,500
There are only three minutes left.

466
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,220
What are they doing?

467
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,220
Chief.

468
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,500
The situation is still unclear.

469
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,340
Let's wait and see the final result.

470
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,380
Reporting, Chief.

471
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,500
Blue Blade team
has contacted the mothership.

472
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,560
The coordinates
of the heavy artillery are

473
00:29:16,626 --> 00:29:18,660
X56781, Y78234.

474
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,700
Wang Lang.

475
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,260
Yes.

476
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,740
They say a capable commander
leads strong troops.

477
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,740
With all the traps we set,

478
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,620
Blue Blade completed their mission

479
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,220
at the last moment.

480
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,220
Thank you for the compliment.

481
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,420
Dad, what are you doing? You scared me.

482
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,940
What's going on?

483
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,980
Bring that guy over

484
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,020
sometime

485
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,580
so we can meet.

486
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,660
What guy?

487
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,180
Zong Qing.

488
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,580
You're great, Dad.

489
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,980
I know you're the best.

490
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,100
Alright.

491
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,860
You're eating junk food again.

492
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,700
I love it.

493
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,026
I'll throw it all away tomorrow.

494
00:30:43,048 --> 00:30:44,380
Don't. Please don't.

495
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,820
Really, stop eating it.

496
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,100
Okay, I'll stop.

497
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,980
Alright.

498
00:30:47,982 --> 00:30:49,180
I have something else to do.

499
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,700
Go on then.

500
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,260
Okay.

501
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,180
Love you.

502
00:30:54,493 --> 00:30:55,340
Right back at you.

503
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,220
What's the status of the last payment?

504
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,180
We might have to wait
another two or three days.

505
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,740
Keep an eye on it.

506
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:12,980
Mr. Han.

507
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,580
What's the matter?

508
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,700
Here's the thing.

509
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,980
I've identified
the person who went out to sea

510
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,980
with Tang Xin.

511
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,100
Who is it?

512
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,100
It can't be the police.

513
00:31:25,893 --> 00:31:28,620
I saw him in a military uniform and
going in and out of the military camp.

514
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,826
I believe his name is Wu Si.

515
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,580
The other details are still unknown.

516
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,140
He's a soldier?

517
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,020
Wu Si.

518
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,660
Anything else?

519
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,140
Not for now.

520
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,460
Leave.

521
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,140
Yes.

522
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,180
Ms. Zhou.

523
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,820
Do you remember

524
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,380
someone called Wu Tongshu?

525
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,660
You mean

526
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,620
the undercover police?

527
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:11,820
Yes.

528
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,420
Wu Si...

529
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,220
Wu Tongshu...

530
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,460
Look into how they're connected.

531
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,420
Got it, Mr. Han.

532
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,420
Captain Wu.

533
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:41,700
You're back.

534
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,460
Is your lesson over?

535
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,180
Do you like it?

536
00:32:46,582 --> 00:32:47,620
How about you have it?

537
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,820
No.

538
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,180
Who else but you could handle

539
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,620
Miss Tang's publicity and reception?

540
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,420
Do you need something?
Run circles if you don't.

541
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,340
I do.
Can't I come to you if I got nothing?

542
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,500
Help me choose one.

543
00:33:01,782 --> 00:33:03,940
Cheng Yuan and those bumpkins
have no sense of style.

544
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:05,860
Is it okay?

545
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,140
I know fashion?

546
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,660
You

547
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,180
asked a self-humiliating question.

548
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,660
Forget it.

549
00:33:16,671 --> 00:33:17,940
You're the least terrible option.

550
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,460
Can you help me out?

551
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,620
Take a look. White is refined.

552
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,940
Take a look.

553
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,582
Stop clinging to me, okay?

554
00:33:25,582 --> 00:33:28,220
You weren't even like this for the proposal.
Why are you being so vain?

555
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,980
Captain, this is more important
than proposing.

556
00:33:29,982 --> 00:33:30,980
Just help me, okay?

557
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:32,560
Find joy in helping others.

558
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:35,026
If white isn't okay, what about stripes?

559
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:35,980
Stripes look...

560
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,940
Unknown caller.

561
00:33:39,248 --> 00:33:41,160
Probably just a telemarketer.
I'll end it for you.

562
00:33:41,182 --> 00:33:41,660
Attention.

563
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,448
Wear your military uniform.
It looks the best.

564
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,382
Yeah, why didn't I think of that?

565
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,940
I take it back.

566
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,940
You're a general among the bad options.

567
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,540
Tang Xin.

568
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:09,900
Captain Wu.

569
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,940
Why did you call me suddenly?

570
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,260
Nothing.

571
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:17,220
I wonder if I can come over
for an interview tomorrow.

572
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,820
Yes, come by anytime.

573
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,540
Okay.

574
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,020
Let me know anytime

575
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,860
if you need help.

576
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,900
I'll sort it out.

577
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,020
Any help?

578
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,020
Yes.

579
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,860
I hope you'll have my back

580
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,220
during tomorrow's interview.

581
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,260
Don't sneak off again like last time.

582
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,780
I'll stay with you.

583
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,420
Any other questions?

584
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,740
Also...

585
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,420
Nothing. See you tomorrow.

586
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,260
Also,

587
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,260
I really want to know

588
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,780
if you were the one
who saved me at Dayan Reef...

589
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,020
I hope it was you.

590
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,500
Dad.

591
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,260
Mom.

592
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,780
You're not eating?

593
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,420
No, I'm trying to lose weight.
I'll go back to my room.

594
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,140
You...

595
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,820
You're skipping meals
just to lose weight.

596
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:29,620
It's time for dinner.

597
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,820
Come chat with us

598
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,940
for a bit.

599
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,740
Yeah.

600
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,020
I'm a little tired.

601
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,420
I want to go back and lie down.

602
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,026
I have to go to the military camp
for an interview tomorrow morning.

603
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,940
Is Wu Si going to be
at tomorrow's interview

604
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,620
at the military camp?

605
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,620
Is he?

606
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,380
I guess so.

607
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,426
Why don't you
take advantage of this opportunity

608
00:35:53,493 --> 00:35:54,715
to spend some time together?

609
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,004
How are you two getting along?

610
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,420
Well...

611
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,380
It's alright. It's been good.

612
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,380
How is it good? Hurry and tell us.

613
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,780
Well.

614
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,020
Everything has been pretty good.

615
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,500
If it's been pretty good, hurry up then.

616
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,740
You're killing us with the suspense.

617
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,460
I can't rush it.

618
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,780
It's not like I can see or touch him
right now anyway.

619
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,420
Are you embarrassed?

620
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,940
It's not like you.

621
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,780
Who's embarrassed? Dad.

622
00:36:24,937 --> 00:36:25,980
Alright, I'm done talking.

623
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,730
I'm going back
to work on my interview script.

624
00:36:27,737 --> 00:36:28,226
Enjoy dinner.

625
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,420
I think there's a chance.

626
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,420
Maybe they'll really set sail.

627
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,260
Look at her.

628
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,460
She was blushing.

629
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,460
Great.

630
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,500
It's great.

631
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,220
Where are they?

632
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,260
No idea.

633
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,340
I only saw Yi Nanwang when I came in.

634
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,500
He was eating super fast.

635
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,780
I wonder what he's up to next.

636
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,780
It's a bit strange.

637
00:37:00,626 --> 00:37:02,740
You not going home on the weekend
is strange too.

638
00:37:03,293 --> 00:37:04,826
I have some work to do back at the unit.

639
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:05,980
Zijian will pick me up later.

640
00:37:06,671 --> 00:37:08,020
I don't care when he picks you up.

641
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,271
Your leave is approved anyway.

642
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:10,220
Have a great weekend.

643
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,420
Thanks, Captain.

644
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:23,980
Hello, Mom?

645
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:25,980
Zijian.

646
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,540
Where did your work trip take you?

647
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,300
It's been so long.

648
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,780
Mom, this time I...

649
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,460
This time
I've got to go to several places.

650
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,260
It'll take a while.

651
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,860
You're acting weird.

652
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,260
What's going on?

653
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,140
I'll tell you the truth.

654
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,620
Lately I've been

655
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,380
busy with a job transfer.

656
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,740
I'm planning to transfer
to Wenzhou Marine Museum.

657
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,290
You're transferring to Wenzhou?

658
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,370
That's a big deal.

659
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,740
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

660
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,980
I didn't want you to worry.

661
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,940
Mom, listen.

662
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,420
Wenzhou is a great place.

663
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,020
Wenzhou Marine Museum

664
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,540
has good career opportunities.

665
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,140
Once I get there,

666
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,300
I can really show what I'm capable of.

667
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,260
Just wait for my good news.

668
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,940
Once everything is settled,

669
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,980
I'll report back to you.

670
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,700
Wenzhou has opportunities?

671
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,820
Wang Chen's in Wenzhou too.

672
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,860
Alright, forget it.

673
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:29,980
Hello?

674
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,060
Captain Zong.

675
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,140
We wear the same uniform,

676
00:38:40,426 --> 00:38:42,300
but how come
it doesn't look the same on me?

677
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,300
Save it.

678
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,604
A few more years in service,
and you'll get there.

679
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:48,820
Attention!

680
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,020
- Captain.
- Captain.

681
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,930
Yi Nanwang, Wang Chen said

682
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:00,540
you were flustered at breakfast.

683
00:39:00,915 --> 00:39:02,780
Are you just here
to see Captain Zong get ready?

684
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,130
No, Captain.

685
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,500
Captain Zong's
going to Yangyang's house today.

686
00:39:10,804 --> 00:39:13,248
So that's why you've been pestering me
about your outfit

687
00:39:13,271 --> 00:39:14,020
all day yesterday.

688
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:15,820
Report.

689
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,620
I'll take Yi Nanwang to the library.

690
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:18,860
Go.

691
00:39:25,537 --> 00:39:26,740
Tell me how you're feeling.

692
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,100
Honestly? A bit scared.

693
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,780
Marines

694
00:39:37,271 --> 00:39:38,804
don't know the meaning of fear.

695
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,060
You don't get it.

696
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,820
Yangyang told me
her dad is super strict.

697
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,260
Think about it.

698
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,340
I proposed without asking him first.

699
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,380
He is even blaming me

700
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,737
for Yang's quitting being a doctor.

701
00:39:49,737 --> 00:39:50,640
Anyone would be scared.

702
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,540
I think

703
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,580
he has already made up his mind

704
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,980
if he invited you over.

705
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,820
Just relax. You'll be fine.

706
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,660
I'll do anything for Yangyang.

707
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,460
You're meeting your father-in-law,
not going into battle.

708
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:10,100
Where's your courage from the proposal?

709
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,420
Easy for you to say.

710
00:40:12,826 --> 00:40:15,060
Do you think every father-in-law
is like Captain Tang?

711
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:36,940
Captain Wu.

712
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:38,980
Miss Tang.

713
00:40:50,493 --> 00:40:51,540
Why are you here already?

714
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,871
I was just about to pick you up.

715
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,300
I've been
mentally preparing myself outside.

716
00:40:58,404 --> 00:40:59,940
I didn't expect your house to be here.

717
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,420
Is it Zong Qing?

718
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,540
Mom, hurry.

719
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,940
Let me introduce you.

720
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,500
This is Zong Qing.

721
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,220
This is my mom.

722
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,300
Hello, Ma'am.

723
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,540
Hello.

724
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,180
Have a seat.

725
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:17,820
Come on.

726
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,500
Dad.

727
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,700
Greetings, Chief.

728
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,620
This is my dad.

729
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,020
This is Zong Qing.

730
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,700
At ease.

731
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,420
Yes.

732
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,020
Welcome to our home.

733
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,020
Thank you, Chief.

734
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,780
No need to be so formal.

735
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,060
We're at home, not the military.

736
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,300
You can relax a little.

737
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,500
How tall are you?

738
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,860
Reporting, Chief.

739
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,100
1.88 meters with shoes on.

740
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,820
I knew it.

741
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,860
1.88?

742
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,204
Go wash your hands. Time to eat.

743
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,020
Yes.

744
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,100
Why didn't you tell me your dad was...

745
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,660
