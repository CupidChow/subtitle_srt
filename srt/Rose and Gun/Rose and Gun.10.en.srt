318
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,690
Mom, is Dad home?

319
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,930
He left in the middle of the night.

321
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,930
Zong Qing's not home.

322
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,890
He's not answering his phone either.

323
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,690
Did he go with Dad?

324
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,690
That I'm not sure about.

325
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,520
But I bet something urgent came up
and they asked for him too.

326
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,890
Dad would know about it.

327
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,010
Can you ask him for me?

328
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,930
Mom, someone's at the door.
I'll talk to you later.

329
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,970
Mom, it's Xin.

330
00:19:13,604 --> 00:19:15,650

I'll take Yangyang home now.

00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:16,690

No problem. Bye, Ms. Wang.

334
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,493

335
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,080
to escort you safely back
to your parents'.

337
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,360
Where did he go?
Why didn't he inform me of it?

338
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,320
Where else could he be?
He's off to the rescue site.

339

You're the only one
who'd sleep through a typhoon like this.

are you going there to make a report?

342
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,490
No way.

343
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,450
Xin, I'm begging you.

344
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,800
Look how pitiful I am.

345
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,450

00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,250
We hope all those affected

374
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,040
can receive help in time.

375
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,010
I'll pull you up.

376
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,060
There's a child on the roof.
Get them first!

377
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,590
Row that way!

378
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,650
Captain Chen,
something's going on ahead there.

379
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:26,760
Hurry.

380
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:27,490
Move fast!

381
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,080
Stay close!

382
00:21:28,182 --> 00:21:28,650
Let's go!

383
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:29,170
Careful!

384
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,410
Are you alright?

385
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,080
We'll get you out of the water soon.

386
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,280
Forget about us.

387
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,320
There's a bus ahead. Save them!

388
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,080
Quick.

389
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,450
Faster!

390
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,490
What's the situation?

391
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,520
All nearby flooded houses
have been checked.

392
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,820
Everyone has been evacuated.

393
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,170
Get the child up there!

394
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,210
Wait!

395
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,360
Wait a second, Sir!

396
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,120
There's more!

397
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,600
Are there still people trapped?

398
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,970
Everyone's been rescued.

399
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:03,310
But my stuff is still in the water.

400
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,210
Sir.

401
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,170
Our top priority is saving lives.

402
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:12,210
I'm the art teacher
at the town's special education school.

403
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,970
A few of my more gifted students

404
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,150
painted an acrylic piece together.

405
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,210
We were planning to take it
to Beijing for an exhibition.

406
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,800
But before we could manage to do so,

407
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,970
the typhoon hit.

408
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,600
The school is gone now.

409
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,930
We still have to get that painting
to Beijing in two days.

410
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:28,760
Where's the school?

411
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,650
Not far ahead.

412
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,120
- Get on the boat first.
- Okay.

413
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,680
The water isn't too deep.
I'll give it a try.

414
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,360
The PLA's here! We're saved!

415
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,690
Help! Save me!

416
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,410
Please help us!

417
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,410
Sir.

418
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,915
How many people are there in the bus?

419
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,600
16.

420
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,010
Anyone injured?

421
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,120
Not for now,

422
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,930
but there are quite a few kids in here.

423
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,280
Please rescue them first.

424
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:54,690
Ma'am.

425
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,410
Everyone stay calm.

426
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,360
Don't panic. We'll figure something out.

427
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,650
Quick, quick!

428
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:00,690
The PLA is here!

429
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,450
(Chinese Navy)

430
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,450
We're saved!

431
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,410
Don't be afraid!
We'll get you all out right away!

432
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,520
What now?

433
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,360
Get the tools and break the window.

434
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:10,970
Got it.

435
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,010
Where's the painting?

436
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,970
In the office cabinet.

437
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,490
Which floor is the office on?

438
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,870
It's on the first floor.

439
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,930
It's the third room on the first floor.

440
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,210
Be careful, Sir.

441
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,120
Keep an eye on him.

442
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:33,930
Yes, Sir.

443
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,690
Step back. Step back.
Everyone move back a little.

444
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,320
- Don't panic.
- Step back.

445
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,410
Please save us!

446
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,360
Please help us!

447
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,520
Anyone there?

448
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,010
Please help us!

449
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,170
Quick, over here!

450
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:11,890
Help me!

451
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:13,890
Hold on tight!

452
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,170
Come on, kids first.

453
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,080
Come on, elderly and children first.

454
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,970
Come on, elderly first. Here.

455
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,560
Slowly.

456
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,010
Leave it to me.

457
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:31,560
Careful...

458
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,520
Here, sit here.

459
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,130
- Easy.
- Be careful.

460
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:46,600
Come on.

461
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,360
- Step back a bit.
- Watch out.

462
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,890
Back up. That's it, move back.

463
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:58,320
Back up. Step back, everyone.

464
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,448
We're breaking the window.

465
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,800
Children, women,

466
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,730
and elderly will go first.

467
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,650
Watch your step.

468
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:56,210
Easy, easy.

469
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,010
Any more children?

470
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:02,760
No more.

471
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,690
Hurry.

472
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,450
Thank you.

473
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,560
Move. Next boat, come over now!

474
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,280
- Watch out.
- Move over there.

475
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,490
The roof's dangerous.
Quick, move to a safer spot.

476
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,840
Come on, push!

477
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,560
Why is it taking so long?

478
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,490
What's taking him so long?

479
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,890
Don't worry, he'll be here any minute.

480
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:25,040
- Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!
- It's okay, you're safe now.

481
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,080
- Mommy!
- Easy now, easy.

482
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,040
Sit down here.

483
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,080
Is this the one?

484
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,890
Yes.

485
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:45,730
Thank you, Sir.

486
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:50,730
The children's hope has been saved!

487
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,930
The Navy soldiers
who rushed to the scene

488
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,650
have successfully rescued

489
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:00,893
the people stranded on the roof

490
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,250
and brought them safely ashore.

491
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:05,930
This is Tang Xin

492
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:08,490
reporting live from the scene.

493
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:09,600
That's a wrap!

494
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,040
Be careful.

495
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,210
Watch your step.

496
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,320
Watch out.

497
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,280
Come on. Keep up.

498
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,250
Everyone be careful.

499
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,450
It's okay now.

500
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,800
Watch your step.

501
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,320
Be careful.

502
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:39,360
Stay close.

503
00:30:39,426 --> 00:30:40,250
Come on. Keep moving.

504
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,170
Slowly. We're almost there.

505
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,840
Careful.

506
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,690
- Watch out.
- Watch your step.

507
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,560
Go slow.

508
00:30:58,826 --> 00:30:59,848
Here, give me a hand.

509
00:30:59,871 --> 00:31:00,650
Take it slow.

510
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,360
This way.

511
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,280
Watch the steps.

512
00:31:03,448 --> 00:31:04,250
Okay, put them down.

513
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:05,410
Gently.

514
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,226
Over here.

515
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,210
No rush. Watch your step.

516
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,970
- Take it easy.
- It's alright.

517
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,210
You're welcome.

518
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:13,930
Thank you all.

519
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:15,560
Thank you.

Thank you, comrades. Thank you.

523
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,730
There's ginger tea here. Grab some.

524
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,280
Don't mention it.

525
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,120
Thank you.

526
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,520
- Sit over here.
- It's no big deal.

527
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,160
Take your time.

528
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,170
Have you had your ginger tea?

529
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,010
Keep moving inside.

530

the rain is still pouring.

00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:02,730
(navy officers and soldiers
are carrying out)

561
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,560
(emergency reinforcement of the levee.)

562
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,970
(New Perspective will continue)

563
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,680
(to bring you real-time updates.)

564
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,290
Tang Xin.

565
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,040
We all saw

566
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,040
your live report.

567
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,930
Nice job!

568
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:29,600
However,

569
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,520
the other outlets have covered

570
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,170
general disaster summaries like that.

571
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,080
I think that's enough.

572
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,650
But if you can

573
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,930
interview a few of the rescue soldiers

574
00:33:38,937 --> 00:33:41,093
and get them to share
what's on their minds,

575
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,410
I think that might touch the viewers.

576
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:44,890
Of course,

577
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,115
providing it doesn't interfere

578
00:33:46,137 --> 00:33:47,600
with their work or rest.

579
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,120
Sure. Got it, Mr. Tian.

580
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,690
Well? Did he praise us?

581
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,930
So, what now?

582
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:56,730
Should we go interview the victims?

583
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,690
No way.

584
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,600
They just lost everything.

585
00:33:59,626 --> 00:34:00,490
Interviewing them now

586
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:02,170
would just reopen the wound.

587
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,690
It's not that serious.

588
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,250
Other outlets are doing interviews too.

589
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,690
That's how they do things.

590
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:08,271
Let's just stick to our approach.

591
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,450
Cheng Yuan.

592
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:44,680
Wind direction?

593
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,200
Testing me? Northwest wind.

594
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,330
Can't you tell?

595
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,890
We just got word from above.

596
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,120
The Weather Bureau

597
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,080
predicts more rain ahead.

598
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,810
So tougher tasks are coming.

599
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,120
If heaven still won't show mercy,

600
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,120
we'll just have to sacrifice ourselves
for the cause.

601
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,450
Oh, give it a rest.

602
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,330
Just got married
and already talking about sacrifice?

603
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:05,080
What about your Milk Tea Princess?

604
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,200
Cheng Yuan's right.

605
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,520
You should give her a call.

606
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:10,890
Where would I even call?

607
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,200
Support vehicle, one minute per person.

608
00:35:14,582 --> 00:35:15,982
Call to let her know you're safe.

609
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,120
It's connected?

610
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:18,890
Then I'll go now.

611
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,120
Let's go

612
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,120
join him.

613
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,290
Sergeant Cheng.

614
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,560
Are you calling Ke'er?

615
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,770
What about you?

616
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,010
My stay-at-home mom.

617
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,600
That's annoying.

618
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:07,560
What's wrong?

619
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,930
Yangyang hung up on me.

620
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:14,040
Do you think she's mad

621
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,640
because I snuck out alone?

622
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,040
Of course she's mad.

623
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,210
It was your wedding night,
but you left her home alone.

624
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:21,890
If she can't get over it,

625
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:23,160
she might just ask for a divorce.

626
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:24,160
Shut your mouth.

627
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,330
Just kidding.

628
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:30,160
You take my place.

629
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,200
I'll give you my one minute.

630
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,200
Try again.

631
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,160
Hang on.

632
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:34,640
Zong Qing.

633
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,970
When we make calls from base numbers,

634
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,520
they either show up as spam or ads.

635
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,080
Did you tell your wife about that
before you left home?

636
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:46,970
I forgot.

637
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,490
I can't believe I forgot that.

638
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,560
Stop being so forgetful.

639
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,290
But Captain,

640
00:36:55,315 --> 00:36:56,970
maybe it's better he didn't get through.

641
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:59,410
If she started crying
her eyes out on the phone,

642
00:36:59,737 --> 00:37:01,240
would he still be able to focus here?

643
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:06,410
You go first, Captain.

644
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:09,370
Mom.

645
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,290
I'm off now.

646
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:11,370
Everything's good on my end.

647
00:37:11,404 --> 00:37:12,080
Bye, Captain Zong.

648
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,720
Don't worry.

649
00:37:12,804 --> 00:37:13,930
Take care of yourselves too.

650
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,071
Alright, I'm hanging up.

653
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,850
Tang Xin.

654
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,330
Are you okay?

655
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,450
Yes, I'm all fine. Don't worry.

656
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,680
How about you? Are you doing good?

657
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,080
I'm alright. Where are you now?

658
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:08,640
Hi, Mr. Han Jr.

659
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,240
Hello.

660
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:10,850
Where's my brother?

661
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,490
Mr. Han is in a meeting.

662
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,720
Please wait. I'll let him know.

663
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,860
No need. You get back to work.

664
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,804
I'll go find him myself.

665
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:16,490
Okay.

666
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:24,780
(Red Sea Internet Café)

667
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,680
Why is it so hard for you guys
to look into one person?

668
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,850
Mr. Han, we've looked into it.

669
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:34,200
This email was registered
at the Red Sea Internet Café.

670
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:35,930
We also pulled the surveillance footage.

671
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,200
But there were just too many visitors.

672
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,680
There's no way to tell
who registered the account.

673
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,490
I think the email was created
as a one-time throwaway.

674
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,370
jn56789@qq.com.

675
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,240
It's such a basic handle.

676
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,560
I bet it was made up.

677
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,720
Another analysis, huh?

678
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:55,450
I don't want that.

679
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:57,810
I want results. Who are they?

680
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,330
Aren't you a tech expert?

681
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,450
What's your solution?

682
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,600
Mr. Han, trying
to trace the user of this email

683
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,080
through the IP address

684
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,330
is nearly impossible.

685
00:39:12,337 --> 00:39:13,600
Should I do it myself?

686
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,120
Mr. Han, that's not what I meant.

687
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,120
I also analyzed the username.

688
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:21,810
The "JN" part might be initials
from a name.

689
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,750
Like Jiangnan, Jiangning,
or something like that.

690
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,200
How about this?

691
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,560
List out all name combinations

692
00:39:30,604 --> 00:39:31,680
that match those initials.

693
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,680
Check them one by one.

694
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,490
Mr. Han, I have a suggestion.

695
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,080
What if we tried

696
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,970
to investigate
that female reporter's connection

697
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,240
to the email?

698
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,720
But we're still doing the name check.

699
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,080
As for the reporter,

700
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,370
if you have a lead, keep digging.

701
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,810
Got it?

702
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,200
Yutian.

703
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:01,680
Yuhang? What are you doing here?

704
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,200
Reception said you were in a meeting,

705
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,080
so I came to find you myself.

706
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:11,600
I don't remember
you coming to the office often.

707
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,200
What brings you here today?

708
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,330
I was passing by,
so I figured I'd stop in.

709
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:16,330
Yutian.

710
00:40:16,493 --> 00:40:17,450
Upon my arrival here,

711
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,200
I heard you were trying
to track someone down.

712
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,450
Is something going on?

713
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,720
Nothing big.

714
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:25,680
A friend of mine got scammed.

715
00:40:25,826 --> 00:40:27,250
We're just helping him look into it.

716
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:29,930
What has he lost?

717
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,080
Some money.

718
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,040
You should report it
to the police, then.

719
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,450
Digging into this yourself is risky.

720
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:36,515
We already reported it.

721
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:38,200
But more hands, more power.

722
00:40:38,426 --> 00:40:39,810
So we might as well help him out.

723
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,450
Fair enough. In that case,

724
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:44,560
give me the details.

725
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,780
I'll help you look into it too.

726
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,080
You must be kidding.

727
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,120
It's rare that you're here.

728
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,450
Let's have some tea

729
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,020
and catch up in my office.

00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,200
Girl, how have you been lately?

732
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:02,600
Here.

733
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,720
All wrapped up.
Careful, don't get it wet.

734
00:41:05,271 --> 00:41:06,271
What a good girl.

735
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,680
I'll take it from here. Don't worry.

736
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,970
Let's go, girl.

737
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:12,200
Here.

738
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,600
You're here
for a bandage change, right?

739
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,600
Captain Wu.

740
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:24,370
Let me dress that wound on your hand.

741
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,560
It's okay.

742
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:30,450
Let me check on it.

743
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:37,970
You should dress it.

744
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:40,404
Fingers are connected to the heart.
