Zong Qing,

19
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,180
make yourself comfortable.

20
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,380
I'm not sure

21
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,540
what you like to eat.

22
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,020
All the dishes I prepared here

23
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,660
are Yangyang's favorites.

24
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,020
Thank you, Mrs. Lan.

25
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,871
If Yangyang likes them,
I'm sure I will too.

26
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,020
Great.

27
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,540
How's the food in the military?

28
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,740
Mrs. Lan, it's good.

29
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,900
We're on Type 2 ration.

30
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,100
What's that?

31
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:12,580
According to military needs,

32
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,204
a set ration of grains,
fish, poultry, meat, eggs,

33
00:02:15,204 --> 00:02:16,940
vegetables, fruit, and fat is provided

34
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,004
in a balanced ratio

35
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,100
to ensure every soldier

36
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,060
meets their daily
nutritional requirements.

37
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,100
Type 2 ration is 41 yuan
per person per day.

38
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,540
Six dishes and one soup daily.

39
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,260
We're just chatting.

40
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,893
You sound like you're giving a briefing.

41
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:28,980
Although

42
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,780
the military meals are nutritious,

43
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,540
they don't taste
as good as your cooking.

44
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,100
If you like it, come by more often.

45
00:02:35,715 --> 00:02:38,100
He's a soldier.
He can't just come here as he pleases.

46
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,660
Dad,

47
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,380
he's a soldier,

48
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,100
but he's also your future son-in-law.

49
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,380
Why can't he?

50
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,260
Yangyang,

51
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,260
Chief didn't mean that.

52
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,980
I won't have many chances

53
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,540
to eat at home.

54
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,540
But I promise,

55
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,260
whenever I'm off duty,

56
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,960
I'll come back to spend time with you

57
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,760
and to visit Mrs. Lan and Chief.

58
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,780
It's Mr. Lan.

59
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,820
Call him Mr. Lan at home.

60
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,100
Yes, Mrs. Lan.

61
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,100
Do you have any fun stories
from the military?

62
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,660
What's the training like?

63
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,420
Are there any tough missions?

64
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,100
There are confidentiality rules.

65
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,100
I can't say.

66
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,700
I'm not a spy.

67
00:03:17,737 --> 00:03:18,780
He did the right thing.

68
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,260
Try the soup.

69
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,980
Your mom is busy looking after him.

70
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,200
You should help serve the food.

71
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,220
All right.

72
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,820
Here.

73
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:44,980
Oh, my leg.

74
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,420
Look.

75
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,660
They really make a good match.

76
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,315
Hurry and look before I delete it.

77
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,540
Mrs. Wang,

78
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,140
my dad told me

79
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,140
you've been taking care
of the elders and your son at home,

80
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,780
and also helping to connect
military families.

81
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,315
My mom showed me

82
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:19,580
the support group chat
for military families.

83
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,737
It seems more helpful
than the neighborhood service.

84
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,340
I have to help out for sure.

85
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,540
Every family has its struggles.

86
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:27,700
By the way,

87
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,100
I should add you to the group.

88
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,709
I don't think that's appropriate.

89
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,980
I'm not a military spouse.

90
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,340
Not just the spouses,

91
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,900
there's also a group
for family members.

92
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,140
Many of them are about your age.

93
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,140
Exactly. My mom's always matchmaking

94
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,460
in that group.

95
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,140
Stop looking. I think he's good.

96
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,900
Ask him.

97
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,460
I don't think I should. You ask.

98
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,220
He's your soldier. You do it.

99
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,020
Well, then.

100
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,980
Lan Yangyang.

101
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,820
Zong Qing.

102
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,580
Yes, Sir!

103
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,460
Dad,

104
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,700
can you not shout at home?

105
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,020
Yeah.

106
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,980
We're at home now.

107
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,140
Come sit down.

108
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:19,893
- Have a seat.
- Sit.

109
00:05:19,893 --> 00:05:20,580
Yes, Sir.

110
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:23,900
Zong Qing,

111
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,260
I'm now asking you

112
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,460
as a father.

113
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,020
Yes, please go ahead.

114
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,900
This is the first time
we've officially met.

115
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,980
If we don't approve of your marriage
to Yangyang,

116
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,900
what would you do?

117
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,700
Dad.

118
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,460
Answer my question.

119
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,020
Chief,

120
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,780
I know you have doubts

121
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,980
about me and Yangyang.

122
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,140
But I promise,

123
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,780
my proposal wasn't made on impulse.

124
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,540
From the moment I met Yangyang,

125
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,900
I knew I liked her.

126
00:05:55,982 --> 00:05:56,980
That was when I decided

127
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,020
I wanted to protect her
and take care of her.

128
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,700
I'll work hard to be a good soldier
and a good husband.

129
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,540
I know it may sound like
an empty promise,

130
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,220
but I'll prove it to you and Mrs. Lan
with my actions.

131
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,700
Zong Qing,

132
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,540
we believe you truly care for Yangyang.

133
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,980
But as a soldier,

134
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,382
your attention is often divided.

135
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,820
Most of the time,

136
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,700
you can only be
a good soldier or a good husband.

137
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,220
Which will you choose?

138
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,020
Dad, Mom, stop putting him on the spot.

139
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,100
He's a soldier.

140
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,020
I support him.

141
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,340
Answer the question.

142
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,220
Chief,

143
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,660
I'll do my utmost to love Yangyang.

144
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,220
But orders are orders,

145
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,460
I must always prioritize my duty.

Yes.

What do your parents think?

149
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,540
They fully support us.

150
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,900
In that case,
invite them over for a visit.

00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,340
Of course I am.

187
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,340
But they're in a different camp.

188
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,220
It'll be late when you get there.

189
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,460
Uh...

190
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:44,980
Brigadier,

191
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,980
maybe let Miss Tang stay the night?

192
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,150
I'll be heading over tomorrow.

193
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,340
I can give her a ride.

194
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,940
Captain.

195
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,580
This way.

196
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,820
Captain Wu,

197
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,980
do people leave their doors
unlocked here?

198
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,940
Soldiers are on guard
around the clock here.

199
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,740
Is this area all women?

200
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,220
This is a family guesthouse,

201
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,537
so it houses all family members.

202
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,460
Don't worry.

203
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,460
It's perfectly safe on base.

204
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,220
In that case,

205
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,980
will my food delivery make it in?

206
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,700
You ordered food takeout?

207
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,820
I'll go get it.

208
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,100
I'm joking.

209
00:09:32,537 --> 00:09:34,337
You actually believe everything I say.

210
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,220
Your room is just ahead.

211
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,460
I'm off. Get some rest.

212
00:09:40,537 --> 00:09:42,220
I'll come to fetch you at 6 AM tomorrow.

213
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,700
Sure. See you tomorrow.

214
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,460
See you then.

215
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,060
Sergeant Cheng.

216
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,671
I just got back from the cafeteria.

217
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,580
Do you want to eat?

218
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,420
What exactly happened?

219
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,100
Captain Zong hit a landmine.

220
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,420
What's that?

221
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,220
Got kicked out?

222
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,700
Sergeant Cheng, think about it.

223
00:10:17,804 --> 00:10:20,340
Other than Lan Yangyang,
who else here has the surname Lan?

224
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,426
Commander Lan, apparently.

225
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:22,740
What's wrong?

226
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,740
Is that hard to guess?

227
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,300
Yeah.

228
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,500
Makes sense when you think about it.

229
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,980
Milk Tea Princess is

230
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,980
the daughter of Commander Lan?

231
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,420
Stepped right on a mine.

232
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,580
It never even

233
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,700
crossed my mind.

234
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,180
If you were me,

235
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,340
would you have guessed?

236
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,820
You've got guts.

237
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,980
I can't help you with that.

238
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,820
Well.

239
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,100
I'll join you.

240
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,620
- Let's do it together.
- Me?

241
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,340
Do it.

242
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,100
Still not back?

243
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,700
Where did Captain Wu go?

244
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,582
I need him to advise me
on my life decision.

245
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,540
Should I do another 200 push-ups
with you?

246
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,660
Get lost.

247
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,540
Heartless push-up machine.

248
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,020
(Captain Wu)

249
00:11:28,004 --> 00:11:28,700
Hello, Cheng Yuan?

250
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,700
Captain Wu.

251
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,140
Zong Qing?

252
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,660
Captain Wu,

253
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,180
do you know who Lan Yangyang's dad is?

254
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,660
Commander Lan.

255
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,180
I really did step on a mine, didn't I?

256
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,300
What are you on about?

257
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,020
A general's daughter can't get married?

258
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,180
Well,

259
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,020
did Commander Lan

260
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,420
say anything?

261
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,380
What did he say?

262
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,420
He asked what I would do
if he didn't agree.

263
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,500
I panicked

264
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,660
and started rambling.

265
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:56,660
Then he said

266
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,140
he wanted to talk to my parents...

267
00:11:58,515 --> 00:11:59,900
Is he going to complain about me?

268
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,180
Are you stupid?

269
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,540
Can't tell what he actually means?

270
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,540
Call your parents right now

271
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,537
and have them come here.

272
00:12:08,582 --> 00:12:09,515
Wait for good news.

273
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,700
Hurry.

274
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,093
Where's Captain Wu?

275
00:12:17,093 --> 00:12:18,860
He's off for an interview
in Battalion Two.

276
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,700
He's not eating breakfast?

277
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,060
You idiot.

278
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,960
The weather is nice.

279
00:12:26,004 --> 00:12:27,500
Why would he eat with a bunch of guys?

280
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,300
Exactly.

281
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,820
Having breakfast with Miss Tang
is way better.

282
00:12:30,848 --> 00:12:32,448
Battalion Two also provides breakfast.

283
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,660
What do they have anyway?
Is it fun there?

284
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,300
It's pretty serious.

285
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,060
No female soldiers.

286
00:12:39,471 --> 00:12:40,940
I'm not interested in female soldiers.

287
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,540
I mean...

288
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,380
Wait.

289
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,300
If there are no female soldiers,

290
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,540
then...

291
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,780
There's no ladies' room.

292
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,540
Captain.

293
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,540
Go upstairs.

294
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,780
Yes, Sir.

295
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,420
Captain.

296
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:01,940
Go upstairs.

297
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,060
Yes, Sir.

298
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,780
Have you been here the whole time?

299
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,500
Can we go now?

300
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:16,940
Sure.

301
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,140
Steady your breath.

302
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,660
Don't pull the trigger too hard
when firing.

303
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,300
Captain Liu.

304
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,180
Captain Wu.

305
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,900
Let me introduce you.

306
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,540
This is Captain Liu Xu.
He participated in the fleet review.

307
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,940
This is Tang Xin, a journalist
from Minghua News.

308
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,780
She's here to cover our brigade.

309
00:13:51,871 --> 00:13:52,580
Hello, Miss Tang.

310
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,580
We're doing live-fire shooting training.

311
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,060
Hello, Captain Liu.

312
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,780
I'm here to observe.

313
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,300
Will I disturb your training?

314
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,140
No.

315
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,060
Service weapons are classified.

316
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,630
You can't...

317
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,426
No photos allowed.

318
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,180
Understood.

319
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,900
Captain Liu,

320
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,380
can I try the rifle later?

321
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,380
I'm sorry, Miss Tang.

322
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,300
You can't.

323
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,180
We have firearm regulations.

324
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,180
Understood.

325
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,780
Sorry about that.

326
00:14:19,248 --> 00:14:20,350
Carry on with your training.

327
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,020
Yes, Sir.

328
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,300
So

329
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,300
that's pretty much what happened.

330
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,660
I thought you all would've
handled things by now

331
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,540
while I was overseas.

332
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,260
That journalist is a hard nut to crack.

333
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,780
She's still digging.

334
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,380
Dad,

335
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,700
if this keeps up,

336
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,700
shall we teach her a lesson?

337
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,380
No need for that.

338
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,700
She's a public figure.

339
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,940
If anything happens to her,

340
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,900
it'll look bad for everyone.

341
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,780
She's just trying

342
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,180
to stir things up.

343
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,700
Then let's downplay the whole thing.

344
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,060
Let them fuss all they want.

345
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,020
What do you suggest?

346
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,700
We've already salvaged most of it

347
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,660
from the sunken ship at Dayan Reef.

348
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,380
What's left are just scraps.

349
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,660
Leave that to them.

350
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,780
What if there's
something valuable there?

351
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,660
Wouldn't it be a waste?

352
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,660
How valuable could it be?

353
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,700
Do you know

354
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,300
why I was gone for so long this time?

355
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,020
Did our partners find

356
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,900
a new target?

357
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,420
Based on what I've learned overseas,

358
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,380
we've basically confirmed

359
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,940
the rough location of a sunken ship
from the Song Dynasty.

360
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,900
So

361
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,260
don't be penny-wise

362
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,660
and pound-foolish.

363
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,180
Point taken.

364
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,580
I know what I'm going to do next.

365
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,420
What about

366
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,260
that journalist?

367
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,900
How will you deal with her?

368
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,180
Actually,

369
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,380
our biggest threat so far

370
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,260
is the one who tipped off Tang Xin.

371
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,260
We can't be sure

372
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,020
how much the person knows.

373
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,180
If that person is taken care of,

374
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,900
we can rest easy.

375
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:53,820
All right.

376
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,260
Since you already know,

377
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,820
get it done quickly.

378
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,420
Okay.

379
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,020
I'll do it now.

380
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:21,540
Who are you looking for?

381
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,260
May I ask

382
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,620
who Mr. Bai Zijian is?

383
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,290
Mr. Bai.

384
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,280
Hello, I'm Bai Zijian.

385
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,220
Hello, I'm Tang Xin.

386
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,530
I'm a journalist from Minghua News.

387
00:17:32,537 --> 00:17:33,560
We spoke on the phone.

388
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,310
Right. You called me.

389
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,790
Wu Si referred you to me.

390
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,700
I also know your wife, Wang Chen.

391
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,940
Great. Please sit.

392
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,300
Sure.

393
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,060
Have a seat.

394
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,380
I remember you told me on the phone

395
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,700
that you wanted to ask about

396
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,980
the sunken ship at Dayan Reef.

397
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,140
Recently,

398
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,020
I received a tip

399
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,180
that some criminals
have been illegally salvaging

400
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,740
national cultural artifacts
from a sunken ship at Dayan Reef.

401
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,180
I've gone to sea

402
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,140
three times

403
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,460
to look into it.

404
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,380
But for many reasons,

405
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,180
I found nothing.

406
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,500
From what I've found

407
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,140
and all the obstacles I met

408
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,380
during the investigation,

409
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,700
I believe

410
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,620
there's a high chance of

411
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,900
a sunken ship around Dayan Reef.

412
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,140
So I came here for your advice.

413
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,115
The area around Dayan Reef

414
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:27,860
is part of the South China Sea Route

415
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,660
during the Tang, Song, Yuan,
and Ming dynasties.

416
00:18:30,737 --> 00:18:33,980
Sunken ships in that area
are highly likely.

417
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:35,860
I see.

418
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,700
Actually,

419
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,940
there's another reason I came.

420
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,180
I know it's very difficult

421
00:18:44,515 --> 00:18:46,980
to investigate this on my own.

422
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,980
So I wanted to ask,

423
00:18:48,071 --> 00:18:50,540
would it be possible
if the Cultural Relics Bureau organizes

424
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,460
an underwater archaeological dig

425
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,060
based on the leads I have?

426
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,220
I see.

427
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,500
Look.

428
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,580
Can you prepare a formal report

429
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,260
about your investigation?

430
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,820
I'll submit it to my leader,

431
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,540
and they can forward it
to the relevant cultural department.

432
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,380
Let's see if our combined efforts

433
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,426
can push forward
an underwater archaeological dig

434
00:19:14,471 --> 00:19:15,540
at Dayan Reef.

435
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,980
Thank you, Mr. Bai.

436
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,260
No need to thank me.

437
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,780
Let me show you a map.

438
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,860
This nautical chart

439
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,100
marks the Dayan Reef area.

440
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,700
Is this where you went?

441
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,780
Yes, that's right.

442
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,493
There are a lot of hidden reefs here,

443
00:19:33,515 --> 00:19:35,780
so the chances of shipwrecks are high.

444
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,940
If you can't calm down,

445
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,260
run five kilometers.

446
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,260
Captain Wu,

447
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,540
my parents are going
to Yangyang's place.

448
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,460
It should be fine, right?

449
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,140
Less talking.

450
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,460
Finish the training first.

451
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,220
Yes, Sir.

452
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,220
Mom,

453
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,260
are Zong Qing's parents here yet?

454
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,780
Not yet.

455
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,140
You bought a lot.

456
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,220
My future parents-in-law
sure are something.

457
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,300
They didn't say when they'd arrive
or their flight info.

458
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,940
I'm running around like crazy.

459
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,180
Mom,

460
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,060
are you heading out?

461
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,460
Your dad has something urgent,

462
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,540
so I need to go over.

463
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,900
Dad isn't here either?

464
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,860
Zong Qing's parents
are about to arrive.

465
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,220
Doesn't he want to meet them?

466
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,648
They're here to see you, not us.

467
00:20:34,671 --> 00:20:37,620
Whether we're here or not
makes no difference.

468
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,071
- I should get going.
- No, Mom.

469
00:20:39,115 --> 00:20:40,060
You can't leave.

470
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,300
Yangyang,

471
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,660
listen.

472
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,020
When they arrive,

473
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,140
be sharp.

474
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:45,700
Also,

475
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,180
your dad and I will be back soon.

476
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,900
- Very soon.
- No.

477
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,020
Look, it leaks.

478
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,180
Look at that.

479
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,700
Mom. Don't go, Mom.

480
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,460
Mom, I don't know how to cook!

481
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,660
Weiguo,

482
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,460
Yangyang's going to meet
Zong Qing's parents

483
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,700
for the first time.

484
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,700
I think we should...

485
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,060
Look at you.

486
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,860
You're soft-hearted again.

487
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,540
We've already met Zong Qing.

488
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,540
It's time his parents

489
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,980
meet Yangyang.

490
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,660
Think about it.

491
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,980
What will it be like if we're there?

492
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,700
You prepare the food in the kitchen,

493
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,700
I chat with them in the living room,

494
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,180
and Yangyang sits next to me smiling.

495
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,940
That's too easy for her.

496
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,700
What if Yangyang messes it up?

497
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,420
Then it's on her.

498
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,700
Listen, you must be aligned
with me on this.

499
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,300
Before, I was assessing my daughter's
future husband.

500
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,540
Today, I'm assessing my soldier's
future wife.

501
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,700
Why are you so anxious?

502
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
Xin, which pan is for frying,

503
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,180
and which is for stir-frying?

504
00:22:40,715 --> 00:22:41,620
What are you doing?

505
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,860
These three shots
are from Captain Zong Qing.

506
00:22:44,515 --> 00:22:45,360
Report the score.

507
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,715
Report the score.

508
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:48,980
Captain Wu.

509
00:22:49,093 --> 00:22:51,648
Blue Blade squad leader, Zong Qing,
three shots, thirty points.

510
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,740
Why are you reporting that?

511
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,980
Zong Qing's getting married soon.

512
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,500
He'll be very busy enjoying married life

513
00:22:58,871 --> 00:23:00,460
and won't have time to shoot this well.

514
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,460
These three shots

515
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,900
are my wedding gift to him.

516
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,740
Report the score.

517
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,900
Lan Yangyang

518
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,380
is lazy,

519
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,660
and she doesn't know how to cook.

520
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,420
She's asking Tang Xin for help.

521
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:41,940
Deduct one point.

522
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,860
Out of how many?

523
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,740
Out of five, of course.

524
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,180
Oh my.

525
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,660
Lan Yangyang.

526
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,660
Smurffi, open the door.

527
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,740
Coming.

528
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,620
Xin.

529
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,780
Stop dawdling. Hurry up.

530
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,700
When will they arrive?

531
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,540
Any time now.

532
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,660
Hurry.

533
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,220
Excuse me.

534
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,540
May I know
where Commander Lan's place is?

535
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,220
Go that way.

536
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:35,660
Thank you.

537
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,540
Sure, no problem.

538
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,460
Thank you.

539
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,700
Is that them?

540
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,260
Most likely.

541
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,300
How's Yangyang getting on
with everything?

542
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,260
You should say,

543
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,700
how's Tang Xin getting on
with everything?

544
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,780
Come.

545
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,180
You...

546
00:25:02,182 --> 00:25:04,540
Let me do it, troublemaker.
Stand at attention over there.

547
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,660
Don't mess around.

548
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,740
Okay. Now listen.

549
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,100
Steamed fish head with chopped chili.
Snow peas with capsicum.

550
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,940
Northern snakehead soup
with bridal veil fungus.

551
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,260
Egg pancake with toona sinensis.

552
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,980
Sichuan boiled beef. Braised pork ribs.

553
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:18,660
You cooked all of them.

554
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,420
Remember, it's you!

555
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,660
I cooked all of them.

556
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,026
- Repeat.
- I cooked all of them.

557
00:25:24,071 --> 00:25:25,382
- Repeat.
- I cooked all of them.

558
00:25:25,404 --> 00:25:27,460
Repeat the dish names. Gosh.

559
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,740
Braised...

560
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,420
Braised... Braised beef pork ribs.

561
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:31,980
Egg pancake.

562
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:35,980
Xin.

563
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,060
Stay composed.

564
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,380
Think about it.

565
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,180
Is there anyone scarier than your dad?

566
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,220
Probably not.

567
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:44,980
Good.

568
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,940
Hold this.

569
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,180
Okay.

570
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,020
On standby in the kitchen.

571
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,180
Good.

572
00:26:00,271 --> 00:26:01,382
Stand up straight.

573
00:26:08,426 --> 00:26:10,420
Hello, Mr. Zong and Mrs. Zong.
Please come in.

574
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,180
Hello.

575
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,980
Is this

576
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,540
Lan Yangyang's house?

577
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,940
Yes, that's right.

578
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,220
And you are?

579
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,980
Oh, Mr. Zong and Mrs. Zong.

580
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,060
I'm Tang Xin. I'm Yangyang's friend.

581
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,140
Yangyang's in the kitchen.

582
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:28,980
Yangyang.

583
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,180
Yangyang, come out.

584
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,020
Coming.

585
00:26:39,468 --> 00:26:41,300
Say something.

586
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,700
Hello, Mr. Zong, Mrs. Zong.

587
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,980
I'm Lan Yangyang.

588
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,660
Hello.

589
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,420
Hang in there.

590
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:01,980
Hang in there.

591
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,460
Keep it up.

592
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,460
Attention,

593
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,220
sing a song.

594
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,300
♪The mightiest force among armies♪

595
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,060
♪The sturdier steel among steels♪

596
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:22,060
♪We are the fiery sons of the nation♪

597
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,060
♪Sword drawn♪

♪Guns loaded♪

♪Awaiting the bugle call♪

600
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,540
It tastes good.

601
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,460
Mrs. Zong,

602
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,060
please have some.

603
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,700
You too.

604
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,700
Sure.

605
00:27:51,915 --> 00:27:53,500
- Mr. Zong, eat some.
- You eat too.

606
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,220
Sure.

607
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,460
You're quite capable.

608
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,220
Great.

609
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,660
It's so delicious.

610
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,540
Your cooking is great.

611
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,460
My cooking is great.

612
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,460
Yangyang, the soup you made is nice.

613
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,740
Let me serve some.

614
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,140
What soup is this?

615
00:28:30,337 --> 00:28:31,648
Northern snakehead soup.

616
00:28:31,648 --> 00:28:33,540
Yes, northern snakehead soup.
That's right.

617
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,620
I made all of this.

618
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,020
All of it.

619
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:39,940
I think

620
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,940
I'd better go check upstairs.

621
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,980
Just sit.

622
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,740
You're impatient.

623
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,220
Well, you can go inside.

624
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,300
Come on.

625
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,220
See that?

626
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,220
You see that?

627
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,380
I did.

628
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,780
A hug doesn't mean anything.

629
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,220
Yangyang,

630
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,180
being a soldier's parents isn't easy.

631
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,940
Being a soldier's wife is even harder.

632
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,420
There may be a lot of things

633
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,140
Zong Qing might overlook.

634
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,780
Please understand him.

635
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,460
Well, don't scare her.

636
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,260
Head back.

637
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,660
Go on.

638
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,700
All right.

639
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,460
Head back.

640
00:29:34,626 --> 00:29:35,871
Goodbye, Mr. Zong and Mrs. Zong.

641
00:29:35,871 --> 00:29:37,471
- Goodbye, Mr. Zong and Mrs. Zong.
- Bye.

642
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,700
Let's go too.

643
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,020
Are you not going over?

644
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,540
They're leaving.

645
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,660
Sorry.

646
00:30:03,026 --> 00:30:03,780
Nice to meet you.

647
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,300
I'm Lan Yangyang's father.

648
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,390
This is my wife.

649
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,540
Nice to meet you.

650
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,970
- Mrs. Lan.
- A pleasure to meet you.

651
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:11,840
- Hello.
- A pleasure.

652
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,220
Let's go.

653
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,140
Look, they're over there.

654
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,620
There?

655
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:41,660
Yes.

656
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,220
Zong,

657
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,660
it's our son.

658
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,980
Mrs. Zong.

659
00:30:51,048 --> 00:30:52,980
They're in the middle of training.
Let's wait.

660
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:54,900
Right.

661
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,900
Don't worry.

662
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,660
You'll be able to meet
at the guesthouse later.

663
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,060
Attention.

664
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,980
Eyes right.

665
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,700
Eyes front.

666
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:21,980
At ease.

667
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:23,980
I'll talk a bit.

668
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,740
Most of you did very well today,

669
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,020
especially Yi Nanwang.

670
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,080
Yes, Sir.

671
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,399
As a military volunteer,
you managed to keep up with everyone.

672
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,404
You've improved so much
compared to your last time.

673
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:33,980
Cheng Yuan.

674
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,620
Yes, Sir.

675
00:31:34,937 --> 00:31:35,900
You did a good job too.

676
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,500
Very fast.

677
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,180
The rest of you were good.

678
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,700
Only a few

679
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,700
lagged behind.

680
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,980
If that happens again next time,

681
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:46,226
you'll have extra training.

682
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,020
Commander Lan,

683
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,620
how's Zong Qing doing in the army?

684
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,300
Not bad.

685
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,420
He's a competent soldier.

686
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,420
He's the only military fan in the family
since he was a kid.

687
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,220
When he took the NCEE,

688
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,420
he applied to the military academy
without telling us.

689
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,780
And after graduating,

690
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,500
he secretly joined the Marine Corps.

691
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,180
He decides everything

692
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,700
on his own.

693
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,460
Even an important decision
like engagement,

694
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,420
we only found out a few days ago.

695
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,700
How could you talk about your son
like that?

696
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,620
He's not saying
that Zong Qing is undisciplined.

697
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,420
He just meant that we've
always respected his decisions

698
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,780
and trusted his choices

699
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,700
since he was young.

700
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,660
Right.

701
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,220
You've met Yangyang too.

702
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,700
Do you think she's good?

703
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,660
- Yes.
- Yes.

704
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,860
Of course.

705
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,060
But don't have high expectations of her.

706
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,220
To be honest,

707
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,220
Yangyang can't cook.

708
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,260
The meal you had today

709
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,660
was prepared by her good friend,

710
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,780
Tang Xin.

711
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,940
Lan.

712
00:32:45,026 --> 00:32:46,140
I'm just telling the truth.

713
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,500
We knew.

714
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,140
Please forgive her.

715
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:52,980
It's on me.

716
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,220
I've spoiled her.

717
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,220
Lan has always spoken highly
of Zong Qing.

718
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,420
We really like him a lot.

719
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:01,980
It's just that,

720
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,220
please don't mind that Yangyang is young

721
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,420
and naive.

722
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,220
I like Yangyang.

723
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,980
We respect Zong Qing's decision.

724
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,140
We'll support all the choices he makes.

725
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,780
Right.

726
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,780
Zong Qing.

727
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,220
Yes, Sir.

728
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:19,980
Return to the base.

729
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,500
Yes, Sir.

730
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,060
Attention, right face.

731
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,140
Turn left to the rear.
Double time, move.

732
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,060
Tiechao,

733
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,420
you came to the right person.

734
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,220
I've shaved Captain's hair too.

735
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,060
Can you really do this?

736
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,540
Of course I can.

737
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,860
You messed up my hair last time.

738
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,382
It's because you didn't flatten
your head properly as a baby.

739
00:33:56,448 --> 00:33:57,604
- Fall in!
- Fall in!

740
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:11,820
Peng Tiechao.

741
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,420
Yes, Sir!

742
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,260
Step out.

743
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:13,940
Yes, Sir.

744
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,540
Who shaves

745
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,860
your hair?

746
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,420
Sir!

747
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:26,980
Step out.

748
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,660
I did.

749
00:34:30,293 --> 00:34:31,500
You shaved his hair like this?

750
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,500
Sir.

751
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,020
I was halfway through

752
00:34:35,071 --> 00:34:36,693
when the emergency
assembly call sounded.

753
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,860
It actually looks good
when it's finished.

754
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,420
No laughing.

755
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,940
All right. Go train.

756
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,860
I'll shave your hair after.

757
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,300
Fall in.

758
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,315
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

759
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,460
Attention.

760
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,140
Tonight's training

761
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,420
is night field training.

762
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,260
All units,

763
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:56,860
move out.

764
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,660
Double time, move.

765
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,740
Double time, move.

766
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,740
This looks better.

767
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,940
Shave the hair behind the ear like this.

768
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,940
What were you even doing?

769
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,740
Buddies!

770
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:17,740
What?

771
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,940
I have good news.

772
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,380
Mr. Lan agreed to my marriage
to Yangyang!

773
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,100
For real?

774
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,860
Heart sign.

775
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,540
(Military Marriage Certificate)

776
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:36,720
Chief, what's your plan
for Yangyang's wedding?

777
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,160
They'll join
the collective military wedding.

778
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,026
Collective wedding?

779
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,460
Why? You think I'll make
the wrong decision?

780
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,340
Don't worry. I've told
the Political Department.

781
00:36:44,604 --> 00:36:47,493
Since you political commissars
have had training on it, you handle it.

782
00:36:47,537 --> 00:36:48,382
Yes, Sir.

783
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,020
I can only be at ease

784
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,540
if it's a collective wedding.

785
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:52,820
Understood.

786
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,260
Careful.

787
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,660
Go straight.

788
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,420
Got it. Go straight.

789
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,820
Keep walking.

790
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,460
Stay to the left.

791
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,940
There's a shoe cabinet on the right.

792
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,020
- Okay.
- Go straight.

793
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,300
Straight. Right.

794
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,540
Keep going.

795
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,660
Okay, stop.

796
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,620
Turn left.

797
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,820
Take three steps forward.

798
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,940
One, two, three.

799
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,620
Turn right.

800
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,940
Good. Walk straight ahead.

801
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,620
Okay.

802
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,540
Okay. Stop.

803
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,100
Captain Zong Qing,

804
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,380
let me introduce.

805
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,820
This will be our future home.

806
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,740
Do you like it?

807
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,740
You did all this yourself?

808
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,740
Yeah.

809
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,260
Why didn't you call me to help?

810
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,460
You're busy in the army.

811
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,582
Besides, it's not like
I can't handle it myself.

812
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,380
Dear, can I ask you something?

813
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,060
How did you

814
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,580
rent this place?

815
00:37:58,626 --> 00:38:00,400
A friend of mine
wanted to transfer the lease.

816
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,480
This is a suburban place

817
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,340
by the sea.
The rent is under two thousand.

818
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:03,980
Well.

819
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,060
From now on, I'll hand over
all my salary to you.

820
00:38:07,271 --> 00:38:08,537
Deduct the rent from that.

821
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:09,660
Sure.

822
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,420
You said it. I didn't force you.

823
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:12,820
Deal.

824
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,740
- Captain Wu.
- Captain Wu.

825
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,580
Sit.

826
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:26,940
What's this?

827
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,860
You bought snacks again?

828
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:36,271
(Captain Wu, I'll pay the guesthouse fee
with snacks.)

829
00:38:36,271 --> 00:38:37,870
(Refund overpayment,
cover underpayment.)

830
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,580
Miss Tang sent you some snacks.

831
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:42,980
Thank you, Miss Tang.

832
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,020
Thank you, Captain Wu.

833
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,300
Let's eat first.

834
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,550
No one's stealing them from you.

835
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:51,980
Brigadier.

836
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:52,860
Sit.

837
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,660
- Brigadier.
- Sit.

838
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,460
Where's Zong Qing?

839
00:38:55,937 --> 00:38:57,460
He went to try on the wedding suit.

840
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,460
He's skipping lunch.

841
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,315
Tell him there's no need to try that on.

842
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,020
The unit will arrange the wedding.

843
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,180
Also, notify Tang Xin.

844
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,619
This is a great interview opportunity.

845
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,820
She won't want to miss it.

846
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,860
Come on. Eat.

847
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,180
- Hurry.
- Okay.

848
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,300
Done.

849
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,060
We've got the ocean theme.

850
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,060
Earliest time slot.

851
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,340
20 percent discount.

852
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,540
Lan Yangyang, you owe me big time.

853
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,860
I'm not going to lie.

854
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,980
You two really make a perfect match.

855
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:11,460
Of course.

856
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,460
Xin,

857
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,180
don't just watch me try these on.

858
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,860
We're in a bridal shop.

859
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,780
Can't you feel the romance in the air?

860
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,460
I'm not the one getting married.
What should I care?

861
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,980
Try one for me.

862
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,182
I want you to look beautiful.

863
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,820
Please. Pretty please.

864
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,060
Zong Qing.

865
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:41,460
Captain Wu.

866
00:40:41,582 --> 00:40:42,550
Is everything all right?

867
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,740
Captain Wu.

868
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,580
There.

869
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,020
Are you happy now?

870
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,740
What's wrong?

871
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,660
Do I look weird?

872
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,300
No, just...

873
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,460
That's really different

874
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,980
from what you usually wear.

875
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,860
Do I look good?

876
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,740
Of course.

877
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,980
So I usually look bad?

878
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,020
No.

879
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,300
You look good in everything.

880
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,580
Why are you here?

881
00:41:31,871 --> 00:41:33,060
I came to bring Zong Qing back.

882
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,340
The wedding plan is canceled.

883
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,460
