What's going on?

You were matchmade?

20
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,360
Drop it.

21
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,360
You're too pretty for that.

22
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,210
Come. Let's be serious.

23
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,210
Okay.

24
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,410
Did you see the Dayan Reef

25
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,360
rescue mission on the news?

26
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,880
I did.

27
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,520
Weren't you in charge of

28
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,850
military news after graduation?

29
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,290
Surely, you're close to the army.

30
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,080
Not close, actually.

31
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,440
But I have friends there.

32
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,290
Can you ask them some questions?

33
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:13,690
Such as?

34
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,880
Such as which unit was dispatched,

35
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,440
and who was on the rescue mission...

36
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,570
As detailed as possible.

37
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,040
Tang Xin, are you out of your mind?

38
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,920
You can't ask about those things.

39
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,410
It's not a military secret.

40
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,410
Just

41
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,200
do me this favor in private.

42
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,880
I'll try.

43
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,970
But don't be mad

44
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,530
if I can't get anything.

45
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,040
Just ask. We'll see.

46
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,810
Okay.

47
00:02:46,315 --> 00:02:48,248
What do you want to drink?
I'll order for you.

48
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,920
Americano, please.

49
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,530
Okay.

50
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,880
Hi, two americanos, please.

51
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:59,640
Okay.

52
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,040
All right.

53
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,130
Not at all.

54
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,250
Okay.

55
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,410
All right. See you.

56
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:15,920
So?

57
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,440
Confidential matters.

58
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,850
No comments.

59
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,410
You got nothing?

60
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,410
They are tight-lipped.

61
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,880
All right.

62
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,410
I asked you out for nothing.

63
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:31,410
I might as well attend
the matchmaking session.

64
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:38,720
Hi,

65
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,530
I'm Tang Xin, a journalist
from Minghua News.

66
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,290
I'd like

67
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,480
to write a special article

68
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,880
regarding the Dayan Reef mission.

69
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,737
As per the protocols,

70
00:03:44,737 --> 00:03:46,510
I came to the Military
Communication Department

71
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,880
to submit my visitation application.

72
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,720
Register here.

73
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,040
Let me check.

74
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:18,840
Thank you.

75
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,880
The queue is so long.

76
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:29,960
Right.

77
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,400
So long...

78
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,520
I like the ocean view here.

79
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,880
Let's take a photo.

80
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,960
Sure. Stand there.
I'll take a photo of you.

81
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,440
Okay.

82
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,520
Strike a pose.

83
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,893
Done.

84
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,280
What's the matter?

85
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,370
Look.

86
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,280
He's quite cute.

87
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,760
He is.

88
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,730
Since it's such a happy coincidence,

89
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,200
ask for his WeChat.

90
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,520
Go.

91
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,280
Go now.

92
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,610
Go.

93
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:21,490
(Wu Si: We need you back on the squad.)

94
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:22,610
Hurry up.

95
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,010
Go.

96
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,250
What? He left!

97
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,080
You took your time.

98
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,610
Now, he's gone.

99
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,320
Mom.

100
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,080
Where's Dad?

101
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,690
In his room.

102
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,570
I'll be on my way.

103
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,760
I...

104
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,610
Mission failed.

105
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:19,930
I advance my soldier.

106
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,130
I...

107
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,640
Your horse is blocked.

108
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:28,930
Are you sure?

109
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,200
Take my cannon.

110
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,930
Let me see.

111
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,930
I...

112
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,130
Captain Zong,

113
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,690
if you play it here, you'll lose.

114
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,490
Listen.

115
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,893
A classy spectator
never comments on a game of Xiangqi.

116
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,610
It's fine if I lose. It's okay.

117
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:45,760
I'll

118
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,250
play here.

119
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,840
Wu Si?

120
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,050
I think so.

121
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:57,960
Captain...

122
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,690
Why aren't you resting?

123
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,760
Is there something on my face?

124
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,893
Why are you staring at me?

125
00:07:04,915 --> 00:07:07,130
Come. Take a seat.

126
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,200
Wu Si,

127
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,960
tell us everything.

128
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,610
Tell you what?

129
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,250
The matchmaking session, of course.

130
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,050
Dad.

131
00:07:31,448 --> 00:07:33,782
You can give me the silence treatment
all you want.

132
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,550
I admit I lied to you.

133
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,760
But not because
of the matchmaking session.

134
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,130
Because he's in the army!

135
00:07:41,782 --> 00:07:43,050
Let me put out a disclaimer.

136
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,039
I have nothing against servicemen.

137
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,170
I grew up in a military camp.

138
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,640
I admire them greatly.

139
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,400
But

140
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,520
admiration is admiration.

141
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,490
To date one is another story.

142
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,520
Also, shouldn't you ask
if I'm okay with it

143
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,440
before setting me up
with someone single?

144
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,400
Did I not ask for your permission?

145
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,690
Did you?

146
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,570
When we first met,

147
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,280
Uncle Wang Lang and you were standing

148
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:09,250
like wedding witnesses.

149
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,690
You two were practically asking
for each other's permission.

150
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,960
So only I

151
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,400
wasn't aware that it was a date.

152
00:08:16,426 --> 00:08:18,248
How gullible. Spill it already.

153
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,130
Why didn't you tell me?

154
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,250
If I told you, I'd be asked to do 15 km

155
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,130
of rucking.

156
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:25,840
Captain,

157
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,690
is she pretty?

158
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,400
Don't be shallow.

159
00:08:30,448 --> 00:08:31,570
Appearance isn't important.

160
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,730
It is.

161
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,400
Shut your mouth.

162
00:08:33,626 --> 00:08:35,650
Do you run your mouth like that
before Wu Ke'er too?

163
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,130
Enough.

164
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,640
Stop dodging the question. Tell us.

165
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,640
We didn't meet.

166
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,250
Like I said,

167
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,560
tell Uncle Wang Lang

168
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,450
to bring me the guy who saved me
at Dayan Reef.

169
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,315
Then perhaps I might go on a date.

170
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,400
Tang Xin, you're doing this on purpose!

171
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,560
What do you mean?

172
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,680
I have nothing against you

173
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,250
or a soldier.

174
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,400
But if you want me to date a soldier,

175
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,520
my answer is no.

176
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,280
Why?

177
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,450
Okay. Tell me.

178
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,640
What is my primary school?

179
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,315
In my junior high school, was my
home class teacher a man or a woman?

180
00:09:16,315 --> 00:09:18,280
Did I pick humanities
or sciences in high school?

181
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,400
Enough already, Xin.

182
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,800
Let me finish, Mom. Look.

183
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,937
He can't even answer
those three simple questions.

184
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,970
Dad,

185
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,970
I love my country, the military,
and all servicemen.

186
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,370
But

187
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,450
I cannot be the woman behind a hero.

188
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,010
Xin!

189
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:38,730
Do you remember?

190
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,010
When I was little,

191
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,560
you were always away
with the Navy for months.

192
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,130
And when you finally came back

193
00:09:45,204 --> 00:09:46,730
and picked me up at the kindergarten,

194
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,130
I kept calling you "Mister".

195
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,130
I was almost four years old.

196
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,490
And I couldn't recognize my own father.

197
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,680
Captain Tang,

198
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,160
do you know how long it took me

199
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,800
to start calling you Dad
instead of Captain Tang?

200
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,560
Do you know how long it took me

201
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,693
to get used to your presence at home?

202
00:10:08,715 --> 00:10:10,040
Do you know when I was old enough,

203
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,160
I almost cried out of fear
when I saw you

204
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,920
sleeping next to my mom
in the same room?

205
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,490
I...

206
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,160
I even wrote a complaint letter

207
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,800
with Pinyin

208
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,920
so that I could
report you to the police.

209
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,400
My childhood is full
of foolish things like this.

210
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,160
I don't want my kids

211
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,800
to have the same childhood.

212
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,920
Then do you know who I missed the most

213
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,490
when I was in the army?

214
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,160
I missed you and your mom.

215
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,610
Yet,

216
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,280
only with the millions of us

217
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,800
stationing in the sky,

218
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,130
on the sea,

219
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,280
or by the border,

220
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,130
that we can give you peace!

221
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,610
I know.

222
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,610
So I never resent you.

223
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,800
I bragged about you all the time

224
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,582
in front of my friends
when I was little.

225
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,560
But I'm an adult now.

226
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,850
I have free will.

227
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,610
I know what I want.
I can decide for myself.

228
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,160
I don't need someone
to find me a suitor.

229
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,400
I don't need someone

230
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,370
to tell me the life I should have.

231
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,490
Even if it's from you.

232
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,040
All right, Dad.

233
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,560
The brigadier

234
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,370
postponed it to another day.

235
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,370
Another day?

236
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,280
When is it then?

237
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,370
Why do you have so many questions?

238
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,137
You are never this keen during training.

239
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,800
Extra training for you tomorrow.

240
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:10,680
Captain,

241
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,330
I have to go now.

242
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:18,850
You're staying?

243
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,040
Okay.

244
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,730
Good luck next time.

245
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,250
Go away.

246
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,090
Please.

247
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,250
Just give it another try.

248
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,400
How can you be so sure

249
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
that this guy I picked
is not the right guy?

250
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,160
- Aren't you curious?
- Stop.

251
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,560
Don't you dare cry in front of me...

252
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,730
I...

253
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,130
Just this time.

254
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,040
Just this time.

255
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,490
Give it a try.

256
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,130
Did the seawater

257
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,130
get into my head or something?

258
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,382
Who do I keep thinking about him?

259
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,860

into a group chat.)

260
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,450

(Captain Tang: Cheers to Friendship)

262
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,160
Mute it.

263
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,280
Tang Xin,

264
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,680
say something.

265
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,010
We must stay in formation.

266
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,040
I see.

267
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,610
It's my date.

268
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:07,180

to "Birds of a Feather".)

269

(Nonchalance's Moments)
Nonchalance?

270
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,330
He is in the army, all right.

271
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:15,010
He has the same Moments
as my dad's.

272
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,210
How nonchalant.

273
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,580
(Captain Tang changed the group name
to "Profound Care".)

274
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,010
Dad,

275
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,210
you do this first.

276
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,880
You can't blame me for being mean.

277
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,980

"Organic Fruits Flash Sales".)

278

Tang Xin!

280
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,520
You're driving me up the wall!

281
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,250
Change the name back.

282
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:58,400
I won't.

283
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,610
Let me change the name again.

284
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,520

285
00:15:04,715 --> 00:15:05,937

286
00:15:05,982 --> 00:15:08,004
You've been sitting here
ever since I came.

287
00:15:08,004 --> 00:15:09,560
What's so enticing?

288
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,920
What does this name mean?

00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,400
I'll unlock this door!

292
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,160
Open up!

293
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,640
All right. No need to do that.

294
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,850
I'll use a proper name, okay?

295
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,520
Change the name now.

296
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,730

Good enough.

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,693
Come with me.

379
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,315
Thanks.

380
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,210
I came

381
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,930
to express my gratitude.

382
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,840
For what?

383
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,080
For saving my life.

384
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,600
The ship caught on fire.

385
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,800
It was so dangerous.

386
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,170
Only you

387
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,800
returned to save me.

388
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,320
I didn't save you precisely.

389
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,210
We were both saved by the marine.

390
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:40,040
Whether you succeed or not
is another story.

391
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,600
But this favor of yours...

392
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,730
I will not forget it.

393
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,450
No need for that, Mr. Han.

394
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,080
I feel bad enough.

395
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,560
I asked you to help me.

396
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,970
And in return, you suffered a huge loss.

397
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,210
I am most ashamed

398
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,320
of myself.

399
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,560
It's my fault

400
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,320
for engaging a faulty ship.

401
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,982
Not only couldn't I help you,

402
00:21:00,004 --> 00:21:01,560
but I also tossed you over to the sea.

403
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,490
Let's stop taking the blame.

404
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,730
Regardless, I can't possibly

405
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,170
buy you a new ship.

406
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,280
You were never at fault anyway.

407
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,360
We did our own investigation.

408
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,960
There was a problem with the engines.

409
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,360
They short-circuited.

410
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,360
Well, I no longer have to feel guilty
about it.

411
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,520
Of course.

412
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,120
Are you free tonight?

413
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,450
I'll buy you dinner.

414
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,250
That way, I'll feel better
for ruining your plan

415
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,730
with a faulty ship.

416
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,080

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,560
Absolutely.

441
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,010

445
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,026
I see.

I like your frankness.

449
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,560
Let me know

450
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,760
if you ever need my help.

451
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:13,960
Should we take photos
or visit them in secret?

452
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,280
Let's take a page out of their playbook

453
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,520
and do a live stream.

454
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,940
(Wenzhou Zhou Xin's Jewelry)

455
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,940
(What secret does this shop hide?
Find out now.)

456
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,940
(What about this shop?
Nice one, streamer.)

457
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,380
(Is something wrong with this shop?)

458
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,300
(Are you here to decipher something?)

459
00:23:39,382 --> 00:23:40,740
(What secret does this shop hide?)

460
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,010
It looks great on you.

461
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,320
This one.

462
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,280
This one is sold out.

463
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,560
Hi, Miss. What do you need?

464
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,800
I'll pick what you like for you.

465
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,010
Can I try this one?

466
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:57,970
This one.

467
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,210
Excellent choice, Miss.

468
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,760
We imported the jade from Myanmar.

469
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,930
Look at the color.

470
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:04,970
It's green

471
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,730
and flawless.

472
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,360
We only ask for 888 yuan.

473
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,315
Other shops will ask you to pay
thousands for it.

474
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,490
Really?

475
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,690
(Call the police.)
Normal jades

476
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,520
have to go through manufacturers,
agents, and wholesalers

477
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,970
before they arrive at the shop.

478
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:21,010
But we source our gems
from Myanmar directly.

479
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,560
There are no intermediaries.

480
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,930
We import good and cheap gems.

481
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:27,930
Do you want to buy one?

482
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,010
Yes.

483
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,360
This one, please.

484
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,170
Sure. I'll pack it for you.

485
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,970
Miss, why not

486
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,600
try this jade bangle as well?

487
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,930
Its color is beautiful.

488
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:38,840
Try it.

489
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,490
Okay.

490
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:42,970
Hi, Mister.

491
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,760
(How to tell if the bangle
is real or fake?)

492
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,400
(She is so brave.)
Can I look at this one?

493
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,930
Here. Once you've made
your choice, I'll pack it for you.

494
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:50,520
Okay.

495
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,520
Okay. Give me a moment.

496
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,170
Thief!

497
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:10,560
What is going on?

498
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,840
That woman ran away with my jade bangle.

499
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,040
Thief!

500
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,300
(What secret does this shop hide?

501
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,140
(Be careful!)

502
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:29,080
Stay there.

503
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,582
(What secret does this shop hide?
Find out now.)

504
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,450
Well, are you all right?

505
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,010
I'll talk when the police are here.

506
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,520
Come.

507
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,280
Write down your personal details.

508
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:19,970
Sign it.

509
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,320
Then decide who should pay

510
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,080
for the jade bangle.

511
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,450
If there's nothing else, you may go.

512
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,280
Sir,

513
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,010
it's not just about the bangle.

514
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,450
What about my camera?

515
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,930
And Mister,

516
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:32,280
why did you go after me?

517
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,930
I thought you stole something
from someone.

518
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,010
I didn't have time
to remove the jade bangle.

519
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,040
I know you want to do good.

520
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,560
But read the situation.

521
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,280
And you didn't see the guy

522
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,360
running before me?

523
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,360
I didn't see him.

524
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,760
I saw you running like a suspect.

525
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:58,010
Fine.

526
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,600
You were careless,

527
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,280
but you acted out of goodwill.

528
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,320
I won't fault you.

529
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,010
You're a soldier?

530
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,080
Which unit?

531
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,930
In the marine.

532
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,280
My cousin is serving there too.

533
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,730
Li Xing, do you know him?

534
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,010
Mr. Officer,

535
00:27:18,204 --> 00:27:19,893
just because you're his colleague

536
00:27:19,893 --> 00:27:21,910
doesn't mean you can commit nepotism
in front of me.

537
00:27:21,915 --> 00:27:23,804
What makes you think
that this is nepotism?

538
00:27:23,826 --> 00:27:25,490
Also, we're not colleagues.

539
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,170
Wait.

540
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,560
You're in the marine, right?

541
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:36,210
Do you know who was on

542
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,271
Dayan Reef rescue mission?

543
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,210
Sorry.

544
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,490
It's a confidential matter.

545
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,760
We cannot disclose

546
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:48,280
our operations and our operators.

547
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,730
Miss,

548
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,730
what about the jade bangle?

549
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,250
Sir, I'll pay.

550
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,520
Come with me to ask the shopkeeper
about the price.

551
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,210
Sir.

552
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,010
I took the jade bangle.

553
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,280
I should pay up.

554
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,760
It's my first time seeing people fight
to pay for a broken item.

555
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,280
- It's not like we're in a restaurant.
- It's not about the money.

556
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,080
He acted out of kindness.

557
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,730
I can't punish him for being kind.

558
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:17,360
I appreciate that.

559
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,560
But in the army, we have a rule.

560
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,760
If we break something, we pay up.

561
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,490
You know what?

562
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,360
I'll pay for the jade bangle.

563
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,450
But I need you

564
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:28,930
to fix my camera.

565
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,010
That's going to take a while.

566
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,690
I'll fix it.

567
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:37,560
How can I contact you?

568
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,890
Thank you.

569
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,800
I never switch off my phone.

570
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,040
Let me know once you fix it.

571
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,010
So?

572
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,840
You pay for the bangle?

573
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,320
- Okay.
- I'll pay for the bangle.

574
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,040
Who are you?

575
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,080
Her boyfriend.

576
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,250
What are you doing here?

577
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,210
The interrupted live stream
left me hanging.

578
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,320
I had to come here to see how it goes.

579
00:29:08,871 --> 00:29:10,890
If there's nothing else,
I'll drive you home too.

580
00:29:10,893 --> 00:29:12,320
No need. I'm going back to the office.

581
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,730
I'll drive you to your office then.

582
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,560
After I fix the camera,

583
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,450
I might not be able
to give it to you in person.

584
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,320
Can I courier it to you?

585
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,800
No.

586
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,280
I have an expensive camera.

587
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,800
Let's do this in person.

588
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,970
I can come to you.

589
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,800
I'll come to you.

590
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,040
Okay.

591
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,490
Let me know once you fix it.

592
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,280
My dear.

593
00:29:58,782 --> 00:29:59,890
Let me take a look at you.

594
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,010
I've missed you.

595
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,210
Close the door.

596
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:22,520
We need to talk.

597
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,800
Are you going on another mission again?

598
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:38,410
I hope

599
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,490
you can agree to this.

600
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:48,970
You're here in Wenzhou anyway.

601
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,760
Initially, I wanted to sign it
and send it to you.

602
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:52,970
Chen.

603
00:30:53,048 --> 00:30:54,404
What is the meaning of this?

604
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,120
Chen,

605
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,730
I know living separately
can be difficult.

606
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:09,080
I'm busy with my work
so I can't see you often.

607
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,120
Let's calm down.

608
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,010
We can

609
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,450
solve whatever problems together.

610
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,490
It cannot be solved.

611
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,560
We should have divorced

612
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,650
long ago.

613
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:27,250
What do you mean?

614
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,970
Why should we get a divorce?

615
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,080
Look. Stop sulking.

616
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,760
Stop the tantrum.

617
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,280
I brought you

618
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,250
your favorite snacks. Come.

619
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,080
Come.

620
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,800
Look.

621
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,800
Take a seat.

622
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,800
Chen.

623
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,320
Potato chips.

624
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,520
Share them with your comrades.

625
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,170
And this...

626
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,650
I can count on one hand

627
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,690
the days

628
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:56,426
we spent together after we got married.

629
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,840
I know what you've been through

630
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,410
from dating me

631
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,840
to marrying me.

632
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,320
I don't want your life

633
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,800
to be affected by my choice.

634
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:07,560
I already explained

635
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,760
to you, but you never listen.

636
00:32:10,382 --> 00:32:11,160
You know what?

637
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,640
I'll call your parents

638
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,515
and ask what they think of it.

639
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:18,520
I'm serious.

640
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,730
We're both still young.

641
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,450
You have plenty of options.

642
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,490
I won't be surprised

643
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,730
if you have admirers.

644
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,730
So don't waste your time on me.

645
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,170
I'm confident enough to know

646
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:30,970
that I have admirers.

647
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,650
But I'm sure you also have admirers.

648
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,226
- Because...
- You're making things up.

649
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,170
Since you're here,

650
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,490
let's settle this.

651
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,890
We love each other.

652
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,560
How come we're talking
about a divorce now?

653
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,490
Enough.

654
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,210
I'm serious about the divorce.

655
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,970
Please think about it.

656
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,760
Bye.

657
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,210
Stop right there.

658
00:32:54,493 --> 00:32:55,730
I'm telling you now, Wang Chen.

659
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:57,360
Don't ever think about the divorce.

660
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,582
I will not agree to that.

661
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,080
Bye.

662
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:17,690
(Forgive me, Zijian.)

663
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,390
(I cannot be this selfish.)

664
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:22,490
(We've been living separately,)

665
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:25,080
(and I can't leave the army
to spend time with you.)

666
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,890
(I haven't also been able)

667
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,450
(to give you a child.)

668
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,250
How far did you run
before he tackled you?

669
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,410
At least 800 m.

670
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,120
Not bad.

671
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,840
Your athletic foundation is still there.

672
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:43,650
Yes!

673
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:44,650
You see, Dad.

674
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,320
Had the street not been crowded,

675
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,930
he wouldn't have been able to catch me.

676
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,600
Enough already.

677
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,650
He's a soldier. He can be a brute.

678
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,280
What if it leaves a scar?

679
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,210
I'm not that fragile.

680
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,360
It's just a scratch.

681
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,670
A military kid
will always have scratches.

682
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,690
Exactly.

683
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,360
Just watch your television.

684
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,293
Don't shower these two days.

685
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,640
If you wet the wound,
you slow down the recovery process.

686
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,600
I can't.

687
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:17,680
I'm attending Yangyang's graduation
ceremony tomorrow.

688
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,160
Will her father be there?

689
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,970
He wants to be there.

690
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:23,450
But Yangyang won't let him.

691
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:25,240
In case he frightens her friends.

692
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:30,450
So he's just like me.

693
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,200
You've been tinkering

694
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,080
with the pinhole camera.

695
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,890
You sure you know how to fix it?

696
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:48,450
Do you?

697
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,640
Of course. I've studied
for this at my university,

698
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,080
and I can fix it with my eyes closed.

699
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,810
Squat down.

700
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:57,200
Don't stand there. I know you're tall.

701
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,680
Take it. Fix it for me.

702
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:06,200
I knew it.

703
00:35:10,271 --> 00:35:11,490
Who are you doing this for?

704
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,010
A

705
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:17,160
heroic friend.

706
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,490
All right. Look at the camera.

707
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,560
You there. Huddle closer.

708
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,160
All right. Look at the camera.

709
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:35,160
One. Two. Three.

710
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,010
We have graduated!

711
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,330
Good.

712
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,890
One. Two. Three!

713
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,410
I have graduated.

714
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:56,720
You have finally graduated.

715
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,680
Xin!

716
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,970
When did you arrive?

717
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:02,040
A long time ago. I've been watching
you for a while.

718
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,010
It's your big day.

719
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:04,520
I said I'd be there so I must be there.

720
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,810
I finally graduated.

721
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:09,040
Should we celebrate
this important occasion?

722
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,720
Come.

723
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:10,970
Let's have milk tea.

724
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:14,680
Field medic?

725
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,720
South Sea Fleet is recruiting.

726
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:20,240
My dad sends me the enrollment list
every day.

727
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,410
He is dying to drive me there.

728
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,890
Being a field medic is not easy.

729
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,640
Do your hands still shake
when holding a scalpel?

730
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,450
Yes.

731
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,450
And I feel sick from the sight of blood.

732
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,490
You're a medical student.

733
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,330
How can you be sick
at the sight of blood?

734
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,490
This is so unfair.

735
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,520
Your father lets you pick
your major and your work.

736
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:44,490
Why are my dad
and your dad so different?

737
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,930
Let's swap dads then.

738
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:49,290
My father will ask you
to get married every day.

739
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,290
You should try that.

740
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:54,450
So did you manage to identify
your savior?

741
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:56,720
I wish.

742
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,040
Their non-disclosure rule
leaves me no choice.

743
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,970
Take it away.

744
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,450
Don't.

745
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:13,770
It's yours.

746
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,450
May you land all your shots. Keep it.

747
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:17,200
Go away.

748
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:19,850
Fine.

749
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,930
I'll use this to cheer Cheng Yuan up.

750
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:26,010
He's no longer the only
sharpshooter in our unit.

751
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,010
Don't be a snob.

752
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,930
He can defeat you

753
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,640
without using a gun.

754
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,160
We agreed to never bring this up.

755
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,040
Did you fix the camera?

756
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:39,850
Yes.

757
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,810
Guess what I discovered
after I fixed the camera?

758
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:45,450
You find out

759
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:46,160
that the camera

760
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,120
belongs to the journalist in Dayan Reef.

761
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:54,226
I recognized her right away.

762
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:55,960
But she didn't recognize me.

763
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,680
I don't think she ever will.

764
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,680
The mission is over.

765
00:38:02,426 --> 00:38:04,315
She has nothing to do with me anymore.

766
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:06,893
I don't want to get myself
into any trouble either.

767
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,640
But the trouble
might come to you instead.

768
00:38:11,204 --> 00:38:13,290
When I was catching a thief
several days ago,

769
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,450
I broke my camera.

770
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:17,010
I asked the marine guy

771
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:18,120
to fix it for me.

772
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,010
After it's done,

773
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,720
I'll ask him to send it back.

774
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,890
And then?

775
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,120
That's how you build connections.

776
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,890
I create opportunities from nothing.

777
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:29,560
What a convoluted way.

778
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,600
You might as well barge into the camp.

779
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:38,200
The queue is still that long.

780
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,330
It's just milk tea.

781
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,930
Why can't they buy one somewhere else?

782
00:38:40,937 --> 00:38:42,120
Why must they queue up here?

783
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,520
Different shops make a difference.

784
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,490
You won't get it.

785
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,370
What?

786
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,160
Xin, hear me out.

787
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,410
This shop is my lucky star.

788
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,240
What do you mean?

789
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,160
Remember the cute guy

790
00:38:55,226 --> 00:38:56,248
I mentioned in the car

791
00:38:56,248 --> 00:38:57,680
that I have a huge crush on?

792
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,930
We met here.

793
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,810
Now, that's lucky.

794
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,410
Look. What do you think?

795
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,010
Isn't he super cute?

796
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:18,160
He's not bad.

797
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,040
But I remember

798
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,370
that when you were little, you swore
to marry a soldier.

799
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,410
Did you understand the answer

800
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:28,680
the lecturer provided just now?

801
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,330
I don't understand it either.

802
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:31,850
It's so difficult.

803
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,640
Yes, it's so difficult.

804
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,370
The exam is around the corner.

805
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,600
What do we do?

806
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,250
Should we find a tutor?

807
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:45,890
Sure.

808
00:39:47,337 --> 00:39:49,304
(Zong Qing: Hey, it's Zong Qing.
Are you at school?)

809
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:53,500
(I'm nearby due to work. I brought
milk tea and cakes. Do you like them?)

810
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:55,930
What's the matter?

811
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:58,410
Carry this for me.

812
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:05,100
(Lan Yangyang: Yes! I'm there.
I want them!)

813
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,370
Captain Zong,

814
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,010
it's about time we head back.

815
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,370
Listen.

816
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,370
Go back first.

817
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,370
I'll be right there.

818
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,370
Here I am.

819
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,890
You're in the army?

820
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,537
I came out to do some grocery.

821
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:39,810
Here.

822
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,330
Thank you.

823
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,200
I should get going.

824
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,200
You're leaving already? We just met.

825
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,410
It's time for me to head back.

826
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:50,410
Goodbye.

827
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:53,240
Bye.

828
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,110
All right.

829
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,450
Stop grinning like a fool.

830
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,200
You can't be that smitten.

831
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,370
You don't get it.

832
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,930
Once love finds you,

833
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,370
you'll be smitten before you know it.

834
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:17,680
Yes, I don't get it.

835
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:21,560
But if you're happy, I'm happy.

836
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:22,560
Come.

837
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:25,410
A toast to a dream come true.

838
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:27,600
You've found a military boyfriend.

839
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:29,810
Isn't it romantic?

840
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:32,490
Dating a soldier is this romantic.

841
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,160
Have you thought about

842
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,160
what your father would do

843
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,782
if he found out about your secret beau?

844
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,370
He has been keeping you
under his protection

845
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:44,370
so that you don't start dating
at a young age.

846
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:46,200
And now, as soon as you graduate...

847
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,010
Listen up, Tang Xin.

848
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:50,450
Never tell my dad about this.

849
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:52,370
I'll break the news to him myself.

850
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:56,370
All right.

851
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,890
I'll keep this a secret.

852
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,770
No problem at all.

853
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,890
But you have to do me a favor.

854
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:05,410
If my camera plan fails,

855
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:09,290
I might need to borrow
your military boyfriend.
