I'm heading out for a breather.

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,570
Dad...

23
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:18,810
Wu Si.

24
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,530
You should know

25
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,760
that both Tang Xin's dad and I

26
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,830
like you.

27
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,880
Her dad likes you

28
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,760
because you're a good boy.

29
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,250
Naturally, I like you

30
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,200
because my daughter

31
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,970
adores you.

32
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,970
Mrs. Tang.

33
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,160
I know.

34
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,040
And I understand.

35
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,460
She's our only daughter.

36
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,440
Since we're entrusting her to you,

37
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,440
I hope you can promise me

38
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,370
you'll never make Xin

39
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,530
shed even a single tear.

40
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,530
You have my word.

41
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,570
Good.

42
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,110
Cheng Yuan!

43
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,310
Ke'er!

44
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,226
What made you decide
to do this hot air balloon ride?

45
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,810
We couldn't make it
to the romantic Turkey,

46
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,290
but we're still able to check out

47
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,900
the beauty of Wenzhou.

48
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,040
It's definitely time for me to do so.

49
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,448
I've been in military for years,
but I've never checked it out.

50
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,010
Dad.

51
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:43,760
Dad.

52
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,640
What are you doing?

53
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,490
What are your eyes for?

54
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,050
Can't you see what I'm up to?

55
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,400
Well, you really stand out
with your dance moves.

56
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,400
I'm here to pick you up.
Let's head home now.

57
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,760
Let's call it a day.

58
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,400
Wait... I'm still dancing.

59
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,930
You've messed up my tempo.

60
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:17,640
Captain.

61
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,640
Let's go home.

62
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,730
I admit my mistake.

63
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,130
I promise I'll never do that again.

64
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,400
Let's go home.

65
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,730
Don't forget the stuff.

66
00:05:54,182 --> 00:05:55,660
- Let's go.
- Look at how smug he is.

67
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,080
Leave it to me.

68
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,170
Get it for him.

69
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,170
Don't drop it.

70
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,010
Here, I want one too.

71
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,200
Well, your dad can't do it.

72
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,440
I'll get one for you.

Are you here to see me off?

I feel a bit dizzy wearing these.

103
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,880
These are corrective glasses.

104
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,280
They're not matched
to your current vision.

105
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,220
Your eyesight
will gradually deteriorate,

106
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:44,093
so the glasses
will become more suitable over time.

107
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,400
How thoughtful. Thank you.

108
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:57,920
Here you go.

109
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,610
It's nothing.

110
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,520
They're all painkillers.

111
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,370
Your eyes
might start to hurt more and more.

112
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,400
Use them wisely.

113
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,040
I'm a veteran.

114
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,040
No need to remind me.

115
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,970
We might not see each other again.

116
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,610
Let me wish you in advance.

117
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:35,210

I hope you're happy.

00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,130
Hold on.

123
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,730
When did you get this injury?

124
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,970
That's a pretty big wound.

125
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,160
Does it hurt?

126
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,090
Clean it with some iodine.

127
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,850
No matter the content,
training is training.

128
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,040
Safety comes first, got it?

129
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Training is temporary.

130
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,090
Your body is for life,

131
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,760
so take it step by step.

132
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:23,160
Come on.

133
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:24,920
Here.

134
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:25,730
Gas!

135
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,520
Move!

136
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:20,730
Reporting in!

137
00:11:21,537 --> 00:11:23,010
How did they do, Captain Zong?

138
00:11:25,404 --> 00:11:27,537
You don't need me
to announce the results, do you?

139
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,450
Tear gas escape.

140
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,450
Gear grab. Underwater shooting.

141
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,537
One person got full marks.

142
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,090
I want you all to remember his face.

143
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,130
His name is Yi Nanwang.

144
00:11:38,426 --> 00:11:40,160
Because of him,
the rest of you scored zero.

145
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,850
Sir. May I come up now?

146
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:45,250
Go ahead.

147
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,160
Yes, Sir.

148
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:58,490
Hello?

149
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,130
Sir, here's a quick update.

150
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,400
The first batch of recovered artifacts

151
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,680
has been delivered to the island.

152
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,426
Roughly how many are there?

153
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,130
About a hundred pieces.

154
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,250
Everything else normal?

155
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:15,880
All normal.

156
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,610
Okay. Got it.

157
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:19,970
Good work.

158
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:26,920
Dad.

159
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,210
It's time to eat.

160
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,400
Okay.

161
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,160
That boat made the delivery.

162
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:38,610
It's done?

163
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,920
Everything's stored at the base.

164
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,280
Aren't we going to the island
to check on it?

165
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,850
Get yourself ready.
We'll go in a couple of days.

166
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:46,640
Sure.

167
00:12:53,493 --> 00:12:54,800
Here's Wang Chen's transfer order.

168
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,880
Take a look.

169
00:12:58,271 --> 00:13:00,060
(Due to physical reasons,
Comrade Wang Chen is hereby)

170
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,700
(transferred from Blue Blade to
Instructional Unit as an instructor.)

171
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,640
I spoke to Wang Chen.

172
00:13:03,937 --> 00:13:05,160
We've decided to transfer her

173
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,226
to the base's instructional unit
as an instructor.

174
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,210
She didn't want you to know

175
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:11,648
because that made her
feel like a deserter.

176
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:13,920
However,

177
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,280
you know how bad her injury was.

178
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,090
Even after all her effort,

179
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,680
this is as much as she's recovered.

180
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,330
Her body can no longer handle

181
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,880
Blue Blade's intense training anymore.

182
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,730
For the sake of her well-being,

183
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,970
I've decided

184
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,850
to put her somewhere more suitable.

185
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,280
Well,

186
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,680
that's settled.

187
00:13:38,337 --> 00:13:39,250
No more discussion.

188
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,970
Let's talk about you.

189
00:13:45,871 --> 00:13:47,010
After much consideration,

190
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,920
the organization

191
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,490
hopes you'll take on
greater responsibility.

192
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:54,850
Brigadier.

193
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,130
I don't think I'm qualified.

194
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,640
Let's skip the modesty today.

195
00:14:01,315 --> 00:14:03,130
It's not like
you're taking over right away.

196
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,210
The official appointment

197
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,626
will have to wait until the party
committee makes a decision.

198
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,760
Tonight,
I'm taking Wang Chen out for hotpot.

199
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,680
You'll join us.

200
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,490
Let's have a nice farewell gathering.

201
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,760
Yes, Sir.

202
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,210
Enemy presence is heavy ahead.

203
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,850
Enemy presence is light ahead.

204
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,490
Possible heavy enemy presence ahead.

205
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,210
Possible light enemy presence ahead.

206
00:14:56,582 --> 00:14:58,250
The path ahead is clear.
Proceed quickly.

207
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,130
Private, slow down.
Maintain order while diving.

208
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,850
Halt.

209
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,800
Diving team training complete, Sir.

210
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,610
Awaiting orders.

211
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,280
At ease.

212
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:06,880
Yes, Sir.

213
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,010
At ease.

214
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,370
Did no one teach you

215
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,400
that descent speed

216
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,280
should not exceed fifteen meters
per minute?

217
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,680
We were taught that, Sir.

218
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,560
Really?

219
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:19,880
Headache?

220
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:20,560
Yes.

221
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,090
No.

222
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,090
Yes or no?

223
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,130
No, Sir.

224
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,610
Underwater training isn't like

225
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,970
your usual speed-focused drills.

226
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,610
Let me remind you again.

227
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,010
Descending too fast

228
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,730
can lead to nitrogen narcosis

229
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,210
and decompression sickness.

230
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,640
Not only
is that dangerous to your health,

231
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:35,730
but it could also

232
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,450
cost you your life.

233
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,010
What's it?

234
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,370
Do you want to be one-dive-only divers?

235
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,610
- No, Sir!
- No, Sir!

236
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,090
Zheng Hao.

237
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:46,730
Here!

238
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,400
Visit the infirmary.

239
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,370
After that,
copy the training manual 100 times.

240
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,130
Yes, Sir!

241
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,450
Hungry?

242
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,471
- Yes, Sir!
- Yes, Sir!

243
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,320
Want to eat?

244
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,320
- Yes, Sir!
- Yes, Sir!

245
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,120
Tough it out.

246
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:19,930
Next subject.

247
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,520
Dress right, dress!

248
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,560
Eyes front!

249
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,280
Right turn!

250
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,760
March!

251
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,760
Your transfer order is in.

252
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,080
I'm sorry, Captain.

253
00:17:44,182 --> 00:17:45,450
I didn't talk to you about it.

254
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,840
I wanted to leave
while Yi Nanwang was off at training.

255
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,650
Cheng Yuan just left.

256
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,170
If he knew I was leaving too,

257
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,410
I was afraid he'd break down.

258
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,280
You hid it from me
because you were afraid I'd break down?

259
00:17:59,715 --> 00:18:02,626
You wanted to leave before I officially
rejoined the team, didn't you?

260
00:18:03,471 --> 00:18:04,650
I didn't keep it from you.

261
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,600
I just wanted to train the rookies more

262
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,840
before I left.

263
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,840
I'll teach them everything I know

264
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,210
since they'll be on the front line.

265
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,600
Why are you leaving?

266
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,210
Is it because of your family

267
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:16,760
or

268
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,520
Cheng Yuan?

269
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,280
Both.

270
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,320
During my recovery,

271
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,410
I kept telling myself,

272
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,320
no matter how hard it got,

273
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,450
as long as I could stay
in the Marine Corps,

274
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,120
I could get through anything.

275
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,930
I always thought

276
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,040
I was pretty brave.

277
00:18:39,093 --> 00:18:40,960
It wasn't until that day
I saw Cheng Yuan off

278
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,600
that I realized

279
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,930
what real bravery is.

280
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,600
Cheng Yuan is clear-headed.

281
00:18:49,493 --> 00:18:50,690
And I'm nothing like him.

282
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,360
He chose to leave

283
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,120
because he knew

284
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,690
he had nothing more to offer Blue Blade.

285
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,040
I knew I was the same.

286
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,280
I was just too stubborn

287
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:03,970
to admit it.

288
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,650
We all treat Blue Blade as our home.

289
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,410
But a squad

290
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,280
should always be young
and moving forward.

291
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,040
After Cheng Yuan's departure,

292
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,280
there's still Yi Nanwang.

293
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,210
After I leave,

294
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,520
there will be more
fresh blood coming in.

295
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,410
No soldier

296
00:19:23,626 --> 00:19:25,080
wants to be their comrades' burden.

297
00:19:26,471 --> 00:19:27,760
Stepping away from the front line

298
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,040
is the last thing I can do

299
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,890
for Blue Blade.

300
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,970
You'll always be part of Blue Blade.

301
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:43,840
You've worked hard all these years.

302
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,410
I, Captain Wang Chen,

303
00:19:47,493 --> 00:19:49,426
am always ready for duty
with Blue Blade.

304
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,840
We respect your decision.

305
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,650
(Cheng Yuan, I'm going home.)

306
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,760
(I didn't tell you on purpose)

307
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,080
(because once I see you,)

308
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,450
(I won't be able to leave.)

309
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,040
(Honestly,)

310
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,450
(at first, I didn't understand)

311
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,690
(why you were reluctant
to leave the team.)

312
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,690
(I just thought,)

313
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,560
(if you couldn't come back,)

314
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,120
(then I'd go to you.)

315
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,410
(New recruits weren't allowed
to use phones.)

316
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,010
(You tried calling me,
but couldn't get through.)

317
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,450
(I borrowed the squad leader's phone
to call you,)

318
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,760
(and you were busy.)

319
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,560
(That was my toughest, most exhausting,)

320
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,360
(most confusing time.)

321
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,210
(But you were never by my side.)

322
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,600
(It felt like we were in a relationship)

323
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,450
(across parallel worlds.)

324
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,970
(We were guarding the same land)

325
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,600
(each in our own way.)

326
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,840
(Back then, I didn't understand you)

327
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,360
(or what was so special
about the military.)

328
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,210
(It wasn't until the day
I took off my own uniform)

329
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,840
(that I finally understood
what being a soldier means.)

330
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,320
(I understood
that someone is always holding the line)

331
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:13,280
(behind this peaceful life.)

332
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,280
(I enlisted for you.)

333
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,760
(Now I'm retiring for myself.)

334
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,600
(I hope we both live well.)

335
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,120
(And I hope your life)

336
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,520
(is always bright and sunny.)

337
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,890
(Keep moving forward.)

338
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,840
This dinner

339
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,490
is both a celebration

340
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:35,080
of Wang Chen's return to the team

341
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,450
and a farewell send-off.

342
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,170
Boy, you're just here
for the free food, you know that?

343
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,080
Here, Wang Chen.

344
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:48,560
Captain Chen.

345
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:49,970
Cheers

346
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,840
to a new chapter in your life.

347
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,450
Blue Blade has a lot of soldiers now.

348
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,560
You two were my first batch.

349
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,360
From Wu Si to Yi Nanwang,

350
00:22:08,826 --> 00:22:10,210
it's been ten years, hasn't it?

351
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,690
Yes.

352
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,080
In those ten years,

353
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,320
you two have always been my strength.

354
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,320
I gave you
all the hardest, toughest missions.

355
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,280
I never praised you before.

356
00:22:22,315 --> 00:22:23,448
Let me make up for that now.

357
00:22:24,537 --> 00:22:25,782
You completed every mission

358
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,490
with excellence.

359
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,840
Each one of you

360
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,360
is an outstanding member
of the Chinese Navy.

361
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:37,320
Wang Chen's journey
hasn't been an easy one.

362
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,840
It's time to retire.

363
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:41,970
She has a family now.

364
00:22:42,448 --> 00:22:45,080
That means you have more
responsibilities than just the military.

365
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,250
During my years of service,

366
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,650
my wife has held our home together.

367
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,600
Thus,

368
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,250
military spouses have it even harder.

369
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,560
After retirement,

370
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,800
don't fight with Bai.

371
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,210
Don't get mad at him either.

372
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,040
You

373
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,210
living your life well

374
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,930
is also a contribution to our country.

375
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,600
Now that you're transferring,

376
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,800
don't you want to say something to us?

377
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,320
Brigadier.

378
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,560
I don't think that's necessary.

379
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,320
Fine.

380
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,280
You don't have to.

381
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,280
We all understand.

382
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,210
Just remember to come back
and visit us often.

383
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,930
Here, eat up. Go ahead.

384
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,040
Let's eat.

385
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,210
Come on.

386
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,930
Help yourself too, silly boy.

387
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,690
Honestly, at first,

388
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,970
I thought

389
00:23:46,937 --> 00:23:49,280
Zong Qing would be the first
to leave among all of you.

390
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,840
From the military academy to the unit,

391
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,693
that boy had big ambitions
and little patience.

392
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,560
But he really had talent.

393
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,240
When I asked his company commander
for him,

394
00:23:58,248 --> 00:23:59,290
the commander told me,

395
00:23:59,293 --> 00:24:01,080
"Forget it. He's leaving."

396
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,600
I thought it'd be a real shame to lose

397
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,080
such a promising young soldier.

398
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,490
So I had to bring him in.

399
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:08,450
Do you remember

400
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,840
how Cheng Yuan managed
to recruit Zong Qing?

401
00:24:11,004 --> 00:24:12,320
The rifle wasn't even calibrated.

402
00:24:12,382 --> 00:24:14,690
It took him one single match
to beat him fair and square.

403
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:25,730
Well...

404
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,600
Cheng Yuan managed
to make Zong Qing stay.

405
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,840
But I couldn't keep Cheng Yuan.

406
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,450
He's the only outstanding sniper

407
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,170
I have.

408
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:46,690
And now he's gone.

409
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,080
Sir.

410
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,730
Speak.

411
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,210
May I...

412
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,490
May I...

413
00:25:14,626 --> 00:25:16,137
transfer out of the front line?

414
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,560
Dress right, dress!

415
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,450
Eyes front!

416
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:29,690
At ease!

417
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,080
Subject!

418
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,690
Concealment training.

419
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,170
Location,

420
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:39,840
500 meters radius, centered on me.

421
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,730
Duration is one hour.

422
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,600
If I don't find you

423
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
in an hour, you pass the evaluation.

424
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,970
Understood?

425
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:47,970
Understood!

426
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,560
Dismissed!

427
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,280
Here's the thing.

428
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,360
I don't think I'm mentally ready.

429
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,730
I don't know
if I'm cut out to be a captain.

430
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,840
If I'm not,

431
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,970
staying in this position

432
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,137
is being irresponsible
to the front-line soldiers.

433
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,450
Therefore,

434
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,170
there will be
someone more suitable than me

435
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,320
to take this post.

436
00:26:28,293 --> 00:26:30,450
You've been holding that in
for a while, haven't you?

437
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,320
Ever since my conversation

438
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,320
with your counselor,

439
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:36,600
I could tell

440
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,320
you had something to say.

441
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,970
So I asked you here

442
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,560
to give you a chance to say it.

443
00:26:45,848 --> 00:26:47,040
Have you made up your mind?

444
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:47,970
Where to go?

445
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,450
Administration? Logistics?

446
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:52,450
Or

447
00:26:53,226 --> 00:26:54,320
join the instructional unit

448
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,840
like Wang Chen is doing?

449
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,210
Once you've decided, submit a report.

450
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,490
I'll personally hand it in for you.

451
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,970
I bet that's just
an impulsive thought of his.

452
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,280
You're not actually submitting it,

453
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:09,560
right?

454
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,930
I thought...

455
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,840
I thought...

456
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,560
I could...

457
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,280
I could lead them out there

458
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,560
and bring them back

459
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:28,730
unharmed.

460
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,210
But now, I can't even...

461
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,080
Wu Si.

462
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,450
You know very well

463
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,560
why I pushed through rehab so hard.

464
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,280
It was all

465
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,930
for the day I could rejoin the team.

466
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,080
Now I'm back.

467
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,970
Yet my physical condition

468
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:51,320
doesn't allow me
to return to my previous position.

469
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,690
I'm just like Cheng Yuan.

470
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,280
We didn't quit because we wanted to.

471
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,080
If we had any choice,

472
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,690
we wouldn't have done that.

473
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,520
You don't know how much I envy you

474
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,490
who can still fight on the front line.

475
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:11,730
Cheng Yuan and I retired
due to injuries.

476
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,970
You're different.

477
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,360
Your reason might convince
the brigadier,

478
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,560
but not me.

479
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,970
Does Cheng Yuan know

480
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,210
you're leaving?

481
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,280
What would he think if he did?

482
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:29,210
We're comrades-in-arms
who've faced death together.

483
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:31,080
When you're facing the enemy

484
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,930
on the battlefield,

485
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,871
you've got your teammates
watching your back.

486
00:28:34,915 --> 00:28:36,293
That's how it should be.

487
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,600
It wasn't your fault
that we got injured.

488
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,120
And it's not an excuse
for you to retreat.

489
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,800
Alright, enough of that.

490
00:28:51,471 --> 00:28:53,493
People come and go.
That's how military works.

491
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,800
They say paths will cross again someday.

492
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,840
But that's just wishful thinking.

493
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,890
Bear this in mind.

494
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,560
No matter what choices you make,

495
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,840
no matter where life takes you,

496
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,760
even if you're far away,

497
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,250
there will always be
the same military flag shining over you.

498
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,080
Out. What's your name?

499
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,320
Lin Feng, Sir!

500
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,120
Speak up. Name?

501
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,650
Wang Kun, Sir!

502
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:53,760
Out.

503
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,800
Out.

504
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,280
Name?

505
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,320
Fu Guoqiang, Sir!

506
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,520
State your name.

507
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,490
Chen He, Sir!

508
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:23,170
State your name.

509
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,280
Wang Yang, Sir!

510
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,840
Name?

511
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,650
Chen Bao, Sir!

512
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,360
Fall in!

513
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,650
Dress right!

514
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,800
Eyes front!

515
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,560
Count off!

516
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,560
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven!

517
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:45,490
One short.

518
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,450
Yi Nanwang!

519
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,120
Time's up.

520
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,120
You win. Come out.

521
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:09,490
Here!

522
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:20,248
Why were you hiding in the tent?

523
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:21,560
Captain Zong.

524
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,970
I remember you once said

525
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,250
any method is allowed
in concealment training.

526
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:27,170
Who taught you that?

527
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:28,410
Cheng Yuan?

528
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,450
When did you get back?

529
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,890
I didn't hear you at all.

530
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,360
What's the matter?

531
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:03,690
This is upsetting.

532
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,010
This is too much.

533
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,490
I watched each of them
put on their uniforms.

534
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,650
They were the best soldiers
I ever trained.

535
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,650
I can't bear to see them go.

536
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,970
But I can't make them stay.

537
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:33,930
This is upsetting.

538
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,410
This is too much.

539
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,730
Honey?

540
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,010
Working overtime at the hospital?

541
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:30,890
That's right.

542
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,490
I'm the backbone of our department now.

543
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:35,560
I've got piles of work
to review every day.

544
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,490
Still got the energy to joke around?
Not tired?

545
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:40,840
Are you on night training?

546
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,320
How'd you answer the call so fast?

547
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,280
We just finished training.

548
00:33:44,337 --> 00:33:46,250
I'm about to go set up
the course for them.

549
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,120
Don't push them so hard.

550
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:49,760
You're acting like a drill sergeant.

551
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:51,560
Are you feeling sorry for them?

552
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,480
I'm telling you. No pain, no gain.

553
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,970
I got where I am by grinding,
but you never felt bad for me.

554
00:33:57,626 --> 00:33:58,560
Let's drop the subject.

555
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,250
Here, look at the moon. Isn't it round?

556
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,560
Now take a look at your handsome hubby.

557
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,330
Well? Handsome or not?

558
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,290
Honey.

559
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:17,770
I miss you so much.

560
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,490
I miss you too, Honey.

561
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:33,850
Keep up.

562
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,520
Come on, keep up. Check this out.

563
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,600
Mom, Dad, you're home.

564
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:44,810
Captain Tang.

565
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:45,810
Wu Si.

566
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:46,810
There you are.

567
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,640
Are you here to freeload again?

568
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,600
You treat our place like your own, huh?

569
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,600
What are you talking about?

570
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,890
It's a holiday.
Of course you should eat with us.

571
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:56,560
Well, I'll make you something tasty.

572
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,080
Hold on...

573
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,890
What's this?

574
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,930
Let's play together.

575
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:03,080
Look.

576
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,080
Look at that.

577
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,560
Hey, you two...

578
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,640
You forgot what day

579
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,410
it is?

580
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,450
It's New Year's Day!

581
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,370
Yeah, New Year's Day!
It's New Year's Day!

582
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,080
New Year's Day!

583
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:20,680
It's Wang Lang's daughter's
hundred-day feast!

584
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,071
- Hurry up and get ready!
- Indeed!

585
00:35:22,115 --> 00:35:23,782
How could you forget? Seriously!

586
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,860
(Zong Qing)

587
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:10,970
Hello.

588
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:11,600
Hi.

589
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,600
Is Lan Yangyang in the OR right now?

590
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,600
Not at the moment.

591
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,410
Thank you.

592
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:17,040
You're welcome.

593
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,890
Anesthesiologist,
please report to OR 309.

594
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:19,600
Honey?

595
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,770
What are you doing here?

596
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:23,810
I took time off,
even if just for a few hours.

597
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,810
But I've got a surgery starting now.

598
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,080
Lan Yangyang, take a break.

599
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,330
I'll deal with this surgery.

600
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,560
Why isn't Zong Qing here yet?

601
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,290
He just called,

602
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,930
and he said he only got a few hours off.

603
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,120
And he went to the hospital.

604
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:01,890
She's so beautiful!

605
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,770
She looks like Lin Lan.

606
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,560
Right? She's not like him at all.

607
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:08,680
She's so adorable
with those long lashes!

608
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,890
No, she takes after me.

609
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,426
Daughters always take after their dads.

610
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:13,370
Yeah, she looks like both of you.

611
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,370
How lovely.

612
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,290
Where's Wu Si?

613
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:19,450
Why isn't he here yet?

614
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:21,810
Don't even mention it.
He didn't pick up his phone.

615
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,248
He's been acting all mysterious.

616
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,850
He must have something important
going on.

617
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,410
He's picking up something.

618
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,290
Yeah, let him take his time.

619
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,330
Don't rush him.

620
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:32,770
What is he even picking up?

621
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:44,200
Sir, looking for a ring?

622
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,330
Yes, an engagement ring.

623
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,450
Of course. Please wait a moment.

624
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,600
Well,

625
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,080
I set you and Wu Si up.

626
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,410
His day has finally come.

627
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,370
I've completed the mission

628
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,600
your dad gave me.

629
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,330
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

630
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:21,890
Captain.

631
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,640
Don't worry, just entrust Xin to Wu Si.

632
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,770
Well,

633
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:28,890
he's definitely solid.

634
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:30,200
I trust him.

635
00:38:30,293 --> 00:38:31,370
I know what he's made of.

636
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:33,890
Mrs. Tang.

637
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,770
Here.

638
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,850
Wu Si is the best soldier I've ever had.

639
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:39,560
Now I'm entrusting him to you.

640
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,640
From today on, you can scold or hit him,

641
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,930
but please take good care of him.

642
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,450
You've got it.

643
00:38:46,093 --> 00:38:47,330
Thank you too, Wang Lang.

644
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,810
- Here.
- A toast to you both.

645
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,110
- Sure. Thanks.
- How wonderful.

646
00:38:50,115 --> 00:38:50,737
Thank you.

647
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:55,290
Mr. Wang, I'd like to point this out.

648
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:57,040
You made it

649
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,330
sound like Wu Si's marrying
into my family.

650
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,770
Why? Now that we're married,
you're done with him?

651
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,560
Even if I want to keep guiding him,
I can't do that anymore.

652
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,090
Although we're in the same brigade,

653
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,200
we'll barely see each other.

654
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,290
What do you mean?

655
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:19,410
Wu Si told me
he's transferring out of the front line.

656
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,450
What are you doing out here?

657
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,520
Where have you been?

658
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,520
I went to buy something.

659
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,330
An engagement ring?

660
00:39:50,537 --> 00:39:52,200
I knew the brigadier would let it slip.

661
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,450
What's with the transfer?

662
00:40:02,248 --> 00:40:03,600
Just a normal reassignment.

663
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,490
Normal?

664
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,330
Would they really take
a special ops captain

665
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:10,370
who's been fighting on the front lines
and put him in logistics?

666
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,040
That doesn't mean leaving the army.

667
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:15,410
It's just a change of pace and place.

668
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,850
I'll still be serving and shining.

669
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,370
So it's because of me?

670
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,040
I've already made up my mind.

671
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,600
Please don't ask anymore.

672
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:28,290
I won't.

673
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,560
And I'll respect your decision.

674
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,330
But only if

675
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:34,160
this decision

676
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,640
is truly what you want,

677
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,240
not just because front-line service

678
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:40,680
is too demanding or dangerous

679
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,271
so you don't have time for our family

680
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,450
or because you're doubting yourself

681
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:46,120
or trying to ease my worries.

682
00:40:50,182 --> 00:40:52,271
I just want
to take responsibility for you.

683
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:54,330
And I'm doing this

684
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,520
for the sake of our future.

685
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:02,080
Are you trying to convince me

686
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,560
or yourself?

687
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,040
I've made up my mind.

688
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,010
In fact, whenever

689
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,850
you try to be avoidant,

690
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,850
I already know the answer.

691
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,450
Even this time.

692
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:22,330
So I'm sorry,

693
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:25,080
but I can't accept your proposal now.

694
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,080
This isn't the kind of marriage I want.

695
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:39,160
Should I bring her a jacket?

696
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,120
Leave her be.

697
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,120
Should I go check on her?

698
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,680
No. All of us just stay out of it.

699
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:04,890
When I had my transfer,

700
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,410
