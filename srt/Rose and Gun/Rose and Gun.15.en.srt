Wu Si.

Am I dreaming?

21
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,250
Why are you here?

22
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,130
We came to An
for a military competition

23
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,480
and just got a notice from the Embassy

24
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,880
that two Chinese citizens
had gone missing nearby,

25
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,880
so we rushed here.

26
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,690
Are you hurt?

27
00:02:39,382 --> 00:02:41,693
Did you not eat for the past few days
in the jungle?

28
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:42,920
Are you hungry?

29
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:55,970
Do you know?

30
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,320

the two missing Chinese citizens

00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,920
were you and Yangyang,

Doc, is there something wrong?

No, there's no problem with her health.

43
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,570
She just needs two days of rest
and to avoid moving.

44
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,130
And that's all.

45
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:53,920
Thanks.

46
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,690
You're welcome.

47
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,090
Thank you.

48
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:02,810
Please.

49
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,440
I see it.

50
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,760
Don't twist it.

51
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,760
Xin, please sit.

52
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,400
Well,

53
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,880
how are you?

54
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,200
Are you okay?

55
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,690
I'm good. Just a bit dehydrated.

56
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,730
I'll eat something

57
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,930
and rest when I get back.

58
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,320
Where's Captain Wu?

59
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,130
Captain Wu

60
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,400
has been exhausted
from the competition.

61
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,880
We let him nap over there.

62
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,730
What are you holding?

63
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,960
His hearing aid.

64
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,250
Hearing aid?

65
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,610
What happened?

66
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,170
Oh, you didn't know.

67
00:04:50,493 --> 00:04:52,026
A few days ago, during the competition,

68
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:54,130
Captain Wu went too deep underwater
too fast,

69
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,826
and it caused temporary hearing damage.

70
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,010
Is it serious?

71
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,640
Pretty serious.

72
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,010
He couldn't hear us.

73
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,250
But he refused to wear it.

74
00:06:09,671 --> 00:06:11,804
He's quite good-looking
even when he's sleeping.

75
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,440
Ever since we returned from Mazhan Town,

76
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,640
I've been avoiding you.

77
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,400
You probably found that weird, right?

78
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,130
I bet you never figured it out.

79
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,730
It wasn't about the Dayan Reef.

80
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,130
I wasn't mad at you
because you kept it from me.

81
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:54,640
It's because

82
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,610
for the first time in my life,
you made me a joke,

83
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:57,490
you know?

84
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,930
Why do you have to be a soldier?

85
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,440
My parents

86
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,880
and all my friends know

87
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,130
I've always said,

88
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,930
"I, Tang Xin,

89
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,930
will never date a soldier."

90
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,760
But look at me now.

91
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,690
I fell for you.

92
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,520
You have no idea

93
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,315
how awkward it has been these days.

94
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,440
If this gets out,

95
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,893
how am I supposed to face everyone

96
00:07:32,937 --> 00:07:33,648
in Wenzhou?

97
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,010
Do you know you're kind of handsome?

98
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,320
I still remember

99
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:54,960
at Yangyang's wedding,

100
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,370
you were wearing

101
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,320
that military uniform.

102
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,490
My heart skipped a beat.

103
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,880
Now I know how those
who are big fans of uniforms feel.

104
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,640
But you're not allowed
to wear that behind my back!

105
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,960
If you do wear it,

106
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,520
you'd better not show off your charm
like you did that day.

107
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,840
Or else I'll lock you up

108
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,760
in a safe.

109
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,610
You hear me?

110
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,490
Oh, I forgot.

111
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,130
You can't hear right now.

112
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,490
Anyways,

113
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,130
thank you

114
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,490
for always being there

115
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,640
when I needed it the most.

116
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,320
Just now,

117
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,804
I couldn't help but kiss you
in the jungle.

118
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:21,800
Sorry about that.

119
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,730
It's fine.

120
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,520
Why are you awake?

121
00:09:32,293 --> 00:09:34,293
You didn't hear what I said just now,
did you?

122
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,880
They said something's wrong
with your hearing.

123
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,370
You need a hearing aid.

124
00:09:40,626 --> 00:09:42,090
You didn't hear anything, right?

125
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,490
It's already healed.

126
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,800
But it's fine.

127
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,490
I can pretend

128
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,880
I didn't hear a thing.

129
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,560
You said that.

130
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:58,760
Anyway, you didn't hear anything

131
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,760
I said just now.

132
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,937
I didn't say anything at all.

133
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,130
What did you say?

134
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,490
Uniforms?

135
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,330
Show off charm?

136
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,330
- Lock me up in a safe?
- Wu Si!

137
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,800
I knew it.

138
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,210
Cheng Yuan and you

139
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,760
teamed up

140
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,090
to get something out of me, right?

141
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,760
If so,

142
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,250
did what you said count?

143
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,450
Let's rest here for a bit.

144
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,404
- I'll massage your leg.
- Okay. I need support.

145
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,210
Dear.

146
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,450
I know you're still shaken up right now.

147
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,920
But there are things I need to say.

148
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,850
Why so serious all of a sudden?

149
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,680
Look. I'm not against
you coming to An

150
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,010
or your search for sunflower seeds,

151
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,204
citrus seeds, or whatever.

152
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,210
But I disapprove of

153
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,400
the way you act so impulsively.

154
00:11:27,293 --> 00:11:28,450
This is a foreign country.

155
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,920
A place you know nothing.

156
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,450
Yet you just brought Xin

157
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,520
into a jungle.

158
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,920
Did you consider the consequences?

159
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,850
How could I know something like that
would happen?

160
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,250
I didn't know the forest was that huge

161
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,280
and hard to get through.

162
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:44,730
Yes.

163
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,970
You didn't know.

164
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,210
But you didn't prepare.

165
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,160
Luckily, you went with Xin.

166
00:11:51,515 --> 00:11:54,337
Luckily, the receptionist you asked
for help called the police in time.

167
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,760
Luckily, the Embassy gave us approval
to search the forest.

168
00:11:58,850 --> 00:11:59,970
Only with all those lucks

169
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,680
can you be standing here,
safe and sound.

170
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:03,680
Dear,

171
00:12:04,493 --> 00:12:05,800
if the tiniest misstep happens,

172
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,850
I don't even dare to think about
what might've happened.

173
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,640
Why are you scaring me?

174
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,680
I didn't know we'd get lost.

175
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,610
I'm not trying to scare you.

176
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,210
I'm really worried.

177
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,370
Zong Qing,

178
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,330
did you come here straight

179
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,490
after the competition without resting?

180
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,800
You went missing. How could I rest?

181
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,610
I'm sorry.

182
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,370
I know I was wrong.

183
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,920
I won't make trouble for you again.

184
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,330
What are you talking about?

185
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,250
It's not about you making trouble.

186
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,490
I'm afraid you'd get hurt, you get that?

187
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:57,680
Well.

188
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,640
I swear it won't happen again.

189
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,680
Keep your word.

190
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,010
Lean on it. I'll massage you.

191
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,520
It's fine. You should rest.

192
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,210
You look exhausted.

193
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,537
I'm heading back to the unit soon.

194
00:13:19,537 --> 00:13:20,760
I don't have much time to rest.

195
00:13:21,826 --> 00:13:22,640
Lean on the railing.

196
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:28,640
Is it here?

197
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:38,970
Do you remember

198
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,730
what I said to you in Wenzhou?

199
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,370
I told you the choice was yours.

200
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:47,850
I mean it.

201
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,040
If you haven't decided yet,

202
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,560
I can pretend

203
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,560
I didn't hear

204
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:55,680
what you said just now.

205
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:56,850
I'll give you more time.

206
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,400
I grew up in a military camp

207
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,640
with my mom

208
00:14:12,715 --> 00:14:14,893
until my dad was transferred,
and we moved away.

209
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
So the army

210
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,210
has always made me feel safe.

211
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,680
When I think back,

212
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,520
there was a fair share of regrets
in my childhood.

213
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,210
But deep down,

214
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,370
I never resented my dad.

215
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,880
So I know

216
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,130
I'm just contradicting myself

217
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,160
when I say I'd never marry a soldier.

218
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,730
I know.

219
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,640
I understand your concerns,

220
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,330
and I respect that.

221
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,680
I won't pressure you.

222
00:15:09,048 --> 00:15:10,330
Don't pressure yourself either.

223
00:15:11,426 --> 00:15:13,093
I'll wait until you've made your mind,

224
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,490
and until you know you won't regret

225
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,640
choosing me.

and the lessons from your experience

always matters more than first place.

288
00:20:07,937 --> 00:20:09,010
Especially for Yi Nanwang,

289
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,360
this was his first competition
at such a young age.

290

Don't let a trophy get to his head.

291

00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,170

What are you smiling at?

295
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,730
It reminds me of when I first enlisted,

296
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,450
you said the same to me.

297
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,650
"Don't get cocky."

298
00:20:27,604 --> 00:20:28,800
When you first joined the army,

299
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,360
you were the cockiest one of them all.

You kissed him. Don't try to deny it.

00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,120
You can't toy with Captain Wu.

331
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,560
Toy with him?

332
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,450
I didn't deny it.

333
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,800
I just...

334
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,280
Just what?

335
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,450
Do you like him or not?

336
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,840
See? I knew it.

337
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,840
You both like each other.

338
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,120
So what are you even waiting for?

339
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:07,280
Weren't you the one who kept saying

340
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,450
you'd never marry a soldier?

341
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,010
And now look at you.

342
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:13,800

343
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,010

get slapped in the face
by their own words?

346
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,560
That was a loud slap. So loud.

347
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,010
Exactly.

348
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:24,160
It's the first time I've seen you
get slapped in the face for it.

349
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,560
It sure was loud.

350
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,890
Was it loud?

351
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,010
Was it?

352
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,010
What's your problem?

353
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,800
You're such a sore loser.

Jeez.

376
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,520
Shut up.

377
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,280
Captain Zong,

378
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,800
his money

379
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,490
is extremely well-organized.

380
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,080
No one can touch them.

381
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,360
One-third goes to his family,

382
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,800
one-third goes into savings,

383
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,930
and the last third, guess what for?

384
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,210
His future son's

385
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,560
education fund.

386
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,760
I'm saving for a daughter too.

387
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:43,840
You can't be serious.

388
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,320
At least get married first, okay?

389
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,690
Why hasn't Mom come out yet?

390
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,080
She's been tidying up in the room.

391
00:23:58,182 --> 00:23:59,648
She's been acting a little weird

392
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:00,730
these past few days.

393
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:01,840
What happened?

394
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,490
I can't say exactly.

395
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,600
Seems like she's in a bad mood.

396
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,930
Call her for dinner.

397
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,840
Mom, dinner's ready.

398
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,490
All the dishes are served.

399
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:14,800
Mom.

400
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,040
Come on. Wang Chen cooked all of them.

401
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,600
What's wrong, Mom?

402
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,490
What happened?

403
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,170
Anything wrong?

404
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,600
(Pre-pregnancy Examination Report Form)

405
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,600
The two of you

406
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,410
gang up and fool me.

407
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:49,250
Is it fun?

408
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,280
What do you mean?

409
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,360
What are you talking about?

410
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,250
I know everything.

411
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,800
It's an excuse
that you're trying to have a baby.

412
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,250
How could it be?

413
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,840
Chen and I have been trying hard.

414
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,760
Stop lying.

415
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,280
You can't have children.

416
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:07,690
Wang Chen

417
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,490
can't conceive.

418
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,170
I saw the pre-pregnancy test results.

419
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:13,930
Uterine rupture.

420
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,250
Extremely low hormone levels.

421
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,560
It's written back and white

422
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,080
in the report.

423
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:22,320
You think I can't understand?

424
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,280
Why were you touching our stuff?

425
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:25,210
That's not the point.

426
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,800
Is it true or not?

427
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,410
With you two like this,

428
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,080
how could you get pregnant?

429
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,360
Mom,

430
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,320
actually...

431
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,410
Don't even try.

432
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,520
The two of you,

433
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,650
stop acting.

434
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:41,970
You team up

435
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,840
to fool an old woman like me.

436
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,690
All I ever wanted

437
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,650
was to see Zijian have a child.

438
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,520
Look at what you've done.

439
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,970
You lied to me.

440
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,520
I just shouldn't be here.

441
00:25:58,890 --> 00:25:59,970
Go live

442
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,890
your own lives.

443
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,450
Can you sit down?

444
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,560
What are you pacing around for?

445
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,560
Didn't she say

446
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,604
she'd come back
right after dropping off Yangyang?

447
00:26:43,626 --> 00:26:45,040
Look what time it is now.

448
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,800
Go meet her outside.

449
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,690
Why are you still sitting here
eating mandarins?

450
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,890
I'm not going.
If you're worried, then go.

451
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,800
I'm not worried.

452
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,560
Then why are you fussing?

453
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,450
Huh?

454
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:58,360
What?

455
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:01,690
Dad, Mom, I'm home.

456
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,040
Mr. Tang,

457
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,520
your precious sweetheart is back.

458
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,040
Oh, wonders never cease.

459
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,170
You can read papers
without reading glasses.

460
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:32,970
Not talking to your sweetheart?

461
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,170
If so, I'll go figure out

462
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:37,080
how to plan a date with Wu Si.

463
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:38,982
Stand right there.

464
00:27:46,893 --> 00:27:47,730
Stand right there.

465
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,982
(Miss Tang, someone sent an email)

466
00:28:02,004 --> 00:28:04,289
(to the old email address
we used to contact each other.)

467
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,490
(They claimed to be your friend)

468
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,360
(and asked me to give them the lead.)

469
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,040
(Is that true?)

470
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,250
(I've been abroad recently)

471
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,560
(and haven't used my laptop much.)

472
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,660
(Something's wrong with my phone.)

473
00:28:24,693 --> 00:28:26,226
(I could only make or receive calls.)

474
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,250
(I didn't ask anyone to contact you.)

475
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,690
(Did you give them the lead?)

476
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,320
(No.)

477
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,010
(That's strange.)

478
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,250
(They said you gave them
my email address.)

479
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,250
(You're the only person)

480
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,490
(who knows it.)

481
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,600
(I swear I never gave it to anyone.)

482
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,840
(And even if)

483
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,360
(I did ask them to contact you,)

484
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,690
(why would I give them
an old email address?)

485
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,210
We missed her again.

486
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,648
Maybe she went out
to celebrate her birthday

487
00:29:13,648 --> 00:29:14,737
with other members?

488
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:16,690
Sergeant Cheng,

489
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,360
maybe you can call Ke'er again.

490
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,600
Don't be dejected.

491
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:27,490
One, two, three, four.

492
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,730
- One, two.
- One, two, three, four.

493
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:30,820
Sergeant Cheng, it's Ke'er.

494
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,450
One, two, three, four.

495
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,490
One, two, one, two.

496
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,450
- Three, four.
- One, two, one.

497
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:39,250
One, two, three, four.

498
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:43,010
- One, two, one.
- One, two, three, four.

499
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,970
One, two, three, four.

500
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,115
Today is Ke'er's birthday.

501
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,450
I should've shouted louder.

502
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:48,760
I think she heard me.

503
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,970
Young man, you've got energy.

504
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,600
I'll give you extra training.

505
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:56,600
I was just trying to help.

506
00:29:59,254 --> 00:30:00,360
One, two, one.

507
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,450
One, two, three, four.

508
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:03,360
One, two.

509
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,210
One, two, three, four.

510
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:04,840
Let's go.

511
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,080
One, two.

512
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,490
Three, four.

513
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,600
One, two, one.

514
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,930
One, two, one, two, one.

515
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:11,626
If you miss her,
just go up and tell her.

516
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,210
She didn't go far.

517
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,560
She just finished field training.

518
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:22,060
(To Protect The Motherland)

519
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,450
Relax.

520
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:29,970
Don't breathe out.

521
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:30,840
Sink down.

522
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,170
It's almost four minutes.

523
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:32,730
Come on.

524
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:34,450
Almost there.

525
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:37,800
Stand up.

526
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:41,170
Captain Wu.

527
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,040
Captain Wu.

528
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,600
Yes.

529
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:43,970
What are you doing?

530
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,210
Extra training.

531
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,450
He asked for it.

532
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:47,970
Last-minute practice?

533
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,080
Come here.

534
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:52,115
Let's go over
the naval training subjects.

535
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,493
Pass the papers around.

536
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,900
(Dating Timetable)

537
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:06,800
Everyone, take a look.

538
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,040
Dating timetable?

539
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,210
Wednesday, two hours.

540
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,560
Lunch, two hours. Just that?

541
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,170
Saturday, four hours. Lunch, two hours.

542
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,280
And movies too.

543
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:17,690
That's very detailed.

544
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,450
Funny how the guy who used to mock me

545
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,840
back then.

546
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,690
A man in love.

547
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,320
Captain, when did you get a girlfriend?

548
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:34,040
Yi Nanwang might not know,

549
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,210
but does Miss Tang know?

550
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,690
Did you confess?

551
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,560
Of course.

552
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,080
Did she accept you?

553
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,970
Tang Xin, will you be my girlfriend?

554
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,080
I...

555
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,730
More or less, yes.

556
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,560
What does that mean?

557
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,080
You can't be casual about this.

558
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,490
It needs to be clear and confirmed.

559
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,189
A sense of ceremony
in romantic relationships.

560
00:32:08,189 --> 00:32:11,020
Both of you must reach a consensus.
That's what makes a relationship count.

561
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:15,040
If not, no matter how detailed
a list you make, it's just one-sided love.

562
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,360
She kissed me!

563
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,320
I kissed them.

564
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,320
Captain, I support you.

565
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:25,600
Keep it up.

566
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,490
You're so clueless.

567
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:31,226
Let's go over the subjects first.

568
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,800
Mom still won't answer your call?

569
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,450
I shouldn't have done that.

570
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,690
I should've really listened to you.

571
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,010
Why did I lie to her

572
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,170
about the baby?

573
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,280
What's done is done.

574
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,560
Right now,

575
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,360
we must think of a way
to bring Mom back.

576
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,450
It's all my fault.

577
00:32:55,782 --> 00:32:56,890
What are you talking about?

578
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,250
It's my fault, too.

579
00:33:00,048 --> 00:33:00,730
I'll go with you

580
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:02,360
to bring Mom back.

581
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,210
But have you thought about it?

582
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:06,800
If the three of us

583
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,930
live together,

584
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,650
there will still be conflicts.

585
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,930
We're a family.

586
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,650
It's on us this time.

587
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,360
We can't break Mom's heart.

588
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,040
Tang Xin.

589
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,840
What's so urgent?

590
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,115
You suddenly asked me out here.

591
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,650
Let's sit and talk.

592
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,010
Here's the thing.

593
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,410
While I was abroad,

594
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:19,160
someone emailed

595
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,970
my informant.

596
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,640
This person claimed to be my friend

597
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,490
and said I was overseas,

598
00:34:26,493 --> 00:34:28,399
and asked the informant
to send them the lead

599
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,490
to investigate on my behalf.

600
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,240
They even tried to meet my informant.

601
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,640
In that case,

602
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,520
did your informant verify it?

603
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:36,930
He sent me an email,

604
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,582
but I didn't see it while I was abroad.

605
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:40,010
I only saw it a few days ago.

606
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,520
Try to recall.

607
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,200
When you were writing him emails,

608
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:48,240
did anyone see them?

609
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:49,520
Impossible.

610
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,290
I never let anyone see

611
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,010
something that important,

612
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,770
or told anyone his email address.

613
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,560
You once mentioned

614
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:58,160
someone used your laptop

615
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,240
and changed your IP address.

616
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,330
If your suspicions are correct,

617
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:02,010
that person

618
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,410
definitely knows his email.

619
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:06,930
Other than that,

620
00:35:07,248 --> 00:35:09,248
I really can't think of
who else it could be.

621
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:11,490
They claimed to be your friend
and tried to meet him.

622
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,970
Obviously, they're using you

623
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,290
to bait the informant.

624
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,330
That's what I think too.

625
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,040
I really want to find out who they are.

626
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,450
But I'm also worried

627
00:35:22,515 --> 00:35:23,982
my informant might be in danger.

628
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,770
That's why I'm asking your advice.

629
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,490
Should we meet the person or not?

630
00:35:31,448 --> 00:35:32,330
Here's what we'll do.

631
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,680
Tell your informant

632
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:35,770
that if the person

633
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:37,200
wants to meet again,

634
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,240
agree to it.

635
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,770
Suggest a time this weekend,

636
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:41,930
but don't confirm

637
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:42,960
the time or place yet.

638
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:44,040
Wait for me.

639
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,040
I'll go with you.

640
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:50,810
All right.

641
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:52,160
Let's do it that way.

642
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,640
We need to find out

643
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,810
who this person really is.

644
00:35:59,160 --> 00:35:59,770
By the way,

645
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:01,770
ask your informant

646
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:03,520
to forward the person's email.

647
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,290
Understood.

648
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,850
I have to head back now.

649
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:27,970
That fast?

650
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,240
Well, then.

651
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,010
Um...

652
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,520
Take care of yourself.

653
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,490
All right, Mr. Chen. No problem.

654
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,450
Okay. This Sunday.

655
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:58,010
See you then.

656
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,490
Okay.

657
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:00,850
Bye.

658
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:04,770
Mr. Han.

659
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,330
Miss Tang's back from abroad.

660
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,490
She's returned to work.

661
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:10,970
Okay. Got it.

662
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,490
(Miss Tang's back.)

663
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:47,560
(When are you free)

664
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,640
(to meet?)

665
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,240
(Maybe this Sunday.)

666
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:09,640
(What time and where?)

667
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,640
(I'll let you know one hour before.)

668
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,300
(Meeting Room)

669
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,330
Mr. Tian.

670
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:29,520
(Minghua News)

671
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,240
Xin, someone's here to see you.

672
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,290
I'm in a meeting. Tell them to wait.

673
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,240
It's Han Yuhang.

674
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,930
Mr. Han.

675
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:43,410
What brings you here?

676
00:38:44,137 --> 00:38:45,582
I didn't make an appointment.

677
00:38:45,582 --> 00:38:46,850
I know this is sudden,

678
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:49,160
but there's something very important

679
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,330
I must tell you in person.

680
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,720
What is it that's so urgent?

681
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,560
While you were abroad,

682
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,010
I contacted the man

683
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:58,770
who gave you

684
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,930
the sunken ship tip

685
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:01,720
as your friend.

686
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,240
How did you get in touch with him?

687
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:05,330
The same way you did.

688
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:06,160
Through email.

689
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:06,770
How do you have

690
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,520
his email?

691
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,490
Do you know him?

692
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:10,490
I don't know him,

693
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:12,160
but I have my ways.

694
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,010
In what ways?

695
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:14,330
That's not important.

696
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:16,226
What matters is that I've arranged
to meet him

697
00:39:16,248 --> 00:39:17,450
as soon as possible.

698
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:18,640
He agreed?

699
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,330
He did.

700
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,810
It's this Sunday.

701
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,640
The exact time and place

702
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,240
will be confirmed one hour before.

703
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:24,930
But

704
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,490
he has one condition.

705
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:28,010
When he comes to meet me,

706
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:29,520
you have to be there.

707
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,330
I'll ask you again.

708
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,560
How did you get his email?

709
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,970
I'm sorry.

710
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,770
I can't tell you yet.

711
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,040
But please believe me,

712
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:46,720
I'm just trying to help.

713
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:47,680
That's all.

714
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:33,450
Mr. Han,

715
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,200
you have lunch with Mr. Chan

716
00:40:36,404 --> 00:40:37,970
at the Exhibition Center Hotel at noon.

717
00:40:38,648 --> 00:40:40,720
As for the afternoon,
there's a meeting at 1:30 PM.

718
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,890
You're chairing it.

719
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,970
- (One hour later, Rainbow Park.)
- And tonight...

720
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:09,680
Mr. Han.

721
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,370
You're here.

722
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,160
I got held up on the road.

723
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:13,970
It's fine.

724
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,010
Where are you two meeting?

725
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:18,490
He didn't say.

726
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:20,410
He told me to send him an email

727
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:21,490
once we're both here.

728
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:22,850
Then he'll tell me the exact spot.

729
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:23,640
One sec.

730
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,200
Sure.

731
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,200
(Miss Tang is here.)

732
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,580
(Where should we meet?)

733
00:41:28,826 --> 00:41:29,890
Let's wait for his reply.
