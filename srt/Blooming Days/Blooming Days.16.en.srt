=Episode 16=

17
00:01:53,312 --> 00:01:54,930
The Heart-Devouring Poison
comes from the desert

18
00:01:55,832 --> 00:01:57,111
and Mu Haiyao hails from there.

19
00:01:58,152 --> 00:01:59,632
Madam Rou, you must know this, right?

20
00:02:01,912 --> 00:02:02,632
Of course I'm aware.

21
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,071
I never imagined that,
I'm intelligent and loyal, however,

22
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,570
I would meet my end at the hands
of the person I trusted the most.

23
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,191
It was the poison planted by Mu Haiyao,

24
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:15,991
which was why you followed
Li Qianmo's orders.

25
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:19,631
Xu Liangchuan is her servant now.

26
00:02:20,392 --> 00:02:21,752
She knows the reason behind this.

27
00:02:22,152 --> 00:02:23,872
She should also know the antidote.

28
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,670
The Heart-Devouring Poison
is very mysterious.

29
00:02:25,991 --> 00:02:27,991
Even the one who administered it
can't cure it.

30
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,392
What Xu Liangchuan knows

31
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:32,711
is just how to control
the poison's effects.

32
00:02:33,592 --> 00:02:36,392
The most crucial ingredient is placenta.

33
00:02:37,152 --> 00:02:39,560
I've heard that Tinglan Pavilion
has been emitting a foul odour lately.

34
00:02:40,071 --> 00:02:41,232
This should be the source.

35
00:02:44,472 --> 00:02:45,752
I thought highly of myself,

36
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:49,152
but I was reduced to a pawn

37
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:49,952
in Li Qianmo's hands.

38
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,152
I hate it.

39
00:02:58,592 --> 00:02:59,560
I had no attachment nor fear.

40
00:03:01,551 --> 00:03:02,911
There's nothing to
be afraid of in death.

41
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,312
However, right now,

42
00:03:08,392 --> 00:03:09,512
I feel remorse towards you

43
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:11,592
and I wronged you.

44
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:13,431
You saved me as well.

45
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:16,831
You risked your life

46
00:03:16,831 --> 00:03:18,170
to stop the vicious dog from harming me.

47
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,512
You harmed me to protect yourself,

48
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:22,551
but when you saved me,

49
00:03:23,631 --> 00:03:25,312
you were willing to sacrifice yourself.

50
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:27,551
It was just a momentary impulse.

51
00:03:28,392 --> 00:03:29,312
Don't forget,

52
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,431
I've always been a ruthless poisoner

53
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,791
who kills without hesitation.

54
00:03:35,392 --> 00:03:36,351
You're not.

55
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:39,472
I once believed

56
00:03:39,472 --> 00:03:41,170
there was no such thing
as sincerity in this world.

57
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:44,831
However, today,

58
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:45,831
I unexpectedly encountered it.

59
00:03:52,872 --> 00:03:53,551
Unfortunately,

60
00:03:54,312 --> 00:03:55,032
I'm unfortunate.

61
00:03:57,831 --> 00:03:59,392
My life is already at its end.

62
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:01,032
Not necessarily.

63
00:04:03,271 --> 00:04:04,472
I said the Heart-Devouring Poison

64
00:04:04,472 --> 00:04:05,592
used to have no cure,

65
00:04:06,752 --> 00:04:07,872
not that it can't be researched.

66
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,070
Young Master granted me the permission

67
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,470
to visit Lianwei Residence freely
for the miscarriage prevention.

68
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:13,831
Starting tomorrow,

69
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,970
you'll visit every three days
for detoxification.

70
00:04:16,351 --> 00:04:17,232
I can't promise you,

71
00:04:17,232 --> 00:04:18,271
but I have a 70% certainty.

72
00:04:18,872 --> 00:04:19,672
Whether you live or die

73
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:21,112
depends on your destiny.

74
00:04:21,831 --> 00:04:23,991
70% is more than enough.

75
00:04:27,391 --> 00:04:28,592
Even if there's only a 10% chance,

76
00:04:29,511 --> 00:04:30,271
I believe that

77
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:31,271
if given the opportunity,

78
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,831
we should seize it firmly.

79
00:04:33,912 --> 00:04:34,592
Rou,

80
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:36,671
you will definitely overcome this.

81
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:38,632
You'll be alright, I'm sure of it.

82
00:05:03,872 --> 00:05:04,872
Hurry up.

83
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:15,592
In the future, you must be careful.

84
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,711
Li Qianmo is foolish

85
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:19,752
and wouldn't have been able to plot this.

86
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:22,152
To protect this child of yours,

87
00:05:22,711 --> 00:05:23,991
you must be wary of
the person behind,

88
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,510
who has sweet words
and a treacherous heart.

89
00:05:26,312 --> 00:05:26,991
I'm not afraid.

90
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:28,711
Do you two know

91
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,391
my greatest gain from all this?

92
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:36,391
It's this.

93
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:39,991
I didn't want it to come.

94
00:05:41,312 --> 00:05:42,352
I didn't want it to be in

95
00:05:42,511 --> 00:05:43,831
this filthy and complicated place.

96
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:45,671
Even when

97
00:05:46,032 --> 00:05:48,231
the prince found out and I had to keep it,

98
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:49,912
I still resisted it a thousand times.

99
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,072
It's been in my belly

100
00:05:52,632 --> 00:05:53,792
for several months already.

101
00:05:54,632 --> 00:05:55,711
I was aware of that,

102
00:05:56,032 --> 00:05:57,271
but I couldn't feel it.

103
00:05:58,752 --> 00:05:59,872
Was it sleeping?

104
00:06:01,032 --> 00:06:01,951
Was it eating?

105
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:03,951
Was it happy?

106
00:06:04,511 --> 00:06:05,391
What did it look like?

107
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:06,271
Was it a boy or a girl?

108
00:06:06,671 --> 00:06:07,472
I didn't know at all.

109
00:06:08,592 --> 00:06:09,872
Could a life that I couldn't feel

110
00:06:09,872 --> 00:06:10,711
be considered a life?

111
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:13,111
However, today...

112
00:06:15,312 --> 00:06:16,511
Today,

113
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:18,711
when that dog pounced on me,

114
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:19,872
I realised that

115
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:21,980
I was not thinking of myself.

116
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,872
I was thinking of it.

117
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:26,152
I'm not afraid to die.

118
00:06:26,431 --> 00:06:27,391
I'm afraid of hurting it.

119
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:29,312
That's when I understood

120
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:33,111
how important it was to me.

121
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,192
It's my flesh,

122
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:41,352
my blood and my life.

123
00:06:43,312 --> 00:06:46,312
Since I have no family in this mansion,

124
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:48,072
I'm creating

125
00:06:48,592 --> 00:06:49,551
my own family.

126
00:06:51,352 --> 00:06:52,551
I hope for its birth.

127
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:55,231
I hope for its growth,

128
00:06:56,312 --> 00:06:58,111
I hope for us to depend on each other.

129
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:07,192
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

130
00:07:10,152 --> 00:07:11,111
You said

131
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:13,072
you didn't want

132
00:07:13,711 --> 00:07:14,592
this child for me.

133
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:17,831
Instead, you're creating a family
for yourself?

134
00:07:23,032 --> 00:07:23,711
Yes.

135
00:07:25,152 --> 00:07:27,671
Even if we have a child together,

136
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:29,431
you still think

137
00:07:29,551 --> 00:07:31,072
that you have no family in this mansion?

138
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:38,671
Yes.

139
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:40,472
Even if you are his mother

140
00:07:40,472 --> 00:07:41,192
and I'm his father,

141
00:07:42,152 --> 00:07:43,752
you still only want to depend on him?

142
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:46,551
Yes.

143
00:08:10,472 --> 00:08:10,991
I understand.

144
00:08:14,312 --> 00:08:15,511
I know you don't like me coming over.

145
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:17,711
In that case,

146
00:08:18,991 --> 00:08:19,792
from now on,

147
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:20,831
I won't come to disturb you.

148
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:31,032
Shi'er.

149
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,551
Let's sit on the throne, okay?

150
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:35,192
Come on,

151
00:08:35,551 --> 00:08:36,951
have a seat on that throne, all right?

152
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:39,992
In the future, you'll become a prince.

153
00:08:42,232 --> 00:08:43,592
Madam. Madam Zhen is here to see you.

154
00:08:48,271 --> 00:08:50,232
Don't cry.

155
00:08:54,672 --> 00:08:55,392
Let her in.

156
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,271
Congratulations for
getting what you wished for.

157
00:09:09,232 --> 00:09:10,631
It's thanks to you.

158
00:09:11,472 --> 00:09:12,352
I'll keep it in mind.

159
00:09:13,391 --> 00:09:14,191
I don't expect you

160
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:15,232
to remember my kindness,

161
00:09:16,032 --> 00:09:17,432
but I've always been by your side,

162
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,232
singing your praises.

163
00:09:18,552 --> 00:09:20,311
However, my performance
hasn't even started yet

164
00:09:20,552 --> 00:09:21,751
and there is no chance.

165
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:24,511
I really wanted
to see your performance through,

166
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:26,511
but what you're doing

167
00:09:26,672 --> 00:09:27,951
was against the rules

168
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:30,232
and there's nothing I could do.

169
00:09:32,511 --> 00:09:33,511
A few days ago,

170
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:34,631
I asked Zuiliu

171
00:09:34,631 --> 00:09:35,951
to buy some rouge for me.

172
00:09:36,871 --> 00:09:37,592
To my surprise,

173
00:09:37,672 --> 00:09:39,511
when she came back,
she told me something.

174
00:09:40,912 --> 00:09:41,831
She said

175
00:09:42,711 --> 00:09:43,792
she saw you

176
00:09:44,232 --> 00:09:45,432
meeting someone

177
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,432
who looked a lot

178
00:09:49,271 --> 00:09:50,511
like Madam Mei.

179
00:09:50,592 --> 00:09:51,672
How could that be possible?

180
00:09:52,311 --> 00:09:53,391
Since my arrival at the mansion,

181
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:54,271
I haven't left.

182
00:09:54,951 --> 00:09:56,592
How could I end up at a cosmetics shop?

183
00:09:56,912 --> 00:09:57,792
It's too dark in the alley

184
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:58,751
and Zuiliu mistook.

185
00:09:58,912 --> 00:09:59,711
Alley?

186
00:10:01,831 --> 00:10:03,152
I never even mentioned an alley.

187
00:10:03,432 --> 00:10:04,912
Why would you even know about it?

188
00:10:05,711 --> 00:10:06,071
I...

189
00:10:07,631 --> 00:10:09,032
Of course I believe in you,

190
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:10,831
but if Young Master

191
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:11,912
finds out about this,

192
00:10:12,432 --> 00:10:15,191
I'm afraid he might become suspicious.

193
00:10:18,391 --> 00:10:19,432
You're worrying too much.

194
00:10:20,992 --> 00:10:21,951
You should go back.

195
00:10:22,391 --> 00:10:24,352
The position of the side consort
is still vacant,

196
00:10:25,271 --> 00:10:26,391
and someone should take it.

197
00:10:27,472 --> 00:10:28,391
When the time comes,

198
00:10:29,152 --> 00:10:30,511
many trivial matters

199
00:10:31,191 --> 00:10:32,672
will require your attention.

200
00:10:49,751 --> 00:10:50,391
Umbrellas!

201
00:10:50,391 --> 00:10:51,311
Take a look!

202
00:10:55,152 --> 00:10:55,912
Good.

203
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:05,032
Finish the entire jar of liquor.

204
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:09,751
Lianxin, you should also draw one.

205
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:10,912
Let's see what you'll get.

206
00:11:10,912 --> 00:11:11,432
Come on.

207
00:11:11,912 --> 00:11:13,311
I'll give it a try

208
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:14,870
to see if I can get
something interesting.

209
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:29,611
(Kill the child in Luo Qinglian's womb.)

210
00:11:42,311 --> 00:11:44,391
Lianxin, please read it.

211
00:11:44,391 --> 00:11:45,552
I'm waiting to draw mine.

212
00:11:46,032 --> 00:11:47,071
How much do you want to drink?

213
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,792
Lianxin, read it.

214
00:12:13,871 --> 00:12:16,472
Kill the child in Luo Qinglian's womb.

215
00:12:18,032 --> 00:12:19,032
Kill...

216
00:12:33,631 --> 00:12:34,352
Lianchu.

217
00:12:34,552 --> 00:12:36,112
I was thinking to take this opportunity

218
00:12:36,112 --> 00:12:37,112
to drink more.

219
00:12:37,432 --> 00:12:38,831
Why are you making such a big joke?

220
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:39,472
Lianxin.

221
00:12:39,871 --> 00:12:41,912
I've heard that if Luo Qinglian
gives birth to that child,

222
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:44,552
that child will become
the trueborn grandson of the prince.

223
00:12:48,152 --> 00:12:49,071
Lianchu.

224
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:50,871
What are you saying?

225
00:12:51,112 --> 00:12:52,511
I dare not even listen to such talk.

226
00:12:53,912 --> 00:12:54,912
The trueborn grandson

227
00:12:55,152 --> 00:12:57,992
can only be your son.

228
00:12:58,672 --> 00:13:00,472
However, I've heard recently

229
00:13:01,232 --> 00:13:03,592
that as long as Luo Qinglian has a child,

230
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:06,391
you will become the heir.

231
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:09,831
Lianchu,

232
00:13:11,672 --> 00:13:12,552
you're drunk.

233
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:13,871
Yes,

234
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:16,112
Lianchu is drunk.

235
00:13:16,552 --> 00:13:17,592
Lianchu is drunk.

236
00:13:24,152 --> 00:13:25,271
He Lianxin!

237
00:13:31,472 --> 00:13:32,032
Great-uncle.

238
00:13:38,232 --> 00:13:40,112
Look at you,

239
00:13:40,432 --> 00:13:41,552
did Lv Beiyi

240
00:13:42,191 --> 00:13:43,071
refuse to accept the gift?

241
00:13:43,672 --> 00:13:46,631
He didn't even take a look at the mansion.

242
00:13:47,352 --> 00:13:48,232
Not even the money?

243
00:13:49,152 --> 00:13:50,432
He just refused.

244
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:52,831
He's not the least bit impressed.

245
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:54,912
Fortunately, we didn't mean to send gifts.

246
00:13:56,951 --> 00:13:57,951
I've heard

247
00:13:58,112 --> 00:13:59,152
that there's a new guest

248
00:13:59,951 --> 00:14:00,951
at Lianwei Residence.

249
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:08,191
Miss, come here and take a look.

250
00:14:08,391 --> 00:14:09,472
What happened?

251
00:14:11,112 --> 00:14:11,871
What's going on?

252
00:14:11,871 --> 00:14:12,792
Look.

253
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:14,112
I can't handle it all.

254
00:14:16,112 --> 00:14:16,631
What is this?

255
00:14:19,472 --> 00:14:20,631
Where is she?

256
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:21,711
You don't have to ask.

257
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,352
She must have worn
something beautiful

258
00:14:23,352 --> 00:14:24,191
and gone out to play.

259
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:25,792
Miss.

260
00:14:26,071 --> 00:14:27,490
Miss, you're really
spoiling Miss Shuilan.

261
00:14:27,912 --> 00:14:29,550
Madam permitted her to come
to keep you company,

262
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,912
however, she's still a guest.

263
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,480
She's only been here for half a month

264
00:14:32,511 --> 00:14:34,410
and she's already worn
all your clothes and jewellery.

265
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:38,152
She's been having all kinds
of dishes in the kitchen and using your name.

266
00:14:39,672 --> 00:14:40,271
Forget it.

267
00:14:40,592 --> 00:14:41,191
Just let her be.

268
00:14:41,711 --> 00:14:43,152
After all, she's my only younger sister.

269
00:15:28,831 --> 00:15:29,271
Girl,

270
00:15:32,271 --> 00:15:33,071
who are you?

271
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,354
(Luo Shuilan,
Luo Qinglian's younger sister)

272
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:37,992
You must be my brother-in-law.

273
00:15:41,472 --> 00:15:42,311
Are you

274
00:15:42,992 --> 00:15:43,951
Little Shuilan?

275
00:15:44,032 --> 00:15:45,032
I'm all grown up now.

276
00:15:45,232 --> 00:15:45,751
You see,

277
00:15:45,871 --> 00:15:47,311
I can fit into my sister's clothes

278
00:15:47,432 --> 00:15:49,232
and I can wear her jewellery too.

279
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:51,871
She gave them to you?

280
00:15:53,191 --> 00:15:54,391
I don't need to wait her to give me.

281
00:15:54,472 --> 00:15:55,672
My sister's things are all mine.

282
00:15:55,912 --> 00:15:56,630
Where are you going?

283
00:15:57,672 --> 00:15:58,792
Back to Lianwei Residence.

284
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:00,831
You've taken the wrong path.

285
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:02,112
Lianwei Residence is over there.

286
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:04,071
Let's go. I'll take you there.

287
00:16:07,937 --> 00:16:09,637
(Lianwei Residence)

288
00:16:13,391 --> 00:16:13,992
Young Master.

289
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:17,152
We've arrived.

290
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:20,570
Right, we're here.

291
00:16:20,831 --> 00:16:21,391
Go in.

292
00:16:21,912 --> 00:16:22,912
Aren't you coming in?

293
00:16:23,672 --> 00:16:24,511
No, I have something to do

294
00:16:25,032 --> 00:16:25,831
and must go back first.

295
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,032
All right.

296
00:16:33,511 --> 00:16:33,992
Shuilan.

297
00:16:34,391 --> 00:16:35,352
What's wrong?

298
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:41,352
Young Master,

299
00:16:42,631 --> 00:16:43,912
it's been several months.

300
00:16:44,311 --> 00:16:45,912
Even if you were mad,
you should've let it go.

301
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:49,112
Are you really not going
to see Ms. Lian again?

302
00:16:49,511 --> 00:16:50,992
Who said I was angry?

303
00:16:51,152 --> 00:16:52,071
I just can't be bothered.

304
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:52,912
Women.

305
00:16:54,032 --> 00:16:54,631
Shuilan,

306
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,552
are you afraid of being scolded?

307
00:16:56,552 --> 00:16:57,271
Do you need me

308
00:16:57,271 --> 00:16:58,191
to plead with you?

309
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:00,232
It's okay. My sister pampers me.

310
00:17:02,472 --> 00:17:03,592
Are you hungry?

311
00:17:03,711 --> 00:17:04,631
Do you want to eat anything?

312
00:17:06,271 --> 00:17:08,552
I'm feeling a bit hungry.

313
00:17:11,152 --> 00:17:13,271
It happens that I'm also a little hungry.

314
00:17:13,912 --> 00:17:15,152
Tell those at the kitchen to prepare

315
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:17,391
Eight-Treasure Duck, Longan Sweet Soup,

316
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:19,432
Three Delicacies Meatball
and Lotus Leaf Congee.

317
00:17:19,631 --> 00:17:21,312
Anyway, Ms. Lian said...

318
00:17:28,432 --> 00:17:28,912
Shuilan,

319
00:17:29,312 --> 00:17:30,871
it's getting late. Go in and rest.

320
00:17:32,871 --> 00:17:33,391
All right.

321
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:58,471
He really got it.

322
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:02,032
Miss.

323
00:19:02,511 --> 00:19:03,231
I can't help

324
00:19:03,231 --> 00:19:04,032
but say something.

325
00:19:04,552 --> 00:19:05,432
Even if you're angry,

326
00:19:05,631 --> 00:19:06,712
I'll still say it.

327
00:19:07,832 --> 00:19:08,432
Say it.

328
00:19:08,511 --> 00:19:09,432
You can't keep giving Master

329
00:19:09,432 --> 00:19:10,192
the cold shoulder.

330
00:19:10,511 --> 00:19:11,712
After all, he's the child's father.

331
00:19:11,832 --> 00:19:13,391
He's the best father I've ever seen.

332
00:19:13,631 --> 00:19:14,511
In the past six months,

333
00:19:14,591 --> 00:19:17,312
everything we've had at Lianwei Residence,
is as good as Madam Rui's

334
00:19:17,391 --> 00:19:18,751
and better than other servant-concubines'.

335
00:19:18,912 --> 00:19:20,670
Which part of it isn't
because of Master's concern?

336
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:23,410
Since you made him upset
with those harsh words last time,

337
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,032
I've seen Young Master hesitating
at Lianwei Residence's entrance many times,

338
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:27,270
but he never comes in for even once.

339
00:19:27,351 --> 00:19:30,111
His affection is so deep
that even the servants are moved.

340
00:19:31,591 --> 00:19:32,351
Miss,

341
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,271
there's just one more month
before you give birth.

342
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:37,312
Do you really intend to ignore him
for the rest of your life,

343
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:39,832
preventing the child from ever seeing
its father and mother together?

344
00:19:41,712 --> 00:19:42,792
You've talked so much.

345
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:44,351
Miss.

346
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:48,751
I know. I understand.

347
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:55,712
Child,

348
00:19:57,792 --> 00:19:59,351
do you think I should go or not?

349
00:20:00,072 --> 00:20:02,032
If you think I should, kick me once.

350
00:20:02,672 --> 00:20:05,432
If not, kick me twice.

351
00:20:08,432 --> 00:20:09,032
Did he move?

352
00:20:13,072 --> 00:20:14,231
It moved.

353
00:20:14,231 --> 00:20:15,751
How many times?

354
00:20:15,751 --> 00:20:16,631
How many times, Miss?

355
00:20:21,312 --> 00:20:23,271
Pathetic.

356
00:20:23,952 --> 00:20:25,672
What kind of women have I never seen?

357
00:20:26,032 --> 00:20:27,432
How did I become such a coward?

358
00:20:29,032 --> 00:20:29,672
Young Master.

359
00:21:00,032 --> 00:21:01,152
Slow down.

360
00:21:10,111 --> 00:21:10,912
This is

361
00:21:11,751 --> 00:21:13,351
something I picked up by chance.

362
00:21:13,832 --> 00:21:14,912
It's not valuable.

363
00:21:15,351 --> 00:21:17,391
You can just keep it casually.

364
00:21:17,712 --> 00:21:19,672
If you don't want it,
you can give it to someone else

365
00:21:21,231 --> 00:21:23,152
or even throw it away.

366
00:21:27,991 --> 00:21:29,511
No.

367
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:33,912
Young Master, why did you lie to me?

368
00:21:38,032 --> 00:21:39,871
Year after year, the red lotus
blooms at night.

369
00:21:40,351 --> 00:21:42,192
Only you and I know the feelings.

370
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,770
If it weren't specially made by you,

371
00:21:45,231 --> 00:21:47,792
who would've changed
the character of "red" to "green"?

372
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:24,631
It's moving.

373
00:22:26,231 --> 00:22:27,471
It often moves.

374
00:22:27,832 --> 00:22:28,672
I feel as if

375
00:22:28,672 --> 00:22:30,111
it understands what we're saying.

376
00:22:30,871 --> 00:22:31,631
Really?

377
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:35,152
Child,

378
00:22:36,072 --> 00:22:37,231
this is your father.

379
00:22:38,351 --> 00:22:39,231
Do you like him?

380
00:22:40,072 --> 00:22:41,192
If you like him,

381
00:22:41,471 --> 00:22:42,712
kick him twice for him to listen.

382
00:22:43,871 --> 00:22:44,712
Listen?

383
00:22:59,871 --> 00:23:00,312
Qinglian,

384
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:03,072
why did he only kick once?

385
00:23:06,111 --> 00:23:06,751
Baby, kick again

386
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,712
so that I can hear it.

387
00:23:09,072 --> 00:23:10,032
Move again, won't you?

388
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:12,032
Can't you hear

389
00:23:12,032 --> 00:23:13,312
your father talking to you?

390
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:16,111
Move again.

391
00:23:21,111 --> 00:23:21,871
Miss Shuilan,

392
00:23:22,111 --> 00:23:23,511
this is fresh from the kitchen.

393
00:23:23,511 --> 00:23:24,460
Osmanthus Sweet Ferment Rice.

394
00:23:24,511 --> 00:23:25,271
Try it first.

395
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:34,712
It's not sweet at all.

396
00:23:35,032 --> 00:23:35,631
Did they forget

397
00:23:35,631 --> 00:23:36,591
to add sugar to my bowl?

398
00:23:37,351 --> 00:23:40,032
It's all made in the kitchen
and distributed to all the houses.

399
00:23:40,471 --> 00:23:41,351
It shouldn't be.

400
00:23:42,152 --> 00:23:43,391
I said it's not sweet.

401
00:23:44,192 --> 00:23:46,170
Isn't there a jar of osmanthus sugar
at Qinglian's place?

402
00:23:46,312 --> 00:23:47,552
Just get it for me.

403
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:48,712
What a waste.

404
00:23:49,152 --> 00:23:50,032
A waste?

405
00:23:50,952 --> 00:23:52,631
That's a reward
from Young Master to Ms. Lian.

406
00:23:52,871 --> 00:23:54,511
Normally, Ms. Lian doesn't even eat it.

407
00:23:54,631 --> 00:23:55,552
She keeps it in some...

408
00:23:57,072 --> 00:23:58,271
You're a lowly servant.

409
00:23:58,511 --> 00:23:59,832
How dare you look down on me.

410
00:23:59,832 --> 00:24:00,871
How dare you hit me.

411
00:24:00,991 --> 00:24:02,712
Even Ms. Lian has never hit us.

412
00:24:02,832 --> 00:24:03,751
Because she's foolish.

413
00:24:03,751 --> 00:24:04,351
Lan'er!

414
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,072
What else do you want to say?

415
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:07,751
Ms. Lian.

416
00:24:08,952 --> 00:24:09,351
I...

417
00:24:11,312 --> 00:24:12,312
Apologise to Zhiyue right now.

418
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:13,391
Apologise?

419
00:24:13,871 --> 00:24:15,391
You want me to apologise to a servant?

420
00:24:15,952 --> 00:24:17,552
Who taught you that?

421
00:24:18,152 --> 00:24:19,672
It's important to know what's right.

422
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:21,111
They treat you so well.

423
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:22,231
How can you hit and scold them?

424
00:24:22,312 --> 00:24:23,792
That's right, Ms. Shuilan.

425
00:24:23,912 --> 00:24:25,351
Zhiyue has always been so good to you,

426
00:24:25,351 --> 00:24:27,111
taking care of your daily needs.

427
00:24:27,111 --> 00:24:28,312
Even you dare to scold me.

428
00:24:29,672 --> 00:24:30,991
Both of you are ganging up on me.

429
00:24:31,271 --> 00:24:32,672
You're a pair of shameless servants.

430
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:33,192
You...

431
00:24:33,432 --> 00:24:34,312
What did you say?

432
00:24:36,832 --> 00:24:38,152
Shameless servants, stupid servants

433
00:24:38,152 --> 00:24:39,391
and despicable servants!

434
00:24:39,631 --> 00:24:39,991
You...

435
00:24:42,952 --> 00:24:43,712
I...

436
00:24:44,231 --> 00:24:44,871
Ms. Lian.

437
00:24:44,871 --> 00:24:46,152
Qinglian, you hit me.

438
00:24:46,231 --> 00:24:47,152
No. Lan'er.

439
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:47,591
I...

440
00:24:48,792 --> 00:24:49,871
Ms. Shuilan!

441
00:24:53,912 --> 00:24:54,552
Miss.

442
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,270
(Jingshu Hall)

443
00:25:04,471 --> 00:25:05,351
Are you

444
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,351
Ms. Lian's younger sister?

445
00:25:10,271 --> 00:25:12,751
You're so pretty and you're a guest.

446
00:25:14,152 --> 00:25:15,871
Who would make you cry?

447
00:25:23,751 --> 00:25:24,751
Have you calmed her down?

448
00:25:25,552 --> 00:25:26,511
I just showed her

449
00:25:26,511 --> 00:25:27,631
some clothes and jewellery.

450
00:25:27,991 --> 00:25:29,432
Her eyes are glowing.

451
00:25:29,871 --> 00:25:30,832
She's so vain.

452
00:25:31,351 --> 00:25:32,760
Have all the servants
of Lianwei Residence

453
00:25:33,351 --> 00:25:34,192
gone out?

454
00:25:34,631 --> 00:25:35,231
Don't worry.

455
00:25:35,912 --> 00:25:37,271
The others left
at Lianwei Residence.

456
00:25:37,712 --> 00:25:39,192
Luo Qinglian is alone.

457
00:25:40,631 --> 00:25:41,712
I told you

458
00:25:42,712 --> 00:25:44,152
I was patient.

459
00:25:49,552 --> 00:25:50,471
Ms. Shuilan!

460
00:25:50,952 --> 00:25:52,631
Ms. Shuilan!

461
00:25:53,111 --> 00:25:54,871
Ms. Shuilan!

462
00:25:55,152 --> 00:25:55,912
Ms. Shuilan.

463
00:25:57,351 --> 00:25:58,271
Ms. Shuilan!

464
00:25:58,712 --> 00:26:01,192
Have you seen Ms. Shuilan
from Lianwei Residence?

465
00:26:01,792 --> 00:26:02,351
No.

466
00:26:10,032 --> 00:26:10,631
Ms. Lian.

467
00:26:11,032 --> 00:26:13,832
Ms. Shuilan is waiting
for you to pick her up.

468
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:14,631
What did you say?

469
00:26:14,952 --> 00:26:15,952
Please take a look.

470
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:20,552
Young Master.

471
00:26:20,751 --> 00:26:21,631
Something has happened.

472
00:26:22,032 --> 00:26:24,991
Madam Zhen is suddenly seriously ill
and bedridden.

473
00:26:45,391 --> 00:26:45,991
What happened?

474
00:26:46,991 --> 00:26:48,192
Come here.

475
00:26:51,511 --> 00:26:52,192
Slow down.

476
00:26:57,432 --> 00:26:57,952
She's awake.

477
00:26:58,192 --> 00:26:58,792
She's awake.

478
00:27:00,192 --> 00:27:00,751
Young Master.

479
00:27:01,672 --> 00:27:02,351
Please don't talk.

480
00:27:03,111 --> 00:27:04,351
You're still weak right now.

481
00:27:04,991 --> 00:27:07,591
I'll ask Lv Beiyi to prepare some medicine
to drive away the cold for you.

482
00:27:11,432 --> 00:27:12,111
Is it here?

483
00:27:14,231 --> 00:27:14,751
Here?

484
00:27:15,991 --> 00:27:16,751
Here.

485
00:27:32,631 --> 00:27:33,432
Are you angry?

486
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,192
There's nothing to be angry about.

487
00:27:41,552 --> 00:27:42,832
You were perfectly fine just now.

488
00:27:43,391 --> 00:27:44,871
Why did you suddenly change?

489
00:27:45,391 --> 00:27:48,912
It's because I saw something
I shouldn't have seen.

490
00:27:50,351 --> 00:27:51,432
What did you see?

491
00:27:51,552 --> 00:27:53,511
I saw you and Lv Beiyi
having unresolved feelings.

492
00:27:53,952 --> 00:27:55,511
You were deeply attached to each other.

493
00:27:56,511 --> 00:27:57,952
What did you see?

494
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:01,591
I was so anxious to find Shuilan,

495
00:28:01,591 --> 00:28:02,680
which caused pain in my abdomen.

496
00:28:02,952 --> 00:28:05,952
Lv Beiyi happened to pass by
and checked on me.

497
00:28:07,751 --> 00:28:08,672
My belly hurts.

498
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,792
Don't use the child as a shield.

499
00:28:10,991 --> 00:28:11,730
Your belly is hurting?

500
00:28:11,871 --> 00:28:12,912
Should I summon Lv Beiyi

501
00:28:13,032 --> 00:28:14,792
to feel your belly
and help you feel better?

502
00:28:14,792 --> 00:28:15,231
You...

503
00:28:15,751 --> 00:28:17,792
All right, you two are so close.

504
00:28:18,351 --> 00:28:20,471
Why did you act so affectionately
towards me just now?

505
00:28:20,552 --> 00:28:21,832
You asked me to feel this child

506
00:28:21,832 --> 00:28:22,832
and listen to it.

507
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:24,471
It's because you are the child's father,

508
00:28:25,192 --> 00:28:27,231
I did what I was supposed to do.

509
00:28:27,871 --> 00:28:29,511
Am I really the child's father?

510
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,511
You said you only did what
you were supposed to do.

511
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:34,912
So let me tell you
what I should do.

512
00:28:34,912 --> 00:28:35,631
You don't deserve.

513
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:36,552
So when the child is born,

514
00:28:36,552 --> 00:28:37,952
you won't be his mother!

515
00:28:41,111 --> 00:28:41,952
What are you saying?

516
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:45,952
Miss!

517
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,991
- Miss.
- Miss!

518
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:47,351
Ms. Lian

519
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:48,432
Miss!

520
00:28:48,432 --> 00:28:49,072
Ms. Lian

521
00:28:49,072 --> 00:28:49,871
Let's go back.

522
00:28:49,991 --> 00:28:50,631
Let's go back first

523
00:28:50,631 --> 00:28:51,832
and then deal with others.

524
00:28:51,832 --> 00:28:52,432
Yes, Ms. Lian.

525
00:28:52,432 --> 00:28:53,072
It's cold.

526
00:28:53,072 --> 00:28:54,312
You'll catch a cold.

527
00:28:54,471 --> 00:28:55,991
I can't be the mother of this child?

528
00:28:56,792 --> 00:28:57,751
When the child is born,

529
00:28:58,511 --> 00:28:59,511
it won't call me mother.

530
00:29:00,591 --> 00:29:01,912
It'll call someone else mother,

531
00:29:01,912 --> 00:29:03,032
just like Shi'er.

532
00:29:03,312 --> 00:29:04,032
- No, Miss.
- No, Ms. Lian.

533
00:29:04,032 --> 00:29:04,871
It won't.

534
00:29:05,072 --> 00:29:05,871
It is your child.

535
00:29:05,871 --> 00:29:07,032
Why would it call someone else?

536
00:29:07,032 --> 00:29:07,471
Yes, Miss.

537
00:29:07,471 --> 00:29:08,591
Let go of me!

538
00:29:09,871 --> 00:29:10,912
- Miss!
- Ms. Lian!

539
00:29:55,111 --> 00:29:56,471
Miss!

540
00:29:56,832 --> 00:29:57,832
What happened to you? Miss!

541
00:29:58,231 --> 00:29:58,792
Miss!

542
00:29:59,952 --> 00:30:00,591
What happened?

543
00:30:02,591 --> 00:30:04,591
Help! Please!

544
00:30:04,991 --> 00:30:06,751
Miss.

545
00:30:07,552 --> 00:30:10,351
Help!

546
00:30:26,672 --> 00:30:29,271
When Ms. Lian's anger subsides,

547
00:30:30,111 --> 00:30:32,111
I'll accompany you

548
00:30:32,111 --> 00:30:33,511
to apologise to her tomorrow.

549
00:30:34,271 --> 00:30:35,552
She's a reasonable person.

550
00:30:36,952 --> 00:30:38,832
I'm sure you'll reconcile.

551
00:30:42,111 --> 00:30:42,912
Please, Young Master,

552
00:30:42,912 --> 00:30:43,591
don't be angry.

553
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:44,770
Getting angry will hurt your health.

554
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:48,111
Being indifferent can hurt others,

555
00:30:49,591 --> 00:30:50,751
but being too deeply involved

556
00:30:52,032 --> 00:30:53,072
can hurt yourself.

557
00:30:53,432 --> 00:30:54,432
Too deeply involved?

558
00:30:55,631 --> 00:30:56,991
She's not even aware of it!

559
00:30:59,552 --> 00:31:00,710
As long as you have the intention,

560
00:31:01,432 --> 00:31:03,152
you'll eventually get what you want.

561
00:31:03,871 --> 00:31:04,591
Ms. Lian will be moved

562
00:31:06,111 --> 00:31:07,631
by you in the end.

563
00:31:19,391 --> 00:31:20,231
Let me

564
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:23,192
accompany you to drown your sorrows

565
00:31:24,792 --> 00:31:25,991
and wait for goal to be achieved.

566
00:31:55,072 --> 00:31:55,712
Pour the liquor.

567
00:31:57,192 --> 00:31:57,751
Yes.

568
00:32:25,751 --> 00:32:26,471
Miss!

569
00:32:27,152 --> 00:32:28,271
Miss.

570
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,712
Save my child, please!

571
00:32:35,712 --> 00:32:37,231
Young Master!

572
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:38,631
Please save Ms. Lian!

573
00:32:39,152 --> 00:32:41,231
Young Master, please save Ms. Lian!

574
00:32:42,271 --> 00:32:43,072
Young Master.

575
00:32:45,072 --> 00:32:45,991
What's that sound?

576
00:32:47,111 --> 00:32:48,072
There's no sound.

577
00:32:48,312 --> 00:32:49,591
Yes, there is.

578
00:32:49,591 --> 00:32:50,672
Young Master, there's no sound.

579
00:32:52,032 --> 00:32:52,952
The crying of a baby.

580
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:53,871
Young Master.

581
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:54,631
There's a baby crying.

582
00:32:54,631 --> 00:32:55,832
Young Master, you're drunk.

583
00:32:56,712 --> 00:32:57,152
There's...

584
00:32:59,152 --> 00:32:59,672
There's a sound.

585
00:33:00,952 --> 00:33:01,672
- Master.
- There's...

586
00:33:02,072 --> 00:33:02,591
Young Master.

587
00:33:03,391 --> 00:33:04,552
You must be drunk.

588
00:33:04,952 --> 00:33:05,871
There's no sound.

589
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:08,351
There's really no sound.

590
00:33:10,511 --> 00:33:11,591
You must be drunk.

591
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:14,991
Young Master has already fallen asleep.
Go back.

592
00:33:15,312 --> 00:33:16,432
Ms. Lian is in unbearable pain

593
00:33:16,432 --> 00:33:17,111
and bleeding.

594
00:33:17,351 --> 00:33:18,991
Please wake him up, Ms. Jianyu.

595
00:33:19,792 --> 00:33:20,991
Young Master told us

596
00:33:21,312 --> 00:33:22,712
not to let anyone disturb him.

597
00:33:23,111 --> 00:33:25,072
Everything has to wait until tomorrow.

598
00:33:25,591 --> 00:33:26,580
Is it Young Master's order

599
00:33:27,192 --> 00:33:28,591
or did Madam Zhen decide on her own?

600
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:41,751
Master Lv.

601
00:33:58,672 --> 00:34:00,312
How's my child?

602
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,231
There's no time
to think about your child now.

603
00:34:05,991 --> 00:34:06,792
No.

604
00:34:11,832 --> 00:34:13,311
My child is not dead.

605
00:34:14,031 --> 00:34:15,232
I want to give birth to it.

606
00:34:15,351 --> 00:34:16,111
Is the child

607
00:34:16,831 --> 00:34:18,071
more important than your life?

608
00:34:29,272 --> 00:34:30,210
If she doesn't deliver soon,

609
00:34:31,031 --> 00:34:32,111
it will be too late.

610
00:34:32,712 --> 00:34:33,391
Please let me try.

611
00:34:33,591 --> 00:34:35,152
Fine, let's start.

612
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:37,591
Zhiyue, close the door
and pull the curtain.

613
00:34:37,831 --> 00:34:39,071
Ranyun, prepare hot water.

614
00:34:39,391 --> 00:34:40,031
Yes.

615
00:35:12,071 --> 00:35:13,232
My child.

616
00:35:17,311 --> 00:35:18,311
