=Episode 9=

17
00:01:50,238 --> 00:01:51,437
My baby is

18
00:01:52,317 --> 00:01:53,518
a child of the He family.

19
00:01:54,518 --> 00:01:55,717
The heavens will look after him.

20
00:01:56,798 --> 00:01:58,957
Even if someone wanted to hurt him,

21
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,077
it wouldn't be that easy.

22
00:02:01,598 --> 00:02:02,757
Right, Qianmo?

23
00:02:04,598 --> 00:02:05,437
Of course.

24
00:02:07,357 --> 00:02:08,397
However, it seems to me

25
00:02:08,918 --> 00:02:09,997
that you're so pale.

26
00:02:10,957 --> 00:02:12,357
You seem to be weak.

27
00:02:13,077 --> 00:02:14,198
This belly keeps growing.

28
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:16,037
Paleness is inevitable.

29
00:02:18,517 --> 00:02:19,358
In that case,

30
00:02:19,998 --> 00:02:21,317
you shouldn't stand here.

31
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:22,797
Go in and get some rest.

32
00:02:23,957 --> 00:02:25,037
Please allow me to see you off.

33
00:02:26,078 --> 00:02:27,198
Did I say I was leaving?

34
00:02:27,838 --> 00:02:28,998
Didn't you just say

35
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,438
we hadn't seen each other
in a long time?

36
00:02:30,638 --> 00:02:32,797
Why not invite me to go in

37
00:02:32,918 --> 00:02:33,838
for a cup of tea?

38
00:02:38,677 --> 00:02:39,638
You are very busy.

39
00:02:40,198 --> 00:02:42,118
Perhaps I'll invite you for tea
again on another day.

40
00:02:43,638 --> 00:02:44,478
Why

41
00:02:45,078 --> 00:02:46,198
are you concealing

42
00:02:46,397 --> 00:02:47,397
everything?

43
00:02:47,998 --> 00:02:49,838
Is there a secret
you can't share with others

44
00:02:49,838 --> 00:02:51,118
at Langyue Hall?

45
00:03:12,237 --> 00:03:13,237
Greetings, Madam Rui.

46
00:03:16,118 --> 00:03:18,237
Ms. Lian, why are you here?

47
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,877
Young Master has lifted
the house arrest on me.

48
00:03:21,438 --> 00:03:22,638
I went to Mansion to see the prince.

49
00:03:23,517 --> 00:03:24,410
Just as I left the mansion,

50
00:03:24,597 --> 00:03:26,597
I saw Ruhua ask for a physician.

51
00:03:27,677 --> 00:03:30,278
Only then we found out that
Madam Yao had fallen down.

52
00:03:30,517 --> 00:03:31,918
I was worried, so I came here.

53
00:03:33,918 --> 00:03:34,670
Where is the physician?

54
00:03:35,317 --> 00:03:37,317
The physician left
after the examination.

55
00:03:38,478 --> 00:03:39,638
I helped Ruhua

56
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:40,517
to clean up inside.

57
00:03:40,797 --> 00:03:41,957
I was about to report it to you

58
00:03:42,278 --> 00:03:43,118
and you had arrived.

59
00:03:48,797 --> 00:03:49,677
Do you mean that

60
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,237
you witnessed the physician

61
00:03:52,957 --> 00:03:54,317
treating Madam Yao?

62
00:03:54,838 --> 00:03:55,317
Yes.

63
00:04:04,397 --> 00:04:05,317
So, what was the result?

64
00:04:07,757 --> 00:04:08,718
The physician said

65
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:12,438
Madam Yao

66
00:04:17,037 --> 00:04:17,918
was not seriously injured.

67
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,597
Madam Yao was pretty lucky.

68
00:04:19,757 --> 00:04:21,130
Just a minor disturbance to the pregnancy.

69
00:04:25,077 --> 00:04:25,797
How could this be?

70
00:04:26,677 --> 00:04:27,598
How could it be?

71
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,070
(Qiege Hall)

72
00:04:31,077 --> 00:04:32,278
The person living here is...

73
00:04:32,797 --> 00:04:34,237
I know. It's Madam Mo.

74
00:04:35,158 --> 00:04:37,118
She nearly had a miscarriage
because of Madam Yao.

75
00:04:37,838 --> 00:04:38,558
I'm afraid

76
00:04:39,517 --> 00:04:40,477
that she will suffer daily

77
00:04:40,477 --> 00:04:41,957
before giving birth.

78
00:04:42,118 --> 00:04:43,598
Don't pity her, Ms. Lian.

79
00:04:44,077 --> 00:04:45,357
She is a snobbish and peacockish,

80
00:04:45,357 --> 00:04:46,197
and plays the bully.

81
00:04:46,637 --> 00:04:47,677
She is not a good person.

82
00:04:48,878 --> 00:04:50,397
Is she as ruthless as Madam Yao?

83
00:04:50,718 --> 00:04:51,477
Not exactly.

84
00:04:52,278 --> 00:04:53,718
Madam Mo is foolish and weak.

85
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,550
She bullies the weak
and fears the strong.

86
00:04:55,637 --> 00:04:57,718
If she harbours ill intentions towards you,

87
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:01,158
just be unyielding and she will give in.

88
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,357
Madam Mo.

89
00:05:04,077 --> 00:05:06,118
Could you return my hairpin to me?

90
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:11,677
What? What are you talking about?

91
00:05:12,158 --> 00:05:13,517
When I left in the morning,

92
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:15,438
didn't Banqiu find my hairpin?

93
00:05:16,758 --> 00:05:17,998
When did she find a hairpin?

94
00:05:18,558 --> 00:05:19,598
Don't make any baseless claim.

95
00:05:19,878 --> 00:05:20,998
I saw it with my own eyes

96
00:05:20,998 --> 00:05:21,998
that Banqiu found my hairpin.

97
00:05:22,318 --> 00:05:23,998
Why did you lie?

98
00:05:26,558 --> 00:05:27,878
It's just a hairpin.

99
00:05:28,438 --> 00:05:29,917
Why are you panicking?

100
00:05:36,957 --> 00:05:37,637
Very well.

101
00:05:39,077 --> 00:05:39,758
Qianmo,

102
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:41,797
very well.

103
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,278
Madam Yao.

104
00:05:44,797 --> 00:05:46,118
Please don't listen to her.

105
00:05:46,397 --> 00:05:46,718
I...

106
00:05:49,158 --> 00:05:50,758
I really had no knowledge of this.

107
00:05:51,278 --> 00:05:52,038
Don't need to explain.

108
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,077
I truly had no knowledge of this.

109
00:05:54,477 --> 00:05:55,077
Qianmo,

110
00:05:56,077 --> 00:05:57,397
if there's nothing major in the future,

111
00:05:57,878 --> 00:05:58,957
you should just rest well.

112
00:05:59,677 --> 00:06:00,637
Don't have to come out again.

113
00:06:01,598 --> 00:06:02,237
Understood.

114
00:06:06,558 --> 00:06:07,118
Haiyao,

115
00:06:07,797 --> 00:06:08,838
if there's no issue,

116
00:06:08,957 --> 00:06:09,957
please rest well.

117
00:06:10,758 --> 00:06:11,957
Master has few children.

118
00:06:13,197 --> 00:06:13,878
Haiyao and Qianmo,

119
00:06:14,397 --> 00:06:16,278
you must take this seriously

120
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:17,917
and be extremely cautious.

121
00:06:17,998 --> 00:06:18,677
Rest assured.

122
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:20,318
I will definitely not

123
00:06:20,318 --> 00:06:21,438
let anything happen

124
00:06:21,758 --> 00:06:22,758
to Young Master's child again.

125
00:06:58,838 --> 00:06:59,517
What?

126
00:06:59,517 --> 00:07:00,838
(He Lianxin's ordinary concubine, Xu Jirou)

127
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:01,477
(He Lianxin's ordinary concubine, Xu Jirou)
She helped you?

128
00:07:02,158 --> 00:07:02,998
Not only she helped me,

129
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:05,517
she did it in front of Madam Rui.

130
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:10,450
I didn't expect that
in just five months,

131
00:07:11,158 --> 00:07:12,077
she would transform

132
00:07:12,077 --> 00:07:13,598
from a defenceless fledgling

133
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:15,077
into someone so capable.

134
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:18,397
It's truly unbelievable.

135
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,477
If she pledges allegiance to us,

136
00:07:21,118 --> 00:07:22,318
won't we be more powerful?

137
00:07:22,637 --> 00:07:23,797
However, it could be a ruse.

138
00:07:25,158 --> 00:07:26,477
We can find out

139
00:07:26,797 --> 00:07:28,158
whether it is a ruse.

140
00:07:36,118 --> 00:07:36,758
What's wrong?

141
00:07:38,957 --> 00:07:40,637
Nothing, I'm just a bit dizzy.

142
00:07:42,118 --> 00:07:43,450
You hadn't been out for several months.

143
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:45,558
Today is the first time
for morning greetings.

144
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:47,077
Of course you're not used to it.

145
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:53,158
Is Madam Rui well?

146
00:07:54,957 --> 00:07:56,278
How well could she be?

147
00:07:57,438 --> 00:07:58,758
Her only son is gone

148
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,758
and she has to witness Madam Yao
getting pregnant.

149
00:08:02,998 --> 00:08:03,957
Madam Yao's child...

150
00:08:05,397 --> 00:08:05,838
Yes?

151
00:08:07,637 --> 00:08:08,278
It's nothing.

152
00:08:13,957 --> 00:08:15,237
Greetings, Ms. Rong and Ms. Lian.

153
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:19,237
Is there anything wrong with Madam Yao?

154
00:08:19,838 --> 00:08:21,450
My lady is suffering from
severe abdominal pain.

155
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,270
Perhaps she's experiencing
pregnancy complications.

156
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,477
Pregnancy complications?

157
00:08:24,677 --> 00:08:25,118
Exactly.

158
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:26,718
I'm in a hurry to fetch

159
00:08:26,718 --> 00:08:27,957
Physician Zhang for her.

160
00:08:28,197 --> 00:08:28,878
I'll leave first.

161
00:08:33,197 --> 00:08:34,930
Madam Yao is experiencing
pregnancy complications?

162
00:08:39,237 --> 00:08:41,758
Xu Liangchuan never spoke nor greeted us

163
00:08:41,758 --> 00:08:43,037
when he saw us.

164
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,717
However, today, he's respectful.

165
00:08:47,638 --> 00:08:48,570
(He's not being respectful.)

166
00:08:49,677 --> 00:08:50,998
(He intentionally said it.)

167
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:53,677
(Madam Yao already had a miscarriage.)

168
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,890
(How could experience
pregnancy complications?)

169
00:08:57,277 --> 00:08:58,998
(Does she intend to keep pretending?)

170
00:09:04,357 --> 00:09:06,237
- Greetings, Madam Rui.
- Greetings, Madam Rui.

171
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:07,518
You may rise.

172
00:09:07,998 --> 00:09:08,917
- Thank you, Madam Rui.
- Thank you, Madam Rui.

173
00:09:16,998 --> 00:09:17,638
Ms. Lian,

174
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,438
are you feeling unwell?

175
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,277
Madam Rui,

176
00:09:25,318 --> 00:09:26,970
perhaps because I hadn't been out
for a long time

177
00:09:27,237 --> 00:09:28,237
and I'm feeling a bit drowsy.

178
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:32,277
Winter has already ended.

179
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:34,837
When Yao's and Mo's children

180
00:09:34,837 --> 00:09:35,717
are born,

181
00:09:36,198 --> 00:09:37,518
we can celebrate.

182
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:39,438
Just now,

183
00:09:39,878 --> 00:09:41,518
I met Xu Liangchuan outside and heard

184
00:09:42,638 --> 00:09:44,118
that Madam Yao
had pregnancy complications.

185
00:09:48,198 --> 00:09:48,998
How severe was it?

186
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,917
Did she call a physician?

187
00:09:50,277 --> 00:09:51,530
Physician Zhang has already arrived,

188
00:09:52,318 --> 00:09:54,438
but I'm uncertain about the rest.

189
00:09:59,797 --> 00:10:00,638
Could it be

190
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:01,758
due to her fall yesterday?

191
00:10:02,558 --> 00:10:02,998
Zuiliu.

192
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,558
Check on Madam Yao.

193
00:10:04,917 --> 00:10:05,398
Understood.

194
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,878
You can go back
if there is nothing else.

195
00:10:12,357 --> 00:10:13,318
If you have time,

196
00:10:13,477 --> 00:10:14,758
you may visit Haiyao as well.

197
00:10:15,717 --> 00:10:16,438
- Understood.
- Understood.

198
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:27,198
Is the medicine ready?

199
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:30,477
Is Ruhua stalling it

200
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:33,398
because I scolded her earlier on?

201
00:10:33,998 --> 00:10:34,878
Madam, please bear with it.

202
00:10:35,118 --> 00:10:37,797
Ruhua knows that this medicine
is crucial for you and your child.

203
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:38,878
She didn't dare to neglect.

204
00:10:42,398 --> 00:10:43,638
Greetings, Madam Yao.

205
00:10:45,597 --> 00:10:46,198
Help me up.

206
00:10:56,677 --> 00:10:57,198
Madam Yao,

207
00:10:58,318 --> 00:10:59,758
hearing that you had complications,

208
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:00,958
Madam Rui was very worried.

209
00:11:01,797 --> 00:11:03,318
So she specially
sent me to check on you.

210
00:11:03,717 --> 00:11:04,518
No need to check on me.

211
00:11:05,638 --> 00:11:06,670
I have pregnancy complications.

212
00:11:06,797 --> 00:11:07,878
Can she give birth for me

213
00:11:07,878 --> 00:11:08,797
or endure the pain for me?

214
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,758
Since you don't need any help,

215
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,318
I'll make a move first.

216
00:11:29,357 --> 00:11:30,477
Why did you hit me?

217
00:11:31,597 --> 00:11:32,677
Why did you hit me?

218
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:34,518
Why did you hit me?

219
00:11:37,037 --> 00:11:38,157
Why did you hit me?

220
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,078
Why did you hit me?

221
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:45,837
Why did you hit me?

222
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:50,270
I've followed you for over ten years,

223
00:11:50,357 --> 00:11:51,917
but I've never been
treated as a human by you.

224
00:11:52,357 --> 00:11:53,398
Since you treasure

225
00:11:53,398 --> 00:11:54,237
this child so much,

226
00:11:54,277 --> 00:11:55,558
I will not let you give birth.

227
00:12:10,318 --> 00:12:11,878
Madam.

228
00:12:14,118 --> 00:12:14,717
What's the matter?

229
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,470
Has anything happened to Madam Yao?

230
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:17,277
Madam,

231
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:18,958
Madam Yao have pregnancy complications

232
00:12:19,398 --> 00:12:20,677
and she's in excruciating pain in bed.

233
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:23,198
However, I saw...

234
00:12:23,837 --> 00:12:24,438
What did you see?

235
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,157
It's okay. They're one of us.

236
00:12:29,157 --> 00:12:29,638
Just speak.

237
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:32,118
I saw it with my own eyes

238
00:12:32,638 --> 00:12:33,398
that Ruhua actually

239
00:12:33,398 --> 00:12:34,198
put abortifacient

240
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:35,078
in Madam Yao's medicine.

241
00:12:39,638 --> 00:12:40,277
Nonsense.

242
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:42,477
Ruhua is her servant

243
00:12:42,477 --> 00:12:43,398
from her maternal home.

244
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:46,878
However, I think with how Madam Yao
scolds and abuses her,

245
00:12:47,398 --> 00:12:49,118
anyone would harbour resentment.

246
00:12:49,438 --> 00:12:50,677
It's natural for her to seek revenge.

247
00:12:51,318 --> 00:12:52,078
Did you stop her?

248
00:12:52,157 --> 00:12:52,638
I didn't.

249
00:12:53,797 --> 00:12:55,237
Are you insane? Why didn't you stop it?

250
00:12:55,237 --> 00:12:56,198
I didn't want to.

251
00:12:56,878 --> 00:12:57,970
She's committed many wicked deeds.

252
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,398
This is just her retribution.

253
00:13:00,118 --> 00:13:00,917
Zuiliu,

254
00:13:01,797 --> 00:13:04,398
are you absolutely sure that
Ruhua did it?

255
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:05,638
Absolutely.

256
00:13:07,998 --> 00:13:08,558
(Impossible.)

257
00:13:09,518 --> 00:13:10,357
(Ruhua knew)

258
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:11,597
(that Mu Haiyao's child was lost.)

259
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:13,118
(She wouldn't do this.)

260
00:13:14,277 --> 00:13:15,198
(The child was lost,)

261
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,470
(but the physician still prescribed
medicine for the pregnancy.)

262
00:13:18,237 --> 00:13:19,118
(What's Madam Yao planning)

263
00:13:19,118 --> 00:13:20,150
(with such a grand spectacle?)

264
00:13:20,277 --> 00:13:21,510
(How big of a play will she put on?)

265
00:13:21,878 --> 00:13:22,438
(Madam.)

266
00:13:23,318 --> 00:13:24,277
(Why are you hesitating?)

267
00:13:24,518 --> 00:13:25,717
(You mustn't go there.)

268
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,518
Anything unusual at Luo Qinglian's place?

269
00:13:34,037 --> 00:13:34,438
Nothing.

270
00:13:35,157 --> 00:13:36,198
However, Madam, don't worry.

271
00:13:36,518 --> 00:13:37,670
Madam Rou is keeping an eye on her.

272
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:39,037
I'm just not sure

273
00:13:39,037 --> 00:13:40,438
if Madam Rui will...

274
00:13:43,878 --> 00:13:44,558
She'll come.

275
00:13:46,237 --> 00:13:47,157
She's always yearned

276
00:13:47,157 --> 00:13:48,357
to revive the Fang family.

277
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,570
Only if Young Master inherits
the title of the prince

278
00:13:52,157 --> 00:13:53,237
that her wish can come true.

279
00:13:54,438 --> 00:13:56,318
How can Young Master Xin

280
00:13:56,917 --> 00:13:58,438
who hardly has any heir,
inherit the title?

281
00:14:00,677 --> 00:14:02,318
So, as long as Luo Qinglian
doesn't stop her,

282
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:03,717
she'll definitely come.

283
00:14:15,357 --> 00:14:16,037
Thank you, Madam.

284
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:22,597
Although I really want to kill her,

285
00:14:23,758 --> 00:14:26,398
she carries the Young Master's child.

286
00:14:41,037 --> 00:14:41,878
Madam Rui, please wait!

287
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:06,980
The weather is getting chilly.

288
00:15:07,477 --> 00:15:08,318
You should wear a cloak.

289
00:15:33,797 --> 00:15:34,357
Young Master,

290
00:15:35,677 --> 00:15:36,998
please don't blame me.

291
00:15:38,277 --> 00:15:39,677
I know you're busy with work,

292
00:15:40,597 --> 00:15:41,078
but

293
00:15:43,438 --> 00:15:44,518
if I don't keep you by my side,

294
00:15:45,438 --> 00:15:46,477
something bad

295
00:15:46,717 --> 00:15:47,878
might happen to the child.

296
00:15:48,837 --> 00:15:49,677
Haiyao.

297
00:15:50,438 --> 00:15:51,518
We're at this point in time.

298
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:52,480
Why are you still saying that?

299
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:54,797
I cherish this child

300
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:56,958
and I need this child.

301
00:15:57,438 --> 00:15:58,477
As long as you need it,

302
00:16:00,597 --> 00:16:02,277
I will endure any hardship

303
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,677
just to ensure
that the child is born safely.

304
00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:20,477
Wretched maid.

305
00:16:21,157 --> 00:16:22,917
Why did you brew medicine
for such a long time?

306
00:16:23,438 --> 00:16:24,638
Just wait, I'll punish you soon.

307
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:39,518
Madam Rui is here.

308
00:16:49,398 --> 00:16:50,277
Don't drink that!

309
00:16:54,558 --> 00:16:56,277
This medicine is
a lifesaver for Madam Yao!

310
00:16:56,758 --> 00:16:57,398
Huairui,

311
00:16:58,318 --> 00:16:59,198
what are you doing?

312
00:16:59,597 --> 00:17:00,078
Huairui,

313
00:17:00,677 --> 00:17:02,917
do you want to kill
the child in my belly so badly?

314
00:17:04,597 --> 00:17:05,037
Haiyao,

315
00:17:05,677 --> 00:17:07,958
your words come with mixed feelings.

316
00:17:09,918 --> 00:17:11,278
I genuinely wish for your pregnancy

317
00:17:11,357 --> 00:17:12,357
to proceed smoothly.

318
00:17:15,518 --> 00:17:16,197
This medicine

319
00:17:16,957 --> 00:17:17,878
is an abortifacient.

320
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:25,957
Haiyao.

321
00:17:26,197 --> 00:17:26,638
Madam.

322
00:17:27,477 --> 00:17:28,678
Physician Zhang!

323
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:29,197
Physician!

324
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:30,118
Madam.

325
00:17:30,118 --> 00:17:30,557
Young Master.

326
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:33,158
I'll take another two hours
to brew medicine.

327
00:17:33,398 --> 00:17:34,678
Is there any quick-acting medicine?

328
00:17:35,717 --> 00:17:36,118
Yes.

329
00:17:38,837 --> 00:17:40,597
However, Young Master,

330
00:17:40,597 --> 00:17:42,437
this is a dire situation for Madam Yao.

331
00:17:42,837 --> 00:17:43,798
The original prescription

332
00:17:43,957 --> 00:17:44,758
was the best solution.

333
00:17:44,957 --> 00:17:46,077
It's too late to make a new one.

334
00:17:46,717 --> 00:17:48,077
This medicine is quick-acting.

335
00:17:48,717 --> 00:17:49,237
However,

336
00:17:49,357 --> 00:17:51,798
I'm concerned that
Madam Yao's body may not withstand it.

337
00:17:52,317 --> 00:17:54,957
Physician Zhang, bring it here.

338
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,270
As long as it's good for the child,

339
00:18:01,317 --> 00:18:02,518
I can tolerate it.

340
00:18:13,957 --> 00:18:14,398
Madam.

341
00:18:16,278 --> 00:18:16,998
Madam.

342
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:19,597
Ruhua.

343
00:18:21,638 --> 00:18:22,158
Madam.

344
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:36,670
Physician, check her pulse.

345
00:18:37,518 --> 00:18:38,118
All right.

346
00:18:52,237 --> 00:18:52,798
Young Master,

347
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,798
it's fortunate that she didn't miscarry.

348
00:18:54,918 --> 00:18:55,878
Madam Yao's condition

349
00:18:56,197 --> 00:18:57,398
seems to be relatively stable.

350
00:18:59,758 --> 00:19:00,270
You may leave.

351
00:19:10,597 --> 00:19:12,717
Huairui, how would you explain?

352
00:19:13,077 --> 00:19:13,557
Young Master.

353
00:19:14,437 --> 00:19:16,197
Even if I were to
behave rudely in public,

354
00:19:17,158 --> 00:19:18,317
I would never allow Haiyao

355
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:19,317
to drink this medicine,

356
00:19:19,918 --> 00:19:21,317
because Zuiliu saw with her own eyes

357
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,660
that Ruhua, holding a grudge
against Haiyao for the harsh treatment,

358
00:19:23,678 --> 00:19:25,317
slipped in an abortifacient.

359
00:19:25,317 --> 00:19:26,038
I didn't.

360
00:19:26,638 --> 00:19:27,158
Young Master,

361
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,918
I've been with Madam Yao
since I was a child.

362
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:29,957
How could I commit

363
00:19:29,957 --> 00:19:31,118
such an outrageous act?

364
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:32,477
Madam Rui,

365
00:19:32,957 --> 00:19:34,557
I haven't offended you in any way.

366
00:19:34,678 --> 00:19:36,518
Why are you framing me like this?

367
00:19:38,437 --> 00:19:39,437
Whether it is a framing,

368
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,870
it's not something
we can determine.

369
00:19:44,437 --> 00:19:44,878
All right.

370
00:20:03,237 --> 00:20:03,878
Young Master.

371
00:20:05,077 --> 00:20:06,197
There is nothing in this potion

372
00:20:10,437 --> 00:20:11,557
that could cause a miscarriage.

373
00:20:19,158 --> 00:20:19,878
How could it be?

374
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,436
Young Master,

375
00:20:40,475 --> 00:20:41,276
please believe me.

376
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,420
I would never falsely accuse a servant.

377
00:20:43,436 --> 00:20:45,340
Of course you wouldn't try to frame me.

378
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:49,796
Madam Rui, everyone feels sorry
that you have lost your child,

379
00:20:49,796 --> 00:20:53,276
but you shouldn't have tried
to harm Madam Yao

380
00:20:53,276 --> 00:20:54,196
because of her pregnancy.

381
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,916
If it wasn't for the good fortune
of Madam Yao,

382
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,885
you would've lost another child

383
00:21:00,006 --> 00:21:01,220
of your own, Young Master.

384
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,172
Young Master.

385
00:21:08,656 --> 00:21:09,633
Please believe me.

386
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:12,422
Haiyao is carrying your child.

387
00:21:12,853 --> 00:21:14,938
I hold no grudge against her.

388
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,270
Nor do I have ill intention to harm her.

389
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,000
Young Master,

390
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,915
I swear I saw with my own eyes that
Ruhua put poison in the medicine.

391
00:21:20,378 --> 00:21:22,023
If I'm lying, may lightning strike me.

392
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,400
Young Master,

393
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,180
I was present at
Jingqiu Pavilion at the time

394
00:21:25,378 --> 00:21:26,729
and I heard Zuiliu's report.

395
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:28,315
She's not lying.

396
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,479
Who doesn't know

397
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,560
that you all serve Madam Rui?

398
00:21:31,003 --> 00:21:32,279
The physician has examined the medicine

399
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,470
and that's a concrete evidence.

400
00:21:33,978 --> 00:21:36,777
Madam Yao is pregnant

401
00:21:36,898 --> 00:21:38,298
but she is being treated like this.

402
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:40,675
Young Master,

403
00:21:40,915 --> 00:21:42,804
we implore you to stand up for Madam Yao.

404
00:21:43,123 --> 00:21:43,763
That's enough.

405
00:21:57,811 --> 00:21:58,531
Huairui, rise.

406
00:21:58,965 --> 00:21:59,539
All of you, rise.

407
00:22:04,292 --> 00:22:06,333
Hui'er's matter has hurt you deeply.

408
00:22:06,573 --> 00:22:08,532
You should rest more for now.

409
00:22:09,652 --> 00:22:12,252
Let Haiyao take care
of the matters in the mansion.

410
00:22:16,412 --> 00:22:17,252
Understand.

411
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,140
(Langyue Hall)

412
00:22:46,492 --> 00:22:47,453
You don't need to watch her.

413
00:22:48,372 --> 00:22:49,532
If she wanted to expose it,

414
00:22:50,213 --> 00:22:51,372
she would have said so.

415
00:23:00,853 --> 00:23:01,213
Madam.

416
00:23:01,652 --> 00:23:03,213
You really frightened me just now.

417
00:23:03,453 --> 00:23:04,853
You tested Luo Qinglian like that

418
00:23:04,853 --> 00:23:06,270
to see if she's pledging
allegiance to you.

419
00:23:06,453 --> 00:23:08,132
In case the miscarriage was exposed

420
00:23:08,252 --> 00:23:10,573
and it ruined your plan with Madam Rou,

421
00:23:10,733 --> 00:23:12,252
wouldn't it have been bad?

422
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:13,613
Are you sure?

423
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:15,933
If Luo Qinglian pretended
to be loyal to me,

424
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:17,292
yet pretended to help me

425
00:23:17,292 --> 00:23:18,573
to conceal the miscarriage,

426
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,532
it'd mean she had a long-term plan.

427
00:23:20,772 --> 00:23:22,292
One day, she'd be caught red-handed.

428
00:23:22,573 --> 00:23:23,853
Even if she wanted to play a long game,

429
00:23:23,853 --> 00:23:25,372
I wouldn't want to be her prey.

430
00:23:25,813 --> 00:23:26,933
In that case,

431
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,254
Luo Qinglian pledged
her allegiance, didn't she?

432
00:23:31,134 --> 00:23:32,494
She is undoubtedly sincere.

433
00:23:32,933 --> 00:23:34,813
My original plan was to
kill two birds with one stone

434
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:37,254
and at least ground Madam Rui.

435
00:23:37,774 --> 00:23:40,173
I didn't expect
that I only managed to take back

436
00:23:40,173 --> 00:23:41,413
her authority over household affairs.

437
00:23:41,734 --> 00:23:43,293
For what we need to do,

438
00:23:43,774 --> 00:23:44,693
that is already enough.

439
00:23:58,734 --> 00:24:01,094
Madam Yao, Madam Rou, greetings.

440
00:24:03,453 --> 00:24:04,293
Has everyone left?

441
00:24:06,254 --> 00:24:06,813
Have a seat then.

442
00:24:13,293 --> 00:24:13,813
Have some tea.

443
00:24:30,653 --> 00:24:32,134
I remember when we first met,

444
00:24:32,494 --> 00:24:34,614
you were just a reckless young girl
who knew nothing.

445
00:24:35,533 --> 00:24:37,854
You dared to elope and
defy the order of marriage.

446
00:24:38,453 --> 00:24:40,734
You always spoke your mind openly.

447
00:24:41,053 --> 00:24:42,293
In less than half a year,

448
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:43,933
you've become so composed

449
00:24:44,293 --> 00:24:46,413
that you could even hide
Young Master and Madam Rui.

450
00:24:47,413 --> 00:24:48,894
People have to grow after all.

451
00:24:50,053 --> 00:24:52,218
It's just that I'm a bit smarter
than others.

452
00:24:53,772 --> 00:24:54,613
How clever are you?

453
00:24:56,532 --> 00:24:57,733
What do you think about this matter?

454
00:24:58,892 --> 00:25:00,453
My opinion doesn't matter.

455
00:25:01,093 --> 00:25:01,933
The important thing is

456
00:25:02,492 --> 00:25:03,132
I

457
00:25:04,492 --> 00:25:05,750
shouldn't be thinking about anything.

458
00:25:08,412 --> 00:25:11,053
There aren't many smart
people like you nowadays.

459
00:25:12,153 --> 00:25:13,553
Am I right, Rou?

460
00:25:18,053 --> 00:25:20,813
Yes, such people are rare.

461
00:25:22,892 --> 00:25:24,973
All right, it's getting late.

462
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:26,172
You should also go back.

463
00:25:27,172 --> 00:25:28,772
Come by when you have time.

464
00:25:30,372 --> 00:25:30,933
By the way,

465
00:25:31,372 --> 00:25:34,292
regarding the matter of having
my elder brother take charge of the treasury,

466
00:25:34,652 --> 00:25:35,892
I can barely agree.

467
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:38,613
However, I heard
that there seem to be many people

468
00:25:39,012 --> 00:25:40,213
who are unwilling to repay the debts.

469
00:25:41,053 --> 00:25:42,412
Even Young Master is at a loss.

470
00:25:44,093 --> 00:25:45,532
I do have a solution for this.

471
00:25:49,093 --> 00:25:50,372
You've been here for a while.

472
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:52,532
I wonder what you've learnt.

473
00:25:54,459 --> 00:25:55,299
Which one are you best at?

474
00:25:56,659 --> 00:25:57,738
Of course it's

475
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:00,012
knowing when to give up.

476
00:26:02,492 --> 00:26:03,892
Is it knowing when to give up

477
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,892
or are you using retreat
as a means to advance?

478
00:26:09,892 --> 00:26:11,132
I believe you're tired.

479
00:26:11,412 --> 00:26:14,252
On another day,
come to Xiyan Tower for a chat.

480
00:26:15,693 --> 00:26:16,492
Take care.

481
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:29,613
A spider?

482
00:26:30,573 --> 00:26:31,772
What does this mean?

483
00:26:36,573 --> 00:26:38,093
A spider weaves its web on the eaves,

484
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,270
so that it can disguise
itself as a mountain insect.

485
00:26:41,292 --> 00:26:43,012
What the spider excels at the most

486
00:26:43,012 --> 00:26:44,333
is patience and biding its time.

487
00:26:47,492 --> 00:26:49,172
Could she have known that you...

488
00:26:52,093 --> 00:26:54,733
Could Mu Haiyao have risen to power

489
00:26:55,652 --> 00:26:58,093
by not solely relying on the Mu family?

490
00:27:02,772 --> 00:27:03,252
Ms. Lian.

491
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:06,733
Ms. Lian, I was looking for you.

492
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:07,813
What's the matter?

493
00:27:13,944 --> 00:27:15,105
Ms. Lian.

494
00:27:26,218 --> 00:27:27,699
If I remember correctly,

495
00:27:28,653 --> 00:27:30,134
you just mentioned your busy schedule.

496
00:27:30,653 --> 00:27:31,293
Well,

497
00:27:31,974 --> 00:27:33,774
did I owe the treasury money?

498
00:27:34,734 --> 00:27:35,693
I did say that,

499
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:37,374
but I also said

500
00:27:37,933 --> 00:27:38,573
that you

501
00:27:40,614 --> 00:27:42,333
should obediently wait for
me at Lianwei Residence.

502
00:27:44,453 --> 00:27:46,134
What do you want to
do in bright daylight?

503
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:49,134
Who says that

504
00:27:49,974 --> 00:27:52,573
conversations can only happen at night?

505
00:27:55,894 --> 00:27:57,453
Girl, are you thinking...

506
00:27:59,933 --> 00:28:01,293
I don't have anything

507
00:28:01,293 --> 00:28:02,293
to talk to you about.

508
00:28:02,653 --> 00:28:04,254
You don't, but I do.

509
00:28:05,453 --> 00:28:06,653
First, we should talk about

510
00:28:06,974 --> 00:28:08,173
the matter from earlier on.

511
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:09,573
The matter from earlier on?

512
00:28:09,933 --> 00:28:11,132
You already knew?

513
00:28:11,532 --> 00:28:12,053
Girl,

514
00:28:14,412 --> 00:28:16,853
you aren't hiding anything from me,
are you?

515
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:19,292
Young Master, please behave.

516
00:28:19,973 --> 00:28:20,652
Behave?

517
00:28:20,892 --> 00:28:21,933
Ask around.

518
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:22,733
If I ever behaved,

519
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:23,933
I wouldn't have been He Lianxin.

520
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:25,892
You're now my servant-concubine.

521
00:28:26,573 --> 00:28:28,613
Do you really think
being a servant-concubine is so easy?

522
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,000
We had a gentlemen's agreement.
You can't touch me.

523
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:34,853
An agreement?

524
00:28:35,093 --> 00:28:35,973
What have you done for me?

525
00:28:36,492 --> 00:28:37,573
Guessing my father's intentions

526
00:28:37,573 --> 00:28:38,693
or helping me to recover the debt?

527
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:41,172
I...

528
00:28:45,573 --> 00:28:46,733
I, He Lianxin,

529
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,292
never engage in unprofitable deals.

530
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:52,132
Even if I miscalculated this time

531
00:28:52,412 --> 00:28:53,372
and placed the wrong bet,

532
00:28:56,213 --> 00:28:57,573
I can't let myself

533
00:28:58,172 --> 00:29:00,132
suffer great losses, right?

534
00:29:01,613 --> 00:29:02,693
How about the two of us...

535
00:29:04,372 --> 00:29:05,093
We...

536
00:29:10,492 --> 00:29:11,053
Young Master.

537
00:29:11,853 --> 00:29:12,733
Please check it out.

538
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,453
Young Master Zuo
has set up a stall outside

539
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:15,510
Testaments and Treasures Bureau.

540
00:29:15,525 --> 00:29:16,885
Master, the work is more urgent.

541
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,900
(Testaments and Treasures Bureau)

542
00:29:40,134 --> 00:29:41,494
Guys, look here!

543
00:29:41,494 --> 00:29:43,630
These are all excellent collectibles,
calligraphy and paintings.

544
00:29:44,214 --> 00:29:45,173
Who wants to make an offer?

545
00:29:45,653 --> 00:29:46,533
We'll sell them at will.

546
00:29:46,614 --> 00:29:47,933
Isn't that Young Master Zuo?

547
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,094
Yes.

548
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,630
Didn't he just receive the appointment as
the General of Defence?

549
00:29:52,012 --> 00:29:54,252
How did he end up selling calligraphy and
paintings on the street?

550
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:55,292
Also, this. Come over here.

551
00:29:55,613 --> 00:29:57,100
A painting of Welcome.

552
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,532
Anyone here with a discerning eye?

553
00:29:58,973 --> 00:30:00,093
You have something to do.

554
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:01,333
Why did you bring me along?

555
00:30:01,973 --> 00:30:03,053
What did I just say?

556
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:04,733
I never engage in unprofitable deals.

557
00:30:05,213 --> 00:30:07,292
I exchanged a valuable horse for you.

558
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,870
Since I made the wrong judgement,

559
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:10,372
I don't mind suffering losses

560
00:30:10,573 --> 00:30:12,012
and use you as a servant.

561
00:30:12,292 --> 00:30:13,213
Add some water later.

562
00:30:19,132 --> 00:30:20,292
Greetings, Young Master.

563
00:30:20,613 --> 00:30:21,492
Mu, don't be so polite.

564
00:30:21,772 --> 00:30:22,252
Where is he?

565
00:30:23,093 --> 00:30:23,652
He's right here.

566
00:30:28,412 --> 00:30:29,573
50 taels. Take it.

567
00:30:30,573 --> 00:30:31,132
Young Master Zuo.

568
00:30:31,693 --> 00:30:32,733
Stop selling them.

569
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:35,012
This is not decent.

570
00:30:36,652 --> 00:30:37,132
Why

571
00:30:37,933 --> 00:30:39,300
can Lianxin force to repay debts,

572
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,060
while I can't sell things?

573
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,280
To be honest,

574
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,120
my third brother's debt collection

575
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,400
has driven all the officials in Quliang
to the brink of despair!

576
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,679
Forget about me,

577
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,439
even my second brother, the heir,

578
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,079
can barely afford meat now.

579
00:30:55,719 --> 00:30:57,880
Young Master Zuo,
please don't talk nonsense.

580
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,439
You should go back.

581
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,280
I can't go back.

582
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:04,959
Take a look at my treasures.

583
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,719
They're all good things.

584
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:07,959
This one.

585
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,640
This is a precious gourd.

586
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,479
Look, it's inlaid with jade.

587
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:12,719
Take it for 50 taels.

588
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,000
I won't offer it to anyone else.

589
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,959
Just 50 taels.

590
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:16,359
50 taels, that's what we agreed on.

591
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:16,959
50 taels.

592
00:31:17,556 --> 00:31:18,997
Come on, take a look at this.

593
00:31:19,157 --> 00:31:20,877
Ivory carving.

594
00:31:21,237 --> 00:31:22,316
50 taels. Is anyone interested?

595
00:31:22,436 --> 00:31:23,117
50 taels.

596
00:31:23,117 --> 00:31:23,836
60 taels.

597
00:31:25,356 --> 00:31:25,997
70 taels.

598
00:31:26,436 --> 00:31:26,917
100.

599
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:27,596
Good, it's yours.

600
00:31:27,757 --> 00:31:28,397
100 taels.

601
00:31:28,556 --> 00:31:30,237
Also, this grape ornament.

602
00:31:30,237 --> 00:31:30,997
Listen,

603
00:31:30,997 --> 00:31:31,757
it's so impressive.

604
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:33,037
Have you seen it?

605
00:31:33,596 --> 00:31:34,596
Official, I'm wondering

606
00:31:34,836 --> 00:31:35,676
what are you trying to do?

607
00:31:36,877 --> 00:31:38,316
Am I required to report to you

608
00:31:38,316 --> 00:31:39,556
what I want to do?

609
00:31:39,836 --> 00:31:40,356
Make way.

610
00:31:40,797 --> 00:31:41,956
If you have other business,

611
00:31:41,956 --> 00:31:43,716
you don't need permission from me,

612
00:31:43,997 --> 00:31:45,517
but if you want to repay your debt,

613
00:31:45,956 --> 00:31:47,917
the heir would like to know your name.

614
00:31:47,997 --> 00:31:50,356
You can have a proper conversation
another day.

615
00:31:50,356 --> 00:31:51,117
The heir?

616
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:56,037
What's wrong? Do you have any issue?

617
00:31:56,397 --> 00:31:57,117
No, it's nothing.

618
00:31:57,836 --> 00:31:58,556
I went the wrong way.

619
00:32:02,237 --> 00:32:02,716
Let's go.

620
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:09,839
The heir and Lianxiu

621
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,199
put in a lot of effort.

622
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,000
It seems that completing this task

623
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:14,640
is going to be difficult.

624
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,079
Mu.

625
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:18,120
You volunteered

626
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:19,719
to help me to collect the debts,

627
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,760
I'm afraid I've burdened you.

628
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,440
Young Master, you are too serious.

629
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,079
Young Master and the Mu family

630
00:32:25,439 --> 00:32:27,640
are already sharing glory and adversity.

631
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,040
There's no burden for me.

632
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,079
Besides,

633
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,400
I know something that might be of help.

634
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,240
(Treasury)

635
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,000
Official Mu, what are you showing me?

636
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:49,400
You will know immediately.

637
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,160
However,

638
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:53,760
Ms. Qinglian is here.

639
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,520
It's inappropriate.

640
00:32:56,014 --> 00:32:56,933
It's all right.

641
00:32:57,053 --> 00:32:58,894
You can just treat her like this cart.

642
00:33:04,726 --> 00:33:06,354
(Treasury)

643
00:33:20,293 --> 00:33:20,813
Please check.

644
00:33:26,693 --> 00:33:27,374
You...

645
00:33:27,533 --> 00:33:28,653
Why didn't you tell me?

646
00:33:30,053 --> 00:33:30,933
I asked you just now.

647
00:33:30,933 --> 00:33:32,053
Didn't you say it's fine?

648
00:33:33,494 --> 00:33:34,333
You...

649
00:33:39,734 --> 00:33:40,933
What are they doing?

650
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:42,650
They are conducting a routine inspection

651
00:33:42,974 --> 00:33:45,214
because only these custodians

652
00:33:45,374 --> 00:33:46,530
are allowed to enter the treasury.

653
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:48,220
So when they leave the treasury,

654
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,540
they have to raise their hands,
clap their hands, shout

655
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:51,500
and jump across the benches

656
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:54,180
to prove they aren't carrying money
in their mouths,

657
00:33:54,494 --> 00:33:56,813
hands or under their armpits.

658
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,540
Do they do this every day?

659
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,260
Yes.

660
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,580
Even so,

661
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,420
money is often stolen from the treasury.

662
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:12,980
Young Master,

663
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,910
I coincidentally heard

664
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,870
that the thief might be...

665
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:29,430
Are they done?

666
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,630
Could my information have been wrong?

667
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,390
Not necessarily.

668
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:39,670
There might be details that we can't see.

669
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,110
Mu,

670
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,230
don't let them go for now.

671
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,110
I have something to say.

672
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:44,950
Understood.

673
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,430
Remember to ask them to get dressed.

674
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,190
Have you done enough hugging?

675
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:55,910
They're taking off their pants.

676
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,230
It's early spring and it's still chilly.

677
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,210
Earlier on, all of you
were completely naked.

678
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,510
Weren't you afraid of catching a cold?

679
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,510
Thank you, Young Master Xin.

680
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,860
We are used to it.

681
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,570
It's always like this
even in the coldest days.

682
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:17,370
You've worked hard.

683
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,250
You've all worked hard.

684
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:20,330
Servant.

685
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:28,810
Hurry up, you're slow.

686
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,330
Freshly brewed ginger soup.

687
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:37,170
Hurry, drink it up.

688
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:37,890
One bowl per person.

689
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,270
- Thank you, Young Master Xin.
- Thank you, Young Master Xin.

690
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,090
Feel free to take it. Come on.

691
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:56,730
Come on.

692
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,210
What a well-behaved servant.

693
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:06,930
This servant is really beautiful.

694
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:20,210
She's so virtuous.

695
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,650
This servant is so virtuous.

696
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:33,930
Thank you.

697
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:36,170
All right.

698
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,570
Now that you have finished you soup

699
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,450
and your bodies are warm,

700
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:40,650
we should have a proper discussion.

701
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,250
I assume most of you are aware

702
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:44,290
that Prince An sent me
to collect the debt.

703
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:45,810
So, I need to know

704
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,850
what the deal is with this treasury.

705
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:48,930
So I'm here today

706
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,650
to ask about the treasury's procedures.

707
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,850
Young Master Xin, these procedures
are quite intricate.

708
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:56,330
It might take some time
to explain them fully.

709
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,010
If you genuinely want to know,

710
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,210
I can report to you in private.

711
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:05,610
Young Master Xin,

712
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,450
I want to go to toilet.

713
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,090
Me too.

714
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,700
(Zuo's Mansion)
With the croton,

715
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,330
(Zuo's Mansion)

716
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,330
(Zuo's Mansion)
make the treasury workers

717
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:37,050
to bring out their hidden money.

718
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:38,210
This...

719
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,210
Is this something a young master should do?

720
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:49,290
He Lianxin

721
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,650
is way too immoral!

722
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:55,290
Young Master, that's my own brother.

723
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,090
You must save him.

724
00:37:58,730 --> 00:37:59,530
Your own brother?

725
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,290
He dared to bribe the treasury workers

726
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:03,290
and stole the money.

727
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,330
Why would I need to save him?

728
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,170
Whose idea was this?

729
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,130
They hide money in such a filthy place.

730
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,370
How did Mu Tianshu find out?

731
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:29,450
Young Master.

732
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:33,090
This is a crime punishable by death.

733
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:34,690
Also, in my family,

734
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,930
we only have this one male heir.

735
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,530
I'm begging you, Young Master.

736
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:39,650
Please save him.

737
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,530
How can I save him?

738
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,050
Haven't you seen

739
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,290
the real purpose of Lianxin?

740
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:45,810
It's obvious
that he set a fire in my backyard

741
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:46,650
to force me to repay!

742
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,930
Why don't you just repay the debt?

743
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:51,450
You...

744
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:53,810
I will not repay it.

745
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,170
Young Master.

746
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:55,850
Shut up!

747
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:56,570
Young Master.

748
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,390
How dare you say again.

749
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:18,850
Young Master, please save him.

750
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:22,010
Steward Song,

751
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:23,570
please allow us to see the heir.

752
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,970
You want to see the heir?

753
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,560
What's your purpose?

754
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,280
What are you doing?

755
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,080
Young Master Zuo.

756
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,320
Get off.

757
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,560
Hurry.

758
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:46,800
(Testaments and Treasures Bureau)

759
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,400
(Testaments and Treasures Bureau)
Hurry.

760
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,960
I don't know what happened.

761
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,560
Suddenly, I had a craving
for lotus seed pastries.

762
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,760
This delicacy requires a lot of effort.

763
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,560
You must have put in
a lot of effort, right?

764
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,880
Madam Yao, even if your order
requires a lot of effort,

765
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,800
it's my duty as a servant to fulfil it.

766
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,320
Moreover,

767
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,560
I heard that since Young Master

768
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,780
received assistance from Master Mu,

769
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,400
in just a few days,

770
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,600
half of the outstanding
debt has been repaid.

771
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,280
It seems that the funds
for flood management

772
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:19,960
are about to be gathered.

773
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,200
Of course,

774
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,520
I must congratulate you, Madam Yao.

775
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,360
All right, you should
take the credit as well.
