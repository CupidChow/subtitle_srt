- Dongli.
- Dongli.

19
00:01:56,048 --> 00:01:57,600
The poison in your body
hasn't dissipated yet.

20
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,768
How can you go out now?

21
00:02:03,128 --> 00:02:03,648
Dongli.

22
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,287
Dongli.

23
00:02:04,968 --> 00:02:06,207
Young Master, don't worry.

24
00:02:06,768 --> 00:02:07,728
Madam Lian will be fine.

25
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,008
The people I sent

26
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:10,008
will definitely find her.

27
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,408
We have a report!

28
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:18,367
Young Master.

29
00:02:18,527 --> 00:02:20,520
There's no sign of Madam Lian
at any of the checkpoints.

30
00:02:21,288 --> 00:02:21,768
Search again.

31
00:02:22,087 --> 00:02:22,488
Yes.

32
00:02:26,527 --> 00:02:28,527
Young Master, we've searched inside
and outside the city,

33
00:02:28,527 --> 00:02:30,040
but there's still no sign of Madam Lian.

34
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,607
Search again.

35
00:02:31,247 --> 00:02:31,607
Yes.

36
00:02:36,807 --> 00:02:37,520
Young Master.

37
00:02:39,688 --> 00:02:40,568
Still no sign of her?

38
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:42,647
Search again!

39
00:02:43,048 --> 00:02:43,527
Hurry.

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,521
(Qiege Hall)

41
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:50,128
Qinglian.

42
00:02:51,447 --> 00:02:52,488
Where are you?

43
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,727
Young Master, please don't worry.

44
00:03:10,768 --> 00:03:11,800
What do you want to do?

45
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:15,527
As the saying goes,

46
00:03:16,007 --> 00:03:18,048
fortune and misfortune
come hand in hand.

47
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:20,087
It looks like the saying

48
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:22,167
is spot on.

49
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:24,007
Young Master Xin's woman

50
00:03:24,007 --> 00:03:25,688
has fallen into my hands.

51
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:27,887
It's an once-in-a-lifetime

52
00:03:28,447 --> 00:03:30,568
opportunity for me.

53
00:03:30,968 --> 00:03:32,408
How can I bear to kill you?

54
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:34,647
How about spending

55
00:03:34,768 --> 00:03:36,247
a night of passion with me?

56
00:03:38,527 --> 00:03:39,928
You know my identity,

57
00:03:40,607 --> 00:03:41,928
yet you act so brazenly.

58
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,928
Young Master Xin will undoubtedly exert
all efforts to rescue me at this moment.

59
00:03:44,928 --> 00:03:46,400
How many heads do you
think you have to spare?

60
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:52,128
You'd better not think
about your husband.

61
00:03:52,568 --> 00:03:53,408
He's been

62
00:03:53,727 --> 00:03:56,568
ordered to find the worthless junk.

63
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:59,167
He won't even have time for you

64
00:03:59,647 --> 00:04:00,568
and what's more,

65
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:03,727
how can he even find you here?

66
00:04:04,848 --> 00:04:06,288
In this remote wilderness,

67
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:08,288
even if I provided him with a map,

68
00:04:08,768 --> 00:04:10,848
he'd probably still be clueless.

69
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:13,080
So, what do you think?

70
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,647
Am I right?

71
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:18,768
Map?

72
00:04:21,968 --> 00:04:23,688
Worthless junk.

73
00:04:30,927 --> 00:04:31,527
I understand.

74
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:32,279
What do you understand?

75
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:32,840
Young Master.

76
00:04:33,888 --> 00:04:34,927
- Tell me.
- Step back!

77
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:36,680
Don't come any closer!

78
00:04:37,728 --> 00:04:37,968
No.

79
00:04:37,968 --> 00:04:38,920
If you move one step closer,

80
00:04:39,087 --> 00:04:40,128
I'll end my life!

81
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:40,688
No.

82
00:04:41,608 --> 00:04:42,327
If I die,

83
00:04:42,728 --> 00:04:44,448
your master will take your life too!

84
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:45,327
Please don't.

85
00:04:46,288 --> 00:04:47,087
Young lady,

86
00:04:47,568 --> 00:04:48,568
please don't get agitated.

87
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:49,728
I'll step back.

88
00:04:50,367 --> 00:04:51,280
I'm stepping back right now.

89
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:54,848
Even if you're strong,

90
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:56,647
you'll get tired,

91
00:04:57,448 --> 00:04:58,168
sleepy

92
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:00,247
and hungry.

93
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:01,568
There's no hurry.

94
00:05:02,207 --> 00:05:03,367
I'll wait for you.

95
00:05:04,247 --> 00:05:05,128
By then,

96
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:08,327
you'll know how good I am.

97
00:05:10,807 --> 00:05:11,728
I'll step back.

98
00:05:12,288 --> 00:05:13,247
I'll step back now.

99
00:05:21,047 --> 00:05:22,487
I'm waiting for you.

100
00:05:32,927 --> 00:05:34,120
There're just a few paintings.

101
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:35,568
Find some painters.

102
00:05:36,008 --> 00:05:37,728
Get all the painters in Quliang.

103
00:05:38,128 --> 00:05:38,688
Yes.

104
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:42,968
Dongli,

105
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:44,760
have you received news about Ms. Lian?

106
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:47,168
No news for two days.

107
00:05:47,608 --> 00:05:48,087
Dongli,

108
00:05:48,568 --> 00:05:50,807
do you think Ms. Lian might be in danger?

109
00:05:55,008 --> 00:05:55,448
Dongli.

110
00:05:55,448 --> 00:05:56,560
Are you going to keep searching?

111
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:57,800
You haven't eaten anything.

112
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,807
Do you want to die?

113
00:05:59,288 --> 00:06:00,927
I failed to protect Ms. Lian.

114
00:06:03,327 --> 00:06:04,288
Even if I die,

115
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:07,408
I must find her.

116
00:06:09,087 --> 00:06:10,047
Dongli.

117
00:06:26,367 --> 00:06:27,288
Stay right here.

118
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:29,207
Don't go anywhere.

119
00:06:30,408 --> 00:06:31,608
It's my fault.

120
00:06:33,888 --> 00:06:35,568
I've lost Ms. Lian.

121
00:06:40,927 --> 00:06:41,807
It's not your fault.

122
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,128
You're a young girl

123
00:06:43,387 --> 00:06:45,600
following men and travelling long distances
to search for your lady.

124
00:06:45,807 --> 00:06:48,448
Look at the scratches
and insect bites on your hands.

125
00:06:49,527 --> 00:06:50,927
If your lady were to see them,

126
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:52,848
she'd be heartbroken.

127
00:07:21,047 --> 00:07:21,807
Young Master Yi,

128
00:07:23,327 --> 00:07:24,767
you said these were insect bites.

129
00:07:26,927 --> 00:07:28,487
Do different insects

130
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:32,448
leave different marks?

131
00:07:33,568 --> 00:07:34,288
Yes, they do.

132
00:07:35,968 --> 00:07:36,927
Some unusual ones

133
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:38,927
can even indicate the species

134
00:07:39,448 --> 00:07:40,408
and region.

135
00:07:46,807 --> 00:07:48,367
What about these red line marks,

136
00:07:49,327 --> 00:07:50,568
like centipede bites?

137
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:52,728
Are they considered unusual?

138
00:07:53,448 --> 00:07:54,288
They're uncommon,

139
00:07:55,168 --> 00:07:57,568
but only a specific small insect
found in the outskirts of Quliang

140
00:07:57,927 --> 00:07:58,807
can leave

141
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,128
such marks.

142
00:08:00,487 --> 00:08:02,527
Don't worry, this one of yours isn't.

143
00:08:06,728 --> 00:08:07,600
I've seen them before.

144
00:08:10,608 --> 00:08:11,327
Do you mean...

145
00:08:13,487 --> 00:08:15,360
Young Master, you've been sleepless
for several nights now.

146
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,327
If you continue like this,
your health won't hold up.

147
00:08:19,527 --> 00:08:20,168
Lianxin,

148
00:08:20,448 --> 00:08:21,608
I know where Madam Lian is.

149
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:23,608
Hurry!

150
00:08:41,928 --> 00:08:43,327
Beiyi, it's time to eat.

151
00:08:55,048 --> 00:08:57,048
The dishes today
are all the new recipes I've learnt.

152
00:08:57,567 --> 00:08:59,368
Try them to see if they taste good.

153
00:08:59,368 --> 00:09:00,687
There are only the two of us.

154
00:09:00,787 --> 00:09:02,280
You didn't have to
prepare so many dishes.

155
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:03,288
It's too much trouble.

156
00:09:04,488 --> 00:09:05,687
Besides, you are after all...

157
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:10,327
No matter what my previous status was,

158
00:09:10,808 --> 00:09:12,240
I should cook for you with my own hands

159
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:14,527
since I'm with you now.

160
00:09:17,127 --> 00:09:18,248
If you have an extra bowl of it,

161
00:09:18,248 --> 00:09:19,048
I'll be happy.

162
00:09:22,207 --> 00:09:23,087
You've endured a lot

163
00:09:23,687 --> 00:09:24,408
over the years.

164
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:27,240
Even though we live together
in the same house,

165
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,527
we've kept separate rooms

166
00:09:30,887 --> 00:09:32,007
without even an official title.

167
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:34,220
Do you you think I feel mistreated?

168
00:09:35,527 --> 00:09:36,608
I only feel fortunate

169
00:09:37,127 --> 00:09:38,048
to be with you,

170
00:09:38,608 --> 00:09:40,000
living the days I'd always wished for.

171
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:45,968
However, there is one thing

172
00:09:46,848 --> 00:09:47,728
that bothers me.

173
00:09:49,327 --> 00:09:49,808
What is it?

174
00:09:55,007 --> 00:09:57,887
Lianxiu and his wife are both calculating
and cunning individuals.

175
00:09:59,007 --> 00:09:59,808
Right now,

176
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:01,488
they view Lianxin and his wife

177
00:10:01,608 --> 00:10:02,848
as the biggest threats.

178
00:10:03,808 --> 00:10:05,320
It's only natural for them to use you.

179
00:10:06,527 --> 00:10:07,327
However, if...

180
00:10:07,327 --> 00:10:07,728
Wait.

181
00:10:12,048 --> 00:10:13,920
This person is the greatest
threat to both you and me.

182
00:10:14,168 --> 00:10:15,120
Kill her immediately

183
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,520
to prevent further complications.

184
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:20,087
The greatest threat?

185
00:10:22,168 --> 00:10:22,647
They...

186
00:10:23,608 --> 00:10:24,567
They want to kill Lian'er.

187
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:28,087
Wait!

188
00:10:28,887 --> 00:10:30,020
Are you just leaving like this?

189
00:10:45,527 --> 00:10:46,647
If you go like this,

190
00:10:47,728 --> 00:10:48,608
how will you save her?

191
00:10:50,207 --> 00:10:50,848
Thank you.

192
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:53,567
Never thank me again.

193
00:10:54,327 --> 00:10:55,127
As long as you want it,

194
00:10:55,928 --> 00:10:57,368
I will go all out

195
00:10:58,248 --> 00:10:59,447
to help you to obtain it.

196
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:09,687
Who is it?

197
00:11:10,248 --> 00:11:11,080
Open the door.

198
00:11:11,288 --> 00:11:11,887
Mr. Zhang.

199
00:11:13,527 --> 00:11:14,808
Mr. Zhang, what brings you here?

200
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:15,327
Is she dead?

201
00:11:16,848 --> 00:11:17,288
Well...

202
00:11:18,168 --> 00:11:19,728
Why is she still here?

203
00:11:19,928 --> 00:11:20,567
Mr. Zhang,

204
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,127
it would be a shame to kill
such a beautiful lady, wouldn't it?

205
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,280
How about selling her instead?

206
00:11:24,327 --> 00:11:25,087
Let me tell you,

207
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:26,728
it's worth at least 2,000 taels.

208
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:29,767
You...

209
00:11:38,127 --> 00:11:39,048
You...

210
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:52,608
Lianxin,

211
00:12:53,408 --> 00:12:55,368
you'd been searching
for your wife without resting

212
00:12:55,368 --> 00:12:56,168
for the past few days.

213
00:12:56,767 --> 00:12:57,968
I know you're worried about her.

214
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,640
You're always keeping her by your side.

215
00:13:00,928 --> 00:13:02,288
Before you take any further action,

216
00:13:03,127 --> 00:13:04,087
you should get some rest.

217
00:13:04,447 --> 00:13:05,968
Those two prisoners
are refusing to talk.

218
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,160
Besides knowing
that they are associates of Lianxiu,

219
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,280
we have no other information.

220
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:10,207
Without solid evidence,

221
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,168
how are we going to find out

222
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:14,808
why he kidnapped Lian'er?

223
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:16,087
Are you implying

224
00:13:16,808 --> 00:13:18,760
that Lianxiu is connected
to the case in Huanzhou?

225
00:13:19,608 --> 00:13:20,488
Although Lianxiu has been

226
00:13:20,488 --> 00:13:21,567
wary of Lian'er for many years,

227
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:24,288
he'd resorted to such
desperate measures.

228
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:27,408
It seems that he's already cornered.

229
00:13:30,007 --> 00:13:31,560
This is already the territory
of Huanzhou.

230
00:13:32,048 --> 00:13:33,887
The investigators have been
searching for days.

231
00:13:33,968 --> 00:13:34,800
Are there any clues?

232
00:13:35,887 --> 00:13:36,647
We haven't found

233
00:13:36,647 --> 00:13:37,728
the stolen money.

234
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,840
(Increasing missing people in Huanzhou)

235
00:13:39,288 --> 00:13:41,007
Still, we've discovered something strange.

236
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:42,408
Many blacksmiths

237
00:13:42,848 --> 00:13:44,087
have gone missing this year.

238
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:45,928
Blacksmiths?

239
00:13:48,647 --> 00:13:50,687
Is there a connection between
them and the stolen money?

240
00:13:58,687 --> 00:13:59,207
Qinglian.

241
00:14:00,327 --> 00:14:00,848
Qinglian.

242
00:14:03,848 --> 00:14:06,248
I've finally deciphered

243
00:14:06,248 --> 00:14:08,048
the secret of Young Master Xiu in Huanzhou.

244
00:14:12,248 --> 00:14:13,368
The armoury.

245
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:15,887
This map

246
00:14:16,687 --> 00:14:17,928
had confounded me for days.

247
00:14:17,928 --> 00:14:19,040
I couldn't understand it at all.

248
00:14:19,728 --> 00:14:20,488
I never expected it

249
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:22,327
to be a distribution map

250
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:23,447
of iron ore in Huanzhou.

251
00:14:24,207 --> 00:14:26,288
No wonder Young Master Xiu is so determined

252
00:14:26,288 --> 00:14:27,207
to retrieve it.

253
00:14:28,207 --> 00:14:29,447
Is there any stronger evidence

254
00:14:29,647 --> 00:14:31,327
than the one he used
to lead a rebellion?

255
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,160
(Huarong Inn)

256
00:14:51,848 --> 00:14:52,647
However, deep down,

257
00:14:53,288 --> 00:14:55,288
I can't help but feel uneasy.

258
00:14:56,928 --> 00:14:57,687
I don't know...

259
00:15:04,608 --> 00:15:05,207
Qinglian.

260
00:15:06,207 --> 00:15:07,887
I don't need you to be so clever.

261
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,248
I also don't need you to overthink it.

262
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:11,447
I need you...

263
00:15:15,087 --> 00:15:16,808
I need you to be safe.

264
00:15:20,327 --> 00:15:23,087
I need you ride the same horse,

265
00:15:24,087 --> 00:15:27,488
have the same food
and sleep on the same bed with me.

266
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:30,048
Lianxiu is indeed heartless

267
00:15:30,048 --> 00:15:32,687
for trying to kill a woman.

268
00:15:33,488 --> 00:15:34,327
However,

269
00:15:36,007 --> 00:15:37,207
what truly pains me

270
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:39,728
is not him.

271
00:15:43,048 --> 00:15:44,248
Are you talking about Yi?

272
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:49,127
If it weren't for Lv Beiyi's help,

273
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:52,248
Lianxiu could've searched as
many iron mines as he wanted,

274
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:54,400
but the armoury would
never have been built.

275
00:15:56,487 --> 00:15:58,080
I understand
he aligned himself with Lianxiu.

276
00:15:58,808 --> 00:16:02,048
Each of them has
his own ambition and motives.

277
00:16:03,368 --> 00:16:04,600
I've never blamed him for that.

278
00:16:05,168 --> 00:16:06,087
What pains me is that

279
00:16:06,687 --> 00:16:07,887
I misjudged him completely.

280
00:16:07,887 --> 00:16:08,608
How could he

281
00:16:08,928 --> 00:16:10,767
disregard your life and death?

282
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:15,960
While there are certainly many

283
00:16:16,887 --> 00:16:19,087
who prioritise personal gain over
righteousness in this world,

284
00:16:21,968 --> 00:16:23,368
I believe that Yi

285
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:24,567
is not one of them.

286
00:16:25,728 --> 00:16:27,327
Young Master Xiu is incredibly calculating.

287
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:28,928
He may have been deceived.

288
00:16:30,048 --> 00:16:31,048
We have a report!

289
00:16:33,928 --> 00:16:34,767
Young Master Xin,

290
00:16:34,767 --> 00:16:35,567
as per your order,

291
00:16:35,647 --> 00:16:37,928
Young Master Yi has located the blacksmiths
and found the armoury.

292
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:47,560
Young Master.

293
00:16:47,648 --> 00:16:49,448
This time, we've seized more than
a dozen armories

294
00:16:49,448 --> 00:16:52,280
and it will take several days to catalogue
all the weapons and armaments within.

295
00:16:52,608 --> 00:16:54,640
There are also several treasuries
containing gold and silver

296
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,779
that will require a few more days.

297
00:16:56,087 --> 00:16:57,080
There's also a special find

298
00:16:57,248 --> 00:16:59,000
that Young Master Yi wants to
present it personally.

299
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,368
Please.

300
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:00,488
Lianyi.

301
00:17:01,007 --> 00:17:01,527
Lianxin.

302
00:17:02,608 --> 00:17:03,327
This armoury

303
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:04,767
concealed a secret base

304
00:17:05,168 --> 00:17:06,087
with only this in it.

305
00:17:06,488 --> 00:17:07,408
I didn't dare to open it

306
00:17:07,647 --> 00:17:08,767
and was waiting for you.

307
00:17:14,287 --> 00:17:14,848
Young Master Yi.

308
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:16,648
How long did it take

309
00:17:16,888 --> 00:17:18,008
from finding this armoury

310
00:17:18,008 --> 00:17:19,087
to breaking in?

311
00:17:22,287 --> 00:17:23,407
An hour.

312
00:17:24,087 --> 00:17:24,888
There were some guards,

313
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:26,248
but they were easily beaten.

314
00:17:27,287 --> 00:17:29,047
Young Master Xiu devoted so much effort

315
00:17:29,128 --> 00:17:30,488
to prepare this armoury.

316
00:17:30,888 --> 00:17:32,528
It's hard to believe
it was breached so easily.

317
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,840
If it's hidden well, it's natural
that they didn't anticipate it being discovered.

318
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,447
A bit of complacency is expected.

319
00:17:41,087 --> 00:17:41,608
Wait a minute.

320
00:17:51,128 --> 00:17:51,728
The royal seal.

321
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:52,807
Lianxin,

322
00:17:53,248 --> 00:17:54,407
I never expected that Lianxiu

323
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,488
would be so audacious.

324
00:17:56,488 --> 00:17:57,407
Lianxiu...

325
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,640
(Prince An's Criminal Charges)

326
00:18:11,287 --> 00:18:12,648
He has written so many accusations

327
00:18:12,648 --> 00:18:14,008
to openly revolt against our father.

328
00:18:15,368 --> 00:18:17,287
The shameless He Lianxiu.

329
00:18:17,688 --> 00:18:19,860
Rising in rebellion to seize
the title of nobility was one thing,

330
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,488
but he even...

331
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,698
(Seal of He Lianchu)

332
00:18:30,968 --> 00:18:31,848
It's not Lianxiu.

333
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:34,287
It's the heir.

334
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:49,560
(There's still a third option.)

335
00:18:49,788 --> 00:18:50,840
(Using another's hand to kill)

336
00:18:51,287 --> 00:18:52,087
and fight to the death.

337
00:18:52,807 --> 00:18:53,287
No,

338
00:18:54,287 --> 00:18:55,848
the armoury is my lifeline,

339
00:18:56,248 --> 00:18:57,248
my last hope.

340
00:18:57,768 --> 00:18:59,167
I cannot just surrender it.

341
00:18:59,608 --> 00:19:02,287
Mr. Lv, your foresight is truly impressive.

342
00:19:03,207 --> 00:19:04,888
A hero must endure pain.

343
00:19:06,287 --> 00:19:07,360
Given the current situation,

344
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:10,047
(it's better to harm both parties)

345
00:19:11,207 --> 00:19:12,407
(than to be utterly defeated.)

346
00:19:16,287 --> 00:19:17,087
It's despicable.

347
00:19:17,768 --> 00:19:18,648
I can't believe Lianxiu

348
00:19:18,648 --> 00:19:19,848
would frame the heir.

349
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:21,447
Fortunately, we captured

350
00:19:21,447 --> 00:19:22,807
the armoury he worked so hard on.

351
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,648
At least our efforts weren't in vain.

352
00:19:29,728 --> 00:19:30,687
He gave us

353
00:19:31,687 --> 00:19:32,728
this armoury.

354
00:19:33,968 --> 00:19:34,528
What?

355
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:37,248
Why did he do that?

356
00:19:39,128 --> 00:19:40,120
It's a fight to the death.

357
00:19:40,528 --> 00:19:42,407
He knew it would be difficult
to keep the armoury.

358
00:19:42,687 --> 00:19:44,087
So he gave it to us.

359
00:19:45,148 --> 00:19:46,760
This way, he could shift
the blame to the heir,

360
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:48,648
avoiding punishment,

361
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:50,407
dooming the heir to eternal suffering

362
00:19:50,968 --> 00:19:53,488
and implicating me.

363
00:19:54,768 --> 00:19:55,927
Implicating you?

364
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:58,047
He framed the heir directly.

365
00:19:58,327 --> 00:19:59,640
What does that have to do with you?

366
00:20:00,968 --> 00:20:01,888
Have you forgotten

367
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:04,848
father's feelings towards the heir?

368
00:20:06,488 --> 00:20:07,800
In the past, when he made mistakes,

369
00:20:07,927 --> 00:20:09,560
the accuser always
suffered a punishment.

370
00:20:10,287 --> 00:20:11,608
Although I was ordered to investigate,

371
00:20:11,888 --> 00:20:12,648
for such a

372
00:20:14,008 --> 00:20:15,128
grave crime of rebellion,

373
00:20:15,488 --> 00:20:16,167
reporting it

374
00:20:16,487 --> 00:20:17,720
would lead to the heir's downfall.

375
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,207
Father, in his distress,

376
00:20:20,007 --> 00:20:21,160
would surely vent his anger.

377
00:20:24,087 --> 00:20:25,087
What if we don't report it?

378
00:20:27,087 --> 00:20:29,167
Not reporting it would also be

379
00:20:29,807 --> 00:20:30,968
a crime of deceit seen by all.

380
00:20:32,407 --> 00:20:33,447
It's a wicked scheme.

381
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:35,600
I didn't expect that,

382
00:20:36,687 --> 00:20:37,927
even in his dire straits,

383
00:20:38,968 --> 00:20:40,200
he could still play a trick on me.

384
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,248
Truly, evil is always

385
00:20:42,687 --> 00:20:43,528
a step ahead of good.

386
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:46,407
In the end,

387
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:48,167
I am defeated.

388
00:20:49,888 --> 00:20:50,600
Young Master Xin,

389
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,248
please grant me death.

390
00:20:52,728 --> 00:20:53,528
What are you doing?

391
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:55,240
Young Master Xin, you just said

392
00:20:55,528 --> 00:20:56,360
that not reporting it

393
00:20:56,407 --> 00:20:58,008
would be a crime of deceit seen by all.

394
00:20:58,488 --> 00:20:59,400
One way to help you is that

395
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,480
all the members of the Investigating Camp
present here are dead.

396
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,447
I've followed you for many years

397
00:21:04,008 --> 00:21:05,488
and witnessed your immense talent

398
00:21:05,687 --> 00:21:06,567
and ambition.

399
00:21:06,888 --> 00:21:07,768
I'd rather die

400
00:21:08,087 --> 00:21:09,207
than seeing all of your efforts

401
00:21:09,207 --> 00:21:10,047
go to waste.

402
00:21:11,488 --> 00:21:14,207
Please grant me death.

403
00:21:26,968 --> 00:21:27,728
My efforts

404
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:29,807
will not go to waste.

405
00:21:30,327 --> 00:21:30,927
This time,

406
00:21:31,488 --> 00:21:32,567
I may have lost to Lianxiu,

407
00:21:33,207 --> 00:21:34,287
but I have all of you,

408
00:21:35,248 --> 00:21:36,567
who are loyal and dedicated to me.

409
00:21:38,848 --> 00:21:39,488
Isn't Lianxiu

410
00:21:40,287 --> 00:21:41,728
also losing to me in that sense?

411
00:21:44,728 --> 00:21:45,287
Get up.

412
00:21:49,968 --> 00:21:51,207
I want everyone who follows me

413
00:21:51,968 --> 00:21:52,687
to live,

414
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,207
no matter the circumstances.

415
00:21:57,447 --> 00:21:58,368
Only when you're alive

416
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:01,327
that I have the courage and strength

417
00:22:01,327 --> 00:22:02,087
to keep fighting.

418
00:22:31,008 --> 00:22:32,728
Ms. Lian, add a cloak, please.

419
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,287
It's okay, I'm not feeling cold.

420
00:22:36,608 --> 00:22:38,160
Ms. Lian, you might not
be feeling cold now,

421
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,660
but you might feel cold
later when you go out.

422
00:23:36,287 --> 00:23:37,800
Aren't you discussing
something important?

423
00:23:38,888 --> 00:23:39,528
Yes.

424
00:23:39,888 --> 00:23:40,848
We were discussing

425
00:23:40,848 --> 00:23:42,687
how to write the letter to my father,

426
00:23:43,327 --> 00:23:44,407
but

427
00:23:47,207 --> 00:23:48,648
we can't change the situation.

428
00:23:52,047 --> 00:23:52,968
I want you

429
00:23:53,648 --> 00:23:55,000
to accompany me for one last time

430
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,287
and see the beauty of Huanzhou.

431
00:23:58,888 --> 00:23:59,927
Are you worried about

432
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:01,520
His Highness's punishment?

433
00:24:03,728 --> 00:24:06,087
After all these years of hard work,

434
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,488
it's natural not to be content
with the current outcome.

435
00:24:09,608 --> 00:24:10,447
If I fall,

436
00:24:11,648 --> 00:24:12,728
everyone in my mansion

437
00:24:12,728 --> 00:24:13,968
will inevitably be implicated.

438
00:24:14,728 --> 00:24:16,080
Some want to become a noble consort

439
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:17,368
seek wealth and glory,

440
00:24:17,687 --> 00:24:18,888
and do the families proud.

441
00:24:20,047 --> 00:24:21,087
However, what I fear the most

442
00:24:22,008 --> 00:24:23,008
isn't any of these.

443
00:24:23,648 --> 00:24:25,488
I know what you fear the most.

444
00:24:28,407 --> 00:24:30,800
What you fear the most
is the same as what I fear the most.

445
00:24:32,047 --> 00:24:33,128
What I fear the most

446
00:24:40,567 --> 00:24:42,447
is going through
this long journey of life

447
00:24:43,407 --> 00:24:44,888
without holding your hand

448
00:24:47,848 --> 00:24:48,888
and not growing old with you.

449
00:24:51,687 --> 00:24:53,207
With frost and snow all over our heads,

450
00:24:53,807 --> 00:24:55,400
it's also considered
growing old together.

451
00:24:56,087 --> 00:24:57,360
From now on, no matter life or death,

452
00:24:57,768 --> 00:24:59,008
as long as I'm by your side,

453
00:24:59,488 --> 00:25:00,968
I'll have no regrets

454
00:25:01,608 --> 00:25:02,528
nor fear.

455
00:25:04,207 --> 00:25:06,128
Young Master, let's return to Quliang.

456
00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:08,567
Regardless of what we'll face,

457
00:25:09,087 --> 00:25:10,407
I'll face it

458
00:25:10,888 --> 00:25:11,407
with you.

459
00:25:21,248 --> 00:25:23,888
With frost and snow all over our heads,

460
00:25:25,848 --> 00:25:27,287
it's also considered
growing old together.

461
00:25:43,248 --> 00:25:44,407
Young Master Yi, you're back.

462
00:25:48,407 --> 00:25:49,207
Why are you here?

463
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,368
I've come to congratulate you.

464
00:25:51,528 --> 00:25:53,008
I heard from Su Nanchun

465
00:25:53,008 --> 00:25:54,608
that this morning, you received news

466
00:25:54,728 --> 00:25:55,960
that Seventh Madam was pregnant

467
00:25:56,207 --> 00:25:57,528
and you're going to be a father.

468
00:25:58,008 --> 00:25:58,687
Yes,

469
00:26:07,248 --> 00:26:08,008
I never thought

470
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,648
that I'd just grown up

471
00:26:10,207 --> 00:26:11,327
and I would be a father.

472
00:26:12,327 --> 00:26:13,608
You don't seem very happy,

473
00:26:13,608 --> 00:26:14,447
Young Master Yi.

474
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:17,447
Is it because you're afraid

475
00:26:18,968 --> 00:26:19,927
you can't fulfil

476
00:26:19,927 --> 00:26:21,047
the duties of a father?

477
00:26:32,488 --> 00:26:33,008
Dongli.

478
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:34,760
This is a matter of great importance.

479
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:35,968
Please don't tell Lianxin

480
00:26:35,968 --> 00:26:36,768
and your lady about it.

481
00:26:38,047 --> 00:26:40,008
You also know
that this matter is significant.

482
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:41,207
I hope for their safety,

483
00:26:41,207 --> 00:26:42,327
but not through such methods.

484
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:43,807
I'll tell Ms. Lian now.

485
00:26:43,968 --> 00:26:44,447
Dongli!

486
00:26:44,807 --> 00:26:45,447
Let go of me!

487
00:26:45,848 --> 00:26:46,368
Let go of me!

488
00:26:46,368 --> 00:26:46,807
Dongli!

489
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:48,488
All the way here,

490
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,407
I've seen you're not like
any other ordinary woman.

491
00:26:52,768 --> 00:26:54,128
I've come to regard you as a friend.

492
00:26:55,248 --> 00:26:56,008
Don't you know

493
00:26:56,008 --> 00:26:57,207
what it means to be selfless

494
00:26:58,087 --> 00:26:59,447
and loyal?

495
00:27:06,488 --> 00:27:07,087
All right.

496
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:10,608
If you are righteous and fearless,

497
00:27:13,368 --> 00:27:15,128
I, Dongli, won't be a coward either.

498
00:27:17,687 --> 00:27:18,888
We'll return to Quliang tomorrow

499
00:27:21,008 --> 00:27:22,608
and I'll help you
to pack your belongings.

500
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,040
(Tonghua Street)

501
00:27:39,148 --> 00:27:40,347
- Have you heard?
- What's going on?

502
00:27:40,447 --> 00:27:41,848
Something big happened in Huanzhou.

503
00:27:41,888 --> 00:27:42,528
What happened?

504
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:44,087
They said that an armoury was found

505
00:27:44,687 --> 00:27:46,440
and it contains the royal seal
and denunciation.

506
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,848
- The royal seal and denunciation?
- Yes.

507
00:27:48,248 --> 00:27:49,320
Isn't this an act of rebellion?

508
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,287
Who could be so audacious?

509
00:27:50,968 --> 00:27:51,768
Keep your voices down.

510
00:27:52,248 --> 00:27:53,008
When they come back,

511
00:27:53,327 --> 00:27:54,368
we'll get the whole story.

512
00:27:54,368 --> 00:27:54,888
Here they come.

513
00:27:56,528 --> 00:27:57,807
It doesn't seem right.

514
00:28:00,807 --> 00:28:02,567
Lianxiu really planned it carefully.

515
00:28:02,968 --> 00:28:04,728
It's widely known in Quliang.

516
00:28:05,087 --> 00:28:06,128
So it will certainly

517
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:08,167
reach father's ears

518
00:28:08,968 --> 00:28:10,567
and we won't be able to escape then.

519
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:13,167
Let's leave it to fate.

520
00:28:14,047 --> 00:28:14,687
They are back.

521
00:28:15,047 --> 00:28:16,768
I heard that Young Master Xin
discovered it.

522
00:28:18,047 --> 00:28:18,848
Is this true?

523
00:28:19,167 --> 00:28:19,848
Of course.

524
00:28:24,407 --> 00:28:25,087
- Lianxin.
- Lianyi.

525
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,687
Lianyi, I'm afraid

526
00:28:33,207 --> 00:28:34,560
I won't be able to escape this time.

527
00:28:35,128 --> 00:28:36,680
I may not be able to
see you becoming a father.

528
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:40,207
This

529
00:28:40,768 --> 00:28:42,488
is a gift from me to your child.

530
00:28:43,008 --> 00:28:43,640
Take it with you.

531
00:28:49,128 --> 00:28:49,768
Hurry back

532
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:51,240
to see your wife and child.

533
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:54,000
It's true that brothers
share a strong bond.

534
00:28:54,287 --> 00:28:55,280
For such trivial matters,

535
00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:56,648
we have the same thought.

536
00:28:58,167 --> 00:29:00,287
So I won't see you off.

537
00:29:05,888 --> 00:29:06,528
Lianxin!

538
00:29:06,908 --> 00:29:08,840
Since we were young,
you've been the one I've listened to

539
00:29:09,287 --> 00:29:10,488
and I like listening to.

540
00:29:11,287 --> 00:29:12,207
We have many brothers,

541
00:29:12,807 --> 00:29:13,927
but the only one I care about

542
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:14,968
is you.

543
00:29:15,567 --> 00:29:16,488
It was like that before

544
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,360
and it will be the same in the future!

545
00:29:28,927 --> 00:29:29,648
Su Nanchun,

546
00:29:33,067 --> 00:29:34,640
take another route
to Young Master Yi's Mansion

547
00:29:34,728 --> 00:29:36,488
and make sure he doesn't come out again.

548
00:29:37,047 --> 00:29:37,488
Understood.

549
00:30:11,207 --> 00:30:12,047
How do I look?

550
00:30:14,447 --> 00:30:16,368
You look radiant, full of energy
and confidence.

551
00:30:21,768 --> 00:30:23,207
Dongli, bring out the things.

552
00:30:27,287 --> 00:30:27,927
Hurry up.

553
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,047
Ms. Lian.

554
00:30:31,167 --> 00:30:31,768
I...

555
00:30:32,648 --> 00:30:33,207
I...

556
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:36,968
- Young Master!
- Young Master.

557
00:30:37,287 --> 00:30:37,807
Young Master.

558
00:30:38,248 --> 00:30:39,640
Young Master Yi didn't return home at all.

559
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,800
He went directly into the Prince's mansion
through Hongyan Gate.

560
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:42,608
What?

561
00:30:47,207 --> 00:30:48,248
Young Master,

562
00:30:49,128 --> 00:30:50,207
the royal seal and denunciation

563
00:30:51,248 --> 00:30:52,848
have been taken by Young Master Yi.

564
00:30:54,047 --> 00:30:54,848
What did you say?

565
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:56,888
Lianxin,

566
00:30:57,847 --> 00:30:59,840
since we were young,
you've been the one I've listened to

567
00:31:00,407 --> 00:31:01,567
and like to listen to.

568
00:31:02,008 --> 00:31:03,008
We have many brothers,

569
00:31:03,368 --> 00:31:04,567
but the only one I care about

570
00:31:04,888 --> 00:31:05,728
is you.

571
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,927
(It was like that before)

572
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,630
(and it will be the same in the future!)

573
00:31:13,768 --> 00:31:14,327
Young Master!

574
00:31:22,327 --> 00:31:22,927
You...

575
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,768
I beg you, Young Master.

576
00:31:24,768 --> 00:31:26,400
Please don't harm
Young Master Yi in any way.

577
00:31:29,528 --> 00:31:30,520
Given the current situation,

578
00:31:32,648 --> 00:31:34,567
you can only help Young Master Yi
to maintain this lie,

579
00:31:35,287 --> 00:31:36,768
so as not to betray his sincerity.

580
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,528
Otherwise,

581
00:31:38,968 --> 00:31:40,368
not only you will be held responsible,

582
00:31:41,087 --> 00:31:42,440
it will also bring
the charge of deception

583
00:31:43,488 --> 00:31:44,687
upon Young Master Yi.

584
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,240
(The Title of Prince An)

585
00:32:18,447 --> 00:32:20,008
The title of Prince An

586
00:32:20,768 --> 00:32:23,528
is coveted by countless people,

587
00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:28,960
but there's only one person
who couldn't covet it

588
00:32:29,407 --> 00:32:30,567
and that's the heir.

589
00:32:33,687 --> 00:32:34,768
The title of Prince An

590
00:32:35,368 --> 00:32:36,368
and the land of Quliang

591
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:37,968
will eventually belong to him.

592
00:32:39,648 --> 00:32:41,407
Why would he be greedy

593
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:43,888
for this lousy stone?

594
00:32:48,287 --> 00:32:51,128
These two items were all found
in the cave near Huanzhou.

595
00:32:51,608 --> 00:32:52,760
I dare not speak out of turn.

596
00:32:53,087 --> 00:32:54,768
Since you've brought these two items,

597
00:32:56,728 --> 00:32:58,047
why is there one person missing?

598
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:01,447
Before finding these items,

599
00:33:01,687 --> 00:33:02,768
I didn't inform Lianxin

600
00:33:03,207 --> 00:33:04,248
and he was completely unaware.

601
00:33:05,047 --> 00:33:06,888
Do you think that by not telling him,
he wouldn't know?

602
00:33:08,207 --> 00:33:10,008
I sent him there.

603
00:33:11,248 --> 00:33:12,008
Do you think

604
00:33:12,327 --> 00:33:13,687
you can hide anything from him?

605
00:33:15,047 --> 00:33:15,648
Lianyi.

606
00:33:18,488 --> 00:33:20,287
you two are brothers.

607
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:22,687
You can't be working together

608
00:33:23,447 --> 00:33:25,167
to make a fool out of me, can you?

609
00:33:25,728 --> 00:33:27,528
This is a matter of great importance

610
00:33:28,287 --> 00:33:29,440
and I didn't dare to reveal a thing

611
00:33:29,848 --> 00:33:30,768
before seeing you.

612
00:33:31,287 --> 00:33:32,128
Even Lianxin

613
00:33:32,407 --> 00:33:33,287
wouldn't know about it.

614
00:33:33,768 --> 00:33:34,880
I hope you will understand.

615
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:36,248
Understand?

616
00:33:39,488 --> 00:33:41,087
Before reaching 50 years old,

617
00:33:43,528 --> 00:33:45,248
I could see everything clearly.

618
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:46,888
However, after turning 50,

619
00:33:47,287 --> 00:33:48,768
my vision has weakened.

620
00:33:49,207 --> 00:33:50,528
The more I look at my sons,

621
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,128
the less I can see.

622
00:33:54,207 --> 00:33:55,287
Is it the heir

623
00:33:55,447 --> 00:33:56,968
coveting my title,

624
00:33:58,128 --> 00:33:59,608
or is it all of you

625
00:34:01,407 --> 00:34:02,648
coveting the position of the heir?

626
00:34:05,728 --> 00:34:06,567
I would never dare.

627
00:34:12,368 --> 00:34:13,008
Yu Dechang.

628
00:34:13,328 --> 00:34:13,808
Here.

629
00:34:14,808 --> 00:34:15,728
Summon Lord Rui.

630
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:16,647
Yes.

631
00:34:42,927 --> 00:34:43,808
Lord Rui is here.

632
00:34:51,927 --> 00:34:52,687
It's been days.

633
00:34:53,328 --> 00:34:55,167
Greetings, father.

634
00:35:21,367 --> 00:35:22,367
Have you seen this?

635
00:35:34,847 --> 00:35:36,447
Father, this is...

636
00:35:37,288 --> 00:35:39,248
This is the evidence
of the heir's rebellion.

637
00:35:41,447 --> 00:35:42,088
Have you seen it?

638
00:35:43,328 --> 00:35:44,447
(Young Master, I beg of you,)

639
00:35:44,447 --> 00:35:45,847
(please do not harm Young Master Yi.)

640
00:35:48,167 --> 00:35:49,320
Given the current situation,

641
00:35:51,008 --> 00:35:53,048
you can only help Young Master Yi
to maintain this lie

642
00:35:53,687 --> 00:35:55,207
and preserve his sincerity.

643
00:35:55,768 --> 00:35:56,488
Otherwise,

644
00:35:57,847 --> 00:35:59,288
not only you will face consequences,

645
00:36:00,528 --> 00:36:02,160
(but you will also burden Young Master Yi)

646
00:36:02,647 --> 00:36:03,927
(with the charge of deception.)

647
00:36:12,008 --> 00:36:12,687
I

648
00:36:15,968 --> 00:36:16,887
had never seen it.

649
00:36:17,647 --> 00:36:18,847
Haven't you even heard about it?

650
00:36:20,328 --> 00:36:21,560
I dare not hide it from you, Father.

651
00:36:22,968 --> 00:36:24,728
I have some knowledge of it.

652
00:36:32,088 --> 00:36:32,847
Lianyi said

653
00:36:33,968 --> 00:36:35,407
you were unaware.

654
00:36:37,367 --> 00:36:38,927
So he might be deceiving me.

655
00:36:40,847 --> 00:36:41,880
It's a misunderstanding, Father.

656
00:36:43,607 --> 00:36:44,687
I once heard

657
00:36:45,207 --> 00:36:46,920
that there was a royal seal
and a denunciation.

658
00:36:47,328 --> 00:36:49,647
I searched the armoury several times

659
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:51,127
but found nothing.

660
00:36:52,488 --> 00:36:53,847
I thought it was just a rumour

661
00:36:53,847 --> 00:36:54,528
until

662
00:36:54,927 --> 00:36:56,528
I saw them here today.

663
00:37:02,728 --> 00:37:03,248
Really?

664
00:37:11,248 --> 00:37:13,568
Go on, take a look at that denunciation.

665
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,768
Is it real or fake?

666
00:37:18,088 --> 00:37:18,927
It must be a fake.

667
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,167
Lianchu's character

668
00:37:22,248 --> 00:37:23,048
and loyalty

669
00:37:23,687 --> 00:37:24,407
are unquestionable.

670
00:37:24,687 --> 00:37:25,528
He would never commit

671
00:37:25,528 --> 00:37:26,447
an act of rebellion.

672
00:37:28,008 --> 00:37:29,528
Although there's deep brotherly love

673
00:37:31,088 --> 00:37:32,328
between me and Lianyi,

674
00:37:35,528 --> 00:37:36,768
we must focus on the facts.

675
00:37:38,447 --> 00:37:39,127
I...

676
00:37:43,048 --> 00:37:44,008
Please continue.

677
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:46,568
I believe that

678
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:50,328
Lianyi was too reckless.

679
00:38:00,847 --> 00:38:01,927
Does that mean

680
00:38:03,808 --> 00:38:05,488
the armoury near Huanzhou

681
00:38:06,328 --> 00:38:07,647
is also a deception?

682
00:38:25,568 --> 00:38:27,528
Nevermind.

683
00:38:28,328 --> 00:38:29,927
You've had a hard time

684
00:38:30,328 --> 00:38:32,847
with all these false statements.

685
00:38:34,288 --> 00:38:35,207
Lift your head.

686
00:38:40,728 --> 00:38:41,367
Thank you, Father.

687
00:38:43,647 --> 00:38:45,808
He Lianchu.

688
00:38:48,968 --> 00:38:51,008
You've been the heir for 30 years.

689
00:38:52,768 --> 00:38:54,607
How many 30 years does
a person have in his life?

690
00:38:58,927 --> 00:39:01,207
I've been the one blocking his path.

691
00:39:02,887 --> 00:39:05,407
(There have been many pieces
of evidence pointing to the heir.)

692
00:39:06,167 --> 00:39:08,607
(This time, the evidence is the final one.)

693
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:12,048
(It still can't change
Prince An's deep affection)

694
00:39:12,048 --> 00:39:13,048
(for the heir)

695
00:39:13,808 --> 00:39:16,127
(but has shattered Prince An's)

696
00:39:16,127 --> 00:39:17,847
(last illusion about him.)

697
00:39:36,367 --> 00:39:37,647
The royal edict states:

698
00:39:38,048 --> 00:39:40,887
Since the heir, He Lianchu,

699
00:39:41,127 --> 00:39:43,728
has suffered from madness
and lost the people's trust,

700
00:39:44,367 --> 00:39:46,167
he is permanently dethroned

701
00:39:46,568 --> 00:39:48,407
and will be confined
to the Penance Court.

702
00:39:59,568 --> 00:40:00,088
Father.

703
00:40:00,728 --> 00:40:02,048
I was wronged, Father!

704
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:03,647
Father!

705
00:40:04,528 --> 00:40:06,407
The seventh son, He Lianyi,

706
00:40:07,048 --> 00:40:08,647
will be stationed at the border

707
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:11,288
as per his permission.

708
00:40:12,687 --> 00:40:13,167
Thank you,

709
00:40:13,607 --> 00:40:14,447
Your Majesty.

710
00:40:27,407 --> 00:40:27,927
(Lianyi,)

711
00:40:28,568 --> 00:40:29,927
(I will never forget)

712
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,607
(what you've done for me today.)

713
00:40:32,088 --> 00:40:33,248
(Lianxiu acts unjustly)

714
00:40:33,568 --> 00:40:35,048
(and I will expose his true colours)

715
00:40:35,647 --> 00:40:37,248
(and restore peace to Quliang.)

716
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,721
(Mansion of Lord Rui)

717
00:40:42,768 --> 00:40:44,248
Lianyi is going to the border

718
00:40:44,927 --> 00:40:46,088
and his future is uncertain.

719
00:40:47,488 --> 00:40:48,808
Although he is highly skilled,

720
00:40:48,808 --> 00:40:49,728
I'm unsure

721
00:40:51,207 --> 00:40:52,407
when he will return.

722
00:40:54,968 --> 00:40:56,528
The border is cold

723
00:40:57,207 --> 00:40:58,320
and the journey is long.

724
00:40:58,728 --> 00:40:59,847
So he may suffer.

725
00:41:02,447 --> 00:41:03,927
As his brother,

726
00:41:04,887 --> 00:41:05,808
I landed him in trouble.

727
00:41:08,207 --> 00:41:09,367
Young Master and Ms. Lian.

728
00:41:11,808 --> 00:41:12,488
I wish

729
00:41:14,328 --> 00:41:15,728
to accompany Young Master Yi.

730
00:41:19,407 --> 00:41:20,248
Please, Young Master

731
00:41:30,048 --> 00:41:30,927
and Ms. Lian,

732
00:41:35,008 --> 00:41:35,768
grant my wish.
