17
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,543
Thank goodness for that.

18
00:01:51,824 --> 00:01:54,464
We're just waiting
for the triumphant return of the army,

19
00:01:54,744 --> 00:01:56,824
so that Lian'er won't be under
the control of Cige'er anymore.

20
00:01:57,064 --> 00:01:58,863
She'll be released
from the Correctional Institution.

21
00:02:00,464 --> 00:02:02,303
Zhao'er has been yearning
for his mother day and night.

22
00:02:02,504 --> 00:02:04,302
If he hears of this good news,

23
00:02:04,303 --> 00:02:05,863
he'll be overjoyed.

24
00:02:06,223 --> 00:02:07,662
Zhao'er, you've grown so much.

25
00:02:07,663 --> 00:02:09,104
I couldn't find you for several days.

26
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:11,783
Reading, practising martial arts
and mastering talents.

27
00:02:11,784 --> 00:02:13,543
You have so much to do.

28
00:02:15,423 --> 00:02:16,623
It's this girl.

29
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:18,823
I was wondering why I
couldn't find her anywhere.

30
00:02:18,824 --> 00:02:19,502
So she's here again,

31
00:02:19,503 --> 00:02:21,304
bothering Zhao'er.

32
00:02:31,783 --> 00:02:32,784
Xiangning.

33
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:34,782
What's bothering my sister now?

34
00:02:34,783 --> 00:02:36,623
She can't find what she's looking for

35
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:37,983
and is angry.

36
00:02:39,104 --> 00:02:41,224
She can't find what she wants?

37
00:02:42,264 --> 00:02:43,502
If you can't find what you want,

38
00:02:43,503 --> 00:02:45,064
I will find it for you.

39
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:45,983
Rabbits.

40
00:02:47,264 --> 00:02:48,263
Rabbits?

41
00:02:49,143 --> 00:02:50,662
The little white rabbits I'm raising

42
00:02:50,663 --> 00:02:51,864
have red eyes,

43
00:02:51,943 --> 00:02:53,743
but I prefer the ones with black eyes.

44
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,664
I looked for you several times,

45
00:02:55,744 --> 00:02:57,584
but you weren't there.

46
00:02:57,984 --> 00:02:59,584
So I went to look for Madam Rou.

47
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:01,584
Madam Rou loves me more than you do.

48
00:03:01,624 --> 00:03:02,422
She's always

49
00:03:02,423 --> 00:03:04,144
been there for me.

50
00:03:04,624 --> 00:03:07,704
Did Madam Rou manage
to catch the rabbits?

51
00:03:09,143 --> 00:03:10,222
She did manage to catch a few

52
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:11,383
with black eyes,

53
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:12,502
but their whole bodies

54
00:03:12,503 --> 00:03:14,064
were black.

55
00:03:15,464 --> 00:03:17,664
So you got a few black rabbits.

56
00:03:20,024 --> 00:03:21,142
Madam Rou.

57
00:03:21,143 --> 00:03:22,623
- Mother.
- Madam Rong.

58
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,782
If Madam Rou couldn't catch them,

59
00:03:24,783 --> 00:03:26,263
can Zhao'er catch them?

60
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,304
I'm afraid he can't either.

61
00:03:29,783 --> 00:03:32,983
Then ask him to put fireflies on kites.

62
00:03:33,184 --> 00:03:34,903
That way, we can fly kites at night.

63
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:37,263
In this season,

64
00:03:37,264 --> 00:03:39,103
how can we find fireflies?

65
00:03:39,223 --> 00:03:41,584
You're still like a child.

66
00:03:42,184 --> 00:03:43,942
Zhao'er is much more mature than you

67
00:03:43,943 --> 00:03:45,584
and won't join you in your antics.

68
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,502
It's because Zhao'er is too mature.

69
00:03:47,503 --> 00:03:49,344
I'm two years older than him.

70
00:03:55,104 --> 00:03:56,144
Zhao'er.

71
00:03:56,824 --> 00:03:58,263
Are you missing your mother?

72
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:06,383
Don't be worry.

73
00:04:07,223 --> 00:04:08,864
She'll be back soon.

74
00:04:09,303 --> 00:04:10,144
Really?

75
00:04:11,423 --> 00:04:12,224
Really.

76
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:16,623
That's great.

77
00:04:18,943 --> 00:04:21,023
I'll be able to see my mother soon.

78
00:04:29,764 --> 00:04:32,183
(Lianwei House)

79
00:04:32,184 --> 00:04:33,183
Rou,

80
00:04:33,624 --> 00:04:35,143
your affection for Lian

81
00:04:35,383 --> 00:04:36,784
is truly enviable.

82
00:04:38,024 --> 00:04:40,344
Coming from your lips,

83
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,224
that's quite ironic.

84
00:04:42,703 --> 00:04:44,703
I wronged you back then,

85
00:04:45,103 --> 00:04:47,944
which is why no matter
how you would scold, curse,

86
00:04:48,224 --> 00:04:49,463
blame or hate me,

87
00:04:49,464 --> 00:04:50,504
I would bear no grudge.

88
00:04:51,064 --> 00:04:52,623
I simply want to thank you.

89
00:04:52,823 --> 00:04:54,664
Without the bone-chilling
coldness of that day,

90
00:04:55,184 --> 00:04:56,863
there would be no warmth
in my heart today.

91
00:04:57,863 --> 00:05:00,863
I only wish to save Lian'er.

92
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,863
As long as you don't obstruct my path,

93
00:05:04,184 --> 00:05:05,382
you're not my enemy.

94
00:05:05,383 --> 00:05:06,143
You...

95
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:08,542
Enduring love requires no explanation.

96
00:05:08,543 --> 00:05:09,944
It's about the time spent together.

97
00:05:10,464 --> 00:05:11,343
I, Xu Jirou,

98
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,143
have never been foolishly kind.

99
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:14,824
The one who wronged me once

100
00:05:15,784 --> 00:05:17,544
will eventually wrong me again.

101
00:05:20,224 --> 00:05:21,223
(I never imagined)

102
00:05:21,224 --> 00:05:23,743
(that one with genuine feelings
would leave me too.)

103
00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:25,664
(Mu Haiyao,)

104
00:05:26,064 --> 00:05:27,423
(what else do you have?)

105
00:05:28,303 --> 00:05:30,023
(Was I really wrong?)

106
00:05:30,024 --> 00:05:30,944
Your Highness.

107
00:05:31,704 --> 00:05:32,623
Another battle report.

108
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:33,384
Read it!

109
00:05:36,784 --> 00:05:38,743
Lv Beiyi made accurate predictions.

110
00:05:39,024 --> 00:05:40,262
With just 500 riders,

111
00:05:40,263 --> 00:05:42,183
he burnt down three of Cige'er's camps.

112
00:05:42,183 --> 00:05:43,423
A complete reversal of the situation.

113
00:05:44,504 --> 00:05:45,384
Your Highness.

114
00:05:45,703 --> 00:05:46,862
We've won.

115
00:05:46,863 --> 00:05:48,102
Your Highness, Quliang has won!

116
00:05:48,103 --> 00:05:48,984
Your Highness!

117
00:05:49,263 --> 00:05:50,143
Good!

118
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,183
Pass my order

119
00:05:52,224 --> 00:05:53,664
to send provisions immediately

120
00:05:53,703 --> 00:05:54,784
and reward the troops.

121
00:05:54,863 --> 00:05:57,463
Let them seize the opportunity and pursue
the enemy in the wake of this victory.

122
00:05:59,703 --> 00:06:01,224
Cige'er's days are numbered.

123
00:06:01,744 --> 00:06:03,104
Today, we will

124
00:06:03,224 --> 00:06:04,343
give our all

125
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:05,504
and fight to the death!

126
00:06:05,784 --> 00:06:07,504
A reward of 1,000 taels of silver

127
00:06:07,664 --> 00:06:09,064
to the one who brings me Celun's head!

128
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,743
Let's fight to the death!

129
00:06:11,744 --> 00:06:13,863
Fight to the death!

130
00:06:18,784 --> 00:06:20,903
You Highness, look at the man outside.

131
00:06:21,143 --> 00:06:22,360
Despite he's in the outcast status,

132
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,743
he possesses as much courage and bravery
as the fiercest generals.

133
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,104
No wonder why the prince values him.

134
00:06:26,383 --> 00:06:27,743
I have a report!

135
00:06:30,184 --> 00:06:32,303
General! The provisions
were adulterated with chaff.

136
00:06:32,504 --> 00:06:33,544
Where is it?

137
00:06:34,064 --> 00:06:35,064
It's right outside.

138
00:06:42,184 --> 00:06:43,302
How can we get our soldiers

139
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:44,903
to fight to the death?

140
00:06:49,423 --> 00:06:50,623
Explain it more clearly.

141
00:06:51,103 --> 00:06:52,663
Our Quliang's forces and Cige'er

142
00:06:52,664 --> 00:06:53,984
battled day and night.

143
00:06:54,024 --> 00:06:55,784
Our troops were in chaos

144
00:06:56,064 --> 00:06:57,303
and completely defeated.

145
00:06:57,944 --> 00:06:59,104
How is that possible?

146
00:06:59,263 --> 00:07:00,504
Victory was within our grasp,

147
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,863
but unexpectedly, we found
chaff in our provisions.

148
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:06,903
- How could there be chaff?
- That's right.

149
00:07:10,504 --> 00:07:11,423
You may leave.

150
00:07:11,784 --> 00:07:12,664
Yes.

151
00:07:19,143 --> 00:07:20,023
Your Highness.

152
00:07:24,823 --> 00:07:25,824
Your Highness.

153
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,223
This battle has severely
weakened our forces.

154
00:07:29,224 --> 00:07:31,344
It's hard to turn the tide

155
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:34,143
and I fear that Cige'er
will seize this opportunity

156
00:07:34,224 --> 00:07:35,542
to invade Mu.

157
00:07:35,543 --> 00:07:36,822
In my opinion,

158
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,903
it might be better to seek a truce

159
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:41,423
while victory is uncertain.

160
00:07:41,703 --> 00:07:44,743
It's a practical measure.

161
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,143
Seeking a truce is a good idea.

162
00:07:50,624 --> 00:07:51,623
We can't seek a truce.

163
00:07:53,784 --> 00:07:56,504
If we do, we'll have to
hand over Luo Qinglian.

164
00:07:56,703 --> 00:07:58,224
How can Lianxin bear to do that?

165
00:07:58,904 --> 00:08:00,583
When Quliang's forces are defeated

166
00:08:01,024 --> 00:08:02,504
and His Majesty blames him,

167
00:08:02,944 --> 00:08:05,023
let's see how he can still be Prince An.

168
00:08:05,423 --> 00:08:07,344
Lianxiu, that's a clever plan.

169
00:08:18,744 --> 00:08:19,944
Did you

170
00:08:20,423 --> 00:08:22,264
do this?

171
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,823
How can we negotiate a truce?

172
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:43,583
Your Highness.

173
00:08:50,703 --> 00:08:52,784
Are you hesitating

174
00:08:53,024 --> 00:08:54,544
because you're reluctant?

175
00:08:54,823 --> 00:08:56,023
At this point,

176
00:08:56,024 --> 00:08:56,942
are you still unwilling

177
00:08:56,943 --> 00:08:58,383
to hand over Luo Qinglian?

178
00:09:02,263 --> 00:09:03,224
Lianzhi,

179
00:09:03,864 --> 00:09:04,864
mind your manners.

180
00:09:04,904 --> 00:09:05,822
How could His Highness,

181
00:09:05,823 --> 00:09:07,463
for the sake of a woman,

182
00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:10,463
disregard the big picture
and the greater good?

183
00:09:13,823 --> 00:09:14,984
We have a report!

184
00:09:16,904 --> 00:09:17,744
Your Highness.

185
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,343
Cige'er has sent an envoy.

186
00:09:19,344 --> 00:09:20,463
He's arrived at the city gate.

187
00:09:20,503 --> 00:09:21,544
What did you say?

188
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,263
Cige'er's envoy is here.

189
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:24,624
He's reached the city gate.

190
00:09:39,284 --> 00:09:42,324
(Quliang)

191
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:50,169
(King of Cige'er, Celun)

192
00:10:02,464 --> 00:10:03,903
As Cige'er's representative is here,

193
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:05,783
I will certainly greet
you with courtesy.

194
00:10:05,784 --> 00:10:07,543
Please follow me to the mansion to rest.

195
00:10:07,544 --> 00:10:08,943
After Quliang's defeat,

196
00:10:09,024 --> 00:10:11,063
it seems that there's
no capable individual left,

197
00:10:11,383 --> 00:10:12,182
as they sent

198
00:10:12,183 --> 00:10:14,104
a young and inexperienced child
to welcome us.

199
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,864
Mu is a land of decorum

200
00:10:16,904 --> 00:10:18,903
and the reception of emissaries

201
00:10:18,904 --> 00:10:20,943
is determined by their status, not their age.

202
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:22,344
I am the son of Prince An.

203
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,784
You're Prince An's son?

204
00:10:26,503 --> 00:10:27,983
You may be young,

205
00:10:27,984 --> 00:10:29,903
but you're presentable.

206
00:10:34,697 --> 00:10:36,414
(Correctional Institution)

207
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:42,503
Madam,

208
00:10:42,544 --> 00:10:44,664
you've been embroidering all day.
Take a break.

209
00:10:44,943 --> 00:10:46,703
Now that Cige'er is here to blame us,

210
00:10:47,464 --> 00:10:49,383
I could be executed anytime.

211
00:10:50,823 --> 00:10:52,143
The more I embroider,

212
00:10:52,864 --> 00:10:54,624
the more keepsakes I have.

213
00:11:32,183 --> 00:11:33,344
Why aren't you crying?

214
00:11:38,383 --> 00:11:39,984
I dare not cry.

215
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:41,903
What are you afraid of?

216
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,104
I'm afraid that if my tears fall

217
00:11:44,864 --> 00:11:46,383
and I can see clearly,

218
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,784
I'll realise it's not you, Your Highness.

219
00:11:59,304 --> 00:12:00,304
Qinglian.

220
00:12:05,623 --> 00:12:06,823
I'm late.

221
00:12:07,664 --> 00:12:09,703
Being able to bid farewell to you,

222
00:12:10,503 --> 00:12:12,544
it doesn't matter how late you arrives.

223
00:12:16,183 --> 00:12:17,823
Who said it's a farewell?

224
00:12:26,183 --> 00:12:27,304
With me here,

225
00:12:28,503 --> 00:12:30,023
no one can harm you.

226
00:12:30,943 --> 00:12:34,063
No one can harm Quliang.

227
00:12:45,505 --> 00:12:48,025
(Mansion of Prince An)

228
00:12:49,424 --> 00:12:51,344
It's just meeting an envoy.

229
00:12:51,544 --> 00:12:54,263
Why have the ladies shown up?

230
00:12:54,544 --> 00:12:56,263
Even if Quliang is defeated,

231
00:12:56,784 --> 00:12:59,503
they shouldn't have done this.

232
00:13:10,984 --> 00:13:12,703
Here comes the prince.

233
00:13:40,383 --> 00:13:41,544
Everyone, take a seat.

234
00:13:53,344 --> 00:13:54,424
Lianxiu!

235
00:14:07,224 --> 00:14:08,104
Your Highness.

236
00:14:09,623 --> 00:14:11,104
This is my fourth younger brother.

237
00:14:11,224 --> 00:14:13,182
He is kind and has many
good connections.

238
00:14:13,183 --> 00:14:14,382
When our father was alive,

239
00:14:14,383 --> 00:14:15,903
the officials praised him

240
00:14:15,904 --> 00:14:18,503
for being intelligent and capable,
as well as having good conduct.

241
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:19,624
So he's suitable to be the heir.

242
00:14:24,623 --> 00:14:27,383
I'm He Lianxiu. Greetings.

243
00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:32,063
Lianzuo!

244
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:34,503
Your Highness.

245
00:14:35,104 --> 00:14:37,184
This is my fifth younger brother,

246
00:14:37,984 --> 00:14:39,502
who is skilled in archery and business.

247
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,344
He is the wealthiest among the siblings.

248
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,263
If he were to empty his coffers,

249
00:14:43,623 --> 00:14:44,583
it would be enough

250
00:14:45,063 --> 00:14:47,984
to sustain a 50,000-strong
army for half a year.

251
00:14:52,823 --> 00:14:54,104
Your Highness, you are too humble.

252
00:14:54,383 --> 00:14:57,703
Even if it's 100,000 troops,
it can be sustained.

253
00:15:07,623 --> 00:15:10,583
I'm He Lianzuo. Greetings.

254
00:15:12,263 --> 00:15:13,344
Lianhua!

255
00:15:14,503 --> 00:15:15,503
Your Highness.

256
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,703
This is my eighth younger brother.

257
00:15:19,024 --> 00:15:21,182
He has protected Mu wholeheartedly,

258
00:15:21,183 --> 00:15:22,503
never losing in a battle.

259
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,182
If it weren't for his old illness
that prevented him from fighting,

260
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,624
the outcome of this war
could be different.

261
00:15:31,544 --> 00:15:33,744
I'm He Lianhua. Greetings.

262
00:15:50,943 --> 00:15:51,983
Your Highness, it seems that

263
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,063
you're values the brotherly bond.

264
00:15:54,304 --> 00:15:55,622
I believe that all your siblings

265
00:15:55,623 --> 00:15:59,063
will do their utmost to assist you.

266
00:16:06,503 --> 00:16:09,063
Since they are my brothers

267
00:16:09,503 --> 00:16:12,263
who hold important positions in Quliang,

268
00:16:12,544 --> 00:16:15,142
they are loyal not to me,

269
00:16:15,143 --> 00:16:16,903
but to Mu

270
00:16:17,104 --> 00:16:19,624
and Quliang.

271
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,544
Let me introduce my family.

272
00:16:38,703 --> 00:16:39,823
Huairui.

273
00:16:41,984 --> 00:16:43,224
I'm here.

274
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,742
This is my primary consort,

275
00:16:46,743 --> 00:16:49,383
who is the eldest daughter
of the Fang family in Quliang.

276
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:53,224
She comes from a prestigious background,
and is virtuous, kind and diligent.

277
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,703
I got to inherit the title,

278
00:16:54,904 --> 00:16:56,624
thanks to her ability

279
00:16:56,703 --> 00:16:57,984
in managing the household.

280
00:16:59,224 --> 00:17:00,943
Greetings, sir.

281
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,263
Haiyao.

282
00:17:12,103 --> 00:17:13,224
I'm here.

283
00:17:13,263 --> 00:17:16,224
This is my side consort,

284
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:18,823
the daughter of
a second-ranking nobleman.

285
00:17:19,064 --> 00:17:21,104
Her brother is someone you know well,

286
00:17:21,863 --> 00:17:24,904
General Mu Tianshu.

287
00:17:31,024 --> 00:17:32,423
Three battles, three victories.

288
00:17:32,664 --> 00:17:33,543
General Mu

289
00:17:33,544 --> 00:17:35,303
is truly a top-tier military leader.

290
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,543
My king admires him.

291
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,583
Thank you for your kind words.

292
00:17:42,944 --> 00:17:44,224
Greetings, sir.

293
00:17:51,743 --> 00:17:53,183
I never expected Quliang

294
00:17:53,463 --> 00:17:54,783
to have so much talent.

295
00:17:55,143 --> 00:17:56,903
Even the ladies by your side

296
00:17:56,904 --> 00:17:59,543
are all remarkable individuals,
Your Highness.

297
00:18:05,064 --> 00:18:06,183
I

298
00:18:06,824 --> 00:18:08,583
have one more side consort.

299
00:18:11,784 --> 00:18:13,144
Summon Madam Lian.

300
00:18:13,304 --> 00:18:15,183
Summon Madam Lian!

301
00:18:15,463 --> 00:18:16,583
What does he want?

302
00:18:17,383 --> 00:18:18,744
Is he thinking

303
00:18:18,983 --> 00:18:20,224
of handing her over to the envoy?

304
00:18:34,424 --> 00:18:36,224
Greetings, Your Highness.

305
00:18:42,343 --> 00:18:43,663
She is Madam Lian,

306
00:18:43,784 --> 00:18:46,024
also a suspect in the tribute fire case.

307
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,504
I have confirmed that

308
00:18:47,623 --> 00:18:49,024
she is innocent.

309
00:18:50,184 --> 00:18:51,663
So I released her.

310
00:18:58,463 --> 00:19:00,423
How can he easily let her go?

311
00:19:00,784 --> 00:19:02,063
He is being too lenient.

312
00:19:02,064 --> 00:19:06,583
He's clearly underestimating Cige'er.

313
00:19:12,863 --> 00:19:14,504
If she's innocent,

314
00:19:15,024 --> 00:19:16,583
she must be set free.

315
00:19:16,584 --> 00:19:19,144
From what I can see, Madam Lian
has a dignified appearance.

316
00:19:19,343 --> 00:19:21,423
She doesn't seem like
a malicious person.

317
00:19:28,184 --> 00:19:29,703
Greetings, sir.

318
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:53,543
These days,

319
00:19:54,263 --> 00:19:55,543
you've suffered.

320
00:19:56,784 --> 00:19:57,904
I'm fine.

321
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:00,104
I've made you two

322
00:20:00,503 --> 00:20:01,823
suffer and worry me.

323
00:20:01,863 --> 00:20:03,583
With His Highness standing up for you,

324
00:20:03,904 --> 00:20:05,342
everything is worth it.

325
00:20:05,343 --> 00:20:07,583
It's just that His Highness's actions

326
00:20:08,263 --> 00:20:09,864
might offend the envoy.

327
00:20:10,064 --> 00:20:11,423
Play the music!

328
00:20:12,263 --> 00:20:15,344
Dance of the Holy Spirit!

329
00:20:55,103 --> 00:20:56,063
Sir,

330
00:20:56,584 --> 00:20:57,904
how do you find this dance?

331
00:20:58,784 --> 00:21:01,904
It's grand and it exudes a heroic spirit,

332
00:21:02,503 --> 00:21:04,183
but honestly,

333
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,982
I've yet to see Quliang's army

334
00:21:06,983 --> 00:21:08,663
exhibiting such courage
on the battlefield.

335
00:21:19,503 --> 00:21:21,024
I've just ascended
the position of the prince

336
00:21:21,103 --> 00:21:22,102
and things are still unstable.

337
00:21:22,103 --> 00:21:24,904
In the future, it won't be like this.

338
00:21:25,024 --> 00:21:27,823
Does His Highness
want to continue the battle?

339
00:21:27,824 --> 00:21:29,183
Your Highness, do you

340
00:21:29,424 --> 00:21:31,344
wish to continue to fight?

341
00:21:33,024 --> 00:21:35,024
I don't long for a war,

342
00:21:35,143 --> 00:21:36,624
but if we lose this battle,

343
00:21:36,743 --> 00:21:39,104
Quliang will be forever
under Cige'er's control.

344
00:21:39,184 --> 00:21:40,463
Even if I lose,

345
00:21:40,784 --> 00:21:42,303
Quliang must not lose

346
00:21:42,304 --> 00:21:45,104
and its heroic spirit must not wane.

347
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:47,864
However, Your Highness,

348
00:21:48,544 --> 00:21:50,904
considering Quliang's
current military strength,

349
00:21:50,983 --> 00:21:51,703
it's difficult for you

350
00:21:51,704 --> 00:21:53,783
to fight our Cige'er army.

351
00:21:58,024 --> 00:21:59,344
The outcome of a battle

352
00:21:59,664 --> 00:22:01,224
doesn't solely depend
on military strength.

353
00:22:01,704 --> 00:22:03,063
Morale is just as crucial.

354
00:22:09,424 --> 00:22:12,543
I'll personally lead the troops,

355
00:22:12,704 --> 00:22:16,504
living and fighting alongside them.

356
00:22:16,743 --> 00:22:17,663
Remember,

357
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:20,303
you might beat me once,

358
00:22:21,463 --> 00:22:23,384
but you must never win a second time.

359
00:22:29,664 --> 00:22:30,904
It's not easy

360
00:22:31,223 --> 00:22:33,264
to remain dignified and undaunted

361
00:22:33,944 --> 00:22:35,183
when facing adversity.

362
00:22:37,383 --> 00:22:38,423
Your Highness.

363
00:22:39,304 --> 00:22:40,744
Your Highness, you speak the truth.

364
00:22:41,223 --> 00:22:44,303
Quliang won't be subjugated.

365
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:45,864
We're all united

366
00:22:45,944 --> 00:22:48,703
and ready to fight to the end.

367
00:22:48,904 --> 00:22:50,104
So what's the harm?

368
00:22:53,424 --> 00:22:55,504
As what our king expected,

369
00:22:55,863 --> 00:22:57,543
Your Highness,
you're honest and upright,

370
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,744
a true hero.

371
00:22:58,983 --> 00:23:00,744
However, the king of Cige'er

372
00:23:00,983 --> 00:23:03,504
is no petty-minded person.

373
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,063
To be frank,

374
00:23:10,064 --> 00:23:11,783
the two outstanding generals from Quliang

375
00:23:11,784 --> 00:23:13,104
have fought like gods,

376
00:23:13,263 --> 00:23:14,583
winning three battles out of three.

377
00:23:14,784 --> 00:23:16,423
They have already placed my Cige'er army

378
00:23:16,424 --> 00:23:17,744
at a disadvantage.

379
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:18,903
Our later victories

380
00:23:18,904 --> 00:23:20,504
were also due to sheer luck

381
00:23:20,704 --> 00:23:22,423
and we are aware of that.

382
00:23:22,424 --> 00:23:24,703
The king sent us here

383
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:26,384
not to accuse you,

384
00:23:29,144 --> 00:23:30,905
but to seek reconciliation.

385
00:23:43,743 --> 00:23:45,144
The king

386
00:23:45,463 --> 00:23:46,943
sincerely requests to Prince An

387
00:23:47,143 --> 00:23:48,904
to marry a virtuous and noble woman

388
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:51,104
as his queen.

389
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,303
What are you thinking?

390
00:24:04,064 --> 00:24:05,144
Marriage alliance.

391
00:24:06,143 --> 00:24:07,943
They come to discuss
a marriage alliance.

392
00:24:08,463 --> 00:24:09,904
Will His Highness agree?

393
00:24:12,024 --> 00:24:13,344
In both private and public matters,

394
00:24:13,664 --> 00:24:15,240
His Highness cannot tolerate
prolonged warfare.

395
00:24:17,024 --> 00:24:18,384
Rong, don't be afraid.

396
00:24:18,743 --> 00:24:19,903
Throughout history,

397
00:24:19,904 --> 00:24:20,943
marriage alliances

398
00:24:21,103 --> 00:24:22,183
have always seen female servants

399
00:24:22,184 --> 00:24:23,783
being chosen and promoted
for the marriage.

400
00:24:23,824 --> 00:24:24,783
Even if

401
00:24:24,784 --> 00:24:26,663
His Highness agrees to the marriage,

402
00:24:26,664 --> 00:24:28,000
the lady will be with chosen

403
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,663
from the noblewomen
of officials' families.

404
00:24:29,663 --> 00:24:31,420
Then, the lady will be appointed
as a county princess.

405
00:24:31,743 --> 00:24:33,303
It won't involve Lingwei.

406
00:24:34,103 --> 00:24:35,583
I hope it'll turn out that way.

407
00:24:36,024 --> 00:24:37,423
Lingwei matters the most to me.

408
00:24:37,784 --> 00:24:39,504
If she goes to Cige'er,

409
00:24:40,184 --> 00:24:41,063
I...

410
00:24:42,343 --> 00:24:43,703
If she goes to Cige'er,

411
00:24:43,704 --> 00:24:45,063
who will catch rabbits for her?

412
00:24:46,463 --> 00:24:47,382
You all

413
00:24:47,383 --> 00:24:48,982
dote on her all day long.

414
00:24:48,983 --> 00:24:50,862
She has a child's nature.

415
00:24:50,863 --> 00:24:52,463
When will she grow up?

416
00:24:53,064 --> 00:24:54,342
She doesn't need to grow up.

417
00:24:54,343 --> 00:24:56,222
She can always be
our little ray of sunshine.

418
00:24:56,223 --> 00:24:57,063
That's right.

419
00:24:57,584 --> 00:24:58,744
Besides,

420
00:24:59,704 --> 00:25:01,583
she's our daughter too.

421
00:25:02,424 --> 00:25:03,303
Don't worry,

422
00:25:03,304 --> 00:25:04,663
the three of us are together.

423
00:25:05,383 --> 00:25:06,543
Do you still want to eat?

424
00:25:06,664 --> 00:25:07,744
So adorable.

425
00:25:13,944 --> 00:25:15,663
Madam, something is not right.

426
00:25:15,664 --> 00:25:16,303
What's wrong?

427
00:25:16,304 --> 00:25:17,063
Madam,

428
00:25:17,103 --> 00:25:18,680
Su Nanchun just sent a message,

429
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,720
saying that last night,
the envoy came to see His Highness

430
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,423
and mentioned
the marriage alliance, wanting...

431
00:25:25,664 --> 00:25:26,502
What do they want?

432
00:25:26,503 --> 00:25:27,463
They want

433
00:25:28,143 --> 00:25:30,463
His Highness's legitimate daughter.

434
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:35,382
Is this matter settled?

435
00:25:35,383 --> 00:25:36,463
What did His Highness say?

436
00:25:37,463 --> 00:25:39,663
Su Nanchun only told me this much.

437
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:42,783
Cige'er's sincere peace proposal

438
00:25:42,784 --> 00:25:44,144
is a just act.

439
00:25:44,184 --> 00:25:47,463
As the defeated side,
Quliang has no moral nor rational basis

440
00:25:48,024 --> 00:25:49,823
to reject it.

441
00:25:52,704 --> 00:25:53,624
Lian'er,

442
00:25:54,463 --> 00:25:56,303
ask His Highness to reconsider it.

443
00:25:56,343 --> 00:25:58,063
He listens to you the most.

444
00:25:58,064 --> 00:26:00,104
There's at least a 50%
chance of success.

445
00:26:07,664 --> 00:26:09,063
You don't want to go?

446
00:26:09,664 --> 00:26:10,703
It's not that.

447
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,063
Indeed,

448
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:16,864
this could anger His Highness,

449
00:26:17,064 --> 00:26:18,303
but I have no influence

450
00:26:18,304 --> 00:26:19,982
as I'm from a lowly background.

451
00:26:19,983 --> 00:26:21,920
Besides asking you,
my best friend of more than a decade,

452
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,423
who else can I turn to?

453
00:26:23,784 --> 00:26:25,104
Don't worry.

454
00:26:26,103 --> 00:26:29,024
I'll ask His Highness.

455
00:26:29,664 --> 00:26:30,703
Really?

456
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:32,224
Lian'er.

457
00:26:32,623 --> 00:26:34,063
I entrust our fate, mine and Lingwei's,

458
00:26:34,304 --> 00:26:35,864
entirely to you.

459
00:26:39,184 --> 00:26:40,502
Zhihui, take good care of her.

460
00:26:40,503 --> 00:26:41,303
Yes.

461
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:43,183
Lian'er.

462
00:26:54,944 --> 00:26:55,823
Lian'er!

463
00:27:02,623 --> 00:27:04,583
Do you know why Madam Rui is doing this?

464
00:27:06,143 --> 00:27:07,024
I know.

465
00:27:07,143 --> 00:27:08,624
You know, yet you still want to go?

466
00:27:09,143 --> 00:27:09,663
Do you know

467
00:27:09,664 --> 00:27:11,264
that this marriage has already been decided?

468
00:27:11,584 --> 00:27:13,023
If you insist on pleading,

469
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,142
it will only disappoint

470
00:27:14,143 --> 00:27:15,264
His Highness greatly.

471
00:27:17,544 --> 00:27:18,384
I know.

472
00:27:20,623 --> 00:27:21,382
Do you know

473
00:27:21,383 --> 00:27:23,423
how many people in this mansion
are watching you closely?

474
00:27:24,263 --> 00:27:26,183
If you lose His Highness's protection,

475
00:27:26,184 --> 00:27:27,502
you will become a target.

476
00:27:27,503 --> 00:27:28,663
It'll be even more dangerous.

477
00:27:28,983 --> 00:27:30,063
I know.

478
00:27:30,064 --> 00:27:31,463
Why are you going then?

479
00:27:33,503 --> 00:27:34,423
My love for Lingwei

480
00:27:34,424 --> 00:27:36,024
is no less than yours.

481
00:27:36,623 --> 00:27:37,744
However, Lian'er,

482
00:27:38,263 --> 00:27:39,823
we've survived

483
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,423
not by acting on impulse,

484
00:27:41,664 --> 00:27:43,183
but by assessing situations

485
00:27:43,184 --> 00:27:44,262
and enduring hardships.

486
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:45,102
Right now,

487
00:27:45,103 --> 00:27:47,583
you're risking everything to do something
with no guarantee of success.

488
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,624
Is it worth it?

489
00:27:49,544 --> 00:27:51,384
If I lose you and Rong,

490
00:27:51,944 --> 00:27:53,624
what's the point

491
00:27:53,983 --> 00:27:55,264
of having everything else.

492
00:28:12,664 --> 00:28:13,823
Did he just fall asleep?

493
00:28:15,743 --> 00:28:17,023
His Highness met with the envoy

494
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,183
and didn't sleep all night.

495
00:28:18,544 --> 00:28:19,624
He just dozed off.

496
00:28:36,824 --> 00:28:37,864
What's this?

497
00:28:38,623 --> 00:28:39,703
His Highness said

498
00:28:39,863 --> 00:28:42,023
it's the first purse
that Lady Lingwei embroidered

499
00:28:42,024 --> 00:28:43,303
when she was learning needlework.

500
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:52,463
You're awake.

501
00:28:53,343 --> 00:28:54,183
You're here.

502
00:28:54,184 --> 00:28:55,864
Did I disturb you?

503
00:28:58,343 --> 00:29:00,344
I knew you'd come to look for me,

504
00:29:01,223 --> 00:29:03,024
but I didn't expect it to be so soon.

505
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,423
If you have anything to say,

506
00:29:06,584 --> 00:29:07,904
please go ahead.

507
00:29:12,623 --> 00:29:14,543
Your Highness, you once told me this.

508
00:29:16,704 --> 00:29:17,823
You said that

509
00:29:18,143 --> 00:29:20,783
seeing Lingwei

510
00:29:21,223 --> 00:29:23,222
during troubled times

511
00:29:23,223 --> 00:29:25,144
would brighten up your mood

512
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:27,384
and she's like

513
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:30,423
a piece of your heart.

514
00:29:31,704 --> 00:29:33,823
Among your children,

515
00:29:34,343 --> 00:29:36,144
she's the only one
who tugs at your heartstrings.

516
00:29:37,944 --> 00:29:38,823
Yes,

517
00:29:40,944 --> 00:29:42,303
she's the only one.

518
00:29:43,503 --> 00:29:45,943
Then how can you

519
00:29:48,263 --> 00:29:49,342
bear to let her

520
00:29:49,343 --> 00:29:51,624
face adversity and marry so faraway?

521
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:54,183
I can't bear it either,

522
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:56,463
but I promised father that I would...

523
00:29:59,503 --> 00:30:00,543
The late prince?

524
00:30:00,944 --> 00:30:02,543
What did you promise him?

525
00:30:04,863 --> 00:30:06,183
I promised him

526
00:30:06,503 --> 00:30:08,423
that I would defend Quliang

527
00:30:08,623 --> 00:30:09,823
and its people with my life.

528
00:30:10,704 --> 00:30:12,543
During the banquet, you said

529
00:30:13,503 --> 00:30:15,384
you would personally lead the troops.

530
00:30:16,824 --> 00:30:18,384
You could fight then.

531
00:30:18,743 --> 00:30:20,224
What about now?

532
00:30:22,304 --> 00:30:23,583
I thought

533
00:30:23,623 --> 00:30:25,543
Cige'er was trying to accuse us.

534
00:30:26,103 --> 00:30:27,303
If I yielded to Cige'er's troops,

535
00:30:27,343 --> 00:30:29,742
Quliang would forever
be controlled by them.

536
00:30:29,743 --> 00:30:30,904
I fought

537
00:30:31,383 --> 00:30:33,303
for the people to avoid dishonour.

538
00:30:33,304 --> 00:30:35,504
They are all for peace now.

539
00:30:35,544 --> 00:30:36,703
If I fight again,

540
00:30:36,983 --> 00:30:38,142
it's for personal reasons

541
00:30:38,143 --> 00:30:39,183
and against the people's wishes.

542
00:30:39,184 --> 00:30:40,144
Do you understand?

543
00:30:40,223 --> 00:30:41,423
I don't understand.

544
00:30:45,463 --> 00:30:48,342
The He family is beloved by the people

545
00:30:48,343 --> 00:30:50,904
because we treat them as our own.

546
00:30:51,064 --> 00:30:52,423
If we lose their support,

547
00:30:52,463 --> 00:30:54,663
even if I got the position of Prince An,

548
00:30:54,944 --> 00:30:56,583
I won't achieve anything.

549
00:30:56,863 --> 00:30:57,744
Do you understand?

550
00:31:04,664 --> 00:31:06,583
Even if I have to give my life,

551
00:31:07,024 --> 00:31:09,984
I'm willing to protect Quliang with you.

552
00:31:11,263 --> 00:31:12,504
However, I implore you

553
00:31:12,544 --> 00:31:14,864
to abandon the path
of marrying off Lingwei.

554
00:31:19,223 --> 00:31:20,543
You still don't understand.

555
00:31:21,304 --> 00:31:22,303
Su Nanchun.

556
00:31:22,304 --> 00:31:23,224
Here.

557
00:31:23,704 --> 00:31:26,023
Madam is tired. Take her back.

558
00:31:26,024 --> 00:31:26,943
Yes.

559
00:31:48,184 --> 00:31:49,344
Go back?

560
00:31:52,664 --> 00:31:54,423
Rong is anxious.

561
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:57,904
How can I go back like this,

562
00:31:59,304 --> 00:32:01,744
watching her lose Lingwei

563
00:32:03,424 --> 00:32:05,224
and leaving her heartbroken
for the rest of her life?

564
00:32:10,503 --> 00:32:11,504
Madam Lian.

565
00:32:14,424 --> 00:32:15,663
I shouldn't have spoken out of turn

566
00:32:16,064 --> 00:32:17,783
about His Highness' matter.

567
00:32:19,223 --> 00:32:20,423
May I

568
00:32:20,824 --> 00:32:21,864
propose an idea?

569
00:32:24,863 --> 00:32:26,783
Since the envoy chose the person,

570
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:30,183
what if he changes his mind?

571
00:32:47,824 --> 00:32:49,063
My Lady,

572
00:32:49,544 --> 00:32:51,104
please slow down.

573
00:32:51,904 --> 00:32:53,024
My Lady.

574
00:32:53,503 --> 00:32:54,904
Walk slowly.

575
00:33:09,103 --> 00:33:11,423
Wait.

576
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:13,543
My Lady.

577
00:33:20,383 --> 00:33:21,943
As the queen of Cige'er,

578
00:33:21,944 --> 00:33:23,224
one naturally needs to be

579
00:33:23,343 --> 00:33:24,982
dignified and virtuous,

580
00:33:24,983 --> 00:33:26,142
with great maternal grace.

581
00:33:26,143 --> 00:33:27,423
It's not something any ordinary woman

582
00:33:27,424 --> 00:33:28,224
can achieve.

583
00:33:29,103 --> 00:33:31,144
Even though the prince's daughter
has a noble status,

584
00:33:31,623 --> 00:33:33,423
whether she can match your king

585
00:33:33,463 --> 00:33:36,504
in temperament and looks

586
00:33:36,944 --> 00:33:38,423
is another matter.

587
00:33:40,944 --> 00:33:44,423
Even if she can't, what does it matter?

588
00:33:44,863 --> 00:33:45,984
Madam,

589
00:33:46,184 --> 00:33:47,904
you underestimate our king.

590
00:33:48,704 --> 00:33:51,703
Seeking a marriage alliance isn't
about indulging in romantic affairs,

591
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:55,463
but ending the animosity between us,

592
00:33:55,824 --> 00:33:58,024
aligning the hearts

593
00:33:58,263 --> 00:33:59,904
of both Cige'er and Quliang.

594
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:03,423
It doesn't matter
if she is beautiful or not.

595
00:34:04,304 --> 00:34:05,783
A person's value lies in the heart.

596
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:08,663
As long as she has a good heart,

597
00:34:09,743 --> 00:34:10,943
King Celun

598
00:34:11,263 --> 00:34:14,023
will surely love and respect her

599
00:34:14,824 --> 00:34:16,144
for life and never abandon her.

600
00:34:23,263 --> 00:34:25,262
He's not afraid to choose
someone extremely odd and ugly.

601
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:26,222
When he returns,

602
00:34:26,223 --> 00:34:28,023
wouldn't he have difficulty
explaining it to his king?

603
00:34:28,743 --> 00:34:30,904
He exudes a kind of stubbornness.

604
00:34:31,024 --> 00:34:32,743
I don't know where his
arrogance comes from.

605
00:34:33,144 --> 00:34:34,904
If this path doesn't work,

606
00:34:35,263 --> 00:34:37,063
wouldn't there be no way left?

607
00:34:42,463 --> 00:34:46,263
Having the garden means losing Quliang.

608
00:34:51,503 --> 00:34:54,023
What's wrong? Did I say anything wrong?

609
00:34:54,304 --> 00:34:55,823
I am just thinking

610
00:34:56,144 --> 00:34:57,383
that an envoy

611
00:34:57,384 --> 00:34:59,262
has such insight.

612
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,384
Seeking a marriage alliance

613
00:35:00,503 --> 00:35:02,223
is not about indulging
in romantic affairs

614
00:35:03,183 --> 00:35:05,944
but ending the animosity between us,

615
00:35:06,344 --> 00:35:07,384
aligning the hearts

616
00:35:07,503 --> 00:35:10,384
of both Cige'er and Quliang.

617
00:35:11,784 --> 00:35:13,503
An envoy

618
00:35:13,864 --> 00:35:16,023
openly addressed the king by his name.

619
00:35:19,304 --> 00:35:21,223
No wonder he has extraordinary insight.

620
00:35:21,263 --> 00:35:22,742
No wonder he's not afraid

621
00:35:22,743 --> 00:35:24,543
of failing the king.

622
00:35:24,824 --> 00:35:25,823
It's because

623
00:35:26,864 --> 00:35:28,823
he's not an envoy at all.

624
00:35:29,223 --> 00:35:30,503
He is

625
00:35:31,824 --> 00:35:33,344
King of Cige'er.

626
00:35:33,503 --> 00:35:34,704
What did you say?

627
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,104
So the envoy is Celun?

628
00:35:39,784 --> 00:35:41,223
In that case,

629
00:35:41,703 --> 00:35:42,702
Lingwei's marriage

630
00:35:42,703 --> 00:35:44,743
can't be changed in any way?

631
00:35:45,584 --> 00:35:46,704
Rong.

632
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,503
Lian'er.

633
00:35:49,304 --> 00:35:50,904
Please think of another way.

634
00:35:51,544 --> 00:35:52,783
I beg you to save me

635
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:54,424
and Lingwei, please.

636
00:35:54,584 --> 00:35:55,863
Please calm down

637
00:35:55,864 --> 00:35:57,503
and listen to me.

638
00:35:57,663 --> 00:35:58,583
All right.

639
00:35:59,304 --> 00:36:00,182
I have some ideas

640
00:36:00,183 --> 00:36:01,503
and want to discuss with you.

641
00:36:02,943 --> 00:36:04,624
Do you have other thoughts?

642
00:36:06,663 --> 00:36:07,783
It's Celun.

643
00:36:09,384 --> 00:36:11,583
He is the king of a whole country

644
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:13,063
and a handsome young man,

645
00:36:13,064 --> 00:36:14,384
yet he hasn't had a queen.

646
00:36:14,663 --> 00:36:16,863
The most important thing is
that this trip to Fangfei Garden

647
00:36:16,864 --> 00:36:18,023
has shown me that

648
00:36:18,024 --> 00:36:19,263
he is a man

649
00:36:19,423 --> 00:36:22,983
with great vision, ideas and integrity.

650
00:36:25,463 --> 00:36:26,864
What do you want to say?

651
00:36:28,503 --> 00:36:30,063
Upon closer examination,

652
00:36:30,743 --> 00:36:32,863
he's not entirely without merit.

653
00:36:32,864 --> 00:36:33,944
If

654
00:36:34,304 --> 00:36:36,063
he treats Lingwei well,

655
00:36:36,144 --> 00:36:37,583
maybe

656
00:36:37,743 --> 00:36:39,743
he's not such a bad match after all.

657
00:36:58,384 --> 00:37:00,063
Such beautiful hair,

658
00:37:01,544 --> 00:37:02,864
as black as ink

659
00:37:04,104 --> 00:37:06,063
and as shiny as the stars at night.

660
00:37:07,624 --> 00:37:08,222
Whose daughter

661
00:37:08,223 --> 00:37:09,743
has such wonderful hair?

662
00:37:10,743 --> 00:37:11,704
Mother.

663
00:37:11,864 --> 00:37:13,583
Did you hurriedly summoned me

664
00:37:13,824 --> 00:37:15,743
just to do my hair?

665
00:37:18,384 --> 00:37:19,823
It's to do your hair

666
00:37:20,544 --> 00:37:21,664
and dress you up.

667
00:37:23,703 --> 00:37:26,503
I thought that these everyday tasks
were ordinary,

668
00:37:27,263 --> 00:37:29,624
but I never imagined
there would come a day

669
00:37:30,864 --> 00:37:33,023
when it would be such a luxury
to take care of my own daughter

670
00:37:34,384 --> 00:37:36,063
with my own hands.

671
00:37:37,943 --> 00:37:39,023
Mother.

672
00:37:41,703 --> 00:37:43,424
I've been timid all my life,

673
00:37:44,344 --> 00:37:45,904
but it's different now.

674
00:37:47,144 --> 00:37:49,424
I've never been like this before.

675
00:37:50,784 --> 00:37:52,344
I'm full of strength.

676
00:37:56,784 --> 00:37:57,664
Come on,

677
00:37:58,384 --> 00:38:00,184
let me dress my daughter up.

678
00:38:10,024 --> 00:38:10,823
Why are you dressing me

679
00:38:10,824 --> 00:38:12,184
in a maid's clothes?

680
00:38:13,223 --> 00:38:14,583
Don't ask too much.

681
00:38:14,903 --> 00:38:16,303
Hurry and put on all the clothes.

682
00:38:16,703 --> 00:38:17,904
Then, we'll do more dressing up.

683
00:38:20,263 --> 00:38:21,344
Mother.

684
00:38:22,183 --> 00:38:23,783
Are you trying to help me to escape?

685
00:38:50,957 --> 00:38:53,277
(Mansion of Lord Rui)

686
00:38:53,624 --> 00:38:55,303
My Lady, please go quickly

687
00:38:55,344 --> 00:38:56,904
or it'll be too late.

688
00:39:07,064 --> 00:39:07,942
Your Highness,

689
00:39:07,943 --> 00:39:08,960
all the dowry gifts,

690
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,863
(Mansion of Prince An)
accompanying physicians, provisions

691
00:39:10,864 --> 00:39:12,263
and everything else are prepared.

692
00:39:12,344 --> 00:39:13,864
They're waiting at the gate,

693
00:39:13,903 --> 00:39:15,904
ready to depart
when the auspicious time comes.

694
00:39:29,223 --> 00:39:30,144
Su Nanchun.

695
00:39:30,463 --> 00:39:31,303
Here.

696
00:39:31,304 --> 00:39:32,384
Return to my former mansion

697
00:39:32,423 --> 00:39:34,503
and ensure Lady Lingwei
doesn't miss the auspicious time.

698
00:39:34,584 --> 00:39:35,503
Yes, Your Highness.

699
00:39:40,384 --> 00:39:41,704
Your Highness, no need to be in a hurry.

700
00:39:41,983 --> 00:39:43,343
Lady Lingwei and her mother

701
00:39:43,344 --> 00:39:45,303
surely have some words
to say in private.

702
00:39:45,503 --> 00:39:48,303
The auspicious time
hasn't arrived yet. We can wait.

703
00:40:04,544 --> 00:40:05,344
Mother.

704
00:40:05,423 --> 00:40:06,783
The procession is waiting
at Luming Gate,

705
00:40:06,784 --> 00:40:08,343
while father and the envoy
are at Qingkang Hall,

706
00:40:08,344 --> 00:40:09,783
awaiting to bid farewell to my sister.

707
00:40:13,584 --> 00:40:14,704
Farewell?

708
00:40:18,423 --> 00:40:23,222
Lingwei is marrying faraway
and I find myself without the courage

709
00:40:23,223 --> 00:40:24,384
to see her off.

710
00:40:24,864 --> 00:40:25,462
It's not because

711
00:40:25,463 --> 00:40:27,184
Madam Rong blamed me,

712
00:40:28,064 --> 00:40:29,424
but I

713
00:40:30,024 --> 00:40:32,624
failed to stand by my best friend.

714
00:40:33,423 --> 00:40:36,704
Instead, I wavered between your father
and my best friend.

715
00:40:37,344 --> 00:40:38,063
