17
00:01:51,663 --> 00:01:52,704
What do you want to say?

18
00:01:55,024 --> 00:01:56,144
I want to say that

19
00:01:56,343 --> 00:01:57,744
even if Madam Rong

20
00:01:57,744 --> 00:01:58,623
blames you wrongfully,

21
00:01:58,863 --> 00:01:59,903
it's just temporary.

22
00:02:00,184 --> 00:02:01,983
Everything will be fine when it's over.

23
00:02:03,903 --> 00:02:05,263
How will it be fine?

24
00:02:07,104 --> 00:02:08,263
Lingwei may not be able

25
00:02:10,343 --> 00:02:11,663
to meet Madam Rong

26
00:02:13,184 --> 00:02:14,464
after she leaves this time.

27
00:02:16,223 --> 00:02:18,184
Mother, what if...

28
00:02:18,984 --> 00:02:20,104
What if my sister runs away?

29
00:02:20,503 --> 00:02:21,583
If she does,

30
00:02:22,863 --> 00:02:24,024
not only Madam Rong

31
00:02:24,264 --> 00:02:25,384
will be executed,

32
00:02:25,943 --> 00:02:27,184
the war will be rekindled

33
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,440
and there will never be peace.

34
00:02:28,464 --> 00:02:29,544
However, Madam Rong said...

35
00:02:34,544 --> 00:02:35,663
What did she say?

36
00:02:39,024 --> 00:02:39,824
It's my fault.

37
00:02:58,423 --> 00:03:00,384
Your Highness, Madam Lian is here.

38
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,170
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

39
00:03:07,663 --> 00:03:08,184
Where is she?

40
00:03:08,824 --> 00:03:09,663
Your Highness.

41
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:11,863
The princess was ready,

42
00:03:12,303 --> 00:03:13,264
but she suddenly

43
00:03:13,824 --> 00:03:14,703
fell sick.

44
00:03:14,824 --> 00:03:16,904
She fell sick? What kind of sickness?

45
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:19,063
Chest pain.

46
00:03:19,423 --> 00:03:20,384
She's shivering all over

47
00:03:20,824 --> 00:03:21,663
and unable to walk.

48
00:03:23,423 --> 00:03:25,904
Do you remember what I've said?

49
00:03:26,303 --> 00:03:26,943
Yes.

50
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,570
We mustn't let the princess
be found by the people of His Highness.

51
00:03:29,824 --> 00:03:31,024
Kill her

52
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,503
if there is no choice.

53
00:03:34,024 --> 00:03:34,544
Go.

54
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,730
- Noted.
- Noted.

55
00:03:39,104 --> 00:03:40,583
To incite a war,

56
00:03:43,943 --> 00:03:45,464
we won't even spare

57
00:03:45,863 --> 00:03:46,624
our own niece.

58
00:03:48,303 --> 00:03:48,984
Lianzuo.

59
00:03:49,984 --> 00:03:51,223
She's our niece,

60
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:53,303
but she can't compare

61
00:03:53,303 --> 00:03:54,544
to our future.

62
00:03:57,703 --> 00:03:58,503
Future?

63
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:04,544
Future.

64
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:38,784
Madam Rong.

65
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,823
His Highness asked you...

66
00:04:39,823 --> 00:04:40,624
Got it.

67
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:45,944
Let's go.

68
00:05:21,944 --> 00:05:22,624
Xiangning!

69
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:26,383
Xiangning!

70
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:31,664
Save Lingwei!

71
00:05:32,224 --> 00:05:34,143
Zhao'er, travel out of the city.

72
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:35,583
You must find Lingwei.

73
00:05:35,823 --> 00:05:36,823
Mother, I...

74
00:05:37,464 --> 00:05:38,064
I know

75
00:05:38,064 --> 00:05:39,423
you're close to Lingwei,

76
00:05:39,744 --> 00:05:41,664
but we can't hesitate on this.

77
00:05:42,263 --> 00:05:44,464
Lingwei's life is at stake
if she doesn't come back.

78
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,370
Lingwei, are you okay?

79
00:05:53,184 --> 00:05:53,703
Zhao'er.

80
00:05:53,983 --> 00:05:55,263
Go. Get inside.

81
00:06:21,024 --> 00:06:22,184
Lingwei, why are you crying?

82
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,823
I'm crying in front of my brother.

83
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,624
I'm seriously a bad sister.

84
00:06:30,064 --> 00:06:31,344
I'm a bad brother instead.

85
00:06:33,423 --> 00:06:34,504
You do nothing wrong.

86
00:06:35,543 --> 00:06:36,664
It's me.

87
00:06:37,103 --> 00:06:37,983
It's my life.

88
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:39,543
I only hope

89
00:06:39,904 --> 00:06:41,464
I wasn't born in a prince's family.

90
00:06:42,184 --> 00:06:42,863
I only hope

91
00:06:44,423 --> 00:06:45,944
my father didn't inherit the title.

92
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,670
Zhao'er, what are you doing?

93
00:06:54,784 --> 00:06:56,423
Leave. I won't stop you anymore.

94
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,664
I'll set you free.

95
00:07:00,064 --> 00:07:01,624
- Come on.
- Silly Zhao'er.

96
00:07:02,863 --> 00:07:04,464
What if I run away?

97
00:07:04,784 --> 00:07:06,263
Will I be happy after that?

98
00:07:06,383 --> 00:07:08,064
I'll part with my mother.

99
00:07:10,344 --> 00:07:12,184
I'll get the family involved.

100
00:07:14,344 --> 00:07:15,064
Leave.

101
00:07:20,383 --> 00:07:21,024
Lingwei.

102
00:07:22,744 --> 00:07:23,583
When I was little,

103
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,064
grandfather said this to me.

104
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,263
Quliang has many children.

105
00:07:29,224 --> 00:07:30,664
He worked hard on political affairs

106
00:07:31,303 --> 00:07:32,624
so that the children

107
00:07:32,944 --> 00:07:34,784
could have enough food and clothing

108
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,583
and play happily.

109
00:07:38,103 --> 00:07:38,664
He said

110
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:41,383
one who looked out for others

111
00:07:43,143 --> 00:07:43,944
was great.

112
00:07:48,064 --> 00:07:50,344
I get it now.

113
00:07:53,303 --> 00:07:53,823
All right.

114
00:07:54,983 --> 00:07:56,904
I promise.

115
00:07:57,624 --> 00:07:59,184
If Celun bullies you,

116
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,904
I'll lead a troop to exterminate Cige'er

117
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,303
before bringing you back.

118
00:08:04,263 --> 00:08:05,983
Leave now.

119
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,464
Lingwei, don't come out!

120
00:09:42,503 --> 00:09:43,063
Go!

121
00:10:09,503 --> 00:10:10,024
(Lianxin.)

122
00:10:10,623 --> 00:10:11,743
(There is no way)

123
00:10:12,263 --> 00:10:14,344
(to undo the mistakes of the past now.)

124
00:10:15,104 --> 00:10:15,703
(This is)

125
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:17,864
(all I can do for you now.)

126
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,460
(I don't ask for your forgiveness.)

127
00:10:19,743 --> 00:10:21,344
(I only ask you to stop the war)

128
00:10:21,943 --> 00:10:23,823
(and restore peace in Quliang.)

129
00:10:26,143 --> 00:10:26,703
Father!

130
00:10:28,183 --> 00:10:28,904
Wait, father!

131
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:30,143
Please meet someone.

132
00:11:07,823 --> 00:11:09,503
Greetings, Father.

133
00:11:14,743 --> 00:11:15,984
Cease the war.

134
00:11:16,703 --> 00:11:17,823
Benefit the people.

135
00:11:19,743 --> 00:11:20,623
May you

136
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,743
bear the words in mind

137
00:11:28,823 --> 00:11:31,743
and never fight against each other.

138
00:11:31,943 --> 00:11:36,703
Respect and love each other.

139
00:11:38,143 --> 00:11:40,623
Never abandon each other.

140
00:12:21,263 --> 00:12:21,943
Stop!

141
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:11,165
(Three months later)

142
00:13:11,251 --> 00:13:12,587
(Prince An's Mansion)

143
00:13:29,864 --> 00:13:31,304
Your Highness!

144
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,664
Madam De...

145
00:13:36,224 --> 00:13:37,024
What happened?

146
00:13:37,904 --> 00:13:39,304
She may not live long.

147
00:14:09,984 --> 00:14:12,024
Physician, Rong...

148
00:14:13,943 --> 00:14:15,623
Madam Rong is weak

149
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:17,344
and she caught a cold.

150
00:14:17,784 --> 00:14:18,503
I'm afraid...

151
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:22,024
What is it?

152
00:14:22,784 --> 00:14:24,583
She may not hold it any longer.

153
00:15:18,263 --> 00:15:18,864
Mother.

154
00:16:19,784 --> 00:16:21,664
Madam, you haven't slept all night.

155
00:16:21,984 --> 00:16:22,864
Why don't you go back

156
00:16:22,864 --> 00:16:23,823
to get some rest?

157
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:29,503
Lian'er.

158
00:16:31,464 --> 00:16:31,943
Lian'er.

159
00:16:35,823 --> 00:16:36,464
Rou.

160
00:17:01,503 --> 00:17:02,344
You're here.

161
00:17:03,984 --> 00:17:04,743
Rong.

162
00:17:12,544 --> 00:17:13,304
Don't cry.

163
00:17:14,664 --> 00:17:15,944
Everyone dies.

164
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,664
I've lived my life without
any injury or pain.

165
00:17:21,824 --> 00:17:23,704
I'm content with having
you all by my side

166
00:17:25,743 --> 00:17:26,824
in the end.

167
00:17:27,304 --> 00:17:28,143
After all,

168
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,263
I failed to persuade His Highness.

169
00:17:32,103 --> 00:17:33,704
I don't get to set Lingwei

170
00:17:33,704 --> 00:17:34,824
free.

171
00:17:36,143 --> 00:17:36,784
Rong.

172
00:17:38,343 --> 00:17:40,184
I'm sorry to you.

173
00:17:40,904 --> 00:17:42,024
Don't talk about this.

174
00:17:46,263 --> 00:17:46,743
Come on.

175
00:17:49,824 --> 00:17:51,223
Play chess with me.

176
00:17:52,623 --> 00:17:54,383
No. You're tired.

177
00:17:54,623 --> 00:17:55,463
I won't play.

178
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,584
I always listen to you.

179
00:18:03,544 --> 00:18:04,623
Listen to me

180
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:07,863
for once,

181
00:18:09,944 --> 00:18:10,704
okay?

182
00:18:14,424 --> 00:18:15,024
Okay.

183
00:18:16,623 --> 00:18:17,383
I'll play.

184
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:19,743
Let's play.

185
00:18:34,463 --> 00:18:35,743
Do you remember us

186
00:18:37,463 --> 00:18:40,983
playing together for the first time
during the first Chinese New Year's Eve

187
00:18:40,983 --> 00:18:42,383
after you entered the mansion?

188
00:18:44,503 --> 00:18:45,544
Of course.

189
00:18:49,024 --> 00:18:50,383
We even made dumplings together

190
00:18:51,103 --> 00:18:54,024
at Lianwei House.

191
00:19:01,863 --> 00:19:03,383
Do you remember who won?

192
00:19:04,064 --> 00:19:05,664
You, for sure.

193
00:19:06,223 --> 00:19:07,143
You always

194
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,223
beat me over the years.

195
00:19:13,824 --> 00:19:14,623
On that day,

196
00:19:16,784 --> 00:19:18,223
we bet on the loser

197
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:21,024
making dumplings

198
00:19:22,064 --> 00:19:24,704
and spent two hours in a game.

199
00:19:25,944 --> 00:19:26,584
In the end,

200
00:19:28,743 --> 00:19:31,064
I narrowly won by an exchange.

201
00:19:31,623 --> 00:19:32,983
I was so thrilled.

202
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:35,863
I got a big smile.

203
00:19:39,944 --> 00:19:42,904
Stop talking.

204
00:19:45,343 --> 00:19:46,064
Well,

205
00:19:46,983 --> 00:19:47,863
I appeared

206
00:19:47,863 --> 00:19:49,343
to be a steady person.

207
00:19:51,863 --> 00:19:53,424
Why was I so thrilled

208
00:19:53,424 --> 00:19:54,584
over a petty thing?

209
00:19:55,503 --> 00:19:56,544
You have no idea.

210
00:19:58,664 --> 00:19:59,463
I was thrilled

211
00:20:02,143 --> 00:20:03,944
not because I beat you.

212
00:20:07,463 --> 00:20:09,463
It's because you're by my side.

213
00:20:13,263 --> 00:20:13,983
That's great.

214
00:20:22,024 --> 00:20:23,103
You thought I didn't know.

215
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:27,743
I was well aware.

216
00:20:29,824 --> 00:20:32,064
I didn't play better than you.

217
00:20:34,103 --> 00:20:36,024
You lost to me every time

218
00:20:38,143 --> 00:20:39,944
to please me.

219
00:20:42,223 --> 00:20:43,103
The exchange.

220
00:20:44,863 --> 00:20:46,343
It's always that.

221
00:20:49,263 --> 00:20:50,383
As long as you...

222
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:54,424
As long as you're happy,

223
00:20:55,383 --> 00:20:58,503
winning or losing doesn't matter.

224
00:21:48,304 --> 00:21:49,383
You've lost again.

225
00:21:50,024 --> 00:21:51,824
Yes, I've lost again.

226
00:21:52,024 --> 00:21:53,223
What do we bet on this time?

227
00:21:55,263 --> 00:21:56,424
Whatever

228
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:57,863
you say.

229
00:22:03,863 --> 00:22:04,944
I want you to promise me

230
00:22:06,584 --> 00:22:07,824
that you'll assist His Highness

231
00:22:07,824 --> 00:22:08,784
in securing the title

232
00:22:08,824 --> 00:22:10,544
and making Quliang stronger and better.

233
00:22:10,544 --> 00:22:12,143
A stronger and better Mu.

234
00:22:13,904 --> 00:22:14,863
Only then,

235
00:22:16,584 --> 00:22:17,223
My Lingweil

236
00:22:17,223 --> 00:22:18,824
wouldn't be bullied by Cige'er.

237
00:22:20,784 --> 00:22:21,904
I'm begging you.

238
00:22:22,784 --> 00:22:23,904
I promise.

239
00:22:25,743 --> 00:22:29,263
I promise you everything.

240
00:22:29,343 --> 00:22:30,424
Rong.

241
00:22:30,424 --> 00:22:31,103
Lian'er.

242
00:22:37,904 --> 00:22:39,503
Remember what you've said.

243
00:22:43,424 --> 00:22:45,343
Remember.

244
00:22:59,824 --> 00:23:00,503
Rong.

245
00:23:02,784 --> 00:23:03,463
Lian'er.

246
00:23:05,024 --> 00:23:06,623
Remember what you've said.

247
00:23:12,143 --> 00:23:12,983
Remember.

248
00:23:25,743 --> 00:23:28,503
Why do you leave me behind?

249
00:23:35,103 --> 00:23:37,743
Why?

250
00:23:39,863 --> 00:23:40,383
Madam!

251
00:23:41,704 --> 00:23:42,424
-  Madam.
- Rong.

252
00:23:48,824 --> 00:23:49,503
Madam.

253
00:23:52,343 --> 00:23:55,983
Don't you want me anymore?

254
00:23:56,944 --> 00:23:59,503
You don't want me anymore.

255
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:29,983
Your Highness.

256
00:24:30,584 --> 00:24:31,623
You think she died

257
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,784
because you didn't help her.

258
00:24:34,944 --> 00:24:36,383
She hated you. She resented you.

259
00:24:36,904 --> 00:24:38,304
She'll never forgive you.

260
00:24:46,664 --> 00:24:47,383
My mother

261
00:24:49,184 --> 00:24:50,584
said nothing to me.

262
00:24:53,103 --> 00:24:54,503
She was already unconscious

263
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,880
when I arrived at Zhaohui Courtyard.

264
00:24:58,383 --> 00:24:59,304
She actually fell sick

265
00:24:59,304 --> 00:25:00,304
as soon as she knew

266
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,980
Lingwei was getting married.

267
00:25:02,664 --> 00:25:03,263
I got angry.

268
00:25:04,983 --> 00:25:06,503
Why wasn't I informed?

269
00:25:07,263 --> 00:25:08,064
Qiushi said

270
00:25:11,184 --> 00:25:12,743
mother allowed no one

271
00:25:13,664 --> 00:25:14,544
to say a word.

272
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,503
Before she lost consciousness,

273
00:25:16,503 --> 00:25:17,463
she allowed no one

274
00:25:18,024 --> 00:25:19,304
to step out of the courtyard.

275
00:25:20,824 --> 00:25:22,064
That's my mother.

276
00:25:25,343 --> 00:25:26,584
She's ruthless.

277
00:25:28,463 --> 00:25:29,623
She was dying.

278
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,863
She could either blame

279
00:25:34,103 --> 00:25:35,304
or reprimand me.

280
00:25:39,064 --> 00:25:39,944
She kept

281
00:25:39,944 --> 00:25:42,263
her son from seeing her.

282
00:25:46,784 --> 00:25:47,424
Your Highness.

283
00:25:47,983 --> 00:25:48,944
Had I known

284
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,503
she was critically ill,

285
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,540
I would've served tea
and medicine to her

286
00:25:54,544 --> 00:25:56,743
and cleaned her up in person

287
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,980
whether she accepted it or not.

288
00:25:59,904 --> 00:26:01,064
Even if she chased me out

289
00:26:01,584 --> 00:26:02,463
for a thousand times,

290
00:26:02,584 --> 00:26:04,263
I would've held on until the end.

291
00:26:06,103 --> 00:26:06,863
It's not

292
00:26:09,184 --> 00:26:10,503
about forgiveness.

293
00:26:15,664 --> 00:26:16,304
It's

294
00:26:19,503 --> 00:26:21,664
about having no regrets in my life,

295
00:26:25,263 --> 00:26:26,343
unlike now.

296
00:26:37,064 --> 00:26:37,623
Qinglian.

297
00:26:38,824 --> 00:26:40,263
There're always flaws in life.

298
00:26:41,503 --> 00:26:43,343
If none of us can stop it,

299
00:26:45,263 --> 00:26:46,544
let's fill it inch by inch

300
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:49,223
by doing our best

301
00:26:52,784 --> 00:26:54,544
in our remaining lives.

302
00:27:00,223 --> 00:27:01,623
Don't worry, Rong.

303
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:05,784
I'll make Quliang stronger

304
00:27:07,024 --> 00:27:08,103
with His Highness.

305
00:27:14,064 --> 00:27:15,343
I'll protect Lingwei.

306
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,680
(Wild pansy and stone)

307
00:28:16,544 --> 00:28:17,983
Your Highness. Lv Beiyi is here.

308
00:28:18,544 --> 00:28:19,263
Leave us.

309
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,383
Yes, Your Highness.

310
00:28:28,383 --> 00:28:29,304
This

311
00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:32,503
was written by my father in person.

312
00:28:34,623 --> 00:28:35,424
Do you know

313
00:28:36,664 --> 00:28:37,544
what it implies?

314
00:28:37,944 --> 00:28:39,024
Wild pansy is a plant.

315
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,270
A stone that looks like jade is a stone.

316
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,270
- It implies that...
- It implies that...

317
00:28:45,263 --> 00:28:47,024
My father kept every plant and stone

318
00:28:47,343 --> 00:28:48,424
of Quliang in his mind.

319
00:28:50,024 --> 00:28:51,304
I thought so at first.

320
00:28:53,143 --> 00:28:54,343
Only today

321
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:58,143
I truly understand
my father's intention.

322
00:29:06,623 --> 00:29:07,863
You've worked hard this time.

323
00:29:08,184 --> 00:29:09,304
I'll reward you handsomely.

324
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,024
I don't dare to take credit

325
00:29:13,424 --> 00:29:14,664
after being defeated by Cige'er.

326
00:29:14,904 --> 00:29:15,743
Defeated?

327
00:29:17,304 --> 00:29:18,424
I'm not stupid.

328
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,263
Cige'er wouldn't have sought truce

329
00:29:20,263 --> 00:29:21,584
if you didn't win

330
00:29:22,143 --> 00:29:24,383
all three previous battles.

331
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:26,904
I've sent someone

332
00:29:27,263 --> 00:29:28,664
to investigate the case of the bran.

333
00:29:29,263 --> 00:29:30,463
I'll give you and Mu Tianshu

334
00:29:30,463 --> 00:29:31,223
an explanation.

335
00:29:31,784 --> 00:29:32,623
It seems

336
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,040
you have guessed
who the mastermind is.

337
00:29:36,064 --> 00:29:37,743
I don't want guessing,

338
00:29:38,503 --> 00:29:39,424
but evidence.

339
00:29:42,664 --> 00:29:44,304
I won't be a worthy opponent

340
00:29:44,424 --> 00:29:46,024
if I can't get the evidence!

341
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,343
Your Highness, you don't have to take

342
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,700
senior princess consort's words
of disappointment to heart.

343
00:30:03,824 --> 00:30:04,584
She

344
00:30:06,024 --> 00:30:06,784
was right.

345
00:30:07,343 --> 00:30:08,299
I thought

346
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,270
Quliang had prosperous people
and strong soldiers.

347
00:30:10,784 --> 00:30:11,743
The war against Cige'er

348
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:13,463
is a wake-up call.

349
00:30:16,223 --> 00:30:17,184
From now on,

350
00:30:17,503 --> 00:30:19,184
I'll take it as a warning.

351
00:30:20,824 --> 00:30:21,944
A few years

352
00:30:22,223 --> 00:30:23,503
to a decade.

353
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:26,424
I'll do my utmost.

354
00:30:27,343 --> 00:30:29,704
I'll be a great master of Quliang.

355
00:30:30,544 --> 00:30:32,064
Your Highness, you have to.

356
00:30:33,343 --> 00:30:34,743
In addition to the aforementioned,

357
00:30:35,944 --> 00:30:37,383
I'm afraid there is another reason.

358
00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:39,544
Your Highness,

359
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,270
you're entrusted with a secret mission.

360
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:48,223
You said

361
00:30:48,584 --> 00:30:50,704
(Wild pansy and stone)
wild pansy and the stone

362
00:30:51,143 --> 00:30:52,824
aren't just plants and stone in Quliang.

363
00:30:53,304 --> 00:30:53,983
I've finally

364
00:30:56,863 --> 00:30:57,904
figured it out.

365
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:11,926
(Diligent)

366
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,670
The late prince spent 40 years
to establish Quliang

367
00:31:14,904 --> 00:31:18,020
so that he could send troops to
rescue the Emperor one day.

368
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:35,103
Zhimei.

369
00:31:36,904 --> 00:31:38,184
Why are you still up?

370
00:31:39,544 --> 00:31:40,184
It's late.

371
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,780
You haven't gone to bed too.

372
00:31:47,343 --> 00:31:48,343
I was waiting for you.

373
00:32:02,584 --> 00:32:04,064
Why are you holding the poison?

374
00:32:15,904 --> 00:32:17,343
Tomorrow is the coronation ceremony.

375
00:32:19,584 --> 00:32:20,944
I would rather kill myself

376
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:23,263
than being killed by Lianxin.

377
00:32:26,584 --> 00:32:27,463
It's you.

378
00:32:29,704 --> 00:32:31,184
You tampered with the provision.

379
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:32,983
You hadn't stopped at all.

380
00:32:33,904 --> 00:32:35,223
Why did you do that?

381
00:32:36,263 --> 00:32:37,503
I told you

382
00:32:37,503 --> 00:32:38,904
everything was well arranged.

383
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:40,904
Why did you act willfully

384
00:32:40,904 --> 00:32:41,743
without my knowledge?

385
00:32:51,983 --> 00:32:52,704
Surprisingly,

386
00:32:53,784 --> 00:32:55,584
I've become an outsider

387
00:32:57,784 --> 00:32:59,503
despite being your wife for years.

388
00:33:08,664 --> 00:33:09,383
My wife?

389
00:33:15,143 --> 00:33:15,784
Yes.

390
00:33:17,904 --> 00:33:19,024
My father left me in the cold

391
00:33:20,304 --> 00:33:22,383
11 years ago
due to the incident at the armoury.

392
00:33:23,343 --> 00:33:25,184
When you abandoned me
as if I was a rag

393
00:33:25,184 --> 00:33:26,720
and turned to support my eighth brother,

394
00:33:28,184 --> 00:33:30,383
did you think of yourself as your wife?

395
00:33:33,064 --> 00:33:34,184
For the past 20 years,

396
00:33:34,343 --> 00:33:35,343
I love you

397
00:33:35,343 --> 00:33:36,184
genuinely.

398
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,270
All you want is to become
the princess consort!

399
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:39,503
When you ignored

400
00:33:39,503 --> 00:33:40,743
and trampled on me mercilessly,

401
00:33:41,904 --> 00:33:44,024
did you think of me as your wife?

402
00:33:49,784 --> 00:33:50,463
Young Master.

403
00:33:53,223 --> 00:33:54,904
Are you talking to me?

404
00:33:55,103 --> 00:33:55,503
Yes!

405
00:33:55,904 --> 00:33:57,503
This is how I want to talk to you!

406
00:33:57,584 --> 00:33:58,143
Don't forget

407
00:33:58,263 --> 00:33:59,424
I'm the head

408
00:33:59,424 --> 00:34:00,343
of this household!

409
00:34:00,544 --> 00:34:01,263
You're

410
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:03,503
just a woman of mine!

411
00:34:15,903 --> 00:34:16,943
Wife?

412
00:34:19,663 --> 00:34:21,824
How are we husband and wife?

413
00:34:25,304 --> 00:34:28,223
Husband and wife who soar together?

414
00:34:31,304 --> 00:34:34,824
Husband and wife who exchange hearts?

415
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:39,263
Deeply connected husband and wife?

416
00:34:42,624 --> 00:34:43,584
No.

417
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:47,104
We're husband and wife who fly away

418
00:34:48,423 --> 00:34:51,943
separately when a disaster strikes.

419
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,792
(Quiet Thinking)

420
00:35:21,824 --> 00:35:22,463
Madam.

421
00:35:22,903 --> 00:35:24,304
Tomorrow is the coronation ceremony.

422
00:35:25,263 --> 00:35:26,423
Rest early.

423
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:28,384
Yes.

424
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,784
I'll be the princess consort tomorrow.

425
00:35:34,024 --> 00:35:35,463
I wonder if anyone will still come

426
00:35:37,903 --> 00:35:39,544
to greet me after that.

427
00:35:40,584 --> 00:35:41,663
You're confused.

428
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:44,540
The incident of the attire with
Luo Qinglian's has been settled.

429
00:35:44,544 --> 00:35:45,943
No one is in a position to compete

430
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,183
with you anymore after
the bran incident.

431
00:35:48,784 --> 00:35:50,983
You'll be the princess consort
tomorrow onwards.

432
00:35:52,223 --> 00:35:53,104
Princess consort?

433
00:35:55,544 --> 00:35:57,024
A pathetic princess consort.

434
00:35:57,024 --> 00:35:57,983
What is the point?

435
00:35:59,144 --> 00:36:00,423
An empty title.

436
00:36:01,144 --> 00:36:03,784
I cannot compare to the one who lives in
His Highness' heart.

437
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:06,183
Even when

438
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,703
she was sent to Correctional Institution

439
00:36:09,624 --> 00:36:12,144
and she disobeyed His Highness,

440
00:36:12,423 --> 00:36:14,943
His Highness pampered her

441
00:36:15,624 --> 00:36:17,503
and missed her

442
00:36:17,824 --> 00:36:19,183
as usual.

443
00:36:30,304 --> 00:36:30,784
Madam.

444
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:33,743
You have a guest.

445
00:36:34,144 --> 00:36:35,384
Who would come so late?

446
00:36:40,477 --> 00:36:44,868
(Qihe's 49th year
Coronation ceremony of Prince An of Quliang)

447
00:36:54,064 --> 00:36:55,743
An edict to Prince An.

448
00:37:07,703 --> 00:37:08,784
The Emperor decrees.

449
00:37:09,223 --> 00:37:11,024
(Lord Rui's Mansion)
The late Prince An, He Yunshuo,

450
00:37:11,024 --> 00:37:11,304
(Lord Rui's Mansion)

451
00:37:11,304 --> 00:37:13,903
(Lord Rui's Mansion)
put in painstaking efforts

452
00:37:14,503 --> 00:37:15,344
to have created

453
00:37:15,344 --> 00:37:17,463
the prosperous Quliang.

454
00:37:17,983 --> 00:37:19,824
Now that He Lianxin inherits

455
00:37:19,824 --> 00:37:20,784
the title,

456
00:37:21,304 --> 00:37:23,903
all officers in Quliang
should serve him faithfully

457
00:37:24,064 --> 00:37:25,304
and play their parts

458
00:37:25,703 --> 00:37:27,144
to be worthy of the Emperor's trust.

459
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:30,304
(Memorial tablets of He's ancestor)
The decree is announced to all.

460
00:37:30,703 --> 00:37:31,903
The end.

461
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:32,983
Yes, Your Majesty.

462
00:37:33,663 --> 00:37:35,663
Thank you, Your Majesty.

463
00:37:57,223 --> 00:37:58,784
His Highness' order!

464
00:38:03,344 --> 00:38:05,480
External management must
depend on internal function.

465
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:07,943
Both should be compatible.

466
00:38:08,503 --> 00:38:10,663
It's better to be in the right position.

467
00:38:13,663 --> 00:38:16,544
Greetings, Prince An.

468
00:38:22,784 --> 00:38:25,903
- Congratulations, Your Highness.
- Congratulations, Your Highness.

469
00:38:25,983 --> 00:38:28,544
- We'll play our parts
- We'll play our parts

470
00:38:28,544 --> 00:38:30,320
- and serve you fully.
- and serve you fully.

471
00:38:41,304 --> 00:38:42,223
Rise.

472
00:38:47,624 --> 00:38:50,104
I'm conferred by the Emperor

473
00:38:50,423 --> 00:38:51,584
and on my father's bequest

474
00:38:52,064 --> 00:38:53,864
to take over Quliang.

475
00:38:54,304 --> 00:38:55,024
I'll depend

476
00:38:55,903 --> 00:38:57,263
on you all from now on.

477
00:38:58,983 --> 00:39:01,223
He Lianxiu. He Lianyi.

478
00:39:07,703 --> 00:39:08,943
- Yes.
- Yes.

479
00:39:11,703 --> 00:39:14,784
(Royal edict)
I've asked for a royal edict

480
00:39:23,384 --> 00:39:25,104
to appoint He Lianxiu
as Lord Li

481
00:39:25,304 --> 00:39:27,144
to supervise administrative affairs.

482
00:39:29,104 --> 00:39:31,263
He Lianyi will be appointed
as Lord Yi

483
00:39:31,384 --> 00:39:33,183
to supervise military affairs.

484
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,100
- Thank you, His Majesty.
- Thank you, His Majesty.

485
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,780
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

486
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,270
- Your Highness, you're brilliant.
- Your Highness, you're brilliant.

487
00:39:40,663 --> 00:39:41,903
I'm brilliant?

488
00:39:43,463 --> 00:39:44,304
I'm not even close!

489
00:39:45,223 --> 00:39:46,903
Someone actually mixed bran

490
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,144
in the army provisions

491
00:39:48,144 --> 00:39:49,503
during the war against Cige'er

492
00:39:49,503 --> 00:39:51,024
under my nose

493
00:39:51,743 --> 00:39:53,784
and nearly killed my army

494
00:39:54,344 --> 00:39:55,903
and ruined Quliang.

495
00:39:56,024 --> 00:39:57,183
There was an unfaithful

496
00:39:57,223 --> 00:39:57,903
and unrighteous

497
00:39:57,903 --> 00:39:59,864
officer under my rule.

498
00:40:00,624 --> 00:40:02,183
How dare you say I'm brilliant!

499
00:40:03,663 --> 00:40:05,743
I sent someone to investigate it

500
00:40:05,943 --> 00:40:06,903
day and night.

501
00:40:12,223 --> 00:40:12,903
The outcome

502
00:40:14,423 --> 00:40:15,663
is in this letter.

503
00:40:16,463 --> 00:40:18,544
I haven't opened the letter

504
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,460
so that I can find out
who the officer is

505
00:40:20,784 --> 00:40:22,703
with all of you

506
00:40:23,544 --> 00:40:24,864
today at the coronation ceremony.

507
00:40:25,304 --> 00:40:26,624
Who is the sinner?

508
00:40:34,983 --> 00:40:37,824
Primary Consort Fang has been
named the princess consort.

509
00:40:53,703 --> 00:40:56,384
Side Consort Mu as
side princess consort.

510
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,420
(Side Consort Luo as
side princess consort.)

511
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,024
Side Consort Luo...

512
00:41:09,024 --> 00:41:10,104
Hold on, Ms. Ma.

513
00:41:14,703 --> 00:41:15,144
Ms. Ma.

514
00:41:15,263 --> 00:41:15,983
What is going on?

515
00:41:16,384 --> 00:41:18,024
The bran incident has been investigated.

516
00:41:18,624 --> 00:41:20,503
The one who mixed bran
in the army provisions

517
00:41:20,703 --> 00:41:22,304
was Madam Lian's father,

518
00:41:22,304 --> 00:41:23,304
(The head is Luo Rongyu.)

519
00:41:23,304 --> 00:41:24,104
Luo Rongyu.

520
00:41:32,304 --> 00:41:34,903
It's simple if you don't want to be
a pathetic princess consort.

521
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:36,784
Just get rid

522
00:41:36,784 --> 00:41:38,743
of the person loved, protected

523
00:41:39,144 --> 00:41:41,223
and kept in His Highness' mind.

524
00:41:41,824 --> 00:41:43,663
I heard that your younger brother,
Fang Erge,

525
00:41:43,663 --> 00:41:44,663
investigated

526
00:41:45,344 --> 00:41:47,104
the bran incident.

527
00:41:58,223 --> 00:41:58,784
This can't be.

528
00:41:59,463 --> 00:42:00,304
