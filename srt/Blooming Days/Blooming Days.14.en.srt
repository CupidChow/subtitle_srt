00:02:01,577 --> 00:02:02,618
Lian'er,

18
00:02:04,137 --> 00:02:04,978
don't blame me.

19
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:08,658
I'm now in the outcast status.

20
00:02:09,618 --> 00:02:11,738
I... I can't burden you.

21
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:14,617
Don't blame me.

22
00:02:17,617 --> 00:02:18,857
Don't blame me.

24
00:02:31,538 --> 00:02:35,417

00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:54,298
He Lianxin,

26
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:57,497
I...

27
00:02:58,777 --> 00:03:01,057
I want to tear off

28
00:03:01,818 --> 00:03:03,977
your mask.

29
00:03:04,938 --> 00:03:07,258
How many masks have you worn, after all?

30
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:09,658
He Lianxin.

31
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:20,857
It's so strong.

32
00:03:23,018 --> 00:03:26,977
You say, are you truly heartless?

33
00:03:33,098 --> 00:03:34,417
I think it's true.

34
00:03:36,577 --> 00:03:40,137
Is your mask real or fake?

35
00:03:46,697 --> 00:03:49,337
Is your smile real?

36
00:03:51,538 --> 00:03:54,577
Is your kindness genuine?

37
00:03:56,738 --> 00:03:57,538
Have a drink.

38
00:04:01,538 --> 00:04:02,137
Have a drink.

39
00:04:13,617 --> 00:04:14,658
Ms. Lian, are you awake?

40
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:21,578
Where is this?

41
00:04:21,578 --> 00:04:22,777
This is Qiege Hall.

42
00:04:27,578 --> 00:04:28,698
Why are you here?

43
00:04:28,698 --> 00:04:30,557
In the morning, Young Master Xin
sent someone to get me,

44
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:31,658
saying that you were drunk.

45
00:04:32,297 --> 00:04:33,057
Ms. Lian,

46
00:04:33,297 --> 00:04:34,578
how did you end up drinking so much?

47
00:05:01,297 --> 00:05:02,177
I want to drink more.

48
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:04,978
You can't drink this.

49
00:05:06,698 --> 00:05:07,297
Come.

50
00:05:07,617 --> 00:05:08,737
I need a drink.

51
00:05:08,737 --> 00:05:09,818
Drink some water.

52
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:12,658
Water? I don't want water.

53
00:05:13,337 --> 00:05:13,938
This is alcohol.

54
00:05:14,617 --> 00:05:15,378
This is alcohol?

55
00:05:15,378 --> 00:05:16,297
Come, have some alcohol.

56
00:05:20,978 --> 00:05:22,698
This alcohol has no taste.

57
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,617
I want to drink this.

58
00:05:23,617 --> 00:05:25,897
You can't drink this, you can't drink.

59
00:05:27,497 --> 00:05:28,538
Can't drink.

60
00:05:29,617 --> 00:05:31,337
You're not letting me drink anything.

61
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,138
If you won't let me drink,

62
00:05:33,617 --> 00:05:34,457
then I'll

63
00:05:36,217 --> 00:05:37,057
go to sleep.

64
00:05:46,017 --> 00:05:46,858
Let's go back.

65
00:05:47,617 --> 00:05:48,497
There's still food here.

66
00:05:48,497 --> 00:05:49,337
No, no, not eating it.

67
00:05:50,337 --> 00:05:51,337
Let me first make his bed.

68
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:54,217
It's a pity not to eat.

69
00:06:05,737 --> 00:06:07,378
He Lianxin,

70
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:10,777
are you real or fake?

71
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:17,538
Girl,

72
00:06:19,737 --> 00:06:20,617
don't hate me.

73
00:06:22,017 --> 00:06:23,378
Out of all the people in the world,

74
00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:25,897
the last thing I want
is for you to hate me.

75
00:06:27,177 --> 00:06:28,138
Do you know that?

76
00:06:40,998 --> 00:06:41,737
Dongli, let's go back.

77
00:06:41,737 --> 00:06:43,777
Ms. Lian, it seems like
the Young Master Xin left you this.

78
00:07:03,698 --> 00:07:05,778
(Since you have no interest
in the felicity of husband and wife)

79
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:08,258
(I will grant you a carefree life.)

80
00:07:09,297 --> 00:07:12,017
(From now on,
we'll each follow our own paths.)

81
00:07:12,737 --> 00:07:13,858
(A gentleman's agreement)

82
00:07:15,217 --> 00:07:16,378
(should not be breached.)

83
00:07:25,857 --> 00:07:28,057
(Xiu's Residence)

84
00:07:30,337 --> 00:07:30,777
Get out!

85
00:07:30,897 --> 00:07:31,578
Didn't I say it?

86
00:07:31,578 --> 00:07:32,337
Don't come in!

87
00:07:35,418 --> 00:07:36,017
Lianxiu.

88
00:07:39,337 --> 00:07:39,858
Zhimei.

89
00:07:41,217 --> 00:07:42,098
It seems like you

90
00:07:42,098 --> 00:07:43,698
are angry with
the heir and Lianxin again.

91
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,177
How do you know that?

92
00:07:45,858 --> 00:07:47,538
You just returned
from your father's mansion.

93
00:07:48,617 --> 00:07:49,698
What else could it be?

94
00:07:53,258 --> 00:07:54,017
Yeah.

95
00:07:54,897 --> 00:07:56,138
Today in the Hall,

96
00:07:56,457 --> 00:07:57,818
they sing the same tune.

97
00:07:58,658 --> 00:07:59,737
No matter what I said,

98
00:08:00,057 --> 00:08:01,777
they forcefully suppressed me.

99
00:08:02,497 --> 00:08:04,337
My father hasn't assigned me
any tasks for a long time.

100
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,897
Some who used to support me

101
00:08:07,457 --> 00:08:09,017
have already taken their side.

102
00:08:09,897 --> 00:08:10,858
At this rate,

103
00:08:11,297 --> 00:08:12,258
Quliang will soon have

104
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,098
no place for me.

105
00:08:13,698 --> 00:08:15,538
Father listens to them this much?

106
00:08:16,337 --> 00:08:17,017
Yeah.

107
00:08:17,777 --> 00:08:19,617
One is the apple of Father's eye,

108
00:08:20,897 --> 00:08:22,497
and the other has found
a powerful backer.

109
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,138
Even if Father is exceptionally wise,

110
00:08:25,897 --> 00:08:27,698
he can't help but show some favoritism.

111
00:08:29,938 --> 00:08:31,978
Lianxin has recently
achieved significant success,

112
00:08:33,017 --> 00:08:33,737
and his words

113
00:08:33,737 --> 00:08:34,938
always hit the crucial points.

114
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,470
Give him a place to stand
and he will move the world.

115
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:39,778
We need to find a way

116
00:08:40,537 --> 00:08:41,138
to deal with him.

117
00:08:43,778 --> 00:08:44,657
A way,

118
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,018
didn't you just say that earlier?

119
00:08:49,497 --> 00:08:51,018
A place to stand, and a lever.

120
00:09:07,857 --> 00:09:10,097
You can't put it down.
You've only taken a few bites.

121
00:09:12,657 --> 00:09:14,898
I can't eat.
How about giving it to Ranyun?

122
00:09:15,537 --> 00:09:16,338
No, no, no.

123
00:09:16,898 --> 00:09:18,737
I've lost 100 or 200 grams
when I was sick.

124
00:09:19,218 --> 00:09:20,857
You helped me gain
3.5 or 4 kilograms.

125
00:09:20,857 --> 00:09:21,818
I won't eat.

126
00:09:21,818 --> 00:09:22,778
I won't eat.

127
00:09:23,177 --> 00:09:25,097
Ms. Lian, you haven't been able
to eat these past few days.

128
00:09:25,138 --> 00:09:26,258
This won't do.

129
00:09:26,698 --> 00:09:28,338
Lianwei House is so quiet,

130
00:09:28,657 --> 00:09:29,857
and there's not much to do around.

131
00:09:30,617 --> 00:09:31,617
Eating a little more or less,

132
00:09:31,617 --> 00:09:32,578
it doesn't really matter.

133
00:09:32,818 --> 00:09:34,197
There were times
when it wasn't so quiet.

134
00:09:34,338 --> 00:09:36,057
As you insisted
on chasing Young Master Xin away,

135
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,938
he hasn't come back quite some time.

136
00:09:42,938 --> 00:09:43,857
I'll keep quiet.

137
00:09:44,737 --> 00:09:45,857
Be careful, all right?

138
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:48,497
That... Put it inside the house.

139
00:09:49,258 --> 00:09:51,218
Hurry up, be careful, everyone.

140
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,470
(Liuyun Cottage)
What are those people doing there?

141
00:09:53,938 --> 00:09:56,018
The Mansion of Prince An
is really well-informed.

142
00:09:56,578 --> 00:09:57,938
Just as two people left,

143
00:09:58,177 --> 00:09:59,417
another group arrived.

144
00:09:59,977 --> 00:10:01,057
Who's so blind?

145
00:10:01,177 --> 00:10:01,818
Sorry, I'm sorry.

146
00:10:01,857 --> 00:10:02,698
I didn't mean it.

147
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,057
Miss,

148
00:10:05,057 --> 00:10:06,497
my servant is quite careless

149
00:10:06,497 --> 00:10:07,880
(Nan Ruzhen)
and bumped into you.

150
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,270
(Consort Candidate)
Please forgive us.

151
00:10:11,218 --> 00:10:11,857
Look,

152
00:10:13,057 --> 00:10:15,177
even the fish at the bottom of the lake
got startled.

153
00:10:18,097 --> 00:10:19,258
Nothing interesting.

154
00:10:20,378 --> 00:10:21,578
Let's go. Let's go.

155
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,378
I am Nan Ruzhen,

156
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:54,338
greetings to Ms. Lian.

157
00:10:55,617 --> 00:10:56,378
You know me?

158
00:10:56,938 --> 00:10:59,578
I was quite anxious when I first
entered the Young Master Xin's Mansion,

159
00:11:00,258 --> 00:11:01,297
so I inquired

160
00:11:01,297 --> 00:11:02,597
about the situation in advance.

161
00:11:02,818 --> 00:11:05,097
I know about your past
with His Highness,

162
00:11:05,818 --> 00:11:06,818
and I also know

163
00:11:07,778 --> 00:11:09,258
that Young Master Xin
only has eyes for you.

164
00:11:09,898 --> 00:11:11,497
A woman that has
His Highness and Young Master Xin

165
00:11:11,657 --> 00:11:13,417
look at her with such regard

166
00:11:13,818 --> 00:11:15,497
must surely have
the appearance and demeanor

167
00:11:15,497 --> 00:11:16,297
that you possess.

168
00:11:18,258 --> 00:11:19,600
We are both servant-concubines.

169
00:11:20,018 --> 00:11:21,657
In the future,
you must never be so humble again.

170
00:11:22,617 --> 00:11:23,297
Sure.

171
00:11:24,297 --> 00:11:25,657
I'm quite unfamiliar with everything

172
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,060
since I just entered
the Young Master Xin's Mansion.

173
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,138
If you have the time, could you teach me?

174
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,097
I have something
to attend to with Madam Rui.

175
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:36,560
Another day, then.

176
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,617
Then I'll wait for you

177
00:11:37,617 --> 00:11:38,258
at Liuyun Cottage.

178
00:11:51,698 --> 00:11:52,417
She's very clever.

179
00:11:53,097 --> 00:11:53,898
She knows how to talk.

180
00:11:54,578 --> 00:11:55,898
She knows when to tell a lie

181
00:11:55,898 --> 00:11:56,938
and when to tell the truth.

182
00:11:57,977 --> 00:11:59,297
Some words that are clearly flattery

183
00:12:00,497 --> 00:12:01,458
will sound especially sincere

184
00:12:01,778 --> 00:12:02,898
when she says them.

185
00:12:05,138 --> 00:12:06,378
I hope it's just me overthinking.

186
00:12:13,177 --> 00:12:15,057
It's on fire, it's on fire!

187
00:12:15,537 --> 00:12:16,258
Ms. Lian, be careful.

188
00:12:17,378 --> 00:12:18,018
Where is the fire?

189
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:19,258
Qie... Qiege Hall.

190
00:12:23,737 --> 00:12:24,840
Hurry, put out the fire!

191
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,560
It's on fire!

192
00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:27,938
Bring another bucket.
Go get another bucket of water.

193
00:12:28,698 --> 00:12:30,578
- Hurry, hurry!
- Get another bucket of water quickly, go!

194
00:12:30,578 --> 00:12:31,778
Bring another bucket of water!

195
00:12:31,778 --> 00:12:32,938
Get a bigger bucket!

196
00:12:33,698 --> 00:12:34,698
Someone, come quickly!

197
00:12:35,617 --> 00:12:36,698
Hurry, hurry!

198
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:37,857
It's on fire!

199
00:12:37,938 --> 00:12:38,977
Water, quickly!

200
00:12:39,537 --> 00:12:40,657
Hurry, get water!

201
00:12:42,378 --> 00:12:43,258
Quick, bring the water!

202
00:12:43,537 --> 00:12:44,438
Where's the water? Hurry!

203
00:12:45,218 --> 00:12:45,778
Water!

204
00:12:46,018 --> 00:12:46,737
Hurry!

205
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:48,680
It's coming, it's coming!

206
00:12:50,698 --> 00:12:51,537
Hurry up!

207
00:12:53,138 --> 00:12:54,778
It's here, it's here!
The water is here!

208
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:56,617
Hurry!

209
00:12:57,857 --> 00:12:59,458
Hurry, hurry, get the water!

210
00:13:00,057 --> 00:13:00,938
It's coming, it's coming!

211
00:13:01,898 --> 00:13:04,218
- Quick!
- Bring more man!

212
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,458
- Young Master.
- Let's go!

213
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,200
Finally, you're back.

214
00:14:16,297 --> 00:14:17,578
The fire started for no reason.

215
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,177
It was you who helped
with the fire just now.

216
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:22,497
What's your name?

217
00:15:24,898 --> 00:15:25,417
Ms. Lian,

218
00:15:27,057 --> 00:15:28,818
during the day
when Qiege Hall caught fire,

219
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:30,177
I met someone

220
00:15:30,177 --> 00:15:31,177
who seemed to be the arsonist.

221
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:32,698
Since it was just speculation,

222
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:33,938
I didn't mention it.

223
00:15:34,578 --> 00:15:35,617
While sending the cloak

224
00:15:35,617 --> 00:15:36,297
I ran into her again.

225
00:15:36,617 --> 00:15:38,138
So I followed her to her residence,

226
00:15:44,218 --> 00:15:45,297
(and found that her owner is)

227
00:15:46,297 --> 00:15:46,977
(Nan Ruzhen.)

228
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:01,458
Ms. Lian.

229
00:16:02,057 --> 00:16:03,537
Ms. Lian, are you here
to find Young Master?

230
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:04,778
There's something

231
00:16:04,778 --> 00:16:05,698
Young Master Xin must know.

232
00:16:06,018 --> 00:16:07,177
Please announce it to him.

233
00:16:07,338 --> 00:16:08,177
Of course.

234
00:16:08,537 --> 00:16:09,617
He will be thrilled

235
00:16:09,737 --> 00:16:10,698
to know that you've come.

236
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:11,177
Hold on.

237
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:21,818
Lian...

238
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:28,617
Is there someone inside?

239
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:31,737
It's her.

240
00:16:32,377 --> 00:16:34,280
(Nan Ruzhen's Maid, Jianyu)
Do you have any business here?

241
00:16:34,938 --> 00:16:36,270
I have to report to the Young Master Xin.

242
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:39,857
Young Master Xin is in the mood right now.

243
00:16:40,097 --> 00:16:40,818
Don't disturb him.

244
00:16:42,857 --> 00:16:43,617
Just let me in.

245
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,218
If you have any business,

246
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:46,778
I can help relay the message.

247
00:16:54,297 --> 00:16:55,458
It is widely known

248
00:16:55,578 --> 00:16:57,018
that Young Master Xin brought Ms. Lian

249
00:16:57,378 --> 00:16:58,938
from the Young Master Zuo's Mansion.

250
00:17:00,737 --> 00:17:01,537
Moreover,

251
00:17:03,097 --> 00:17:04,378
I have already seen Ms. Lian.

252
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:08,378
So...

253
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:10,938
What did she say?

254
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:13,777
She didn't say anything.

255
00:17:14,657 --> 00:17:16,137
But the moment I saw her,

256
00:17:16,377 --> 00:17:17,777
I knew the rumors were not wrong.

257
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:20,137
Rumors?

258
00:17:21,297 --> 00:17:21,978
What rumors

259
00:17:23,057 --> 00:17:24,098
are you talking about?

260
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,137
Ms. Lian is remarkably
elegant and graceful,

261
00:17:27,738 --> 00:17:28,938
simple and unworldly,

262
00:17:29,698 --> 00:17:30,897
smart without being pushy,

263
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,657
resilient but not impatient.

264
00:17:33,338 --> 00:17:34,338
Such a woman

265
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:37,537
is worthy of all the affection.

266
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:44,978
Get up.

267
00:17:50,777 --> 00:17:51,938
Just let me

268
00:17:52,257 --> 00:17:53,897
have three drinks with you.

269
00:17:55,738 --> 00:17:57,377
This is a Western spirit.

270
00:17:57,657 --> 00:17:59,458
I'm afraid
one would get you intoxicated.

271
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:02,417
If I don't get drunk after ten glasses,

272
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,417
will you reward me?

273
00:18:05,978 --> 00:18:06,698
Alright.

274
00:18:06,978 --> 00:18:08,177
If you truly have that capacity,

275
00:18:08,858 --> 00:18:10,897
take drinking with me
for the entire night as a reward.

there is a servant-concubine outside

00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:15,897
who claims to be looking for you.

290
00:19:16,537 --> 00:19:17,098

Young Master Xin...

296
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:33,858
I know.

297
00:19:34,578 --> 00:19:35,137
It's fine.

298
00:19:36,177 --> 00:19:37,098
I'll wait for him then.

299
00:19:42,377 --> 00:19:44,297
I'm afraid you'll have to wait
for a long time.

300
00:19:44,657 --> 00:19:45,938
What's the point of this, Ms. Lian?

301
00:19:46,297 --> 00:19:47,218
You heard it too.

302
00:19:47,657 --> 00:19:48,338
Young Master Xin

303
00:19:48,377 --> 00:19:49,618
is quite fond of Ms. Zhen.

304
00:19:50,017 --> 00:19:51,498
I believe he will be busy
the whole night.

305
00:19:51,938 --> 00:19:53,417
If you have any urgent matters,

306
00:19:53,578 --> 00:19:54,578
you might as well inform me.

307
00:19:55,057 --> 00:19:56,397
When Young Master Xin wakes up tomorrow,

308
00:19:56,897 --> 00:19:58,657
I'll have Ms. Zhen inform him.

309
00:20:06,698 --> 00:20:07,338
(Yes,)

310
00:20:08,218 --> 00:20:09,098
(it's just a fire.)

311
00:20:10,738 --> 00:20:11,698
(When someone is in favor,)

312
00:20:12,537 --> 00:20:14,338
(an arson means nothing.)

313
00:20:37,498 --> 00:20:38,858
Just now you went to see Lianxin

314
00:20:38,897 --> 00:20:40,218
about her setting the fire.

315
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:41,498
Did you mention it?

316
00:20:42,218 --> 00:20:44,177
Nan Ruzhen setting the fire
is to get close to Young Master.

317
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,897
So why would I say anything?

318
00:20:48,137 --> 00:20:48,698
Am I

319
00:20:49,938 --> 00:20:51,417
forbidding her to get close to him?

320
00:20:54,017 --> 00:20:55,057
It sounds like

321
00:20:55,498 --> 00:20:56,618
you're jealous.

322
00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:01,818
You're overthinking it.

323
00:21:02,738 --> 00:21:04,777
You know the person in my heart
better than anyone else.

324
00:21:07,818 --> 00:21:08,978
I can't control my marriage,

325
00:21:10,297 --> 00:21:11,377
but I can keep my own heart

326
00:21:12,618 --> 00:21:14,218
for the one I want.

327
00:21:28,777 --> 00:21:29,377
Young Master.

328
00:21:31,818 --> 00:21:32,777
Young Master.

329
00:21:39,338 --> 00:21:40,137
Young Master.

330
00:21:43,498 --> 00:21:44,257
Girl,

331
00:21:45,218 --> 00:21:46,537
don't leave me.

332
00:21:47,537 --> 00:21:48,177
You...

333
00:21:49,738 --> 00:21:51,458
You've all gone.

334
00:21:52,618 --> 00:21:53,858
All gone.

335
00:21:54,578 --> 00:21:56,897
All gone. Everyone's left me.

336
00:22:01,818 --> 00:22:03,818
You've all left me.

337
00:22:07,057 --> 00:22:07,698
Young Master.

338
00:22:08,218 --> 00:22:09,458
You've all left me.

339
00:22:10,098 --> 00:22:10,978
Young Master.

340
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:12,818
Let's have another drink.

341
00:22:21,897 --> 00:22:22,578
Is he asleep?

342
00:22:24,057 --> 00:22:24,657
Yes.

343
00:22:25,818 --> 00:22:27,417
Indeed, just as the master predicted.

344
00:22:28,498 --> 00:22:29,417
Young Master Xin's Mansion

345
00:22:29,698 --> 00:22:31,377
will soon be entirely yours.

346
00:22:32,377 --> 00:22:33,818
But compared to Luo Qinglian,

347
00:22:35,017 --> 00:22:36,297
I'm afraid I'm not even close.

348
00:22:37,137 --> 00:22:38,218
So what?

349
00:22:39,657 --> 00:22:40,938
Luo Qinglian's heart

350
00:22:40,938 --> 00:22:42,297
is not with him at all.

351
00:22:42,618 --> 00:22:44,377
He won't be interested
for much longer.

352
00:22:44,978 --> 00:22:46,417
Is it true that Luo Qinglian's heart

353
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:50,297
is not really with him?

354
00:23:14,938 --> 00:23:17,057
Cheers, let's all drink!

355
00:23:17,618 --> 00:23:19,057
Your Highness, let's have a drink!

356
00:23:20,338 --> 00:23:22,320
- Your Highness, you're good with alcohol.
- It tastes great.

357
00:23:23,177 --> 00:23:24,417
Your Highness.

358
00:23:24,657 --> 00:23:25,818
Let's have another drink.

359
00:23:25,818 --> 00:23:27,297
Let's have another drink,
Your Highness.

360
00:23:30,177 --> 00:23:31,417
Thank you, Your Highness.

361
00:23:31,417 --> 00:23:32,098
Outrageous!

362
00:23:36,897 --> 00:23:37,858
All of you, get out!

363
00:23:38,657 --> 00:23:39,338
Drink...

364
00:23:41,938 --> 00:23:42,618
Great-uncle.

365
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,537
Great-uncle, why are you
such a wet blanket?

366
00:23:50,818 --> 00:23:52,257
It seems the rumors

367
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:55,297
about the heir's indulgence
in pleasure and debauchery

368
00:23:55,938 --> 00:23:57,017
are true.

369
00:23:58,338 --> 00:23:59,377
You worry too much.

370
00:24:00,818 --> 00:24:02,417
Father is treating me well now.

371
00:24:04,698 --> 00:24:05,417
Even better

372
00:24:06,218 --> 00:24:06,777
than before.

373
00:24:07,657 --> 00:24:09,297
Do you think
that's because of your efforts?

374
00:24:10,377 --> 00:24:11,098
I know.

375
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:12,858
It's Lianxin's.

376
00:24:13,657 --> 00:24:14,137
But

377
00:24:14,897 --> 00:24:16,417
Lianxin reports to me.

378
00:24:16,578 --> 00:24:17,338
His accomplishments

379
00:24:20,017 --> 00:24:21,017
are my accomplishments.

380
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:25,458
If I were to...

381
00:24:27,657 --> 00:24:29,377
If I had...

382
00:24:31,257 --> 00:24:33,897
If I had Lianxin gone east,

383
00:24:34,137 --> 00:24:34,777
Lianxin...

384
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:38,177
Lianxin wouldn't go west.

385
00:24:38,657 --> 00:24:39,377
I...

386
00:24:40,978 --> 00:24:42,537
If I had him gone south,

387
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:45,338
he... he wouldn't

388
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:46,738
go... go north.

389
00:24:46,738 --> 00:24:47,858
Your Highness.

390
00:24:48,218 --> 00:24:49,858
Your Highness.

391
00:24:50,377 --> 00:24:51,978
Why are you still so silly

392
00:24:51,978 --> 00:24:54,017
at this point?

393
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:56,738
How can I continue to help you?

394
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:05,017
You're hopeless.

395
00:25:10,698 --> 00:25:12,377
Madam Rui has rewarded you.

396
00:25:13,338 --> 00:25:15,458
A pair of ivory gold-carved ornaments
from the Jinxiu Pavilion.

397
00:25:16,978 --> 00:25:19,377
A pair of mountaintop lilac cloud
bottle gourds.

398
00:25:20,098 --> 00:25:23,377
A pair of golden headpieces
and four pieces of damask.

399
00:25:25,537 --> 00:25:27,377
Ms. Zhen, please accept the rewards.

400
00:25:28,297 --> 00:25:29,377
I, Nan Ruzhen,

401
00:25:30,698 --> 00:25:31,918
thank Madam Rui for her generosity.

402
00:25:32,578 --> 00:25:33,897
She just entered the mansion.

403
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:35,218
Does she deserve that?

404
00:25:36,657 --> 00:25:38,458
She has a face
in the Young Master's heart.

405
00:25:38,938 --> 00:25:39,618
Do you have that?

406
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:43,297
Su Nanchun. Su Nanchun.

407
00:25:44,017 --> 00:25:44,698
You're here in time.

408
00:25:44,858 --> 00:25:46,218
Water. Get me some water.

409
00:25:46,297 --> 00:25:47,698
Headache. Headache.

410
00:25:47,698 --> 00:25:48,938
Water, water...

411
00:25:51,057 --> 00:25:52,978
What... What's this?

412
00:25:53,537 --> 00:25:54,338
Rewards from Madam Rui.

413
00:25:54,657 --> 00:25:56,458
(Qiege Hall)
Congratulations, Young Master.

414
00:26:07,257 --> 00:26:07,897
Young Master.

415
00:26:21,098 --> 00:26:22,098
Madam Rui

416
00:26:22,738 --> 00:26:23,978
has always been thoughtful.

417
00:26:24,777 --> 00:26:26,578
I didn't expect her
to make a mistake this time.

418
00:26:26,858 --> 00:26:27,498
How can

419
00:26:27,498 --> 00:26:28,417
such a small place

420
00:26:28,417 --> 00:26:29,057
like Liuyun Cottage

421
00:26:29,057 --> 00:26:30,137
accommodate so many rewards?

422
00:26:30,417 --> 00:26:31,120
Spread the word.

423
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:35,297
Ruzhen is promoted
to an ordinary consort.

424
00:26:35,297 --> 00:26:35,978
Grant...

425
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:39,978
Grant the Jingshu Pavilion.

426
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:43,177
I

427
00:26:43,738 --> 00:26:45,078
thank Young Master Xin for your kindness.

428
00:26:48,297 --> 00:26:48,938
Rise.

429
00:26:50,377 --> 00:26:50,938
You may leave.

430
00:26:54,657 --> 00:26:56,377
Water, water, water.

431
00:26:57,818 --> 00:26:59,297
Being in the mansion for just one day,

432
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,157
and receiving such favor
from Young Master Xin

433
00:27:01,938 --> 00:27:03,338
is truly overwhelming.

434
00:27:03,618 --> 00:27:04,560
It's not because of you.

435
00:27:05,098 --> 00:27:05,938
It's just to have

436
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,978
some company for future drinking.

437
00:27:08,177 --> 00:27:09,017
Go back and pack up.

438
00:27:09,017 --> 00:27:09,657
Pack up, pack up.

439
00:27:26,137 --> 00:27:26,738
Su Nanchun.

440
00:27:30,897 --> 00:27:31,498
I am here.

441
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:34,578
Has Ms. Lian been here?

442
00:27:35,618 --> 00:27:36,618
Yes, she has been here.

443
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:38,978
At that time, Ms. Zhen was in the room.

444
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:41,417
It was... It was Jianyu who said...

445
00:27:41,417 --> 00:27:42,017
Young Master,

446
00:27:42,498 --> 00:27:43,938
I've reported it to you.

447
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:45,417
You said not to see her.

448
00:27:49,537 --> 00:27:50,218
It was her.

449
00:27:56,098 --> 00:27:56,978
She came here.

450
00:28:11,137 --> 00:28:11,777
Young Master,

451
00:28:12,137 --> 00:28:13,698
Ms. Lian is unwell.

452
00:28:13,897 --> 00:28:14,738
She hasn't gotten up yet.

453
00:28:15,897 --> 00:28:16,600
Doesn't need to.

454
00:28:16,777 --> 00:28:17,578
I just want to see her.

455
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:19,257
Ms. Lian said

456
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:20,338
she's not properly dressed,

457
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:21,578
afraid of offending you.

458
00:28:21,978 --> 00:28:23,377
She kindly asks you to come another day.

459
00:28:23,818 --> 00:28:24,377
Not offending.

460
00:28:24,498 --> 00:28:25,618
I offended her.

461
00:28:26,057 --> 00:28:27,177
Rejection to a rejection.

462
00:28:27,377 --> 00:28:27,777
It's fair.

463
00:28:31,017 --> 00:28:31,818
No, Young Master.

464
00:28:34,897 --> 00:28:35,698
Ms. Lian.

465
00:28:35,858 --> 00:28:37,017
We as servant-concubines

466
00:28:37,297 --> 00:28:38,698
have no right
to obstruct Young Master.

467
00:28:39,698 --> 00:28:40,938
Last night, it was my fault.

468
00:28:41,297 --> 00:28:42,897
I'll make it up to you.

469
00:28:43,338 --> 00:28:44,338
Please,

470
00:28:44,498 --> 00:28:46,257
don't blame Young Master for it.

471
00:28:50,137 --> 00:28:51,458
Ms. Lian is just sick.

472
00:28:51,858 --> 00:28:53,137
The way Ms. Zhen put it,

473
00:28:53,657 --> 00:28:54,777
it seems like she's deliberately

474
00:28:54,777 --> 00:28:55,618
not opening the door.

475
00:28:55,897 --> 00:28:57,417
Isn't it anger Young Master
for no reason?

476
00:28:58,257 --> 00:28:58,938
You are right.

477
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:00,537
I was overthinking.

478
00:29:02,777 --> 00:29:03,218
Alright.

479
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:04,578
Go and tell her.

480
00:29:07,738 --> 00:29:10,017
Whether she's sick or in a bad mood,

481
00:29:10,338 --> 00:29:11,498
I won't blame her.

482
00:29:11,878 --> 00:29:13,270
I'll wait till she recovers
if she's sick.

483
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:14,800
I'll wait till she calms
if she's angry.

484
00:29:15,098 --> 00:29:16,017
I waited for three months.

485
00:29:16,618 --> 00:29:17,458
A little while won't hurt.

486
00:29:18,377 --> 00:29:19,137
Anyway,

487
00:29:19,978 --> 00:29:20,818
if this door is not open,

488
00:29:21,098 --> 00:29:23,618
I won't leave Lianwei House today.

489
00:29:45,537 --> 00:29:46,338
Oh no, Young Master,

490
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:47,417
Ms. Lian has fainted.

491
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,057
She was fine,
how did she suddenly faint?

492
00:30:07,377 --> 00:30:08,417
Did you all not caring for her,

493
00:30:08,417 --> 00:30:09,057
and her meals?

494
00:30:09,257 --> 00:30:10,377
Ms. Lian's appetite

495
00:30:10,377 --> 00:30:11,858
hasn't been great recently,

496
00:30:12,257 --> 00:30:14,738
but it shouldn't have
caused her to faint.

497
00:30:15,218 --> 00:30:15,858
Great then.

498
00:30:16,537 --> 00:30:18,498
Perhaps she upset her stomach,
and have food poisoning.

499
00:30:22,098 --> 00:30:22,938
Is there no one capable

500
00:30:22,938 --> 00:30:24,297
in the entire Lianwei House?

501
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:26,297
If it's found it's because of you,

502
00:30:26,537 --> 00:30:27,618
I'll break your legs.

503
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:30,738
Young Master, have mercy!

504
00:30:30,738 --> 00:30:31,618
Don't be too hard on them.

505
00:30:35,618 --> 00:30:36,137
How is it?

506
00:30:39,177 --> 00:30:40,278
If you want to break one's legs,

507
00:30:41,017 --> 00:30:42,177
start by breaking your own.

508
00:30:43,498 --> 00:30:44,377
What do you mean?

509
00:30:48,618 --> 00:30:49,498
Ms. Lian is pregnant.

510
00:30:52,777 --> 00:30:55,498
Congratulations, Young Master!

511
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:09,897
Nicely trimmed, here's a reward.

512
00:31:10,338 --> 00:31:11,017
Thanks, Young Master.

513
00:31:13,177 --> 00:31:15,098
Nicely swept, here's a reward too.

514
00:31:15,858 --> 00:31:16,578
Thanks, Young Master.

515
00:31:16,657 --> 00:31:17,137
Each of you,

516
00:31:17,657 --> 00:31:18,618
take a look

517
00:31:18,698 --> 00:31:19,897
at the jewelry in your hands.

518
00:31:20,618 --> 00:31:21,137
See if it...

519
00:31:22,657 --> 00:31:24,177
Young Master, have mercy!

520
00:31:24,897 --> 00:31:26,618
A canal...

521
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,160
is formed when water comes.

522
00:31:28,537 --> 00:31:29,698
Water comes and brings a child.

523
00:31:29,938 --> 00:31:30,978
Rewards, here's a reward.

524
00:31:31,218 --> 00:31:32,578
There's rewards for everyone.

525
00:31:41,897 --> 00:31:42,657
He has left?

526
00:31:47,098 --> 00:31:49,017
He rewarded everyone in Lianwei House,

527
00:31:49,618 --> 00:31:50,338
but wasn't contented.

528
00:31:51,057 --> 00:31:52,177
Then he took Su Nanchun

529
00:31:52,818 --> 00:31:53,657
back to Qiege Hall.

530
00:31:59,057 --> 00:32:00,618
I've never seen him so happy before.

531
00:32:04,498 --> 00:32:05,218
What medicine is this?

532
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:06,738
Antiabortifacient.

533
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:10,320
I'm afraid it's bitter.

534
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,560
You were never afraid of bitterness.

535
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:14,738
Especially this is your foundation

536
00:32:14,738 --> 00:32:15,657
in the mansion.

537
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,098
Even if it's a bowl of Coptis chinensis,
you have to eat it.

538
00:32:22,978 --> 00:32:23,618
Yi,

539
00:32:25,057 --> 00:32:26,137
do you remember two years ago

540
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:28,137
when I saved a rabbit?

541
00:32:30,057 --> 00:32:30,978
That rabbit

542
00:32:31,738 --> 00:32:32,738
was hit by a carriage,

543
00:32:33,338 --> 00:32:34,938
and its internal organs
were severely damaged.

544
00:32:35,897 --> 00:32:37,738
You told me it couldn't be saved.

545
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,657
But I couldn't bear it.

546
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:40,657
I brought it back.

547
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:43,498
The two of us took care of it
for two days,

548
00:32:48,297 --> 00:32:49,257
but it still died.

549
00:32:51,098 --> 00:32:51,938
Do you remember

550
00:32:51,938 --> 00:32:53,017
what you told me afterwards?

551
00:32:55,338 --> 00:32:56,257
I told you

552
00:32:58,057 --> 00:32:59,338
that every moment of those two days,

553
00:32:59,338 --> 00:33:00,377
it felt worse than death.

554
00:33:01,297 --> 00:33:02,417
Your self-perceived kindness

555
00:33:04,257 --> 00:33:05,897
was only adding to its suffering.

556
00:33:16,657 --> 00:33:17,698
Just now, I was here.

557
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:20,338
I was lying here.

558
00:33:22,978 --> 00:33:24,098
I don't know why,

559
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:27,938
but I kept thinking about

560
00:33:30,657 --> 00:33:32,698
how Hui'er looked l
ying in a pool of blood.

561
00:33:34,498 --> 00:33:35,338
Yi,

562
00:33:37,578 --> 00:33:38,537
everyone

563
00:33:39,657 --> 00:33:40,257
in this mansion

564
00:33:40,897 --> 00:33:42,618
wants to have children.

565
00:33:42,657 --> 00:33:43,777
But who really understands

566
00:33:45,618 --> 00:33:47,338
that a child born in this mansion

567
00:33:48,098 --> 00:33:49,578
may not necessarily be a blessing?

568
00:33:51,618 --> 00:33:52,137
You want to...

569
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:02,338
I want to leave.

570
00:34:04,657 --> 00:34:05,657
What did you say you want?

571
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,298
You heard that.

572
00:34:18,337 --> 00:34:19,018
How dare you!

573
00:34:19,377 --> 00:34:20,897
Me, He Lianxin's blood
runs in the child.

574
00:34:21,417 --> 00:34:23,058
My blood runs in the child too,

575
00:34:23,377 --> 00:34:24,978
and I'm the child's biological mother.

576
00:34:25,458 --> 00:34:27,417
How dare you claim
that you are the child's mother?

577
00:34:38,778 --> 00:34:40,298
Whether you allow it or not,

578
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,617
this child is still mine,

579
00:34:46,377 --> 00:34:48,458
and I have a hundred ways

580
00:34:48,857 --> 00:34:49,857
to take him away.

581
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:55,938
You...

582
00:35:17,177 --> 00:35:17,657
Girl,

583
00:35:20,177 --> 00:35:21,377
do you hate me this much?

584
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:22,738
You not even give me

585
00:35:22,738 --> 00:35:24,120
the chance to raise our child together?

586
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,778
You must think

587
00:35:29,258 --> 00:35:30,137
I'm

588
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:32,377
the most cruel mother.

589
00:35:34,018 --> 00:35:35,377
But even if I'm cruel,

590
00:35:36,058 --> 00:35:37,258
I would never use a child

591
00:35:37,258 --> 00:35:38,538
as a means of revenge.

592
00:35:39,617 --> 00:35:40,298
I believe

593
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:42,018
that all mothers in the world

594
00:35:42,018 --> 00:35:42,657
want to protect

595
00:35:42,657 --> 00:35:43,577
their children.

596
00:35:43,817 --> 00:35:44,738
Believe me,

597
00:35:46,058 --> 00:35:47,018
this is the best way

598
00:35:47,018 --> 00:35:47,897
I can protect him.

599
00:35:54,577 --> 00:35:56,058
Young Master,
Young Master Yi is here.

600
00:35:56,298 --> 00:35:57,498
He has something to discuss about.

601
00:36:01,817 --> 00:36:03,218
Young Master, it's an urgent matter.

602
00:36:13,018 --> 00:36:13,617
Luo Qinglian.

603
00:36:14,738 --> 00:36:15,377
You,

604
00:36:16,097 --> 00:36:17,377
and everything about you,

605
00:36:17,377 --> 00:36:18,377
belong to me.

606
00:36:19,897 --> 00:36:20,817
Without my permission,

607
00:36:20,817 --> 00:36:22,018
without my permission!

608
00:36:22,817 --> 00:36:23,938
No one can take away

609
00:36:23,938 --> 00:36:24,817
the person I care most,

610
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:26,298
including yourself.

611
00:36:43,258 --> 00:36:44,018
Which reason is it?

612
00:36:46,058 --> 00:36:46,657
What?

613
00:36:50,218 --> 00:36:51,218
You want to leave

614
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:54,258
as you don't want
to be in the conflicts,

615
00:36:56,377 --> 00:36:57,377
or the child's father

616
00:36:57,377 --> 00:36:58,258
has hurt you?

617
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,258
Which one are you then?

618
00:37:08,617 --> 00:37:10,458
Are you Young Master Xin's adviser, Mr. Lv?

619
00:37:12,137 --> 00:37:12,978
Or are you

620
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:16,617
Yi who would risk your life for me?

621
00:37:24,377 --> 00:37:25,600
You should take the medicine first.

622
00:37:28,058 --> 00:37:29,377
I will always be with you,

623
00:37:30,938 --> 00:37:32,538
whether you choose to leave or stay.

624
00:37:33,538 --> 00:37:34,298
Tomorrow morning,

625
00:37:35,738 --> 00:37:36,498
it's your choice.

626
00:38:03,218 --> 00:38:03,778
Your Highness.

627
00:38:09,018 --> 00:38:10,458
I welcome the arrival of Your Highness.

628
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:14,218
Kneel.

629
00:38:22,337 --> 00:38:23,058
To reward.

630
00:38:26,097 --> 00:38:29,137
Grant two chefs for Ms. Lian.

631
00:38:29,498 --> 00:38:31,018
One silver-topped palanquin.

632
00:38:31,498 --> 00:38:32,617
Six porter for a palanquin.

633
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:35,698
Ten boxes of jewelry,
and ten chests of clothing.

634
00:38:37,817 --> 00:38:38,938
Thank you, Your Highness.

635
00:38:43,857 --> 00:38:45,538
But these gifts are too luxurious,

636
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:46,498
I cannot accept them.

637
00:38:47,897 --> 00:38:49,377
There are nothing too luxurious.

638
00:38:50,097 --> 00:38:50,938
I arrived in a hurry,

639
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:52,617
so Yu Dechang

640
00:38:53,337 --> 00:38:54,377
prepared them hastily.

641
00:38:56,698 --> 00:38:58,377
Ms. Lian, not showing gratitude
for the reward?

642
00:39:02,177 --> 00:39:02,938
Thanks, Your Highness.

643
00:39:04,538 --> 00:39:05,097
Get up.

644
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:14,617
Your Highness, do you have

645
00:39:15,538 --> 00:39:16,657
no matters to attend to today?

646
00:39:16,738 --> 00:39:17,577
Why not?

647
00:39:19,058 --> 00:39:20,058
Even if there are matters,

648
00:39:20,698 --> 00:39:22,097
I have to make a personal visit

649
00:39:22,538 --> 00:39:24,298
for this joyous occasion.

650
00:39:24,857 --> 00:39:25,498
Joyous occasion?

651
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:40,938
May I take Ms. Lian's pulse?

652
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,320
Congratulations, Your Highness.

653
00:40:04,417 --> 00:40:05,337
The pulse is steady.

654
00:40:05,617 --> 00:40:07,018
Ms. Lian's unborn child

655
00:40:07,177 --> 00:40:08,218
is very healthy.

656
00:40:08,857 --> 00:40:09,698
Congratulations, Father.

657
00:40:10,498 --> 00:40:11,058
You're

658
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:12,698
going to be a grandfather again.

659
00:40:15,778 --> 00:40:18,018
Yes, you're going
to have a grandson again.

660
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:20,377
Great.

661
00:40:22,538 --> 00:40:24,698
As long as it's healthy.

662
00:40:24,857 --> 00:40:26,177
I have a premonition

663
00:40:26,337 --> 00:40:27,018
that this child,

664
00:40:27,218 --> 00:40:28,577
it's definitely going to be a boy.
