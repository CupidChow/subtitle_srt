17
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,170
Lianxin.

18
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:57,980
Why?

19
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,890
Why wouldn't you

20
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,700
let your sister off?

21
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,420
Are you confused

22
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,610
from being too busy?

23
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,340
I don't understand what you mean.

24
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,140
Yuanxue has not
stepped out of the mansion.

25
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,400
Where would she get the poison from?

26
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,650
But you.

27
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,160
You were at
the Office of Medication last night.

28
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,650
And then went to Changze Courtyard.

29
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:18,780
Yes.

30
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,780
If Yuanxue died,

31
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,060
Father would punish me harshly.

32
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,580
That's why you wanted

33
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,810
to poison your sister to death?

34
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,340
You think

35
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,780
I tried to kill Yuanxue.

36
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,530
She is also my younger sister.

37
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:40,940
Lianxin.

38
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,530
If you have any proof,

39
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,450
you may imprison me now.

40
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,300
If you don't,

41
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,610
please never again

42
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,250
slander me.

43
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,700
I don't.

44
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,090
But heavens have it.

45
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,170
Because of the title of prince,
you lost your conscience.

46
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,340
But remember,

47
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,860
the heavens are watching.

48
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,250
Quliang will never

49
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,090
be yours.

50
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,650
The heavens are watching.

51
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,320
Your Highness.

52
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,895
(Qingkang Hall)

53
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,010
Your Highness.

54
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,610
Your Highness.

55
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,140
Lady Xue

56
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,500
is safe now.

57
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,370
No.

58
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,340
Lv Beiyi.

59
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,300
Lv Beiyi.

60
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,170
I don't want to marry.

61
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,250
I don't want...

62
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,610
I don't want to marry anyone else.

63
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,330
Lianxin.

64
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,930
Did you do your duty

65
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,860
well or badly?

66
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:03,810
Father.

67
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,930
As the person in charge
of sending off the bride,

68
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,650
I wasn't cautious enough.

69
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,530
I'm of course to be blamed.

70
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,140
You're right.

71
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,250
But you were decisive

72
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,980
and brought back Yuanxue.

73
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,530
You stood against all opinions

74
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,050
and saved her.

75
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,330
Your merits and demerits balanced out.

76
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,650
I shall

77
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,930
neither punish nor compliment you.

78
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,420
Raise.

79
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,020
Thank you, Father.

80
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,530
Lv Beiyi.

81
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,020
This is my second time seeing you.

82
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,860
The first time I saw you,

83
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,810
I gifted you a pariah.

84
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,620
For the second time,

85
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,900
what should I gift you?

86
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,530
Your Highness.

87
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,460
Perhaps you can bestow death upon me.

88
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,490
Are you afraid?

89
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,740
If I were afraid,

90
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,180
I wouldn't come here.

91
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,460
Very well.

92
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:15,770
Here, take a seat.

93
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,050
Have a meal with me.

94
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,120
Thank you, Your Highness.

95
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,210
You too, Lianxin.

96
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,810
Sit.

97
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,620
Take it easy.

98
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:40,930
Let's eat.

99
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,530
Eat.

100
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:51,930
Lv Beiyi.

101
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,700
Regarding this matter,

102
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,050
you first made a mistake,

103
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,930
then you gained a merit.

104
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,050
But the mistake you made

105
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,530
was too serious.

106
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,650
How

107
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,860
should I punish you?

108
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,090
I

109
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,620
of course can't be forgiven.

110
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,250
Of course you can't be forgiven.

111
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,050
Yuanxue is

112
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,460
my favourite only daughter.

113
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,620
But because of you,

114
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,930
she ignored me.

115
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,140
This is the first thing.

116
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,250
She is betrothed to Qi family.

117
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,740
But you broke into
the send-off ceremony forcefully.

118
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,980
You had no regards for He family's pride

119
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,050
and the good name of Yuanxue.

120
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,620
This is the second thing.

121
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,090
Right now,

122
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,580
I have to clarify to Qi family.

123
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,620
Clarify to myself.

124
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,250
However,

125
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,140
after all,

126
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,420
you rescued my daughter.

127
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,860
Today I should send you to your death

128
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,460
with this glass of alcohol.

129
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,090
Here.

130
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:17,980
What's wrong?

131
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,080
Didn't you say that you aren't afraid?

132
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,740
Thank you for your grace, Your Highness.

133
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,210
Don't drink!

134
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,300
Please have mercy, Father.

135
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,260
Let him live.

136
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:58,820
You're awake,

137
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,260
You can get off your bed now.

138
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,260
Since you're awake,

139
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,890
why don't you ask how embarrassed

140
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,420
Qi family is?

141
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,740
Why don't you ask

142
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,450
how much trouble I'm in?

143
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,500
Why don't you ask

144
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,090
how sad your mother is?

145
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,090
Yet you asked me to let him live.

146
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,980
Yuanxue.

147
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,300
Where did your heart go?

148
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,690
I know

149
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,090
that I'm very unfilial.

150
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,530
I can't ask for your forgiveness.

151
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,820
I just ask you

152
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,330
to let Lv Beiyi go.

153
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,860
If he insists on dying,

154
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,770
wouldn't that

155
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,890
change your mind?

156
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,060
No matter he lives or dies,

157
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,820
I'll never marry anyone else.

158
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,300
The son of Qi family
may be your top choice for my husband.

159
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,300
But he's not who I like.

160
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,450
Not now,

161
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,260
not in the future.

162
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,130
This is not your call to make.

163
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,300
Don't you think your suicide attempt

164
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,740
can threaten me.

165
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,570
Yu Dechang.

166
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,200
Yes, Your Highness.

167
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,640
Give him the alcohol.

168
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,300
Father.

169
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:58,860
Father.

170
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,500
Thank you for your false love, Lady Xue.

171
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,940
Please forget about me.

172
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,720
I wish you hundred years of health.

173
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,620
Don't drink it.

174
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,380
Your Highness.

175
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,800
Please have mercy, Your Highness.

176
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,650
Spare Lv Beiyi's life.

177
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,210
Luo Qinglian.

178
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,890
I've made up my mind on this matter.

179
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,450
Stop talking.

180
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,450
I don't expect you

181
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,130
to change your mind.

182
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,940
I just want to ask you

183
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,860
if your words count.

184
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,570
A gentleman
doesn't go back on his words.

185
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:58,860
This is the jade flute

186
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,530
of the late princess consort
that you gave me,

187
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,300
promising I can avoid death for life.

188
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,820
Now I boldly

189
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,690
pass the jade flute on to Lv Beiyi.

190
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,130
Luo Qinglian.

191
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,890
I bestowed this upon you.

192
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,530
But you didn't say

193
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,690
that I can't pass it on to others.

194
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,890
Please have mercy, Your Highness.

195
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,090
Spare Lv Beiyi's life.

196
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,300
Please have mercy, Father.

197
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,860
All of you are disobeying

198
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,980
my wish.

199
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,570
Am I wrong?

200
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,060
Am I wrong?

201
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,420
You're not wrong, Your Highness.

202
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,620
You're the head of Quliang.

203
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,770
You think about the honor of He family.

204
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,980
A marriage is arranged,
we can't back off.

205
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,530
But Lady Xue is a woman.

206
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,380
All she wants is
to have a harmonic family

207
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,570
and a normal marriage.

208
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:02,860
Your Highness.

209
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,060
The most touching thing on earth

210
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,380
is the simplest feeling

211
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,860
of ordinary people.

212
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,860
Although you're Prince An,

213
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,300
you're also a father.

214
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,130
No matter

215
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,420
what decision you make today,

216
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,090
you'll be thinking

217
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,320
about your daughter all the time.

218
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,450
Your daughter as a baby.

219
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,650
Your daughter when she called you

220
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,620
Father for the first time.

221
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,010
And your daughter,

222
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,570
who asked about your well-being.

223
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,690
And right now,

224
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,740
your daughter

225
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,440
who's extremely remorse and hopes

226
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,010
that her father can
condone her doing once again.

227
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,890
I only hope

228
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,130
that in the future

229
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,940
you won't regret

230
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,820
your decision today.

231
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:18,740
Yuanxue.

232
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,570
I ask you one last time.

233
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,530
Do you really

234
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,940
not want to marry Qi family

235
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,860
and only want to be an ordinary person?

236
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:30,940
Yes.

237
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,450
Please allow me, Father.

238
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,260
Okay.

239
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,570
I promise

240
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,300
to give you all the freedom

241
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,420
you want.

242
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,180
But from now on,

243
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,060
you'll no longer be my daughter.

244
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,500
Father.

245
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,690
Stop calling me.

246
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,570
The world is big,

247
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,450
you can go anywhere.

248
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,690
Thank you

249
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,300
for your upbringing, Father.

250
00:16:46,483 --> 00:16:50,135
(Mansion of Prince An)

251
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,300
Go to my house?

252
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,650
In this world

253
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,740
only where Lv Beiyi wants to go

254
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,330
is where Yuanxue wants to be.

255
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,060
No way.

256
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,450
Why?

257
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,300
Because of her,

258
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,030
you broke into the send-off
ceremony and snatched her.

259
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,520
You could even
drink poisonous alcohol for her.

260
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,890
Why won't you try

261
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:08,650
accepting the woman

262
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,810
who deeply loves you?

263
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,570
Because I'm not qualified.

264
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,050
Many years ago,

265
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,380
I heartlessly took advantage

266
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,660
of a woman who deeply loved me.

267
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,540
After I lost her, I knew

268
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,170
that what I gave away

269
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:28,620
wasn't just

270
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,540
this important person,

271
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,410
but also my heart.

272
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,930
How can a person without a heart

273
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,290
accept another person?

274
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,330
Yi, do you believe in fate?

275
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,780
Did I hear it wrong?

276
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,860
You believe in fate?

277
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:49,980
Yes.

278
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,540
I didn't believe it.

279
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,690
But right now I think

280
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,690
some encounters

281
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,140
are an indirect way

282
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,980
of fate that leads us

283
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,290
back to the right way.

284
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,090
For example,

285
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,900
He Lianxin and I.

286
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,500
Or

287
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,330
Yuanxue and you.

288
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,480
(Mansion of Prince An)
Even as a commoner woman,

289
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,020
(Mansion of Prince An)
my sister is still the prettiest one.

290
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,860
A commoner woman.

291
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,570
Father said the world is big,

292
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,780
and I can go anywhere.

293
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:25,620
But where

294
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,500
can I go?

295
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:31,810
Come on.

296
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,810
My place is very simple.

297
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,690
It isn't as well-equipped
as the Mansion of Prince An.

298
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,210
But it

299
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,290
is like home.

300
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:03,930
If you stay with me,

301
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:06,740
I'm afraid

302
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,050
you'll never have a luxury life again.

303
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,280
There's only simple food.

304
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,680
♪Strengthens my feelings for you♪

305
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,260
Luxury life isn't what I want.

306
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,740
Even if I have no shelter

307
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,050
and only have porridge to eat,

308
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,410
as long as I'm with you,

309
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,860
it's already enough for me.

But right now,

313
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,090
I can't give you anything.

314
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,140
Not love, not status.

315
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,690

clear enough when I took

320
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,330

Okay.

00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,140
I'll get the horse cart.

325
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,980
Lv Beiyi said he doesn't love me.

326
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,540
But I still follow him happily.

327
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,330
If it were back then,

328
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,140
I wouldn't be as free and easy.

329
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,330
The thing in here

330
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,380
is what I treasure.

331
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,810
If it were back then,

332
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,860
I might not be willing to give it up.

333
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:58,860
What about now?

334
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,500
(I'm just an infatuated person.)

335
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,140
I searched through
all the cosmetic shops in Quliang,

336
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,660
in order to find

337
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,570
a girl with fragrance.

338
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,140
Two days ago,

339
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,450
I saw a scholar in street

340
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,980
who searched through
all the cosmetic shops

341
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,260
to find

342
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,690
a girl who spent a night with him.

343
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,740
He has never seen her face.

344
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,020
He only remembered

345
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,620
the unique orchid scent on her.

346
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,020
That's the only clue

347
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,980
for him to find his loved one.

348
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,620
He's an infatuated person.

349
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,410
Therefore,

350
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,140
I'm not the only one

351
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,090
who is infatuated.

352
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,570
I'm also not the only one

353
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,780
who suffers for love.

354
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,410
Compared to this scholar,

355
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,290
compared to Lv Beiyi,

356
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,050
I'm way luckier.

357
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,690
I once thought,

358
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,290
I'll never see Lv Beiyi again.

359
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,050
Right now,

360
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,170
I can be by his side.

361
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,410
This...

362
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,780
This should be given

363
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,410
to the person
he wants to give it to the most.

364
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,450
Luo Qinglian.

365
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,380
This love

366
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,500
is something

367
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,980
I long my whole life but I can't get.

368
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,570
Please

369
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,860
take good care of it

370
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,780
and treasure it.

371
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,170
Yuanxue.

372
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,660
Yi has feelings.

373
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,450
He'll never miss

374
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,140
such a pure and kind person like you.

375
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,690
I believe,

376
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,170
there'll be a day

377
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,540
when he opens his heart.

378
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:48,627
(Xiyuan Gate)

379
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,500
You seem to be very happy.

380
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,570
Of course.

381
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,050
Someone took away my rival in love.

382
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,410
How can I not be happy?

383
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,290
Yuanxue.

384
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:01,330
My good sister.

385
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,410
Take him away, the further the better.

386
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,690
Sweet. Very sweet.

387
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,930
What are you talking about?

388
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,780
Talking about my wife,

389
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,620
who broke into the Mansion

390
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,620
to save the life

391
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,570
of another man.

392
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,930
Isn't this

393
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,090
act of love after the blow

394
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:28,980
sweet?

395
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,900
Real. So real.

396
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:33,780
What are you talking about?

397
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,410
The way you pretend to be jealous

398
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,020
looks so real.

399
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,810
Who said I'm pretending?

400
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,620
Didn't you ask me

401
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,450
to help beg

402
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,330
for Lv Beiyi's life?

403
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:47,740
Here.

404
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,450
Go to Lian

405
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,330
and ask her to come

406
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,410
with the jade flute

407
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,210
Father gifted her.

408
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,380
At this point,

409
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,210
that's the only thing
which can save Lv Beiyi.

410
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,120
Okay, Young Master.

411
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,050
Hold on.

412
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:58,930
Don't let her know

413
00:24:58,930 --> 00:24:59,860
that I told you to go.

414
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:00,980
Why?

415
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,050
This girl

416
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,260
is already out of control.

417
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,860
I don't want to spoil her further.

418
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,570
You get me.

419
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,320
I get it, Young Master.

420
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,570
I'll go there immediately.

421
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,660
You scared me, Young Master.

422
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,980
You rascal,

423
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,260
how dare you went against my order.

424
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,290
It's my bad.

425
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,480
Young Master, I thought about it.

426
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,050
It's a loss to not claim

427
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,810
your credit.

428
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,090
I'll give you credit after I kill you.

429
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:24,740
Young Master.

430
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,170
Young Master.

431
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,290
Young Master is right.

432
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:30,330
I'm out of control

433
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,660
because you spoiled me.

434
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,410
But pampering alone

435
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:34,660
doesn't make me arrogant.

436
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,210
I want to thank you.

437
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,450
Because you don't

438
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,020
just pamper me,

439
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,900
you also made me

440
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,410
understand the love.

441
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,020
- Su Nanchun.
- Another act of love,

442
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:49,860
which is sweeter.

443
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:56,858
(Xiu's Mansion)

444
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,810
The thing is now in Luo Qinglian's hand,

445
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,450
so

446
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,980
is our life.

447
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,620
At this point,

448
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,410
we can only count on Nan Ruzhen.

449
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,380
But the child she's bearing

450
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,330
is auspicious.

451
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,290
Would a fully-fledged bird

452
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,810
still obey to us?

453
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,930
Fully-fledged.

454
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,140
I wonder if her wings

455
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,620
are strong or ruined.

456
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:34,170
Honey, it's late now.

457
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:35,980
Let's get rest.

458
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,000
Whatever it is,
we'll think about it tomorrow.

459
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,860
What a beautiful night.

460
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,050
But our life is in someone's hand,

461
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,410
how can I sleep well?

462
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:04,900
Madam.

463
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:08,740
Did you find that person?

464
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:10,810
Yes.

465
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,170
Madam.

466
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,400
This person is asking for death indeed.

467
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,140
If he hadn't been
looking for the perfumed powder,

468
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,290
I would never

469
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,140
in my life find his place.

470
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,660
Since you found him,

471
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,900
what are you waiting for?

472
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,450
Forth Madam, please stop.

473
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,290
Let me pass on the message.

474
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,170
Nonsense.

475
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,900
Even seeing a servant-concubine

476
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:37,540
needs a bulletin?

477
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,330
Servant-concubine?

478
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,410
Hold on, Forth Madam.

479
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,260
You're a distinguished guest.

480
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,140
I haven't tidied up and changed.

481
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,780
How can I meet you?

482
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,380
Please wait for a moment, Forth Madam.

483
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,020
Ms.Lian, the medicine is ready.

484
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:16,810
Drink while it's hot.

485
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:21,860
Dongli.

486
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,050
Store it well.

487
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:23,780
Yes, Ms. Lian.

488
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,570
Isn't it bitter?

489
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,020
No.

490
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,810
After you have your first child,

491
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:50,170
you'll know that the tocolytics
are the sweetest.

492
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,860
You're lying.

493
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,410
Just because I've not drunk it.

494
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,620
Are you asleep, Madam?

495
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,450
Not yet. Come in.

496
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:00,780
Madam.

497
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,210
Forth Madam just came to our mansion.

498
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,500
She went to Jingshu Pavilion right away.

499
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,290
Forth Madam. On her own?

500
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:08,810
By right,

501
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,450
she could

502
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,860
ask a servant to pass on messages.

503
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,410
She actually came by herself.

504
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:13,810
Could it be...

505
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,380
Could it be...

506
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,050
Could it be a threat?

507
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,690
Nan Ruzhen is
bearing an auspicious child.

508
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,290
If Forth Madam wants her
to do something again,

509
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,020
she would naturally feel overwhelmed.

510
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,450
What auspicious child?

511
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:27,930
Heavens must have been blinded.

512
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,290
How could someone like her

513
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:30,050
be pregnant?

514
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:33,540
(Lian'er.)

515
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,290
(I've read the register.)

516
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,090
We found

517
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,090
a suspicious spot.

518
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,240
After reading the register carefully,

519
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,410
I found a sign of modification.

520
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,980
Nan Ruzhen

521
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:49,810
does have problem.

522
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,020
Her pregnancy isn't that simple.

523
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,690
You mean...

524
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:55,930
Heavens are not blinded.

525
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,450
She shouldn't

526
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,170
be bearing this child.

527
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,210
Two days ago,

528
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,170
I saw a scholar in street,

529
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,540
who searched through
all the cosmetic shops

530
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,140
to find

531
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,450
the girl who spent a night with him.

532
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,450
He has

533
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,690
never seen her face.

534
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,570
He only remembered

535
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:19,930
the unique orchid scent on her.

536
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,500
Orchid scent?

537
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:24,170
Dongli.

538
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:25,780
I told you

539
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,140
to find out everything about Nan Ruzhen's

540
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:27,860
daily essentials.

541
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,690
Do you know

542
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:30,140
what perfume she uses?

543
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,500
Of course, I do.

544
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,050
Nan Ruzhen's perfume

545
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,780
is carefully prepared
with the fragrance of orchid.

546
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,330
It's called the Scent of Pleasure.

547
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,780
Scent of Pleasure.

548
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,380
Go to the housekeeping room

549
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,840
and get some Scent of Pleasure.

550
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,810
I'll go now.

551
00:30:51,178 --> 00:30:53,353
(Jingshu Pavillion)

552
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,170
Madam, Forth Madam is gone.

553
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,900
Forth Madam is indeed formidable.

554
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,500
But I don't understand.

555
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,140
Why did she order you

556
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,500
to get such a weird thing?

557
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,620
I don't care if it's weird.

558
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,020
I don't want

559
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,020
to be threatened anymore.

560
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,450
Tell Xu Liangchuan,

561
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:24,840
since the person he's looking for

562
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,210
is asking for death,

563
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,620
then let him have it soon.

564
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,020
It does smell like orchid.

565
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:39,690
Could it really be her?

566
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:40,810
Who?

567
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,380
Ms. Lian, what are you thinking about?

568
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,570
If I'm right,

569
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,330
Madam Zhen who lives

570
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:47,050
deep in the mansion

571
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,620
is being longed and searched

572
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,660
by a scholar all over Quliang.

573
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,210
A scholar?

574
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,260
Nan Ruzhen is as proud as a peacock now.

575
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,570
Why would she be related

576
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:56,380
to a scholar?

577
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,090
She doesn't want to.

578
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,520
Unless it was absolutely necessary

579
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,600
to put all eggs in a basket.

580
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:02,620
Madam.

581
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:03,540
Come in.

582
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,260
Forth Madam is gone.

583
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,020
But the weird part is

584
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,500
Nan Ruzhen is working for Forth Madam.

585
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,690
When Forth Madam left,
she should at least see her off.

586
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,860
Didn't she?

587
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,670
Not only that she didn't see her off,
there wasn't even a servant or maid

588
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,330
who came out.

589
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:24,210
Forth Madam is unfathomable.

590
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:24,980
Her knowledge

591
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,930
will not be lesser than mine.

592
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,090
What did Nan Ruzhen do

593
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,930
to make her so emboldened?

594
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,450
Madam.

595
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,380
After Forth Madam left,

596
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:34,780
I saw that

597
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:37,210
Xu Liangchuan hurried out after her.

598
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,690
It looked like he has a task.

599
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,140
Oh, no!

600
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,330
Follow him and save the person.

601
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,540
I never knew yearning.

602
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:49,860
I just learned about it,

603
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,540
and I'm already suffering from it.

604
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,780
My body is like floating clouds.

605
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,380
My heart is like a catkin.

606
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,570
The air is as thin as balance spring.

607
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:07,740
All that's left is the fragrance.

608
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:16,380
All that's left is the fragrance.

609
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,930
Madam, I've brought who you asked for.

610
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,740
You know me.

611
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,900
Why do you say so?

612
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,410
I heard that

613
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:17,260
you've been searching through the city
to find the fragrance of orchid.

614
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,020
Is this the one?

615
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,210
This is it indeed.

616
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,450
This fragrance is unique.

617
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,370
Only with such an appearance,

618
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,780
you can be worthy of it.

619
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,340
Why are you looking for me?

620
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:40,780
Have we met?

621
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,410
Madam, you're of high status.

622
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,540
You naturally don't remember me.

623
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,610
But do you know

624
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,370
that I'll never forget you.

625
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:52,450
Where have we met?

626
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,100
On the way to hell.

627
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:00,410
Madam.

628
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:01,300
Ms. Lian.

629
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:08,850
I...

630
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,100
I almost

631
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,100
killed that scholar.

632
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,340
Almost?

633
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:13,980
I deserve to die.

634
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,210
Who took him away?

635
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,170
Although it was far away and dark,

636
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,450
I couldn't see clearly.

637
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,060
From the body shape and silhouette,

638
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,130
it looked similar to Madam Lian.

639
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,610
It's her?

640
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,610
Only similar?

641
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,610
How can I tell?

642
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,170
It's not hard

643
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:41,930
for you to tell.

644
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,410
She was assassinated by the scholar

645
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:44,450
and was badly injured.

646
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,890
Badly injured?

647
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:56,450
Madam Zhen.

648
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,300
Madam Lian is asleep.

649
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,130
Just now someone saw

650
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,100
Madam Lian outside

651
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,370
and wasn't asleep.

652
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,580
Hold on.

653
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,540
You're pregnant,

654
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,370
why are you still so hot-tempered?

655
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,540
Of course I should rest peacefully.

656
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:25,780
But I

657
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,500
heard some outrageous rumors.

658
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,500
It was unbearable to hear.

659
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,410
That's why I couldn't rest.

660
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,930
Outrageous rumors?

661
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,650
You're too modest.

662
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,340
Since we met,

663
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,580
no matter what happens,

664
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,890
you're always behaving calm.

665
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,020
If it were just outrageous rumors,

666
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,060
why would it make you

667
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,020
slap my servant

668
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:48,930
with such menace?

669
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,370
It's all because of you.

670
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,540
These wretched servants

671
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,579
made such a lifelike description

672
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,820
saying

673
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,540
you met a scholar

674
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,690
at the pavilion privately.

675
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,340
Perhaps it was because of arguments

676
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,650
or a bad breakup,

677
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,260
the scholar stabbed your belly

678
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,130
with a sharp knife.

679
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,170
There's never an end
in Young Master's Mansion.

680
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:17,890
In the past few months,

681
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,060
I've been feeling exhausted.

682
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,170
I didn't even leave my room.

683
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,690
But people are still

684
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,740
making stories about me.

685
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,850
Could you've forgotten

686
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,410
that there's no smoke without fire?

687
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,780
If I don't have a look myself,

688
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:39,690
I won't be able to confirm if it's real

689
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,170
or not.

690
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,130
To confirm what?

691
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,500
If I met a man privately?

692
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,890
I can let you have a look.

693
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,850
But if I'm not severely injured,

694
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,450
can you bear the crime

695
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:53,580
of false accusation?

696
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,610
Hold on.

697
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:17,650
Madam Lian.

698
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:20,170
What do you have to say?

699
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,300
Isn't this medicine

700
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,560
against coagulation and relief pain?

701
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,300
Your belly is bulging.

702
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,580
Isn't it because of all the gauze

703
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,020
you used to cover up?

704
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:37,780
I would like to see

705
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,170
if you can bear

706
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,500
the crime of deviance.

707
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,100
- Madam.
- You!

708
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,170
Madam Zhen.

709
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,540
How dare you?!

710
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:49,820
Ms. Lian.

711
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,540
Just tell Madam Zhen.

712
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,170
Let everyone in the mansion know.

713
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,130
So you don't have to

714
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:56,450
drink tocolytics secretly.

715
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:57,210
Indeed.

716
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:58,580
Tocolytic?

717
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:06,850
You...

718
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,340
You're pregnant?

719
00:39:13,929 --> 00:39:17,467
(Lianwei House)

720
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,210
If we knew this,

721
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,820
we shouldn't have saved that person.

722
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,600
It would be better
if Xu Liangchuan killed that person.

723
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,060
Such a cruel person.

724
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,780
She almost killed two lives in one body.

725
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:37,120
Yes. Two lives in one body.

726
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,610
And this longevity lock
has been stabbed.

727
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,890
You're still joking.

728
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:41,930
I'm not joking.

729
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,890
Without it,

730
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,610
even if I didn't die,

731
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,650
my wound would be found by Nan Ruzhen.

732
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,300
We've prepared for so long.

733
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:51,650
We can never give up
our previous efforts.

734
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,060
Sadly,

735
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:54,980
because of this

736
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,170
your pregnancy is exposed.

737
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,130
It's worth it.

738
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:00,980
What I've scarified

739
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,650
is that I must be
very careful in the future.

740
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:03,980
What I got

741
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:05,540
is the truth

742
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,260
that can ruin Nan Ruzhen.

743
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,100
Ms. Lian, where should I put this?

744
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:12,820
Put it in the side room.

745
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,820
You're tired.

746
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,370
Young Master isn't back from work yet.

747
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,500
When he finds out

748
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,540
about your pregnancy,

749
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:26,650
I'm afraid Lianwei House

750
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:27,930
will be chaotic again.

751
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,300
Miss Lan.

752
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:32,980
Greetings, Miss Lan.

753
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:40,650
Lan'er.

754
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,450
You're here.

755
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:45,610
Sister.

756
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,210
You're pregnant.

757
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:49,850
I came to congratulate you.

758
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:53,020
Since when

759
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:55,130
you're calling me

760
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:56,170
so strangely?

761
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,740
We're family after all.

762
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:02,130
Blood is thicker than water.

763
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:05,260
I was wrong.

764
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,060
Please forgive me.

765
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,410
Forgive?

766
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:12,960
I'm back in Young Master's
Mansion for months now.

767
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:14,780
I invited you every day.

768
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,410
Yet you didn't come by once.

769
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:17,980
Should I

770
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:18,820
forgive you

771
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,580
for not keeping your sister in mind

772
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,300
or forgive myself

773
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,260
for doing the wrong thing

774
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:26,370
that made me lose you?

775
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,980
You didn't lose me.

776
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:30,580
As far as I can remember,

777
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,540
you love me more than our parents.

778
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,980
You treat me better
than treating yourself.
