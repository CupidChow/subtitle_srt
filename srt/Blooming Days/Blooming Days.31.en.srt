The primary consort
shall receive her reward.

18
00:01:53,526 --> 00:01:56,086
Fang Huairui, the primary consort,

19
00:01:56,806 --> 00:01:58,645
will be given the attire
for princess consort.

20
00:02:15,486 --> 00:02:17,286
No wonder the prince rewards you last.

21
00:02:17,885 --> 00:02:19,566
Congratulations, Madam.

22
00:02:19,965 --> 00:02:22,885
- Congratulations, Madam.
- Congratulations, Madam.

23
00:02:30,085 --> 00:02:31,206
Thank you, Your Highness.

24
00:03:01,965 --> 00:03:03,766
Why is there suddenly a fire?

25
00:03:04,165 --> 00:03:05,000
Madam, throw it away!

26
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:06,766
Madam, hurry and throw it away!

27
00:03:06,766 --> 00:03:08,006
This dress is so strange.

28
00:03:09,206 --> 00:03:10,566
What is going on?

29
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:13,366
Madam.

30
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,420
- Madam, let go!
- Throw it away.

31
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,830
- Are you okay?
- How did this happen?

32
00:03:20,206 --> 00:03:21,165
How did this happen?

33
00:03:21,165 --> 00:03:22,006
Are you okay, Madam?

34
00:03:22,366 --> 00:03:22,926
Rou.

35
00:03:23,685 --> 00:03:24,646
How did this happen?

36
00:03:25,885 --> 00:03:27,325
Why is it on fire?

37
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:34,006
Look.

38
00:03:34,566 --> 00:03:36,046
It burns until there's a lotus shape.

39
00:03:42,245 --> 00:03:43,085
Lotus?

40
00:04:14,646 --> 00:04:16,206
This is creepy.

41
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,165
It's the attire for princess consort.

42
00:04:18,486 --> 00:04:19,685
Why would it be on fire?

43
00:04:20,006 --> 00:04:20,885
Exactly.

44
00:04:21,246 --> 00:04:23,246
It even became a lotus shape.

45
00:04:24,005 --> 00:04:25,125
I don't understand.

46
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,966
Why do all the ladies
go to see Madam Lian?

47
00:04:29,086 --> 00:04:29,926
Is it

48
00:04:30,206 --> 00:04:31,246
because there is "Lian"

49
00:04:31,246 --> 00:04:32,125
in her name?

50
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,445
It's surely more than that.

51
00:04:34,966 --> 00:04:36,165
You joined us late.

52
00:04:36,165 --> 00:04:37,206
You may not know.

53
00:04:37,766 --> 00:04:39,325
Madam Lian looked like

54
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:40,366
the late princess consort.

55
00:04:40,725 --> 00:04:41,806
So the late prince

56
00:04:41,806 --> 00:04:43,766
looked at her differently.

57
00:04:44,486 --> 00:04:45,325
One

58
00:04:45,526 --> 00:04:47,445
of the similarities between them

59
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,720
is that they both loved lotus flower.

60
00:04:50,686 --> 00:04:52,725
Did the late prince show up,

61
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,730
wanting Madam Lian to become
the princess consort?

62
00:05:03,086 --> 00:05:03,790
- Madam.
- Madam.

63
00:05:08,246 --> 00:05:10,039
We've offended her then.

64
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,270
You don't have to say anything.

65
00:05:16,686 --> 00:05:18,325
Madam looks really unhappy.

66
00:05:18,845 --> 00:05:19,650
It's not surprising.

67
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,800
She looked forward to
having the attire for years.

68
00:05:21,806 --> 00:05:23,086
Not long after she got it,

69
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:25,206
she watched it burning into ashes.

70
00:05:27,766 --> 00:05:28,445
Xu Liangchuan.

71
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:29,646
What do you think?

72
00:05:30,285 --> 00:05:31,486
The attire burned

73
00:05:31,486 --> 00:05:32,560
because of white phosphorus,

74
00:05:32,806 --> 00:05:33,725
which is easy to guess.

75
00:05:34,526 --> 00:05:36,605
However, it's strange
that it became a lotus shape

76
00:05:36,806 --> 00:05:37,686
after burning.

77
00:05:38,486 --> 00:05:39,845
No matter how she did it,

78
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,005
it's a brilliant move from Madam Lian.

79
00:05:42,285 --> 00:05:44,270
In happened in public for
the people to talk about.

80
00:05:44,526 --> 00:05:46,206
Even if Madam is the primary consort,

81
00:05:46,686 --> 00:05:47,966
she can't defy the late prince

82
00:05:48,246 --> 00:05:49,206
nor the heaven's will.

83
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,080
However, I've been in Young Master Xin's
Mansion for years.

84
00:05:52,605 --> 00:05:54,670
I didn't realise such an ambition
from Madam Lian.

85
00:05:56,285 --> 00:05:57,630
Young Master has become the prince.

86
00:05:58,405 --> 00:05:59,646
He isn't what he used to be.

87
00:06:00,966 --> 00:06:01,766
Too bad.

88
00:06:02,646 --> 00:06:04,125
No matter how ambitious she is

89
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:05,646
and how brilliant her moves,

90
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,325
only Madam Rui

91
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:10,246
can be the princess consort.

92
00:06:11,686 --> 00:06:12,605
What did you say?

93
00:06:13,246 --> 00:06:14,870
Madam Rui sees us as thorns in her flesh.

94
00:06:14,926 --> 00:06:16,005
Should we help her?

95
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,766
She is also a thorn in my flesh.

96
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,405
However, at present,

97
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:22,366
Luo Qinglian is the apple
of the prince's eyes.

98
00:06:23,285 --> 00:06:24,806
Who can touch her

99
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,646
if she becomes the princess consort?

100
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,270
There is still a long way to go
in the mansion.

101
00:06:30,646 --> 00:06:32,086
If we can't tell

102
00:06:33,005 --> 00:06:33,725
who the strongest

103
00:06:33,725 --> 00:06:34,766
or the most hateful one is,

104
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:37,240
I would've spent 16 years
in the courtyard for nothing.

105
00:06:37,885 --> 00:06:39,005
I, Mu Haiyao,

106
00:06:39,806 --> 00:06:41,980
could bear with the humiliation
for the past 16 years.

107
00:06:42,686 --> 00:06:44,246
I should be able to tolerate her.

108
00:06:44,845 --> 00:06:45,486
Madam.

109
00:06:46,046 --> 00:06:48,605
May I ask you, Madam?

110
00:06:49,046 --> 00:06:50,125
Why didn't you think

111
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:50,926
about yourself?

112
00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:53,445
The prince is counting on Official Mu
in many areas.

113
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,270
If you really want to be
the princess consort,

114
00:06:55,725 --> 00:06:57,206
it is still possible,

115
00:06:57,405 --> 00:06:59,125
even if the prince is unwilling.

116
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:05,325
Fine.

117
00:07:06,165 --> 00:07:07,806
Surprisingly, losing the prince' love

118
00:07:08,766 --> 00:07:10,046
is still what you fear the most

119
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,445
after so many years.

120
00:07:16,086 --> 00:07:17,005
Haven't I lost his love

121
00:07:23,885 --> 00:07:25,206
long ago?

122
00:07:27,766 --> 00:07:28,246
Madam.

123
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:29,845
I don't know why.

124
00:07:29,926 --> 00:07:32,005
Each courtyard in the mansion sends gifts here.

125
00:07:32,366 --> 00:07:33,806
I don't know why they did that.

126
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,005
I've kept them for the moment

127
00:07:35,325 --> 00:07:36,725
for you to handle when you're back.

128
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:38,806
These people

129
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:40,125
are trying to please you now.

130
00:07:41,325 --> 00:07:42,046
Zhiyue and Ranyun.

131
00:07:42,325 --> 00:07:43,366
Go out now and keep watch.

132
00:07:43,366 --> 00:07:44,070
Close the doors and windows.

133
00:07:44,086 --> 00:07:45,120
You mustn't let anyone in.

134
00:07:45,325 --> 00:07:45,845
Noted.

135
00:07:58,766 --> 00:08:00,046
Good gracious.

136
00:08:00,285 --> 00:08:01,486
You've done this

137
00:08:01,486 --> 00:08:02,686
without anyone's knowledge.

138
00:08:03,046 --> 00:08:04,046
Even Rou

139
00:08:04,046 --> 00:08:04,806
and I were unaware.

140
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:05,766
Why?

141
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,270
Do you want to tell us only after becoming
the princess consort?

142
00:08:10,766 --> 00:08:12,486
Did you not do it?

143
00:08:17,926 --> 00:08:18,966
It's neither you indeed.

144
00:08:21,845 --> 00:08:22,845
Madam Rui is nice to me.

145
00:08:23,246 --> 00:08:25,686
Also, she has been managing
the mansion for years

146
00:08:25,966 --> 00:08:27,285
tolerantly and impartially.

147
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,270
Her position of princess consort
is well deserved.

148
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:30,885
I wouldn't hanker after it.

149
00:08:32,285 --> 00:08:33,646
I wondered why

150
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:34,486
you're

151
00:08:34,486 --> 00:08:35,766
so presumptuous just now.

152
00:08:36,605 --> 00:08:37,230
There is indeed

153
00:08:37,886 --> 00:08:38,806
someone else.

154
00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:39,886
Could it be

155
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:41,525
Mu Haiyao?

156
00:08:42,085 --> 00:08:43,326
It seemed

157
00:08:43,605 --> 00:08:44,205
that she still

158
00:08:44,205 --> 00:08:45,486
cared about you.

159
00:08:45,886 --> 00:08:46,446
You

160
00:08:46,446 --> 00:08:47,645
don't know Mu Haiyao at all.

161
00:08:48,126 --> 00:08:49,645
If she still cared about you,

162
00:08:50,165 --> 00:08:51,370
she would support you in secret

163
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,446
instead of recalling the past

164
00:08:53,446 --> 00:08:54,285
before Madam Rui.

165
00:08:55,006 --> 00:08:56,006
Such an obvious act

166
00:08:56,686 --> 00:08:58,285
was just to mislead Madam Rui

167
00:08:58,285 --> 00:08:59,670
that she was colluding with Lian'er.

168
00:09:01,725 --> 00:09:02,886
She remains heartless

169
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:05,046
even after so many years.

170
00:09:06,326 --> 00:09:06,926
There aren't

171
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:08,366
permanent friends nor foes.

172
00:09:09,686 --> 00:09:11,006
Maybe these are

173
00:09:11,525 --> 00:09:13,006
the only true words from her heart.

174
00:09:16,326 --> 00:09:17,046
Rou.

175
00:09:17,246 --> 00:09:17,886
Don't worry.

176
00:09:20,165 --> 00:09:21,126
It's been 16 years.

177
00:09:22,165 --> 00:09:23,566
I've forgotten

178
00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:24,886
all love and hatred.

179
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:26,486
Nothing about her

180
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:28,165
is related to me.

181
00:09:28,845 --> 00:09:29,605
Strange.

182
00:09:30,366 --> 00:09:31,405
It's not us

183
00:09:32,085 --> 00:09:33,326
nor Mu Haiyao.

184
00:09:33,965 --> 00:09:34,886
Who could it be?

185
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:37,165
Whoever it is,

186
00:09:37,926 --> 00:09:39,605
it must be one with a noble status.

187
00:09:49,765 --> 00:09:51,205
I thought it's fishy at that time.

188
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:54,285
The fabric wasn't completely burnt.

189
00:09:55,765 --> 00:09:56,686
I suddenly recall

190
00:09:56,965 --> 00:09:57,686
a rock called

191
00:09:57,686 --> 00:09:58,686
sericite.

192
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,270
It is fireproof after being
ground into powder.

193
00:10:02,845 --> 00:10:04,645
So I've brought some powder back.

194
00:10:08,046 --> 00:10:09,405
Sericite isn't easy to get.

195
00:10:10,605 --> 00:10:12,046
No ordinary person can find it.

196
00:10:14,006 --> 00:10:15,366
The only place to obtain it

197
00:10:16,326 --> 00:10:17,566
is the mansion's warehouse.

198
00:10:21,006 --> 00:10:22,366
Who is it exactly?

199
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,680
Why did the person want to help you?

200
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:27,405
That can't be the case.

201
00:10:27,806 --> 00:10:28,686
I'm afraid Madam Rui

202
00:10:28,686 --> 00:10:30,070
is holding a grudge against me now.

203
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:32,686
Mu Haiyao is wary of me.

204
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,126
The person didn't help me.

205
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:38,165
(I became a target of
public criticism instead.)

206
00:10:38,926 --> 00:10:40,285
(The coronation is coming up.)

207
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,780
(The appointment of princess consort
is also imminent.)

208
00:10:43,486 --> 00:10:44,525
(Many people)

209
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,645
(take a secret interest in something)

210
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:47,605
(these days.)

211
00:10:48,446 --> 00:10:50,486
There could also be troubles brewing.

212
00:10:59,205 --> 00:11:00,366
Good job.

213
00:11:01,405 --> 00:11:02,046
Madam.

214
00:11:02,605 --> 00:11:03,686
I don't understand.

215
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:06,446
You wanted to get rid of Luo Qinglian

216
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,070
only because she stood in Young Master's way
to inherit the title

217
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:11,806
However, Young Master Xin has...

218
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,965
Why do you still want to
keep an eye on Luo Qinglian?

219
00:11:17,446 --> 00:11:18,205
Yes.

220
00:11:19,765 --> 00:11:20,566
I failed.

221
00:11:21,486 --> 00:11:22,486
Failure isn't scary.

222
00:11:23,165 --> 00:11:24,085
It's scary

223
00:11:24,366 --> 00:11:26,046
when you don't know to whom you lose.

224
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,126
In the past couple of days,

225
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,046
what happened over a decade

226
00:11:30,046 --> 00:11:31,886
ran through my head one after another.

227
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:34,246
I suddenly got a clear view

228
00:11:35,725 --> 00:11:37,285
of Luo Qinglian's presence

229
00:11:37,285 --> 00:11:39,326
in Young Master's failures.

230
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,845
She wasn't only Young Master Xin's brain,

231
00:11:42,486 --> 00:11:43,806
but also his soul.

232
00:11:44,486 --> 00:11:46,085
I was too eager for success.

233
00:11:47,686 --> 00:11:49,806
It's only until now that I realise

234
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:52,366
that I didn't lose to Young Master Xin.

235
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:55,765
I lost to his woman instead.

236
00:11:56,285 --> 00:11:57,165
I understand now.

237
00:11:57,525 --> 00:11:58,886
Young Master Xin will be left alone

238
00:11:59,326 --> 00:12:00,965
if we get rid of Luo Qinglian.

239
00:12:01,446 --> 00:12:03,645
However, the coronation
is just around the corner.

240
00:12:03,686 --> 00:12:04,725
Can we still make it?

241
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:06,340
What's the matter?

242
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:09,566
Do you think no one else
is more eager than me?

243
00:12:11,246 --> 00:12:12,886
Fang Huairui will not

244
00:12:12,886 --> 00:12:15,126
spare her until that day.

245
00:12:15,886 --> 00:12:17,446
As long as Young Master stays calm,

246
00:12:18,285 --> 00:12:20,046
He Lianxin may not be the one

247
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:22,046
who ascends the throne of Prince An.

248
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,170
(Courier station)

249
00:12:29,205 --> 00:12:30,645
Official.

250
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:32,205
Official, you can't leave.

251
00:12:32,205 --> 00:12:33,126
It's just an accident.

252
00:12:33,165 --> 00:12:34,126
You can't leave.

253
00:12:35,806 --> 00:12:36,486
An accident?

254
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,730
There wouldn't have
been such an accident

255
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:40,085
if it was well preserved.

256
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:41,886
My King

257
00:12:42,046 --> 00:12:44,085
sincerely congratulated
the prince on the title,

258
00:12:44,285 --> 00:12:45,725
but he was neglected.

259
00:12:46,006 --> 00:12:47,926
The people of Quliang have gone too far.

260
00:12:49,006 --> 00:12:50,686
The Mu has gone too far!

261
00:12:51,446 --> 00:12:52,605
Tell the prince

262
00:12:53,085 --> 00:12:54,926
to wait for my king to declare war!

263
00:12:55,205 --> 00:12:55,806
Official!

264
00:12:57,566 --> 00:12:58,886
The tribes on horseback

265
00:12:59,525 --> 00:13:00,845
matter dignity the most.

266
00:13:01,926 --> 00:13:03,285
They can't stand such humiliation.

267
00:13:05,246 --> 00:13:06,326
I'm afraid a war

268
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,006
is imminent.

269
00:13:10,645 --> 00:13:12,326
Lianxiu, you made a brilliant move.

270
00:13:13,645 --> 00:13:15,725
He burnt the tribute from Cige'er

271
00:13:16,645 --> 00:13:18,405
to stir up strife between two nations.

272
00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:23,046
I'll see how Lianxin
can become Prince An.

273
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:24,845
Was it you who set

274
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,205
fire to the warehouse, Lianxiu?

275
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,130
The coronation will be held
at the end of mourning period.

276
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:34,085
That's our last chance.

277
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:36,926
It's now

278
00:13:37,845 --> 00:13:38,845
or never.

279
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:41,165
Lianxiu.

280
00:13:50,886 --> 00:13:51,566
Nothing.

281
00:13:53,046 --> 00:13:53,725
You don't look

282
00:13:53,725 --> 00:13:54,806
good lately.

283
00:13:55,605 --> 00:13:56,686
I have premium antler.

284
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,350
I'll let someone to send you today.

285
00:13:59,845 --> 00:14:00,566
Serve the dishes!

286
00:14:22,686 --> 00:14:23,446
Surprisingly,

287
00:14:23,886 --> 00:14:25,285
Madam De refuses to meet the prince

288
00:14:25,725 --> 00:14:27,886
because of Young Master Hua.

289
00:14:28,845 --> 00:14:29,686
She

290
00:14:29,686 --> 00:14:30,886
gave birth to the prince.

291
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,270
They're her flesh and blood.

292
00:14:32,845 --> 00:14:34,326
She was biased.

293
00:14:35,246 --> 00:14:36,126
The prince must be

294
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,285
very upset.

295
00:14:41,126 --> 00:14:42,046
Bad news, Madam.

296
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,366
Cige'er's tribute has been burnt.

297
00:14:43,486 --> 00:14:44,566
The envoy has left Quliang

298
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:45,205
out of rage.

299
00:14:45,566 --> 00:14:47,285
He claimed to be declaring war.

300
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:50,926
Take a look at the mansion.

301
00:14:51,486 --> 00:14:52,326
It's better

302
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,765
if you talk about the attire first.

303
00:14:57,205 --> 00:14:57,686
Let's go.

304
00:15:07,926 --> 00:15:08,285
Madam.

305
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,965
I still thought there was something fishy
about what happened this morning.

306
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,580
So I looked around Lianwei Residence.

307
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:16,446
I saw this.

308
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:23,326
I've asked around.

309
00:15:23,645 --> 00:15:24,605
It's called...

310
00:15:25,326 --> 00:15:26,126
Sericite.

311
00:15:28,085 --> 00:15:28,566
Yes.

312
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,046
Why would I forget?

313
00:15:31,686 --> 00:15:33,085
The evidence is conclusive.

314
00:15:33,405 --> 00:15:34,486
As the princess consort,

315
00:15:34,605 --> 00:15:36,645
the prince will speak for you

316
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,340
no matter how much
he favours Luo Qinglian.

317
00:15:42,405 --> 00:15:43,246
Princess consort?

318
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,770
Can I still be the princess consort?

319
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,405
You're the primary consort.

320
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,270
Luo Qinglian is just a daughter of a petty officer
at the Bureau of Treasury.

321
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:52,725
She can't match you.

322
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:55,765
Really?

323
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,446
If only one with a prominent
family background

324
00:15:58,446 --> 00:15:59,806
can be the princess consort,

325
00:16:01,285 --> 00:16:02,165
what about Mu Haiyao?

326
00:16:07,605 --> 00:16:09,165
One wins the prince's heart

327
00:16:09,926 --> 00:16:11,366
while another controls his power.

328
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:12,965
As for me?

329
00:16:13,446 --> 00:16:14,605
I only hold the empty title

330
00:16:14,605 --> 00:16:15,645
of the primary consort.

331
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,126
What can I do even when I have evidence?

332
00:16:21,165 --> 00:16:22,605
Will the prince speak

333
00:16:22,605 --> 00:16:23,405
for my empty title?

334
00:16:26,205 --> 00:16:28,170
The incident in the morning
will be spread soon.

335
00:16:29,285 --> 00:16:30,165
The attire

336
00:16:30,765 --> 00:16:32,126
will be taken back soon.

337
00:16:33,246 --> 00:16:33,845
At that time,

338
00:16:34,806 --> 00:16:36,046
I'll lose even this empty title.

339
00:16:37,486 --> 00:16:38,006
Madam.

340
00:16:38,446 --> 00:16:38,886
Madam.

341
00:16:43,366 --> 00:16:43,806
Madam.

342
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,530
There was a fire at
the mansion's warehouse

343
00:16:46,566 --> 00:16:47,725
that burnt Cige'er's tribute.

344
00:16:49,085 --> 00:16:50,366
Both states could go to war.

345
00:16:50,725 --> 00:16:51,205
Really?

346
00:16:51,566 --> 00:16:52,566
Yes.

347
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:53,645
I was on duty

348
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:54,605
in the warehouse.

349
00:16:54,965 --> 00:16:57,686
I saw a shadow hurriedly coming out
of the warehouse.

350
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,070
The fire started after that.

351
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:00,366
I followed that person

352
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:01,645
and saw him...

353
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,770
He entered Young Master Xiu's mansion.

354
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:08,525
Madam.

355
00:17:08,686 --> 00:17:09,525
You shouldn't enter.

356
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:09,926
Madam.

357
00:17:10,206 --> 00:17:10,645
Madam.

358
00:17:16,566 --> 00:17:17,566
Leave us.

359
00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:22,966
Who offended you, Third Madam?

360
00:17:25,926 --> 00:17:27,005
I'm so forgetful.

361
00:17:27,485 --> 00:17:28,966
There is no more Third Madam.

362
00:17:32,046 --> 00:17:32,806
Congratulations.

363
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:35,405
Your lifelong wish is fulfilled.

364
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,405
I should address you by
"Your Highness" now.

365
00:17:39,765 --> 00:17:40,485
Nevermind.

366
00:17:41,446 --> 00:17:42,525
I have yet to be appointed

367
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,405
and I may not be the princess consort.

368
00:17:45,846 --> 00:17:46,686
Besides,

369
00:17:47,165 --> 00:17:48,326
I'm not the only person

370
00:17:48,446 --> 00:17:49,686
with the same wish.

371
00:17:56,005 --> 00:17:57,005
How sad.

372
00:17:57,606 --> 00:18:00,485
No matter how skillfully
and beautifully this peacock

373
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,606
is embroidered,

374
00:18:02,606 --> 00:18:04,165
it's imperfect

375
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,926
even with one missing stitch.

376
00:18:08,686 --> 00:18:09,405
Fine.

377
00:18:10,405 --> 00:18:11,566
Might makes right.

378
00:18:13,086 --> 00:18:14,165
I deserve

379
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:16,806
all kind of humiliation.

380
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,566
I'm not humiliating you.

381
00:18:20,046 --> 00:18:21,165
I intend to remind you.

382
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:24,566
It's a done deal now.

383
00:18:25,206 --> 00:18:26,365
Stop pestering

384
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,260
and harm others including yourself.

385
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:33,165
What did you say?

386
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,730
Cige'er wouldn't let it slide

387
00:18:36,885 --> 00:18:39,525
after suffering
such insult this morning.

388
00:18:40,046 --> 00:18:42,645
Quliang is in turmoil now.

389
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,285
It'll be dealt a heavy blow
in case of a defeat in a war.

390
00:18:45,885 --> 00:18:47,005
What is in it for you

391
00:18:47,245 --> 00:18:48,245
even if

392
00:18:48,245 --> 00:18:49,086
you could stop

393
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:50,525
the coronation

394
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:51,365
of the prince?

395
00:18:54,326 --> 00:18:55,686
You're a smart person.

396
00:18:57,046 --> 00:18:58,165
You surely know

397
00:18:58,165 --> 00:18:59,720
the principle of sharing the same fate.

398
00:19:01,606 --> 00:19:02,806
You speak with certainty.

399
00:19:03,885 --> 00:19:05,460
It seems you have some kind of evidence.

400
00:19:08,165 --> 00:19:10,606
No evidence and that's unnecessary.

401
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:13,806
I hope it's not Young Master Xiu.

402
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,550
Otherwise, the prince would be forced

403
00:19:15,686 --> 00:19:17,086
to turn against his own brother.

404
00:19:24,086 --> 00:19:26,125
I'll pretend like I don't know about it.

405
00:19:26,846 --> 00:19:28,125
Hopefully, you would prioritise

406
00:19:28,206 --> 00:19:29,326
Quliang in the future.

407
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,046
Think twice before you act.

408
00:19:37,046 --> 00:19:38,405
How many stitches are left

409
00:19:39,086 --> 00:19:40,405
to complete the peacock?

410
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,580
It's fine even when you aren't
the princess consort yet.

411
00:19:44,446 --> 00:19:46,125
You're afraid of losing it forever,

412
00:19:47,285 --> 00:19:47,926
right?

413
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:53,485
Liuyan.

414
00:19:55,966 --> 00:19:56,525
Madam.

415
00:19:58,285 --> 00:19:59,326
Has Young Master back yet?

416
00:20:01,686 --> 00:20:02,645
Calm down, Madam.

417
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,806
Young Master always
discusses everything with you.

418
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,485
Maybe he feels ashamed to face you

419
00:20:06,726 --> 00:20:08,120
after failing to inherit the title.

420
00:20:10,365 --> 00:20:11,206
Ashamed?

421
00:20:12,846 --> 00:20:14,285
Does he feel ashamed

422
00:20:15,885 --> 00:20:16,970
or have we become estranged?

423
00:20:27,245 --> 00:20:28,606
Greetings, Your Highness.

424
00:20:29,326 --> 00:20:30,170
You came just in time.

425
00:20:30,485 --> 00:20:32,125
Look at what this is.

426
00:20:34,046 --> 00:20:34,806
This is...

427
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,206
18 years have passed.

428
00:20:41,686 --> 00:20:42,770
The parrot is still around.

429
00:20:43,485 --> 00:20:44,885
The trees before Ms. Jinfang's tomb

430
00:20:45,086 --> 00:20:46,566
have formed a forest.

431
00:20:47,165 --> 00:20:49,005
Yu Dechang had been looking after it

432
00:20:49,446 --> 00:20:50,966
over the years after Ms. Jinfang died.

433
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,686
I've been feeding it for seven days.

434
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,285
It makes no sound.

435
00:20:55,525 --> 00:20:58,365
You must be missing your old master.

436
00:21:01,765 --> 00:21:04,606
Even birds have feelings.

437
00:21:05,485 --> 00:21:06,125
Humans,

438
00:21:07,365 --> 00:21:09,040
however, have hearts
that can't be warmed.

439
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,566
The burning of
the tribute is a big deal,

440
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:15,125
but Madam De remains

441
00:21:16,285 --> 00:21:17,405
the biggest problem for you.

442
00:21:24,726 --> 00:21:25,926
I knew

443
00:21:27,046 --> 00:21:28,686
there would be no peace today.

444
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,885
Whether it's a natural
or man-made disaster,

445
00:21:32,686 --> 00:21:34,046
there should be a way to stop it.

446
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:36,485
However, I didn't expect my mother

447
00:21:38,086 --> 00:21:39,885
to be the first

448
00:21:42,966 --> 00:21:44,326
to give me a fatal blow.

449
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,365
Madam De wasn't the only person

450
00:21:46,645 --> 00:21:48,125
who stabbed you.

451
00:21:49,446 --> 00:21:51,046
I did it too.

452
00:21:54,165 --> 00:21:55,806
It's not that Madam De is ruthless.

453
00:21:56,446 --> 00:21:58,086
You hide your heart

454
00:21:58,446 --> 00:21:59,405
too deep.

455
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,125
You don't want others to see it.

456
00:22:02,645 --> 00:22:03,726
I'm sure

457
00:22:03,885 --> 00:22:05,046
every heart can be warmed.

458
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,606
If you can't do it alone,

459
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:09,245
I'll do it with you.

460
00:22:28,365 --> 00:22:29,686
You've been with me for years

461
00:22:31,086 --> 00:22:32,765
and suffering.

462
00:22:34,966 --> 00:22:36,086
I've inherited the title.

463
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:39,285
I want to give you
the best of everything.

464
00:22:41,245 --> 00:22:42,165
However,

465
00:22:43,005 --> 00:22:43,806
the Fang family...

466
00:22:45,245 --> 00:22:47,326
The Fang family used to
be the master of Quliang.

467
00:22:47,806 --> 00:22:49,285
It's deeply rooted here.

468
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,525
The position of the princess consort...

469
00:22:54,885 --> 00:22:55,450
Your Highness.

470
00:22:55,806 --> 00:22:56,566
There is something

471
00:22:56,686 --> 00:22:57,645
I have to say.

472
00:22:59,365 --> 00:23:00,125
The attire

473
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:01,846
given by you to Madam Rui

474
00:23:01,846 --> 00:23:02,686
this morning...

475
00:23:02,806 --> 00:23:03,405
Your Highness!

476
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,640
Your Highness, Young Master Yi
has returned from the border.

477
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,005
Hurry and let him in.

478
00:23:13,086 --> 00:23:13,566
Lianxin.

479
00:23:13,765 --> 00:23:14,446
Qinglian.

480
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,680
It's been a long while.

481
00:23:16,005 --> 00:23:16,726
We have a trouble.

482
00:23:17,365 --> 00:23:18,005
What is it?

483
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,970
I heard of the burning of the tribute
as soon as I came back.

484
00:23:22,245 --> 00:23:25,086
A shattered white phosphorus bottle
was found at the fire scene.

485
00:23:26,326 --> 00:23:27,086
Also...

486
00:23:58,285 --> 00:23:58,966
Strange.

487
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,520
Why was Luo Qinglian's handkerchief

488
00:24:00,525 --> 00:24:01,686
found in the warehouse?

489
00:24:02,686 --> 00:24:03,606
Whatever it is,

490
00:24:04,326 --> 00:24:04,926
let her

491
00:24:06,285 --> 00:24:07,806
be our scapegoat this time.

492
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:09,686
Get up.

493
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,060
You aren't allowed to kneel
before you're confirmed to be the criminal!

494
00:24:18,966 --> 00:24:19,525
Your Highness.

495
00:24:20,165 --> 00:24:21,606
Is it not Madam Lian's handkerchief

496
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,125
that's found in the warehouse?

497
00:24:23,405 --> 00:24:24,885
It is hers.

498
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:27,125
Madam Lian.

499
00:24:28,165 --> 00:24:29,566
As the prince's concubine,

500
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:31,405
why did you appear in the warehouse

501
00:24:31,645 --> 00:24:32,846
and lose your handkerchief?

502
00:24:35,245 --> 00:24:36,806
It's her handkerchief,

503
00:24:37,165 --> 00:24:38,206
but it's not hard

504
00:24:38,206 --> 00:24:39,245
to obtain.

505
00:24:39,446 --> 00:24:41,926
It's possible that someone
intended to frame her.

506
00:24:48,005 --> 00:24:48,606
Your Highness.

507
00:24:49,846 --> 00:24:52,446
You seem biased.

508
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:55,405
It's not bias. It's trust.

509
00:24:55,926 --> 00:24:57,846
Lianyi knows
Madam Lian's personality well.

510
00:24:58,046 --> 00:24:59,245
It's not her doing.

511
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:00,765
Trust?

512
00:25:02,046 --> 00:25:04,046
Let's see if Cige'er's army would listen

513
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:05,566
to your trust when it invades us.

514
00:25:06,086 --> 00:25:06,686
Moreover,

515
00:25:07,285 --> 00:25:08,765
times have changed.

516
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,780
No matter how long
you've known each other,

517
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,485
she could've changed.

518
00:25:13,446 --> 00:25:14,765
Young Master Zhi is right.

519
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,170
Your Highness, you're
the master of Quliang now

520
00:25:18,846 --> 00:25:19,765
and I'm no longer

521
00:25:19,966 --> 00:25:21,525
the madam of the mansion.

522
00:25:22,285 --> 00:25:23,566
The higher the people go,

523
00:25:24,005 --> 00:25:25,165
the easier they get lost.

524
00:25:25,686 --> 00:25:26,885
They become insatiable.

525
00:25:28,686 --> 00:25:30,046
I just want to ask you.

526
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:33,446
What is my greed?

527
00:25:34,525 --> 00:25:35,485
What is in it

528
00:25:35,485 --> 00:25:36,765
for me by burning the tribute

529
00:25:37,005 --> 00:25:38,446
and creating a war?

530
00:25:44,206 --> 00:25:45,245
What you want

531
00:25:45,405 --> 00:25:46,846
is not a war between two armies.

532
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:55,365
Your Highness.

533
00:25:56,086 --> 00:25:57,005
May I

534
00:25:57,485 --> 00:25:58,365
plead

535
00:25:58,365 --> 00:25:59,645
for my madam.

536
00:26:02,206 --> 00:26:02,926
For her?

537
00:26:04,446 --> 00:26:05,606
What has happened to her?

538
00:26:16,686 --> 00:26:17,206
Madam.

539
00:26:17,645 --> 00:26:19,525
You haven't seen the prince for long.

540
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,005
This is the golden opportunity
to bring Luo Qinglian down.

541
00:26:22,686 --> 00:26:25,125
Why don't you go to see him?

542
00:26:28,525 --> 00:26:30,566
The hard-earned reunion

543
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:34,100
mustn't be about annoying him
by making him watch the woman he loves

544
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,365
the most being condemned.

545
00:26:37,285 --> 00:26:38,726
I have nothing.

546
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,326
I can only rely on the fact
that he's wronged me

547
00:26:41,326 --> 00:26:42,446
for 16 years.

548
00:26:43,485 --> 00:26:44,046
It's also

549
00:26:44,046 --> 00:26:45,326
my only chance of survival.

550
00:26:46,245 --> 00:26:47,485
However, when you aren't around,

551
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,966
you could miss a good opportunity
if Luo Qinglian gets away

552
00:26:50,245 --> 00:26:51,846
with her glib tongue.

553
00:26:53,485 --> 00:26:54,125
Get away?

554
00:26:56,846 --> 00:26:58,046
She can't, as long as

555
00:26:59,046 --> 00:27:00,485
there is someone around.

556
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,270
Madam Rui was bullied and humiliated by someone
with an ulterior motive.

557
00:27:08,686 --> 00:27:10,446
Her attire was burnt in public.

558
00:27:11,165 --> 00:27:11,726
What?

559
00:27:12,525 --> 00:27:13,326
The attire

560
00:27:13,686 --> 00:27:14,926
granted by the prince to madam

561
00:27:14,926 --> 00:27:15,846
this morning

562
00:27:16,165 --> 00:27:18,525
was burnt in the wind,
as soon as the box was opened.

563
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:20,245
Also, it became

564
00:27:20,245 --> 00:27:21,645
the shape of a lotus.

565
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:26,846
Zuiliu!

566
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,880
Forgive me, Your Highness.

567
00:27:34,405 --> 00:27:37,840
I failed to stop her from spouting nonsense
before you, Your Highness.

568
00:27:37,846 --> 00:27:39,686
I'll bring her back
to punish her properly.

569
00:27:40,405 --> 00:27:41,846
Zuiliu, come with me.

570
00:27:42,046 --> 00:27:42,566
Madam!

571
00:27:43,005 --> 00:27:44,686
You can't just swallow your anger.

572
00:27:45,405 --> 00:27:46,125
It

573
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:47,446
concerns the safety of Quliang.

574
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,030
Do you still want to conceal it for her?

575
00:27:49,645 --> 00:27:51,125
It concerns the safety of Quliang?

576
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:54,365
Huairui, stand up to talk.

577
00:27:55,165 --> 00:27:56,005
Yes, Your Highness.

578
00:28:03,885 --> 00:28:04,606
Just now,

579
00:28:05,206 --> 00:28:06,446
when the attire was burnt,

580
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,686
I thought it's the late prince
showing his presence

581
00:28:09,285 --> 00:28:11,525
to select the princess consort
for you, Your Highness.

582
00:28:11,726 --> 00:28:12,606
It's until

583
00:28:13,086 --> 00:28:14,806
I found this in Lianwei Residence.

584
00:28:35,446 --> 00:28:36,966
This is called sericite.

585
00:28:37,326 --> 00:28:38,765
It's a fireproof lime.

586
00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:41,086
The sericite was hidden

587
00:28:41,206 --> 00:28:42,326
in the mansion's warehouse.

588
00:28:42,926 --> 00:28:43,645
Someone

589
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:45,086
applied it on the attire.

590
00:28:45,446 --> 00:28:47,326
The warehouse caught fire
not long after that.

591
00:28:48,086 --> 00:28:49,326
I try my utmost

592
00:28:49,566 --> 00:28:50,806
to clear Lian's name.

593
00:28:51,046 --> 00:28:51,765
However, I really

594
00:28:51,765 --> 00:28:52,726
can't believe

595
00:28:52,806 --> 00:28:54,046
it is purely a coincidence.

596
00:28:59,525 --> 00:29:00,046
Lian.

597
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,285
Is the position of the princess consort

598
00:29:03,606 --> 00:29:04,566
so important to you

599
00:29:04,686 --> 00:29:06,566
that you'd lose your sense of proportion

600
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,270
and sneak into the warehouse

601
00:29:08,525 --> 00:29:10,206
to steal sericite and white phosphorus?

602
00:29:10,765 --> 00:29:12,046
Maybe you're troubled.

603
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,645
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
accidentally hit and shattered

604
00:29:14,885 --> 00:29:16,885
the bottle of white phosphorus
when you panicked.

605
00:29:17,405 --> 00:29:18,566
You surely didn't expect

606
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:22,046
the spontaneous combustion
of white phosphorus after it leaves the water

607
00:29:22,285 --> 00:29:23,926
would create a havoc to Quliang.

608
00:29:24,165 --> 00:29:24,846
Your Highness.

609
00:29:26,206 --> 00:29:27,405
I didn't.

610
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:31,840
Your Highness.

611
00:29:32,245 --> 00:29:33,726
If we want to prevent the war,

612
00:29:33,885 --> 00:29:35,206
please send Madam Lian

613
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,086
to Cige'er

614
00:29:36,165 --> 00:29:38,005
and explain to the king.

615
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,326
Your Highness!

616
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,765
Madam Rui is just speculating.

617
00:29:40,765 --> 00:29:42,270
How can we convict
without investigating?

618
00:29:42,645 --> 00:29:44,525
Also, anyone going to Cige'er now

619
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,750
is akin to committing suicide.

620
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,610
Your Highness, please think twice.

621
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,086
Your Highness.

622
00:29:51,765 --> 00:29:53,806
Cige'er and Quliang
are just a desert's throw away.

623
00:29:54,206 --> 00:29:55,566
There is no war over so many years.

624
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,870
Would you ignore the friendship

625
00:29:56,966 --> 00:29:58,206
only because

626
00:29:58,485 --> 00:30:00,405
you have love for Madam Lian?

627
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:17,125
Detain Madam Lian

628
00:30:18,606 --> 00:30:19,885
in the Correctional Institution

629
00:30:20,765 --> 00:30:22,966
until we find out the truth.

630
00:30:44,485 --> 00:30:45,005
Zhimei.

631
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:47,206
Where have you gone?

632
00:30:50,206 --> 00:30:51,170
I had nothing good to do.

633
00:30:51,765 --> 00:30:52,806
So I travelled out

634
00:30:52,926 --> 00:30:53,926
with my brothers.

635
00:30:54,606 --> 00:30:55,645
Where?

636
00:30:57,086 --> 00:30:57,966
Zhaohui Courtyard?

637
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:00,485
Mansion's warehouse?

638
00:31:02,206 --> 00:31:03,846
You weren't idle at all.

639
00:31:04,926 --> 00:31:06,326
Why didn't you discuss with me?

640
00:31:07,005 --> 00:31:08,206
You could've used others.

641
00:31:08,206 --> 00:31:09,446
Why did you expose yourself?

642
00:31:10,086 --> 00:31:11,245
You could get yourself killed

643
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:13,285
if you're caught with evidence.

644
00:31:15,405 --> 00:31:16,765
Zhimei, I thought...

645
00:31:16,765 --> 00:31:17,970
You don't have to think at all.

646
00:31:18,686 --> 00:31:20,566
I'll take care of everything for you.

647
00:31:22,885 --> 00:31:23,405
Sure.

648
00:31:25,765 --> 00:31:26,446
I'll listen

649
00:31:28,365 --> 00:31:29,525
to you in everything.

650
00:31:30,966 --> 00:31:31,846
I won't

651
00:31:31,846 --> 00:31:32,926
let you down.

652
00:31:35,206 --> 00:31:35,950
I'll serve the soup

653
00:31:36,525 --> 00:31:37,606
as soon as it's ready.

654
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,400
(Correctional Institution)

655
00:32:02,405 --> 00:32:03,446
(Correctional Institution)
What is the matter?

656
00:32:03,446 --> 00:32:04,846
(Correctional Institution)

657
00:32:04,846 --> 00:32:06,480
The prince is about
to inherit the title.

658
00:32:07,446 --> 00:32:09,206
I thought the good times
would be coming.

659
00:32:10,566 --> 00:32:12,005
How did it come to this?

660
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,270
There will be fear when there're
others looking forward to it.

661
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:18,285
The one who fears the most

662
00:32:18,765 --> 00:32:20,005
is the most impatient.

663
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:22,806
Do you mean Madam Rui?

664
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,930
Both the white phosphorus bottle
and the handkerchief.

665
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,730
The Fang family is the former
master of Quliang.

666
00:32:28,206 --> 00:32:29,005
She doesn't want

667
00:32:29,005 --> 00:32:30,165
any war between two armies,

668
00:32:30,966 --> 00:32:32,525
but when everything is a done deal,

669
00:32:32,846 --> 00:32:34,245
she may as well frame Lian'er

670
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,970
and play along with the drama.

671
00:32:36,806 --> 00:32:37,645
That way,

672
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,405
she can find a scapegoat,

673
00:32:39,405 --> 00:32:40,380
settle down the dispute

674
00:32:40,726 --> 00:32:43,270
and solve the rumour of the spontaneous
combustion of the attire.

675
00:32:44,485 --> 00:32:46,326
I always thought Madam was meticulous.

676
00:32:47,005 --> 00:32:48,926
She is unexpectedly as scheming

677
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:49,926
as Mu Haiyao.

678
00:32:52,606 --> 00:32:53,525
Even when

679
00:32:54,046 --> 00:32:55,885
the two of them have
a long-standing feud,

680
00:32:57,326 --> 00:32:58,885
they have the common enemy now.

681
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,580
I'm afraid Lian'er will
be in more danger

682
00:33:03,326 --> 00:33:04,485
in the future.

683
00:33:05,326 --> 00:33:07,326
If she can't clear her name this time,

684
00:33:08,525 --> 00:33:10,046
there is no future.

685
00:33:15,765 --> 00:33:17,606
Lian'er, what are you thinking?

686
00:33:19,525 --> 00:33:20,326
It's like...

687
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:24,086
It's like the day

688
00:33:24,966 --> 00:33:26,686
I was banished to the secondary courtyard.

689
00:33:27,326 --> 00:33:28,726
It's also a winter day like this.

690
00:33:29,765 --> 00:33:31,046
I was also wronged.

691
00:33:31,686 --> 00:33:33,405
You two bid me farewell too.

692
00:33:39,446 --> 00:33:41,046
I lost all hope

693
00:33:43,365 --> 00:33:45,326
not only because the pain
of losing my child,

694
00:33:46,726 --> 00:33:47,645
but also because

695
00:33:49,165 --> 00:33:50,525
the person I cared the most

696
00:33:51,645 --> 00:33:52,846
refused to believe me.

697
00:33:55,726 --> 00:33:56,566
Does he

698
00:33:57,806 --> 00:33:59,086
believe me today?

699
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,140
(Correctional Institution)

700
00:34:16,606 --> 00:34:17,166
Madam.

701
00:34:19,406 --> 00:34:20,485
Greetings, madams.

702
00:34:20,886 --> 00:34:21,646
The prince wants me

703
00:34:21,886 --> 00:34:23,326
to hand over a letter to Madam Lian.

704
00:34:26,806 --> 00:34:27,406
Thank you.

705
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:43,126
(I believe you and will rescue you.)

706
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:02,126
Your Highness.

707
00:35:02,846 --> 00:35:03,285
How is it?

708
00:35:04,205 --> 00:35:05,205
A letter from Madam Lian.

709
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:15,005
(Thank you. I'll help you.)

710
00:35:18,925 --> 00:35:19,485
Your Highness.

711
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,406
Madam Lian also wants me

712
00:35:21,566 --> 00:35:22,566
to pass you a message.

713
00:35:24,606 --> 00:35:25,245
She said

714
00:35:26,046 --> 00:35:27,086
she would go to Cige'er

715
00:35:29,005 --> 00:35:30,245
for the safety of Quliang.

716
00:35:49,485 --> 00:35:51,366
Skip the formalities!

717
00:35:52,846 --> 00:35:55,046
I couldn't see you
after inheriting the title.

718
00:35:55,685 --> 00:35:56,566
It's been long.

719
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:58,245
So I came on my way.

720
00:35:59,646 --> 00:36:00,205
On your way?

721
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,270
It seems like you're
living a lovely life.

722
00:36:05,925 --> 00:36:06,886
Not bad,

723
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,566
but not as good as you.

724
00:36:09,086 --> 00:36:10,725
You're farming and watering plants.

725
00:36:11,525 --> 00:36:13,005
You should help me out

726
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:15,445
since you have so much free time.

727
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:16,965
What I'm doing

728
00:36:16,965 --> 00:36:18,245
is my own duty.

729
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:19,965
Being badly battered

730
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:21,846
is yours.

731
00:36:33,765 --> 00:36:35,326
It's great

732
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:36,205
that I befriended you.

733
00:36:37,925 --> 00:36:39,765
You're still concerned about me

734
00:36:39,886 --> 00:36:41,205
while enjoying an idyllic life.

735
00:36:42,205 --> 00:36:43,060
You guessed it right.

736
00:36:43,566 --> 00:36:46,366
Cige'er and Quliang
are about to go to war.

737
00:36:46,886 --> 00:36:48,445
Since the situation is pressing,

738
00:36:49,205 --> 00:36:52,285
there is no need to waste your time on me.

739
00:36:53,765 --> 00:36:54,765
Lv Beiyi.

740
00:36:54,925 --> 00:36:56,046
Would you

741
00:36:56,046 --> 00:36:57,806
refuse to work for me?

742
00:36:58,646 --> 00:37:00,685
I never take up the job.
There is no such theory.

743
00:37:04,046 --> 00:37:05,485
Do you remember

744
00:37:06,886 --> 00:37:08,046
our initial agreement?

745
00:37:12,485 --> 00:37:13,646
So this is it.

746
00:37:16,806 --> 00:37:17,326
I remember.

747
00:37:18,326 --> 00:37:19,700
You'd help me to inherit the title.

748
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:22,086
I'd help you to be exempted
from the outcast status.

749
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,166
However,

750
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:25,500
you've inherited the title now.

751
00:37:25,925 --> 00:37:27,005
Yes, I'm the prince now.

752
00:37:27,205 --> 00:37:28,606
However, your outcast status

753
00:37:28,606 --> 00:37:29,606
was granted by my father.

754
00:37:29,846 --> 00:37:32,166
It's not suitable to mention it
during the mourning period.

755
00:37:32,406 --> 00:37:33,566
The mourning period is over.

756
00:37:33,566 --> 00:37:35,126
The coronationof has yet to be held.

757
00:37:35,126 --> 00:37:35,765
He Lianxin!

758
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,080
A great man keeps his promise!

759
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,126
You're going back on your word.

760
00:37:38,126 --> 00:37:38,886
You have no shame.

761
00:37:39,485 --> 00:37:40,485
I am not.

762
00:37:41,646 --> 00:37:42,245
I'm really

763
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,100
in an unstable situation with
internal and external troubles.

764
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:47,965
There's no chance.

765
00:37:49,366 --> 00:37:50,086
However, if...

766
00:37:51,765 --> 00:37:53,485
However, if someone can help me

767
00:37:53,965 --> 00:37:55,126
to have the throne firmly

768
00:37:55,326 --> 00:37:57,606
and resolve the internal
and external troubles.

769
00:37:57,965 --> 00:37:58,725
Maybe

770
00:37:59,205 --> 00:38:00,005
the chance

771
00:38:00,205 --> 00:38:01,646
could come up instantly.

772
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:06,406
I'm also a human.

773
00:38:06,485 --> 00:38:07,765
It's not easy for me.

774
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,965
It's your subordinates
who can share your troubles.

775
00:38:12,366 --> 00:38:13,646
I'm in the outcast status.

776
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,820
I cannot become an officer.
Nor can I serve you.

777
00:38:15,886 --> 00:38:17,086
I can't share your troubles.

778
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,530
Please see yourself out.

779
00:38:19,725 --> 00:38:21,765
Are you chasing me out?

780
00:38:28,646 --> 00:38:29,245
Fine.

781
00:38:35,086 --> 00:38:36,166
Would you even refuse

782
00:38:36,725 --> 00:38:38,005
to help her then?

783
00:38:50,566 --> 00:38:51,285
Stop crying.

784
00:38:51,646 --> 00:38:52,846
It's just a trip to Cige'er.

785
00:38:53,126 --> 00:38:54,725
I'll come back

786
00:38:54,725 --> 00:38:55,725
after the truth is known.

787
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,925
Stop crying.

788
00:39:05,445 --> 00:39:07,126
You sound like it doesn't matter.

789
00:39:07,685 --> 00:39:09,846
Why don't you  let me
and Ranyun go with you?

790
00:39:10,366 --> 00:39:12,319
It's clear that you know
it'll be dangerous.

791
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,830
You're afraid of
getting us involved.

792
00:39:16,925 --> 00:39:17,886
I shouldn't

793
00:39:17,886 --> 00:39:18,886
say this,

794
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,360
but since the prince wants
to trust and rescue you,

795
00:39:22,086 --> 00:39:24,245
he can just have a war with Cige'er.

796
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,800
He didn't have to detain you

797
00:39:25,806 --> 00:39:27,080
in this Correctional Institution.

798
00:39:28,086 --> 00:39:29,925
I'm afraid the prince

799
00:39:30,886 --> 00:39:31,765
values the title

800
00:39:31,765 --> 00:39:33,285
more than you after all.

801
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,660
You mustn't spout nonsense.

802
00:39:35,245 --> 00:39:36,205
The prince is now

803
00:39:36,205 --> 00:39:37,086
the master of Quliang.

804
00:39:38,725 --> 00:39:40,685
He surely has different consideration

805
00:39:40,685 --> 00:39:41,566
from being just a son.

806
00:39:42,285 --> 00:39:43,566
Who else cares

807
00:39:44,005 --> 00:39:45,445
even though you think about Quliang?

808
00:39:45,965 --> 00:39:47,485
Madam Rui would set the tribute on fire

809
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,406
to get rid of you.

810
00:39:52,005 --> 00:39:53,126
The Fang family

811
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,326
had been in charge of Quliang
for hundreds of years.

812
00:39:56,566 --> 00:39:58,285
Madam Rui cares about Quliang

813
00:39:58,886 --> 00:39:59,806
as much as others do.

814
00:40:00,445 --> 00:40:02,485
She wouldn't risk it with a war.

815
00:40:03,326 --> 00:40:04,685
There's only one person

816
00:40:06,205 --> 00:40:07,326
who would hope so.

817
00:40:11,086 --> 00:40:11,886
It's Xiu...

818
00:40:16,366 --> 00:40:17,005
Madam!

819
00:40:17,765 --> 00:40:18,725
Madam!

820
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,640
The prince has mobilised the army.

821
00:40:32,245 --> 00:40:34,445
This war has insufficient recruits.

822
00:40:35,005 --> 00:40:36,005
More than enough.

823
00:40:37,965 --> 00:40:38,765
Then, most of them

824
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,130
are the old, the weak,
the sick and the disabled.

825
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,445
They all are in prime of life.

826
00:40:43,005 --> 00:40:43,925
In this case,

827
00:40:44,566 --> 00:40:46,245
Mu Tianshu can win it alone.

828
00:40:46,965 --> 00:40:48,126
What do you want from me?

829
00:40:49,086 --> 00:40:50,566
Mu Tianshu is valorous,

830
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:51,780
but he's not meticulous enough.

831
00:40:52,566 --> 00:40:53,685
We must win the war.

832
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,245
We need to win cleverly.

833
00:40:56,205 --> 00:40:57,525
I have two requests.

834
00:40:57,846 --> 00:40:58,406
One.

835
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,606
There must be no more than half
as many casualties as in the past.

836
00:41:02,205 --> 00:41:02,685
Two.

837
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:05,100
Looting must not be less than
double the number in the past.

838
00:41:06,525 --> 00:41:07,965
Quliang has ample supply for war.

839
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,660
It's also the first war after
you become the prince.

840
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,030
It concerns your reputation.

841
00:41:12,886 --> 00:41:14,205
You don't have to be so demanding.

842
00:41:15,846 --> 00:41:16,886
There is something

843
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,370
more important than reputation
in Quliang at present.

844
00:41:24,005 --> 00:41:25,285
(No one knows)

845
00:41:26,126 --> 00:41:27,806
(that Luo Qinglian is just the gimmick)

846
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,525
(in the war between
He Lianxin and Cige'er.)

847
00:41:32,525 --> 00:41:33,485
(The late prince died.)

848
00:41:34,245 --> 00:41:35,485
(The princes around Quliang)

849
00:41:35,485 --> 00:41:37,326
(are ready to make trouble.)

850
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,525
(There's criticism among Quliang
officers and the people)

851
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,680
(towards the new Prince An.)

852
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,920
(Internal and external troubles.)

853
00:41:43,925 --> 00:41:45,285
(He Lianxin has to go to war.)

854
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,240
(The success or failure of the war)

855
00:41:47,245 --> 00:41:48,670
(isn't just about the new Prince An.)

856
00:41:48,925 --> 00:41:50,205
(It's about Quliang,)

857
00:41:51,086 --> 00:41:52,965
(Mu's border's fastness.)
