Your Majesty!

00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,476
Your Majesty!

20
00:02:09,317 --> 00:02:11,637
Your Majesty!

21
00:02:22,557 --> 00:02:24,076
(The Young Emperor of Mu)
(In the first year of Qihe reign,)

22
00:02:24,076 --> 00:02:26,677
(the Emperor passed away and
his young son succeeded him.)

23
00:02:27,477 --> 00:02:29,236
(The grand chancellor fully
supported the young ruler.)

24
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:31,757
(The political situation was
unstable and unpredictable.)

25
00:02:31,957 --> 00:02:32,917
(After some changes,)

26
00:02:33,716 --> 00:02:35,120
(Prince of An of Quliang, Mu)
(the great general, He Yunshuo,)

27
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,837
(He Yunshuo (middle-aged) )
was appointed as Prince of An)

28
00:02:36,636 --> 00:02:38,837
(and he went to a barren
land at the border.)

29
00:02:40,317 --> 00:02:41,236
(When he first entered Quliang,)

30
00:02:41,557 --> 00:02:43,037
(he saw only a desolate land.)

31
00:02:43,903 --> 00:02:45,224
(Quliang)

32
00:02:46,356 --> 00:02:47,076
Quliang.

33
00:02:47,716 --> 00:02:48,876
(The land was not cultivated yet.)

34
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:49,876
(So were the people.)

35
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:51,636
(They faced attacks from other tribes,)

36
00:02:52,076 --> 00:02:53,477
(as well as internal conflicts
from the barbarians.)

37
00:02:53,516 --> 00:02:55,356
(He Yunshuo quelled the unrest,)

38
00:02:55,356 --> 00:02:56,397
(gathered the talent,)

39
00:02:56,516 --> 00:02:57,716
(convinced the people with his virtues)

40
00:02:57,757 --> 00:02:58,837
(and worked extremely
hard to manage the land.)

41
00:02:58,876 --> 00:03:00,477
(After putting in effort for 30 years,)

42
00:03:00,557 --> 00:03:01,516
(he managed to turn Quliang)

43
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,436
(into a prosperous city.)

44
00:03:04,037 --> 00:03:04,596
Move over!

00:03:04,596 --> 00:03:05,236

51
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:10,596
Stop running!

52
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:15,677
Bravo!

Luo Qinglian)

Move over!

58
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:29,596
Don't push me.

Stop running!

60
00:03:32,117 --> 00:03:32,677

(Official Luo Rongyu's elder son,
Luo Zhanxuan)

00:03:40,677 --> 00:03:41,317
Move over!

63
00:03:45,796 --> 00:03:47,277
Where do you think you can go?

64
00:03:47,397 --> 00:03:47,996
How dare you

65
00:03:48,236 --> 00:03:49,436
try to lay a finger on your master.

66
00:03:50,876 --> 00:03:52,837
What are you waiting for? Go!

67
00:03:53,117 --> 00:03:54,317
Luo Zhanxuan, seriously?

68
00:03:54,716 --> 00:03:55,557
Whatever.

69
00:03:55,557 --> 00:03:56,356
Get her!

70
00:03:59,436 --> 00:03:59,917
Bring it on.

71
00:04:00,557 --> 00:04:01,596
It's so painful.

72
00:04:01,796 --> 00:04:03,037
Get her.

73
00:04:12,236 --> 00:04:12,876
It's so painful.

74
00:04:12,876 --> 00:04:13,796
I didn't even touch it.

75
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:15,197
Don't touch it.

76
00:04:15,596 --> 00:04:16,477
The heaven is fair.

77
00:04:17,076 --> 00:04:17,996
Who asked you to play favourites?

78
00:04:17,996 --> 00:04:18,716
Shut up!

79
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:19,837
(Luo Qinglian's mother, Mrs.Luo-Gong)

80
00:04:19,837 --> 00:04:20,716
How can you speak

81
00:04:20,716 --> 00:04:21,677
to your mother like that?

82
00:04:22,036 --> 00:04:22,997
You sold

83
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:23,957
your daughter out for your son.

84
00:04:23,957 --> 00:04:24,636
Nonsense.

85
00:04:26,356 --> 00:04:27,557
I'm not selling you out.

86
00:04:28,597 --> 00:04:31,157
The prince has been
in Quliang for 30 years.

87
00:04:31,277 --> 00:04:33,036
It's the only time he's selecting
a lady to be his concubine.

88
00:04:33,597 --> 00:04:34,756
Many would

89
00:04:34,756 --> 00:04:36,397
hope to become his concubine.

90
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:37,877
You're lucky.

91
00:04:38,076 --> 00:04:38,837
As your mother,

92
00:04:39,437 --> 00:04:40,397
I won't allow you

93
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:41,877
to miss the opportunity.

94
00:04:42,877 --> 00:04:43,877
I wouldn't want

95
00:04:44,476 --> 00:04:45,117
such luck.

96
00:04:45,356 --> 00:04:46,717
It's not up to you.

97
00:04:47,557 --> 00:04:49,957
The prince never held
a selection before this.

98
00:04:50,277 --> 00:04:51,117
This time,

99
00:04:51,316 --> 00:04:52,997
the Emperor issued an order

100
00:04:52,997 --> 00:04:54,277
for the prince to remarry.

101
00:04:54,636 --> 00:04:55,597
You can ask around.

102
00:04:55,877 --> 00:04:57,636
Everyone is trying so hard

103
00:04:57,636 --> 00:04:59,117
to enter the mansion for the selection.

104
00:04:59,117 --> 00:05:00,196
People have been asking around.

105
00:05:00,557 --> 00:05:02,196
I am lucky

106
00:05:02,597 --> 00:05:03,316
to have found out

107
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:05,397
that Lady Yao, the wife of
the prince's third son, He Lianxin,

108
00:05:05,397 --> 00:05:06,557
is trying to groom a lady.

109
00:05:07,157 --> 00:05:09,236
Without the information, it wouldn't
even matter even if we had money.

110
00:05:10,036 --> 00:05:11,397
I heard that

111
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:12,877
Lady Yao promised

112
00:05:13,157 --> 00:05:14,316
to give my brother

113
00:05:14,636 --> 00:05:15,916
a position in the mansion

114
00:05:16,157 --> 00:05:16,997
if I was selected.

115
00:05:18,636 --> 00:05:20,437
Mother, is this true?

116
00:05:23,196 --> 00:05:24,356
So what if it's true?

117
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:24,957
Well,

118
00:05:25,236 --> 00:05:27,157
we've raised you up.

119
00:05:27,397 --> 00:05:28,356
What's wrong with contributing

120
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:29,636
to the family and your brother's career?

121
00:05:30,356 --> 00:05:30,877
Brother.

122
00:05:33,476 --> 00:05:34,356
You'll be an official.

123
00:05:35,036 --> 00:05:35,877
Are you happy?

124
00:05:37,877 --> 00:05:38,437
Sister.

125
00:05:39,557 --> 00:05:41,036
I'll remember what you do for me.

126
00:05:42,597 --> 00:05:43,717
All of you are happy.

127
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:44,916
What about me?

128
00:06:05,796 --> 00:06:06,196
He's awesome.

129
00:06:06,516 --> 00:06:07,036
Yes.

130
00:06:07,157 --> 00:06:08,516
He kicked the carriage away.

131
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:10,837
Bravo!

132
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:11,677
Bravo!

133
00:06:11,677 --> 00:06:12,997
Bravo!

134
00:06:13,196 --> 00:06:14,557
He kicked the carriage right away.

135
00:06:14,997 --> 00:06:15,756
He's awesome.

136
00:06:15,756 --> 00:06:16,677
Bravo!

137
00:06:17,516 --> 00:06:18,196
Yi.

138
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:37,636
How is it?

139
00:06:39,557 --> 00:06:40,677
There's no suitable candidate.

140
00:06:41,356 --> 00:06:42,236
There's none.

141
00:06:42,717 --> 00:06:44,397
(Mu Haiyao's maid, Ruhua)
There's one, Luo Qinglian.

142
00:06:44,636 --> 00:06:45,677
Her mother tried all means

143
00:06:45,677 --> 00:06:46,597
to register her name,

144
00:06:46,717 --> 00:06:47,837
but for an unknown reason,

145
00:06:47,837 --> 00:06:48,476
she didn't show up.

146
00:06:50,437 --> 00:06:51,356
She might not be good enough.

147
00:06:51,837 --> 00:06:53,236
She might not even make it
even if she showed up.

148
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:00,677
Pardon me, Madam.

149
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,277
I hurt my finger a few days ago.

150
00:07:02,437 --> 00:07:03,316
This is an accident.

151
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:05,996
(He Lianxin‘s concubine, Mu Haiyao)

152
00:07:06,157 --> 00:07:07,756
You can't do anything well.

153
00:07:08,316 --> 00:07:09,356
Since your finger is hurt,

154
00:07:09,636 --> 00:07:10,916
what's the point of keeping it?

155
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:11,715
(Mu Haiyao's maid, Lan)

156
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:12,557
Madam.

157
00:07:12,796 --> 00:07:13,437
Get someone here!

158
00:07:14,437 --> 00:07:15,557
Madam, spare my life!

159
00:07:15,837 --> 00:07:16,316
Madam!

160
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:17,837
No, Madam!

161
00:07:18,516 --> 00:07:19,117
Madam!

162
00:07:19,437 --> 00:07:20,076
Madam!

163
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:21,597
Madam, save me!

164
00:07:21,957 --> 00:07:23,557
Madam, I was wrong!

165
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:33,036
Madam,

166
00:07:33,717 --> 00:07:34,837
I wonder who's the one

167
00:07:34,837 --> 00:07:35,557
in the portrait.

168
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:37,877
Why must we pick one that resembles her?

169
00:07:38,516 --> 00:07:39,557
The one in the portrait

170
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,236
is the cause of the prince's condition

171
00:07:42,117 --> 00:07:43,597
and will bring good
fortune to my husband.

172
00:07:58,397 --> 00:07:58,916
Your Highness

173
00:07:59,717 --> 00:08:00,957
the heir and Mr. Lianxiu

174
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:02,117
are visiting you.

175
00:08:02,236 --> 00:08:03,277
They're waiting by the door.

176
00:08:04,437 --> 00:08:05,036
Yu Dechang.

177
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:05,717
Yes, Your Highness.

178
00:08:06,516 --> 00:08:07,397
What's the date?

179
00:08:08,076 --> 00:08:08,877
Your Highness,

180
00:08:09,717 --> 00:08:11,397
today is the first day of the month.

181
00:08:12,597 --> 00:08:13,557
It's the ninth lunar month.

182
00:08:16,117 --> 00:08:17,356
The ninth lunar month.

183
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:20,796
30 years.

184
00:08:21,516 --> 00:08:23,756
You've been gone for 30 years.

185
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:26,957
I'm already old,

186
00:08:33,957 --> 00:08:35,877
but I keep thinking about you

187
00:08:38,277 --> 00:08:40,917
and the days we spent together.

188
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:42,600
(Prince of An of Quliang, Mu)
He Yunshuo (middle-aged) )

189
00:09:00,676 --> 00:09:01,917
The prince will not meet anyone.

190
00:09:02,397 --> 00:09:04,277
(He Yunshuo's attendant, Yu Dechang)
Every autumn is hard for him.

191
00:09:05,076 --> 00:09:05,717
The prince remembers

192
00:09:05,717 --> 00:09:07,157
what the late princess
said from her deathbed.

193
00:09:07,556 --> 00:09:08,676
He tends to fall sick
in this period of time.

194
00:09:11,157 --> 00:09:12,797
Father loved the late princess dearly.

195
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,636
Lianchu, you're fortunate.

196
00:09:14,996 --> 00:09:16,875
(He Yunshuo's second son,
the Heir of Prince of An, He Lianchu)

197
00:09:17,076 --> 00:09:18,196
Not at all.

198
00:09:19,076 --> 00:09:19,837
I have

199
00:09:20,357 --> 00:09:21,397
no mother to dote on me.

200
00:09:23,876 --> 00:09:24,357
By the way,

201
00:09:25,636 --> 00:09:26,397
I heard

202
00:09:26,837 --> 00:09:27,957
father is requesting the Emperor

203
00:09:27,957 --> 00:09:29,516
to grant titles for his adult sons.

204
00:09:30,756 --> 00:09:32,436
Our eldest brother

205
00:09:32,436 --> 00:09:33,397
can be appointed as
a prince of a commandery.

206
00:09:33,797 --> 00:09:34,397
Lianxiu.

207
00:09:34,717 --> 00:09:36,037
You have a good reputation.

208
00:09:36,996 --> 00:09:38,917
Who knows? You might be appointed

209
00:09:39,116 --> 00:09:39,996
as General of Illustrious Virtue.

210
00:09:43,597 --> 00:09:44,876
My position as the heir

211
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:45,837
might

212
00:09:47,237 --> 00:09:48,357
be replaced by any of you, right,

213
00:09:48,436 --> 00:09:49,037
Lianxiu?

214
00:09:49,477 --> 00:09:50,756
(He Yunshuo's forth son, He Lianxiu)
Lianchu, you must be kidding me.

215
00:09:51,237 --> 00:09:52,397
You have great talent and virtues

216
00:09:52,397 --> 00:09:53,676
and are favoured by father.

217
00:09:54,196 --> 00:09:54,756
None of us

218
00:09:55,157 --> 00:09:56,397
would dare to even think about it.

219
00:09:58,237 --> 00:09:59,076
You're right.

220
00:10:00,316 --> 00:10:00,996
What are you holding?

221
00:10:11,837 --> 00:10:13,037
It's for father, right?

222
00:10:15,556 --> 00:10:16,157
You're thoughtful.

223
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,157
Father is sick.

224
00:10:19,316 --> 00:10:20,477
I don't think he's in the mood.

225
00:10:23,516 --> 00:10:25,076
Lianchu, if you like it,

226
00:10:27,597 --> 00:10:28,756
you may take it.

227
00:10:38,316 --> 00:10:39,237
It's indeed not bad.

228
00:10:40,797 --> 00:10:41,436
What a pity,

229
00:10:41,676 --> 00:10:42,676
father didn't even

230
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:44,316
see this.

231
00:10:47,477 --> 00:10:47,957
Lianxin!

232
00:10:48,116 --> 00:10:50,597
It's the heir and Lianxiu.

233
00:10:51,357 --> 00:10:52,116
What

234
00:10:53,516 --> 00:10:54,516
are you doing here?

235
00:10:54,676 --> 00:10:55,597
Are you seeking shelter from the heat?

236
00:10:55,957 --> 00:10:56,556
Come on.

237
00:10:56,797 --> 00:10:57,957
Make a sound.

238
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:02,676
Lianxin.

239
00:11:07,436 --> 00:11:08,636
Everyone says you're relaxed.

240
00:11:08,996 --> 00:11:09,636
I didn't expect

241
00:11:10,277 --> 00:11:11,556
Lianxin to be the most thoughtful.

242
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:12,315
(He Yunshuo's third son, He Lianxin)

243
00:11:12,516 --> 00:11:13,477
Thoughtful?

244
00:11:13,837 --> 00:11:14,797
What do you mean?

245
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,957
Father is bothered lately.

246
00:11:18,436 --> 00:11:19,676
With this parrot entertaining him,

247
00:11:20,397 --> 00:11:21,196
I bet

248
00:11:21,837 --> 00:11:23,076
he'll cheer up in no time.

249
00:11:23,876 --> 00:11:24,717
Hold on.

250
00:11:24,996 --> 00:11:26,196
Did I say I was giving it to father?

251
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,037
Aren't you?

252
00:11:27,237 --> 00:11:28,316
Of course not.

253
00:11:28,797 --> 00:11:29,196
This...

254
00:11:29,797 --> 00:11:31,037
Father wouldn't like this.

255
00:11:31,797 --> 00:11:32,636
You have no idea

256
00:11:33,037 --> 00:11:34,316
how difficult it is to handle the bird.

257
00:11:34,756 --> 00:11:35,636
In order to make it talk,

258
00:11:35,636 --> 00:11:37,676
I have not slept well for two weeks.

259
00:11:38,477 --> 00:11:39,037
Lianxin.

260
00:11:39,556 --> 00:11:40,316
The bird is not bad.

261
00:11:40,676 --> 00:11:41,717
If you give it to father,

262
00:11:42,037 --> 00:11:42,797
he might be pleased

263
00:11:42,996 --> 00:11:43,516
and even

264
00:11:43,797 --> 00:11:44,876
appoint you as General of Protection.

265
00:11:45,116 --> 00:11:46,037
No way.

266
00:11:46,196 --> 00:11:47,277
Don't get me involved.

267
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:49,357
I'm already busy feeding the bird.

268
00:11:49,436 --> 00:11:50,876
I don't want to be a general.

269
00:11:53,477 --> 00:11:53,996
Everyone says Lianxin

270
00:11:53,996 --> 00:11:55,157
is the most idle person in the world.

271
00:11:55,717 --> 00:11:57,116
They're right.

272
00:11:59,957 --> 00:12:00,477
Yu Dechang.

273
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:03,316
Pass this to my father

274
00:12:04,076 --> 00:12:04,717
and tell him

275
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:07,357
it's from me.

276
00:12:09,037 --> 00:12:09,516
Lianxin.

277
00:12:09,837 --> 00:12:10,876
Bring the bird

278
00:12:11,316 --> 00:12:12,397
and visit me in my mansion someday!

279
00:12:12,477 --> 00:12:12,996
Sure!

280
00:12:15,797 --> 00:12:17,556
Come on, greet Lianxiu.

281
00:12:21,676 --> 00:12:22,436
It's useless.

282
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:23,556
Fine.

283
00:12:23,556 --> 00:12:24,436
Go on.

284
00:12:25,556 --> 00:12:26,397
(Qingkang Hall)
Lianxin, take care.

285
00:12:27,477 --> 00:12:28,516
Can't you make a sound?

286
00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:40,717
Mr. Yu.

287
00:12:41,237 --> 00:12:41,957
Young Master Xiu.

288
00:12:42,477 --> 00:12:43,237
Does my father

289
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:46,237
seriously want to remarry?

290
00:12:46,676 --> 00:12:47,876
I dare not speculate

291
00:12:48,357 --> 00:12:49,837
the prince's intention.

292
00:12:50,797 --> 00:12:52,756
The Emperor understood the prince's

293
00:12:52,756 --> 00:12:54,477
deep longing for the late princess.

294
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:56,917
So he ordered the prince to remarry,

295
00:12:57,157 --> 00:12:58,957
hoping that someone

296
00:12:58,957 --> 00:13:00,037
can stay by the prince's side

297
00:13:00,157 --> 00:13:01,717
to talk to him and keep him company.

298
00:13:02,996 --> 00:13:04,076
I just hope that

299
00:13:04,436 --> 00:13:05,717
there will be a lady

300
00:13:05,957 --> 00:13:06,957
who resembles

301
00:13:06,957 --> 00:13:08,597
the late princess tomorrow.

302
00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:11,597
That way, the prince might feel better.

303
00:13:17,636 --> 00:13:18,676
I agree to join the selection.

304
00:13:19,636 --> 00:13:20,316
What did you say?

305
00:13:22,157 --> 00:13:23,116
Yi came just now

306
00:13:23,116 --> 00:13:24,076
to bid farewell to me.

307
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:26,636
I loved him so much,

308
00:13:27,076 --> 00:13:28,357
yet he's such a coward.

309
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:30,277
Lian'er.

310
00:13:30,797 --> 00:13:31,436
Let's

311
00:13:32,116 --> 00:13:33,316
go to Young Master Xin's mansion.

312
00:13:33,636 --> 00:13:34,797
Don't keep Lady Yao waiting.

313
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:35,397
Hold on.

314
00:13:36,277 --> 00:13:37,556
I agreed to join the selection,

315
00:13:38,076 --> 00:13:39,516
but I'm not meeting Lady Yao.

316
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:40,837
Are you crazy?

317
00:13:41,756 --> 00:13:42,917
Lady Yao is well-connected

318
00:13:43,116 --> 00:13:44,436
in the mansion.

319
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,116
With her help,

320
00:13:46,676 --> 00:13:48,996
you'll stand a good chance
for the selection.

321
00:13:49,277 --> 00:13:50,996
If I can't rely on my own,

322
00:13:51,237 --> 00:13:52,157
what's the point

323
00:13:52,157 --> 00:13:53,277
of entering the mansion?

324
00:13:53,837 --> 00:13:54,477
Also,

325
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:55,556
I wouldn't want

326
00:13:55,556 --> 00:13:56,717
to be manipulated by Lady Yao

327
00:13:57,116 --> 00:13:57,837
for the rest of my life.

328
00:14:04,116 --> 00:14:05,237
This preliminary

329
00:14:05,676 --> 00:14:07,397
is just a routine examination.

330
00:14:07,717 --> 00:14:09,837
Ladies, please don't be nervous.

331
00:14:10,157 --> 00:14:11,157
A few days after the preliminary,

332
00:14:11,436 --> 00:14:13,316
we'll hold a second selection.

333
00:14:13,756 --> 00:14:15,797
If you're selected by the prince,

334
00:14:16,436 --> 00:14:18,076
you can join the family

335
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,237
as a concubine.

336
00:14:19,636 --> 00:14:21,996
It'll be an honour.

337
00:14:23,316 --> 00:14:24,037
The first group.

338
00:14:35,316 --> 00:14:35,797
Keep her.

339
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:36,357
Keep her.

340
00:14:39,116 --> 00:14:40,157
The second group.

341
00:14:47,597 --> 00:14:48,477
Retreat!

342
00:15:08,556 --> 00:15:10,316
Greetings, Lady Yao.

343
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:11,676
Skip it.

344
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,160
(He Lianxiu's Wife, Ruan Zhimei)

345
00:15:52,277 --> 00:15:53,876
Greetings, Lady Mei.

346
00:15:54,316 --> 00:15:55,397
Thanks you.

347
00:15:57,237 --> 00:15:58,316
Lady Mei, you're here, too.

348
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,357
Lady Mei, you're thoughtful.

349
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:02,876
You're assisting

350
00:16:02,876 --> 00:16:03,917
Young Master Xiu in every way.

351
00:16:04,357 --> 00:16:05,357
Lady Yao, you treat Lianxin

352
00:16:05,357 --> 00:16:06,196
the same way.

353
00:16:07,357 --> 00:16:07,876
By the way,

354
00:16:08,237 --> 00:16:09,837
it's been a while since I met Lianxin.

355
00:16:10,116 --> 00:16:10,837
I wonder

356
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:12,196
whether he has any new toy.

357
00:16:12,676 --> 00:16:13,797
What else?

358
00:16:14,756 --> 00:16:15,597
He keeps

359
00:16:15,597 --> 00:16:16,837
bringing back jewellery.

360
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:19,876
I only have a head

361
00:16:20,516 --> 00:16:21,237
and a pair of hands.

362
00:16:21,636 --> 00:16:22,837
I cannot wear them all.

363
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:25,436
I should be like you, Lady Mei,

364
00:16:25,597 --> 00:16:27,196
and dress plainly.

365
00:16:34,636 --> 00:16:35,837
(Ruan Zhimei's maid, Liuyan)
Madam, you're patient.

366
00:16:36,237 --> 00:16:37,357
She's just a concubine.

367
00:16:37,837 --> 00:16:39,277
Just because her father is powerful,

368
00:16:39,597 --> 00:16:41,037
she's so rude to you.

369
00:16:41,277 --> 00:16:43,076
Her father is Nanjing's
surveillance commissioner.

370
00:16:43,237 --> 00:16:44,636
Even the prince has to respect him.

371
00:16:45,357 --> 00:16:46,157
She has every right

372
00:16:46,157 --> 00:16:47,397
to be arrogant.

373
00:16:51,237 --> 00:16:52,477
Anyone but her

374
00:16:52,477 --> 00:16:54,116
can mock Young Master Xin.

375
00:16:54,636 --> 00:16:55,957
Back then, she and Young Master Xin...

376
00:16:56,837 --> 00:16:57,957
What happened between him and her?

377
00:16:58,717 --> 00:16:59,676
Why didn't I know?

378
00:17:00,316 --> 00:17:01,196
Pardon me.

379
00:17:05,436 --> 00:17:07,116
Young Master Xin is idling everyday.

380
00:17:07,477 --> 00:17:08,597
He's simply a rich spoilt brat

381
00:17:08,597 --> 00:17:09,556
who is hopeless,

382
00:17:10,076 --> 00:17:11,396
but Young Master Xiu

383
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:13,757
is well-known for his virtues.

384
00:17:13,957 --> 00:17:16,076
Enough, find the right lady.

385
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,076
Find the right lady.

386
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:18,877
If Lady Mei gets ahead of me,

387
00:17:19,316 --> 00:17:20,757
I'll make you pay.

388
00:17:21,276 --> 00:17:21,916
Yes.

389
00:17:46,637 --> 00:17:48,676
Madam, there's none.

390
00:17:56,237 --> 00:17:57,436
How is it? Have you found one?

391
00:17:58,036 --> 00:17:58,556
Madam,

392
00:17:59,156 --> 00:18:00,997
they don't resemble the person
in the portrait at all.

393
00:18:01,517 --> 00:18:03,036
I really can't find one.

394
00:18:07,276 --> 00:18:07,877
However,

395
00:18:08,076 --> 00:18:09,196
I heard Jinfang,

396
00:18:09,196 --> 00:18:09,957
the senior maid of Qingkang Hall,

397
00:18:09,957 --> 00:18:11,676
once served the late princess.

398
00:18:12,076 --> 00:18:12,637
If...

399
00:18:12,637 --> 00:18:13,436
What?

400
00:18:14,196 --> 00:18:14,957
If I could get her help,

401
00:18:14,957 --> 00:18:16,076
why would I even need you?

402
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:17,997
Madam, calm down.

403
00:18:18,237 --> 00:18:19,156
If you asked me,

404
00:18:19,357 --> 00:18:20,117
I don't think Lady Mei

405
00:18:20,117 --> 00:18:21,436
has the upper hand.

406
00:18:25,117 --> 00:18:25,916
What to do?

407
00:18:26,837 --> 00:18:27,837
If we can't find one that resembles her,

408
00:18:28,396 --> 00:18:29,916
find one that is pretty.

409
00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:10,556
Lift your head.

410
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:13,556
Lady Yao is talking to you.

411
00:19:13,556 --> 00:19:14,396
Don't you hear her?

412
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:17,316
How dare you

413
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:18,196
go against

414
00:19:18,196 --> 00:19:19,156
Lady Yao.

415
00:19:19,156 --> 00:19:20,196
Put down your hand.

416
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:25,036
I told you to put down your hand!

417
00:19:32,676 --> 00:19:33,997
I look hideous.

418
00:19:34,556 --> 00:19:35,597
I didn't want to scare you, Madam.

419
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:36,676
So I covered it.

420
00:19:37,436 --> 00:19:38,796
How dare you join the selection
when you look like this.

421
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:39,717
Get lost.

422
00:19:39,837 --> 00:19:40,436
Yes.

423
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:44,997
Hold on!

424
00:20:29,997 --> 00:20:30,517
Go on.

425
00:21:32,676 --> 00:21:33,877
Don't tell me

426
00:21:34,357 --> 00:21:35,117
I can't find one that resembles her

427
00:21:35,117 --> 00:21:35,957
in Quliang.

428
00:21:39,396 --> 00:21:40,676
Are you Lady Yao

429
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:41,597
of Young Master Xin's mansion?

430
00:21:43,156 --> 00:21:43,837
I am.

431
00:21:44,477 --> 00:21:45,237
Who are you?

432
00:21:47,036 --> 00:21:48,556
I'm here to pass you a message.

433
00:21:49,477 --> 00:21:51,237
The girl whom you just chased away

434
00:21:52,036 --> 00:21:54,076
resembles the late
princess a great deal.

435
00:21:54,757 --> 00:21:55,837
Had you met the late princess?

436
00:21:58,237 --> 00:22:00,196
It's nothing special if she
resembles her in appearance.

437
00:22:00,837 --> 00:22:01,957
The thing is

438
00:22:02,357 --> 00:22:05,477
her temperament and behaviour

439
00:22:05,597 --> 00:22:07,357
is almost the same as the late princess.

440
00:22:11,316 --> 00:22:12,877
Are you Madam Jinfang?

441
00:22:15,517 --> 00:22:17,316
Madam, please tell Young Master Xin

442
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,196
I've returned his favour.

443
00:22:21,517 --> 00:22:22,156
Madam.

444
00:22:22,436 --> 00:22:23,117
The girl

445
00:22:23,117 --> 00:22:24,276
has such a huge mark on her face.

446
00:22:24,556 --> 00:22:25,717
Even if she resembles her,

447
00:22:26,316 --> 00:22:27,556
it will be pointless.

448
00:22:28,676 --> 00:22:30,237
The ladies in the mansion

449
00:22:30,837 --> 00:22:31,997
are like tree leaves.

450
00:22:32,957 --> 00:22:34,556
No matter how well they grow in spring,

451
00:22:34,757 --> 00:22:35,237
they end up falling

452
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:36,837
in autumn.

453
00:22:37,316 --> 00:22:38,796
Sometimes, I wonder.

454
00:22:39,757 --> 00:22:41,796
Between those who try so hard to stay

455
00:22:42,757 --> 00:22:44,957
and those who try so hard not to stay,

456
00:22:46,076 --> 00:22:47,837
who's smarter?

457
00:22:51,076 --> 00:22:52,117
I'll make a move first.

458
00:22:55,597 --> 00:22:57,117
She doesn't want to be chosen.

459
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:04,556
Miss!

460
00:23:05,757 --> 00:23:06,237
Miss.

461
00:23:06,517 --> 00:23:07,837
Why are you out alone?

462
00:23:08,196 --> 00:23:09,076
I was chased out.

463
00:23:09,196 --> 00:23:09,957
Why?

464
00:23:10,396 --> 00:23:11,156
I'm ugly.

465
00:23:12,637 --> 00:23:14,556
(Luo Qinglian's maid, Dongli)
Are those in the mansion blind?

466
00:23:14,997 --> 00:23:15,717
(Prince of An's Mansion)
Aren't you leaving?

467
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,156
Why don't you give it a try?

468
00:23:18,036 --> 00:23:18,637
Miss.

469
00:23:18,637 --> 00:23:19,676
You're pretty.

470
00:23:19,676 --> 00:23:20,676
Why would you fail?

471
00:23:20,837 --> 00:23:22,237
Someone must have played a trick.

472
00:23:23,076 --> 00:23:23,637
Oh no.

473
00:23:24,156 --> 00:23:25,276
Madam has even bought firecrackers.

474
00:23:25,276 --> 00:23:26,837
She's waiting for good news.

475
00:23:27,076 --> 00:23:27,676
Get in.

476
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,140
(Lv's Clinic)

477
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,760
(Noble Physician of Quliang, Lv Beiyi)

478
00:23:47,637 --> 00:23:49,717
Physician Lu.

479
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:51,597
My condition...

480
00:23:56,196 --> 00:23:57,316
My apologies.

481
00:23:58,117 --> 00:24:00,357
So this is how the best
physician in Quliang

482
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:01,597
does pulse diagnosis.

483
00:24:04,796 --> 00:24:05,637
Are you done?

484
00:24:07,997 --> 00:24:09,316
Are you chosen?

485
00:24:12,036 --> 00:24:13,396
Physician Lu, your medicine

486
00:24:13,717 --> 00:24:14,556
is so effective,

487
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:15,597
seriously.

488
00:24:16,316 --> 00:24:17,957
It'd be hard for me to be chosen.

489
00:24:18,076 --> 00:24:18,637
Seriously?

490
00:24:21,357 --> 00:24:22,436
Does your face

491
00:24:22,997 --> 00:24:23,597
hurt?

492
00:24:24,316 --> 00:24:25,237
Even if it does,

493
00:24:26,276 --> 00:24:27,036
I'm not afraid.

494
00:24:34,676 --> 00:24:35,237
Come on.

495
00:24:35,676 --> 00:24:36,196
My apologies.

496
00:24:36,196 --> 00:24:36,796
My apologies.

497
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,730
(Lv's Clinic)

498
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:39,436
My apologies,

499
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,396
everyone.

500
00:24:40,597 --> 00:24:42,477
I, Lu Beiyi, have good news today.

501
00:24:42,676 --> 00:24:43,556
My business will close for a day.

502
00:24:43,796 --> 00:24:44,957
Please come again tomorrow.

503
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:45,957
The medicine and consultation

504
00:24:46,237 --> 00:24:46,916
will be free!

505
00:24:47,156 --> 00:24:50,036
Bravo!

506
00:24:50,036 --> 00:24:51,036
Thank you.

507
00:24:51,036 --> 00:24:52,436
Thank you.

508
00:24:52,436 --> 00:24:53,357
Thank you.

509
00:24:53,357 --> 00:24:53,916
Thank you.

510
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:54,997
Thank you.

511
00:24:59,237 --> 00:25:00,396
She indeed doesn't have a mark.

512
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:01,477
Madam.

513
00:25:01,556 --> 00:25:02,757
The girl was audacious

514
00:25:02,757 --> 00:25:03,837
for trying to deceive the prince.

515
00:25:04,357 --> 00:25:05,357
Since she deceived the prince,

516
00:25:05,357 --> 00:25:06,076
report it to the authority.

517
00:25:06,717 --> 00:25:08,316
Understood. I'll go now.

518
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:14,997
Father,

519
00:25:15,796 --> 00:25:16,597
Sorry for being an unfilial daughter

520
00:25:17,117 --> 00:25:18,796
and deciding my marriage on my own.

521
00:25:19,957 --> 00:25:20,436
Look.

522
00:25:20,717 --> 00:25:21,637
Yi

523
00:25:21,877 --> 00:25:23,237
is just a physician,

524
00:25:23,436 --> 00:25:24,357
(Bureau of Literature's Official, Luo Rongyu)
but he's the best physician

525
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:25,396
in Quliang.

526
00:25:26,117 --> 00:25:27,517
Also, he's gifted.

527
00:25:28,316 --> 00:25:30,517
He's knowledgeable and knows
ways of managing a country.

528
00:25:30,877 --> 00:25:31,556
He's simply

529
00:25:31,556 --> 00:25:32,676
one in a million.

530
00:25:33,357 --> 00:25:34,837
He doesn't want to
be an official, because

531
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:35,837
like me,

532
00:25:35,837 --> 00:25:37,196
he can't stand the corruption
among officials.

533
00:25:37,396 --> 00:25:38,997
He just wants to be an honest

534
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:40,436
and ordinary man.

535
00:25:41,117 --> 00:25:42,117
I'm not seeking wealth.

536
00:25:42,396 --> 00:25:43,877
I'm only seeking true love.

537
00:25:45,637 --> 00:25:46,916
You're seeking true love.

538
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:48,477
I understand.

539
00:25:48,837 --> 00:25:50,637
I watched Beiyi as he grew up.

540
00:25:51,276 --> 00:25:52,036
This kid

541
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,556
is destined for great things.

542
00:25:56,237 --> 00:25:57,556
To succeed,

543
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:00,517
being an official is not the only way.

544
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:03,796
My Lian'er has a good eye.

545
00:26:04,837 --> 00:26:05,717
You won't end up having

546
00:26:05,717 --> 00:26:07,316
a bad husband.

547
00:26:09,237 --> 00:26:09,757
Father.

548
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:11,237
So you agree?

549
00:26:12,357 --> 00:26:13,276
Father, do you agree?

550
00:26:15,477 --> 00:26:16,276
I

551
00:26:16,477 --> 00:26:17,916
feel bad.

552
00:26:22,517 --> 00:26:23,997
I've let you down.

553
00:26:24,196 --> 00:26:25,436
I can't even afford to give you

554
00:26:25,436 --> 00:26:26,556
any presentable dowry.

555
00:26:27,477 --> 00:26:28,837
Says who?

556
00:26:30,877 --> 00:26:31,957
My best dowry

557
00:26:32,796 --> 00:26:34,036
is having a good father.

558
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:46,877
Physician Lu is here.

559
00:26:48,957 --> 00:26:49,796
Physician Lu is here.

560
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,340
(Luo’s Residence)

561
00:26:58,517 --> 00:26:59,357
Congratulations.

562
00:27:00,597 --> 00:27:01,796
The bride is out, too.

563
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,156
They're indeed rich.

564
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:09,556
She's gorgeous.

565
00:27:12,156 --> 00:27:13,196
The bride is out.

566
00:27:13,637 --> 00:27:14,396
Good.

567
00:27:14,396 --> 00:27:15,076
Congratulations.

568
00:27:15,396 --> 00:27:16,357
Congratulations, Physician Lu.

569
00:27:16,357 --> 00:27:17,036
Congratulations.

570
00:27:17,597 --> 00:27:18,477
They're a match made in heaven.

571
00:27:18,477 --> 00:27:19,036
Congratulations.

572
00:27:21,757 --> 00:27:22,316
They're blessed.

573
00:27:22,316 --> 00:27:22,997
Yes.

574
00:27:22,997 --> 00:27:23,877
Congratulations.

575
00:27:24,316 --> 00:27:25,276
They're a match made in heaven.

576
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:25,916
They look good.

577
00:27:26,757 --> 00:27:27,757
I wish to have the same good luck.

578
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,676
Congratulations.

579
00:27:30,117 --> 00:27:31,036
Congratulations.

580
00:27:33,517 --> 00:27:34,396
Awesome.

581
00:27:34,396 --> 00:27:35,117
She has a good eye.

582
00:27:35,837 --> 00:27:36,357
Hurry up!

583
00:27:36,477 --> 00:27:37,156
Hurry up!

584
00:27:37,477 --> 00:27:37,957
Hurry up!

585
00:27:38,036 --> 00:27:39,997
The authority is here.
What's the matter?

586
00:27:41,597 --> 00:27:43,517
What's the matter? Why
is the authority here?

587
00:27:44,276 --> 00:27:45,036
What is going on?

588
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:46,276
What are they doing?

589
00:27:46,717 --> 00:27:47,276
No idea.

590
00:27:47,276 --> 00:27:47,837
What's going on?

591
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:56,396
Search the items.

592
00:28:01,997 --> 00:28:02,477
Sir!

593
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:10,156
What is he holding?

594
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:11,156
No idea.

595
00:28:15,717 --> 00:28:16,436
Arrest him.

596
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:21,796
You received a bribe.

597
00:28:22,316 --> 00:28:23,196
How should you be punished?

598
00:28:25,796 --> 00:28:26,316
Father.

599
00:28:29,676 --> 00:28:30,676
He's a good official.

600
00:28:37,436 --> 00:28:38,957
He's one with integrity.

601
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:40,597
He's framed.

602
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:45,556
He must've been framed.

603
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:53,477
Mr. Luo,

604
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:55,436
do you think I'm a child?

605
00:29:02,357 --> 00:29:05,436
My wife didn't discuss with me.

606
00:29:05,757 --> 00:29:06,997
Sorry for that, Lady Yao.

607
00:29:07,837 --> 00:29:10,357
I hope you will let it slide.

608
00:29:11,477 --> 00:29:13,316
I've returned

609
00:29:13,517 --> 00:29:15,837
all the rewards you gave her.

610
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,477
My son does not excel academically.

611
00:29:19,837 --> 00:29:21,877
We don't need your help, Lady Yao.

612
00:29:22,276 --> 00:29:23,076
Mr. Luo,

613
00:29:23,477 --> 00:29:25,237
you indeed favour your daughter.

614
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:27,997
Forget about your son's prospect,

615
00:29:29,076 --> 00:29:31,237
you even disregard your wife's life.

616
00:29:33,196 --> 00:29:33,676
Ruhua.

617
00:29:43,436 --> 00:29:45,877
Mr. Luo, you're an official
of the imperial court.

618
00:29:46,837 --> 00:29:47,877
I'm sure you recognise

619
00:29:47,877 --> 00:29:49,757
the traitor of Tianqing Society.

620
00:29:50,357 --> 00:29:52,036
Look at the name of the sponsor.

621
00:29:53,316 --> 00:29:54,676
It's Madam Luo.

622
00:30:01,196 --> 00:30:01,997
Impossible.

623
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,280
(A Deed of Covenant)

624
00:30:06,676 --> 00:30:07,757
Words alone aren't enough.

625
00:30:08,196 --> 00:30:09,517
Sign this agreement

626
00:30:09,997 --> 00:30:11,676
and I'll arrange a position
for your son.

627
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,276
Madam,

628
00:30:13,676 --> 00:30:14,997
I heard

629
00:30:14,997 --> 00:30:16,796
Luo Zhanxuan is ignorant
and incompetent.

630
00:30:16,796 --> 00:30:18,076
He's a gambler.

631
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:20,436
Seriously?

632
00:30:21,477 --> 00:30:22,637
I may need to reconsider it.

633
00:30:23,517 --> 00:30:23,916
Take it back.

634
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:24,597
No.

635
00:30:32,276 --> 00:30:34,316
Lady Yao, you tricked me!

636
00:30:34,757 --> 00:30:35,436
You claimed that

637
00:30:35,436 --> 00:30:36,796
it's a guarantee letter!

638
00:30:38,276 --> 00:30:39,997
This is the best guarantee letter.

639
00:30:40,477 --> 00:30:40,997
You...

640
00:30:41,637 --> 00:30:43,796
You sponsored the traitor
of Tianqing Society.

641
00:30:44,957 --> 00:30:46,117
You'll surely

642
00:30:48,276 --> 00:30:49,276
be executed.

643
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:22,237
Mother.

644
00:31:22,396 --> 00:31:22,717
Mother.

645
00:31:22,717 --> 00:31:23,477
Untie her.

646
00:31:27,036 --> 00:31:27,757
Luo Qinglian.

647
00:31:28,076 --> 00:31:30,517
there's solid proof of
Luo Rongyu accepting a bribe.

648
00:31:31,396 --> 00:31:32,957
I also have proof of your mother

649
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,676
colluding with Tianqing Society.

650
00:31:34,957 --> 00:31:35,796
You know what to do.

651
00:31:40,276 --> 00:31:40,997
Lian'er.

652
00:31:41,717 --> 00:31:42,916
It's all my fault.

653
00:31:43,396 --> 00:31:44,757
I've let you down.

654
00:31:45,276 --> 00:31:46,076
I shouldn't have

655
00:31:49,477 --> 00:31:50,997
risked your happiness

656
00:31:50,997 --> 00:31:52,276
in this.

657
00:31:58,517 --> 00:31:59,997
I've let the Luo family down.

658
00:32:00,517 --> 00:32:01,957
I've let the ancestors down.

659
00:32:04,076 --> 00:32:06,796
What's the point of me living?

660
00:32:07,436 --> 00:32:08,156
I agree.

661
00:32:17,556 --> 00:32:18,556
You...

662
00:32:18,556 --> 00:32:19,357
You agree?

663
00:32:24,036 --> 00:32:24,997
I agree.

664
00:32:39,637 --> 00:32:40,276
Lady Yao.

665
00:32:41,156 --> 00:32:41,877
I agree

666
00:32:43,477 --> 00:32:44,196
on

667
00:32:44,676 --> 00:32:45,837
one condition.

668
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:47,877
From now on,

669
00:32:48,276 --> 00:32:50,276
don't you ever make life
difficult for my family.

670
00:32:51,556 --> 00:32:52,156
Don't worry.

671
00:32:52,717 --> 00:32:53,436
As long as you stay

672
00:32:53,436 --> 00:32:54,556
in the mansion,

673
00:32:55,676 --> 00:32:57,036
I won't make life difficult
for your mother.

674
00:33:02,036 --> 00:33:03,957
Guards, send them out.

675
00:33:04,117 --> 00:33:04,637
Wait.

676
00:33:10,637 --> 00:33:11,916
Yi, will you blame me?

677
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,196
Of course not.

678
00:33:14,556 --> 00:33:15,676
No matter what you decide,

679
00:33:17,357 --> 00:33:18,357
I'll only blame myself.

680
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:22,276
At 7pm tomorrow, I'll liaise with you.

681
00:33:22,276 --> 00:33:22,877
This way.

682
00:33:30,396 --> 00:33:30,957
Tell me.

683
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:32,837
What do you want me to do?

684
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:36,796
No rush.

685
00:33:40,196 --> 00:33:40,757
Dear.

686
00:33:56,517 --> 00:33:58,196
Dear, this...

687
00:33:58,837 --> 00:33:59,436
I understand.

688
00:34:09,877 --> 00:34:10,717
Are you...

689
00:34:10,796 --> 00:34:11,637
He Lianxin.

690
00:34:12,796 --> 00:34:13,356
How dare you.

691
00:34:21,356 --> 00:34:22,396
- Luo...
- He Lianxin.

692
00:34:41,396 --> 00:34:43,596
With determination,

693
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:46,156
we'll meet one day.

694
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:55,557
Madam Jinfang.

695
00:34:59,116 --> 00:35:00,396
Greetings, Young Master Xin.

696
00:35:01,596 --> 00:35:02,876
I've returned

697
00:35:03,596 --> 00:35:04,876
your favour.

698
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:06,396
Young Master Xin,

699
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:07,196
please do not come here anymore.

700
00:35:12,636 --> 00:35:13,156
Come here.

701
00:35:32,037 --> 00:35:34,757
Miss.

702
00:35:41,037 --> 00:35:44,396
Miss?

703
00:35:48,797 --> 00:35:50,196
Miss.

704
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:02,797
Your Highness.

705
00:36:03,676 --> 00:36:06,477
The princess insisted for us to
save the son instead of herself.

706
00:36:08,797 --> 00:36:09,356
We...

707
00:36:10,596 --> 00:36:11,317
We...

708
00:36:12,557 --> 00:36:16,237
None of us could stop her.

709
00:36:33,957 --> 00:36:35,757
How can you leave me behind?

710
00:36:37,037 --> 00:36:38,997
(He Yunshuo's Wife, Consort of Prince An)
Your Highness, don't be sad.

711
00:36:41,196 --> 00:36:43,636
Take good care of yourself.

712
00:36:44,757 --> 00:36:47,477
Raise our child up well.

713
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:51,116
Forgive me for having to leave you.

714
00:36:52,836 --> 00:37:01,317
With determination,

715
00:37:03,077 --> 00:37:12,757
we'll meet one day.

716
00:37:17,596 --> 00:37:18,237
Fu'er.

717
00:37:32,557 --> 00:37:33,676
Fu'er.

718
00:37:35,396 --> 00:37:36,836
That's the last time the prince

719
00:37:36,836 --> 00:37:38,317
met Ms. Fu.

720
00:37:41,237 --> 00:37:42,477
Since that day,

721
00:37:44,196 --> 00:37:46,196
the prince longed for
the return of Ms. Fu.

722
00:37:48,717 --> 00:37:50,237
He's been waiting

723
00:37:51,717 --> 00:37:53,477
for decades.

724
00:38:00,517 --> 00:38:01,676
Do I resemble the late princess

725
00:38:02,717 --> 00:38:03,876
that much?

726
00:38:06,116 --> 00:38:08,156
I served Ms. Fu for decades.

727
00:38:10,636 --> 00:38:12,876
I know her appearance

728
00:38:14,077 --> 00:38:16,037
and personality best.

729
00:38:17,077 --> 00:38:18,077
That's the reason.

730
00:38:18,757 --> 00:38:19,477
Throughout the years,

731
00:38:19,876 --> 00:38:21,957
many people

732
00:38:22,916 --> 00:38:24,277
turned to me,

733
00:38:25,277 --> 00:38:27,557
hoping to find one that resembled Ms. Fu

734
00:38:28,156 --> 00:38:30,196
through my eyes,

735
00:38:30,997 --> 00:38:33,156
in order to please the prince.

736
00:38:34,957 --> 00:38:36,676
I didn't want Ms. Fu's
reputation to suffer.

737
00:38:37,757 --> 00:38:39,557
So I never agreed.

738
00:38:41,757 --> 00:38:43,156
However, I met you that day.

739
00:38:45,717 --> 00:38:48,757
You resemble her greatly

740
00:38:49,356 --> 00:38:51,676
in terms of appearance and personality.

741
00:38:54,517 --> 00:38:55,237
Madam Jinfang.

742
00:38:55,876 --> 00:38:57,717
I took a few days of leave for you

743
00:38:58,156 --> 00:38:59,557
without your permission.

744
00:38:59,957 --> 00:39:00,757
If you don't mind,

745
00:39:01,557 --> 00:39:02,517
you may right away...

746
00:39:03,836 --> 00:39:05,077
You may right away...

747
00:39:09,596 --> 00:39:11,517
You may leave the mansion right away.

748
00:39:19,436 --> 00:39:20,077
I

749
00:39:20,997 --> 00:39:22,797
will join you, Young Master Xin,
in leaving the mansion

750
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:27,757
and helping Ms. Qinglian
for the selection.

751
00:39:52,277 --> 00:39:53,037
Watch out.

752
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:56,757
Thanks, Ms. Qinglian.

753
00:40:00,876 --> 00:40:01,836
"Watch out."

754
00:40:02,557 --> 00:40:03,957
You got into your character pretty fast.

755
00:40:04,876 --> 00:40:05,676
She's a decent person.

756
00:40:06,676 --> 00:40:08,396
She's loyal and honest.

757
00:40:09,596 --> 00:40:11,557
Lady Yao is pretty and capable.

758
00:40:11,997 --> 00:40:13,237
The women around you are brilliant.

759
00:40:16,517 --> 00:40:17,077
I...

760
00:40:17,356 --> 00:40:18,436
I understand.

761
00:40:18,436 --> 00:40:21,317
You're mocking me for being incompetent

762
00:40:21,317 --> 00:40:22,396
and having to rely on women, right?

763
00:40:22,396 --> 00:40:23,356
If I thought that way,

764
00:40:23,557 --> 00:40:24,757
you'd be happy, right, Young Master Xin?

765
00:40:26,717 --> 00:40:27,396
What do you want

766
00:40:27,757 --> 00:40:28,717
from me?

767
00:40:30,596 --> 00:40:31,196
Didn't Madam Jinfang

768
00:40:31,196 --> 00:40:32,077
say?

769
00:40:32,477 --> 00:40:33,797
I'm trying to please my father.

770
00:40:34,037 --> 00:40:35,277
That might be the case for other sons,

771
00:40:35,636 --> 00:40:37,757
but definitely not for you.

772
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,116
The prince does a good job
managing Quliang.

773
00:40:43,396 --> 00:40:44,077
Forget about

774
00:40:44,077 --> 00:40:45,317
a woman who resembles the late princess,

775
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:47,037
even if the late princess
came back to life,

776
00:40:48,156 --> 00:40:49,676
the prince might not even listen to her.

777
00:40:50,717 --> 00:40:52,077
Young Master Xin, throughout the years,

778
00:40:52,077 --> 00:40:53,156
you try so hard

779
00:40:53,356 --> 00:40:53,836
to create an image of an idling son

780
00:40:53,836 --> 00:40:55,356
for yourself.

781
00:40:55,916 --> 00:40:56,596
You would

782
00:40:56,596 --> 00:40:58,037
only take risk

783
00:40:58,037 --> 00:40:58,676
if you're confident about something.

784
00:41:02,077 --> 00:41:03,396
What else do you think I'm after?

785
00:41:06,356 --> 00:41:07,077
I heard that

786
00:41:07,717 --> 00:41:09,156
days after the late
princess passed away,

787
00:41:09,477 --> 00:41:10,636
the prince appointed
her son as the heir.

788
00:41:11,396 --> 00:41:12,237
Over the years,

789
00:41:13,196 --> 00:41:14,396
the heir is arrogant and spoilt.

790
00:41:14,997 --> 00:41:15,477
However, the prince

791
00:41:15,477 --> 00:41:17,077
has high hopes for him.

792
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:18,237
Everyone can tell

793
00:41:18,596 --> 00:41:20,196
he's doing it for
the late princess' sake.

794
00:41:20,997 --> 00:41:21,596
If

795
00:41:22,356 --> 00:41:23,757
another woman appears

796
00:41:23,757 --> 00:41:24,957
and replaces the late princess,

797
00:41:25,797 --> 00:41:26,957
can the heir

798
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:28,156
keep his position?
