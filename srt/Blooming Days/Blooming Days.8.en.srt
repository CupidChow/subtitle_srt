- Greetings, Madam Lian.

20
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:35,420
(Luo Qinglian's Attendant, Li Tang)
My name is Li Tang.

(Luo Qinglian's Attendant, Li Tang)

22
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,941
(Luo Qinglian's Attendant, Li Tang)
I am strong and can read a little.

Feel free to give me orders

24
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,700
as you please.

25
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,700
Thank you.

(Luo Qinglian's Maid, Zhiyue)
I am Zhiyue. She is Ranyun.

Both of us

28
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,440
(Mu Haiyao's Maid, Ranyun)
are in charge of your daily needs.

00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:48,901
Dongli.

30
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,500
It's all right.

31
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,741
I have decent looks.

32
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:55,181
I'm just a little fat. I'm fine.

33
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:58,941
We will be seeing each other a lot.

34
00:02:58,941 --> 00:02:59,700
No need to be polite.

35
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,301
Please get up.

36
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,630
- Thank you, Madam Lian.
- Thank you, Madam Lian.

37
00:03:04,461 --> 00:03:05,261
I will take care of

38
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:06,261
your luggage.

39
00:03:06,741 --> 00:03:07,860
If you have any orders,

40
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,700
please let me know.

41
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,901
I have a few favours to ask.

42
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,900
- Madam Lian, please tell us.
- Madam Lian, please tell us.

43
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,301
Firstly,

44
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,780
Young Master granted me
Lianwei Residence,

45
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,140
but in rank, I am still a servant-concubine.

46
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,060
I'm not Madam.

47
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:22,941
In future, when you call me,

48
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:23,980
let's go by the rules

49
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,381
so as to avoid gossip.

50
00:03:28,021 --> 00:03:29,500
- Yes, Ms. Lian.
- Yes, Ms. Lian.

51
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,101
Secondly,

52
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:35,101
I'm sure everyone has

53
00:03:35,101 --> 00:03:36,860
heard of my past.

54
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:38,461
It's not possible to

55
00:03:38,461 --> 00:03:39,661
hide it from everyone.

56
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:41,060
Since we will be

57
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:42,181
a family,

58
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:44,021
you might feel the need to protect me.

59
00:03:44,461 --> 00:03:45,220
If you hear others

60
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,661
gossip about me,...

61
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:47,261
We will

62
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:48,620
protect you at all costs.

63
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,980
No, you must not care.

64
00:03:52,101 --> 00:03:52,980
Why?

65
00:03:53,821 --> 00:03:54,901
My conscience is clear.

66
00:03:55,461 --> 00:03:56,520
I did not do anything shameful.

67
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,140
I don't care about what they say.

68
00:03:58,941 --> 00:03:59,580
I just

69
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,181
don't want everyone here

70
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:01,901
to suffer with me.

71
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,060
- I understand.
- I understand.

72
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:08,340
Lastly,

73
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,101
at Lianwei Residence,

74
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,301
no one treats you as slaves.

75
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:14,620
So, you shall not see
yourselves as slaves.

76
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:16,381
I won't ask for your loyalty

77
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,901
and won't hold you down.

78
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,301
All I ask is for you
to follow your heart.

79
00:04:21,701 --> 00:04:23,701
I will never blame or force you.

80
00:04:28,821 --> 00:04:29,261
Dongli,

81
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,780
help everyone settle in.

82
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,060
Yes, Miss.

83
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,701
Sorry, I mean Ms. Lian.

84
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,661
If you cannot switch over, that's fine.

85
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:37,900
It sounds so awkward

86
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,780
from you.

87
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:50,981
Liu'er,

88
00:04:51,981 --> 00:04:53,101
go and help with the luggage.

89
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:53,941
- Yes.
- Yes.

90
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,340
Did I hear wrongly?

91
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,701
We've been servants for many years

92
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:13,220
and have served many masters,

93
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,900
but we've not heard

94
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,421
of requests like these.

95
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,460
All masters wish for

96
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,821
their servants to be loyal,

97
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:24,141
but

98
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,180
everyone knows

99
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:27,141
that loyalty cannot be forced.

100
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,020
She's so pretty and assertive.

101
00:05:31,941 --> 00:05:33,460
No wonder Young Master likes her.

102
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,020
Sadly,

103
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:38,460
there is one shortcoming.

104
00:05:44,701 --> 00:05:46,261
She's too skinny.

105
00:05:58,981 --> 00:06:00,300
Ms. Lian, do you need anything else?

106
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,261
I'll revert to Young Master right away.

107
00:06:03,581 --> 00:06:04,141
No need.

108
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,300
He is still recovering.

109
00:06:06,941 --> 00:06:08,620
Madam Yao needs to settle down too.

110
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,661
Let's not...

111
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,941
Young Master, why are you here?

112
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,340
Why can't I be here?

113
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,141
This entire mansion is mine.

114
00:06:20,941 --> 00:06:21,861
Look.

115
00:06:22,981 --> 00:06:23,701
This porcelain

116
00:06:24,661 --> 00:06:25,740
is so rough.

117
00:06:26,581 --> 00:06:27,780
Go back and

118
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,620
bring over the begonia red tea set

119
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,180
in my room.

120
00:06:31,381 --> 00:06:32,020
Yes, Young Master.

121
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,701
Right away.

122
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:34,220
Hold on.

123
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,340
Why is there only one pillow?

124
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,900
This blanket

125
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,661
doesn't look soft enough.

126
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,261
Throw it out. Change new ones.

127
00:06:41,261 --> 00:06:41,900
Yes, Young Master.

128
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,701
I'll do that right away.

129
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,020
All right. That's enough.

130
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:45,861
Please excuse us.

131
00:06:58,661 --> 00:06:59,500
Young Master, a commotion

132
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,581
must have its boundaries.

133
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,381
What commotion?

134
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,821
A precious gem that
I exchanged with a good horse

135
00:07:04,861 --> 00:07:06,141
must be cherished.

136
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:07,340
Don't worry.

137
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:08,581
I will definitely

138
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,421
treat my women well.

139
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:13,460
Young Master, you are so kind

140
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,381
to your women.

141
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,941
A step down has been offered

142
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,620
during your hardest times.

143
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,541
Why don't I get what

144
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,780
you're trying to say?

145
00:07:29,861 --> 00:07:31,340
You put up with Fang Erge

146
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,180
and stood still.

147
00:07:32,981 --> 00:07:33,821
How could you not accept

148
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:34,821
Little Master Hui's death?

149
00:07:39,381 --> 00:07:41,861
No matter how painful it is,

150
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,661
the past is in the past.

151
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:46,101
Nothing is more important
than the future.

152
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,421
You didn't hear wrongly

153
00:07:49,861 --> 00:07:52,900
but your heart misunderstood
what you heard.

154
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,381
Girl,

155
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:02,780
has anyone told you

156
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:04,060
that the smarter a woman is,

157
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,340
the farther men will be.

158
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,421
Are you going to escape?

159
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:07,101
Yes.

160
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,981
But there is something
I wish to do more.

161
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:10,060
What is that?

162
00:08:10,421 --> 00:08:11,460
To disappoint you.

163
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,300
I'm telling you.

164
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,840
Don't think that
everything will go your way

165
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:22,740
after making it into
the mansion.

166
00:08:22,981 --> 00:08:25,661
Don't forget that you are mine.

167
00:08:26,581 --> 00:08:27,620
In the days to come,

168
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,500
you must accompany me
for meals, to play chess,

169
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,460
to rub ink, to read,

170
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:32,900
and to bathe and sleep.

171
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,060
Young Master,
we had a gentleman's agreement.

172
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,300
You promised not to touch me.

173
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:39,221
Gentleman? Who's the gentleman?

174
00:08:39,461 --> 00:08:40,461
You're a woman.

175
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,660
I'm not any gentleman.

176
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,300
Don't challenge me.

177
00:08:45,821 --> 00:08:46,800
Perhaps the more you escape,

178
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,580
the more interested I'll become.

179
00:08:51,021 --> 00:08:52,941
Girl, give up.

180
00:08:53,261 --> 00:08:55,420
It's getting dangerous out there.

181
00:08:56,221 --> 00:08:57,261
You should just stay

182
00:08:57,701 --> 00:08:58,901
by my side obediently.

183
00:09:02,261 --> 00:09:02,980
From tomorrow,

184
00:09:03,261 --> 00:09:05,060
you cannot go out
without my permission.

185
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,461
Miss,

186
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,701
is Young Master

187
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:18,821
really grounding you?

188
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,620
That's fine.

189
00:09:22,701 --> 00:09:25,060
He has his own thoughts.
Don't worry.

190
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,701
(He Lianxin cares for the people.)

191
00:09:33,381 --> 00:09:34,960
(He will surely rise to
importance in Quliang.)

192
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,221
(It's just that Mu Haiyao is treacherous.)

193
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,941
(The Mu family is extremely powerful.)

194
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,021
(They will hurt He Lianxin
sooner or later.)

195
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:52,180
Madam,

196
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,581
I heard that once Luo Qinglian arrived,

197
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:56,141
she was locked up by Young Master.

198
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,860
It's different from
when you are pregnant.

199
00:09:57,941 --> 00:09:59,180
You had gifts every day.

200
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,500
You didn't see

201
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,740
the look on Madam Rui's face.

202
00:10:01,941 --> 00:10:03,581
It looked so sour.

203
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,341
Did Young Master really
ground Luo Qinglian?

204
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,021
Then, today...

205
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,781
For a full year.

206
00:10:15,941 --> 00:10:17,660
Young Master caught Luo Qinglian

207
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,021
after she ran away the last time.

208
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,060
Because of Prince An,

209
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,821
Young Master had no choice
but to stomach his anger.

210
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,540
It's like how

211
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,221
he granted her Lianwei Residence today

212
00:10:24,261 --> 00:10:25,860
but with the poorest servants.

213
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,261
They're all very rigid.

214
00:10:27,381 --> 00:10:28,941
You wouldn't like any of them.

215
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,540
I'm just afraid

216
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,341
it isn't as simple as it seems.

217
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,100
Send someone to Qiyan Tower.

218
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:44,461
All right.

219
00:10:50,581 --> 00:10:51,141
Madam.

220
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:54,860
Madam Yao sent someone

221
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,901
with this letter.

222
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,380
(Luo Qinglian)

223
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,480
(Lianwei Residence)

224
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,821
Did you lock her up just like that?

225
00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:19,980
She has been instrumental

226
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:21,221
to Father.

227
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:22,821
This time,

228
00:11:23,701 --> 00:11:24,581
she saved me

229
00:11:24,941 --> 00:11:26,540
and messed up the heir's plan.

230
00:11:28,581 --> 00:11:30,100
She also did well

231
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:31,141
in front of Father

232
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:32,620
and has been appreciated.

233
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,901
Everyone is

234
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,980
watching her closely.

235
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,381
She never knew of

236
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:39,381
family politics.

237
00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:41,180
If she were to survive here,

238
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,221
she must learn to wait.

239
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:47,620
Aren't you worried she would go crazy

240
00:11:48,221 --> 00:11:48,980
from being grounded?

241
00:11:52,781 --> 00:11:53,740
She won't.

242
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,540
Ms. Lian, are you drawing?

243
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,180
Drawing the scenery?

244
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:09,420
I'm not drawing the scenery

245
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,941
but the essence of the
Young Master's mansion.

246
00:12:16,221 --> 00:12:17,100
Among the three of you,

247
00:12:17,461 --> 00:12:19,100
who has been here the longest?

248
00:12:19,581 --> 00:12:20,660
Who served Madam Rui the most?

249
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,180
Ms. Lian,

250
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,941
we were not flattering enough.

251
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,980
Madam Rui didn't like us,

252
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:29,141
so we have been here the longest

253
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:31,100
and served Madam Rui the most.

254
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,901
(So, when Young Master
assigned these staff to me,)

255
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,381
(he foresaw this.)

256
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,620
Li Tang.

257
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:37,420
Yes.

258
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,100
Since you've been here for many years,

259
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,581
you must be well aware

260
00:12:40,821 --> 00:12:41,901
of what happened in the past.

261
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,300
From today,

262
00:12:43,381 --> 00:12:44,021
I want you

263
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,781
to tell me everything

264
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,980
that has happened.

265
00:12:47,261 --> 00:12:48,500
Leave no detail out.

266
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:49,341
All right.

267
00:12:49,821 --> 00:12:50,300
Zhiyue.

268
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,100
Yes.

269
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:52,860
You've served a few madams.

270
00:12:52,941 --> 00:12:54,141
You know their tempers

271
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:55,341
and dispositions.

272
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,021
Are they fierce or evil?

273
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:58,180
Who are they closer to?

274
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,341
What outfits do they like?

275
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,500
How many dogs have they had?

276
00:13:00,901 --> 00:13:02,021
I must know everything thoroughly.

277
00:13:02,021 --> 00:13:03,620
All right. I'll tell you everything.

278
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,540
Dongli.

279
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,100
It's finally my turn.

280
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,821
Miss, go on.

281
00:13:11,221 --> 00:13:12,901
You're in charge of daily matters.

282
00:13:13,021 --> 00:13:14,581
You're the only one who comes in

283
00:13:14,581 --> 00:13:15,901
contact with the outside world.

284
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,420
You must control the speech

285
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,100
and actions

286
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:21,740
of other rooms very carefully.

287
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,221
If I miss out on any news from outside,

288
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:25,781
it's all on you.

289
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:26,581
Miss, don't worry.

290
00:13:26,901 --> 00:13:27,781
I have it covered.

291
00:13:33,901 --> 00:13:34,860
Ranyun, what's the matter?

292
00:13:37,261 --> 00:13:38,021
It's just that.

293
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,261
Everyone has a role.

294
00:13:40,581 --> 00:13:41,581
Am I useless?

295
00:13:42,261 --> 00:13:43,180
Who said so?

296
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:43,860
What's my role?

297
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,100
Eat!

298
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,660
Eat?

299
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:48,141
Eating is not a simple task.

300
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,300
Some food are nutritious

301
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:52,461
while some can be lethal.

302
00:13:53,261 --> 00:13:54,141
Be it form or taste,

303
00:13:54,341 --> 00:13:56,100
I need you to teach me
to differentiate them.

304
00:13:57,261 --> 00:13:57,980
I understand now.

305
00:13:58,141 --> 00:13:58,740
I

306
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,180
will definitely help
to finish everything.

307
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:02,261
No.

308
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:04,341
I meant to differentiate the food.

309
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,581
This is my forte.

310
00:14:17,821 --> 00:14:18,701
(In a year,)

311
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,300
(a lot can be achieved.)

312
00:14:29,341 --> 00:14:29,980
(Mu Haiyao.)

313
00:14:31,381 --> 00:14:33,480
(Nobody can remain in charge
forever at Young Master's mansion.)

314
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,980
(Only the most talented prevail.)

315
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,221
(To wait.)

316
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,740
Miss, something's wrong.

317
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,270
Prince An sent a messenger
for Young Master.

318
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,781
Something happened at Mansion.

319
00:15:26,021 --> 00:15:26,941
Preposterous!

320
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,341
- Prince, please calm down.
- Prince, please calm down.

321
00:15:30,341 --> 00:15:32,141
How do I remain calm?

322
00:15:32,901 --> 00:15:34,141
One year's worth of Quliang taxes

323
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,180
is at least a million taels.

324
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,860
How can all the reserves

325
00:15:38,141 --> 00:15:39,581
be lent out?

326
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,300
What are we left with?

327
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,821
Just receipts for the loans!

328
00:15:44,261 --> 00:15:46,021
Just receipts for the loans!

329
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,261
How do you do your job?

330
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,300
Is everyone blind?

331
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,300
How could you just lend
it out like that?

332
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,021
The rivers have overflown.

333
00:16:06,141 --> 00:16:08,261
We do not have money to
control the floods.

334
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:12,941
The Quliang people

335
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,781
pay taxes every year

336
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,581
but that money cannot help them.

337
00:16:16,821 --> 00:16:18,540
How can I be the Prince of An?

338
00:16:40,381 --> 00:16:41,860
Who will ask for orders

339
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,581
to recover the loans?

340
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,060
Who?

341
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,341
Look at you lot.

342
00:17:18,101 --> 00:17:19,101
You are usually

343
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:20,341
all smug.

344
00:17:20,821 --> 00:17:22,701
When it comes to offending people,

345
00:17:23,461 --> 00:17:24,780
all of you become cowards

346
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,780
like turtles.

347
00:17:27,501 --> 00:17:28,821
Who will ask for orders?

348
00:17:30,861 --> 00:17:31,540
Who?

349
00:17:34,981 --> 00:17:35,501
Your Highness.

350
00:17:37,941 --> 00:17:39,621
Official Yuan, are you asking for orders?

351
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:40,981
Your Highness.

352
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,260
I have a humble opinion.

353
00:17:43,741 --> 00:17:45,380
I'm not sure if I should speak up.

354
00:17:48,821 --> 00:17:49,760
Official Yuan, just say it.

355
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,941
The collection of debt

356
00:17:53,221 --> 00:17:54,900
involves the entire Quliang.

357
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,020
If we do not execute it well,

358
00:17:57,501 --> 00:18:00,060
there will be a lot of resentment.

359
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,341
The people's hearts may be swayed.

360
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:03,821
So, we must choose the candidate

361
00:18:04,221 --> 00:18:06,260
very carefully.

362
00:18:06,701 --> 00:18:07,861
Official Yuan,

363
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,741
who do you think is most suitable?

364
00:18:10,941 --> 00:18:11,900
I think

365
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,380
this person must

366
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,341
fulfill three criteria.

367
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,420
The first criteria is good morals.

368
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,660
Good morals and rapport

369
00:18:20,861 --> 00:18:22,941
would help him persuade the people

370
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,221
without getting into an argument.

371
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,760
The second criteria is benevolence.

372
00:18:27,221 --> 00:18:29,380
He must love the people like his family

373
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,941
so he will put their needs first

374
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,221
and do his best.

375
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,300
In that case,

376
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:39,660
Fourth Master is the most suitable.

377
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,581
Your Highness,

378
00:18:46,941 --> 00:18:48,260
Fourth Prince

379
00:18:48,341 --> 00:18:49,861
fulfills the two criteria above

380
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:51,900
but he fails to meet

381
00:18:52,101 --> 00:18:53,380
one criteria.

382
00:18:53,981 --> 00:18:57,501
Debt recovery doesn't happen overnight.

383
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,900
One must make visits multiple times.

384
00:19:00,461 --> 00:19:02,581
For one who has a lot of responsibilities,

385
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,341
where would he find the energy
for this important task?

386
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,501
So, the last criteria

387
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:09,821
is

388
00:19:10,701 --> 00:19:11,660
the luxury of time.

389
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,941
Based on your views...

390
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,780
Based on my views,

391
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,101
the only person
who fulfills all three criteria

392
00:19:26,981 --> 00:19:29,380
is Third Master.

393
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,581
Your Highness, please decide.

394
00:19:53,501 --> 00:19:54,981
This task has been given
to Third Master.

395
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,140
He has been trapped.

396
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:57,581
What do you know?

397
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,501
You would be the runners
on the ground, right?

398
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,020
- Yes.
- Yes.

399
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:01,960
Go to drink in my place.

400
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,180
- All right.
- Let's go.

401
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,701
This isn't good for him.

402
00:20:05,701 --> 00:20:06,420
Third Master, hold on.

403
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,270
Congratulations, Third Master.

404
00:20:11,621 --> 00:20:13,140
You received such a wonderful task.

405
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:14,581
If you are able to

406
00:20:14,861 --> 00:20:16,660
recover all the debts,

407
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,861
Prince An would surely be overjoyed.

408
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,581
Yes, this is all thanks

409
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,660
to Official Yuan's recommendation.

410
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:24,420
Oh, no.

411
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:26,780
Third Master, your virtues

412
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,020
have allowed me

413
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:30,821
to discover your talent.

414
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,581
Right, Third Master?

415
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:43,701
What is Official Yuan up to?

416
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,101
Let me ask you.

417
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,060
(He Yunshuo's Sixth Son, He Lianzhi)
Who is the most annoying in this world?

418
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,900
(He Yunshuo's Sixth Son, He Lianzhi)

419
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:50,540
Don't know.

420
00:20:52,941 --> 00:20:53,540
Who?

421
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,540
Creditors.

422
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,080
If Lianxin doesn't
complete the task,

423
00:20:58,501 --> 00:21:00,020
Father will get mad.

424
00:21:00,621 --> 00:21:01,900
If he gets it done,

425
00:21:02,981 --> 00:21:03,780
he would have offended

426
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,180
many officials in Quliang.

427
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,970
He would lose the people's support.

428
00:21:07,741 --> 00:21:09,300
No matter how ambitious he is,

429
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:10,821
he will never make it.

430
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,380
Official Yuan pulled an amazing trick.

431
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:20,420
He used a natural disaster to
clear the path for the heir.

432
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,981
Lianxiu, why are you happy?

433
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:28,221
If this matter is done,

434
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:30,180
the heir will
become more powerful.

435
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,501
Am I glad?

436
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:36,981
I am very glad.

437
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,861
Because our biggest problem

438
00:21:43,701 --> 00:21:44,900
may not be the heir.

439
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:46,981
I just know

440
00:21:47,461 --> 00:21:49,020
what my biggest problem is.

441
00:21:53,821 --> 00:21:54,981
I borrowed 50,000 taels.

442
00:21:57,101 --> 00:21:58,501
How will I repay that?

443
00:22:34,621 --> 00:22:35,101
I'll beat you!

444
00:22:35,941 --> 00:22:37,221
What are you doing suspiciously here?

445
00:22:37,221 --> 00:22:37,900
Stop.

446
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:38,581
Stop.

447
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,581
It's me, Su Nanchun.

448
00:22:40,741 --> 00:22:42,621
Su Nanchun.

449
00:22:43,621 --> 00:22:44,060
You.

450
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:45,821
Long time no see.

451
00:22:46,821 --> 00:22:48,621
Su Nanchun, is that really you?

452
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,861
Who else can it be?

453
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:54,840
Young Master ordered me

454
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,940
to summon Ms. Lian to
the Mansion immediately.

455
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:57,821
To the Mansion?

456
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,701
But haven't we been grounded for a year?

457
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,160
It has only been five months.

458
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,420
Has it been lifted?

459
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,420
Since it's Young Master's order,

460
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,470
then the order has been lifted.

461
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,501
Dongli.

462
00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:09,180
It's very urgent.

463
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,341
Please report over quickly.

464
00:23:10,581 --> 00:23:11,020
Hurry.

465
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,140
I cannot do that.

466
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,300
Young Master ordered for us
to be grounded.

467
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:16,501
Why don't you check again?

468
00:23:17,341 --> 00:23:18,861
I beg you.

469
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,461
Don't waste more time. All right?

470
00:23:20,861 --> 00:23:21,941
Please ask Ms. Lian to come out.

471
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:23,180
She can get ready...

472
00:23:29,821 --> 00:23:30,770
Tell the details on the way.

473
00:23:35,341 --> 00:23:37,660
Isn't it urgent? Let's go.

474
00:24:00,621 --> 00:24:01,101
Ms. Lian.

475
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,260
Langyue Hall still looks the same.

476
00:24:06,101 --> 00:24:06,981
The house is still there,

477
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:08,461
but the people are different.

478
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,501
Madam Yao is nearly

479
00:24:10,621 --> 00:24:11,501
eight-months pregnant.

480
00:24:11,861 --> 00:24:12,660
Madam Mo

481
00:24:13,501 --> 00:24:14,300
had a more

482
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,101
difficult pregnancy

483
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:17,180
but she's nearly due.

484
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:21,101
Ms. Lian.

485
00:24:21,581 --> 00:24:23,501
The sun is rising. Let us hurry.

486
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:28,741
Ms. Lian.

487
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,890
(Li Qianmo's Maid, Banqiu)

488
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:57,300
Madam Mo, hang in there.

489
00:24:58,941 --> 00:24:59,621
Hang in there?

490
00:25:00,461 --> 00:25:01,861
For how long more?

491
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:06,741
Madam Mo.

492
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,341
I saw Ms. Lian

493
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:09,420
on my way back earlier.

494
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,621
What did you say?

495
00:25:14,941 --> 00:25:16,420
Isn't she grounded?

496
00:25:16,941 --> 00:25:17,741
Yes.

497
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,300
But I definitely saw her

498
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,461
and Su Nanchun.

499
00:25:20,461 --> 00:25:21,380
They were

500
00:25:21,861 --> 00:25:23,380
rushing somewhere.

501
00:25:25,341 --> 00:25:27,660
I even picked this up.

502
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,461
I heard something happened
at the Mansion.

503
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,300
Everyone knows

504
00:25:39,501 --> 00:25:41,540
that she can convince Prince An.

505
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,780
Did Young Master

506
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,180
lift the grounding order for this?

507
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,300
I'm afraid

508
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,780
Mu Haiyao doesn't know yet.

509
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:52,780
Imagine.

510
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,501
She hates Luo Qinglian so much.

511
00:25:56,581 --> 00:25:58,300
If she knows about this,

512
00:25:58,821 --> 00:25:59,660
what would happen?

513
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,861
Girl.

514
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,581
I hope you have been well.

515
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:20,660
I have

516
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,581
but I'm afraid you haven't been well.

517
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,581
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here either.

518
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,420
It's better to be ignorant sometimes.

519
00:26:29,741 --> 00:26:32,140
Young Master, it's better to be transparent.

520
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,101
What a smart girl.

521
00:26:39,581 --> 00:26:41,341
Which daft person would bear to

522
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,101
lock you up for so long?

523
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,821
Is it long?

524
00:26:45,621 --> 00:26:47,701
I think that still doesn't beat
the show you're putting on.

525
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,341
It's better to be ignorant.

526
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,020
All right. Here.

527
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,420
All right. Go on.

528
00:27:14,821 --> 00:27:15,300
Let's go play.

529
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,060
Slow down.

530
00:27:16,861 --> 00:27:17,660
Be careful.

531
00:27:18,221 --> 00:27:19,581
Slowly. Slow down.

532
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:19,981
Come.

533
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,020
Don't fall down.

534
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:21,861
Hug.

535
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,660
Coming.

536
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:26,821
Father.

537
00:27:27,621 --> 00:27:28,101
Have a seat.

538
00:27:30,581 --> 00:27:31,180
Have some tea.

539
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,020
It's early spring.

540
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:36,540
Fangfei Garden is still chilly.

541
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,461
Take care of your health.

542
00:27:39,221 --> 00:27:40,260
The chill in Fangfei Garden

543
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,180
cannot beat the cold waters
of the Quliang River.

544
00:27:47,461 --> 00:27:48,821
It's good to help them.

545
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:50,821
Right, Lianxin?

546
00:27:54,701 --> 00:27:55,981
Didn't you bring Qinglian here

547
00:27:56,621 --> 00:27:59,540
over the debt recovery matter?

548
00:28:02,821 --> 00:28:04,180
I cannot hide
anything from you, Father.

549
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,380
Naturally, my heart aches

550
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,380
for the flood victims.

551
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:09,581
But Father,

552
00:28:09,741 --> 00:28:11,180
you know my capabilities.

553
00:28:11,501 --> 00:28:12,221
I'm just worried

554
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,581
that I won't be able to help

555
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,461
and might make matters worse.

556
00:28:15,981 --> 00:28:16,621
Qinglian,

557
00:28:18,501 --> 00:28:22,260
do you think he can do it?

558
00:28:25,221 --> 00:28:26,020
I think that

559
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,581
he will do it well.

560
00:28:29,461 --> 00:28:29,981
Why?

561
00:28:31,221 --> 00:28:31,900
Because

562
00:28:32,861 --> 00:28:34,540
he is your son.

563
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,981
This task should not be taken lightly.

564
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,581
If you don't manage it well,

565
00:28:42,581 --> 00:28:44,300
you could offend the entire Quliang.

566
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,461
Your Highness is his father.

567
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,621
You wouldn't abandon him

568
00:28:47,621 --> 00:28:48,461
in that position.

569
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,900
So, I think

570
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,180
he will get it done.

571
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,501
You are

572
00:28:56,621 --> 00:28:57,581
very much like Fu'er.

573
00:28:58,501 --> 00:28:59,941
You are clever yet sneaky.

574
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,020
This sort of wit does not annoy people.

575
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:02,900
Slowly.

576
00:29:04,341 --> 00:29:04,821
Come here.

577
00:29:07,501 --> 00:29:08,221
It's mine.

578
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,660
Little Masters.

579
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,900
His Highness is in a discussion.

580
00:29:14,941 --> 00:29:16,101
Lower your voice.

581
00:29:16,461 --> 00:29:17,420
Let's be quieter.

582
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,221
Quick. Come.

583
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,581
Why aren't you going?

584
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,420
Take it.

585
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,861
I am weak.

586
00:29:24,941 --> 00:29:26,140
I cannot beat them.

587
00:29:27,981 --> 00:29:28,380
No.

588
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,461
That won't do.

589
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,741
A son of the He family is never afraid.

590
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,420
Go. Go and snatch it from them.

591
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:35,780
Take it.

592
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,660
Little Master, slowly.

593
00:29:37,581 --> 00:29:38,180
Too high.

594
00:29:38,501 --> 00:29:38,941
Here.

595
00:29:39,461 --> 00:29:40,420
Here. Pass it here.

596
00:29:40,501 --> 00:29:41,221
Here.

597
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,221
Come here.

598
00:29:44,461 --> 00:29:44,861
Here. Take.

599
00:29:44,861 --> 00:29:45,400
Give it to me.

600
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,581
Qinglian, how does he treat you?

601
00:29:52,981 --> 00:29:53,861
Great.

602
00:29:58,701 --> 00:29:59,660
Great?

603
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,180
Then, why did I hear

604
00:30:03,621 --> 00:30:04,461
that you were grounded

605
00:30:04,581 --> 00:30:06,660
for nearly five months?

606
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,060
Is that great?

607
00:30:09,701 --> 00:30:11,221
What's not great about being grounded?

608
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:12,821
In these five months,

609
00:30:12,821 --> 00:30:15,300
I learned more than I could in five years.

610
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,020
Good.

611
00:30:24,501 --> 00:30:25,221
There are always

612
00:30:25,981 --> 00:30:27,581
two sides to a coin.

613
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,180
He treats you

614
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,060
like this.

615
00:30:30,741 --> 00:30:32,140
Aren't I like this

616
00:30:33,221 --> 00:30:34,621
to my sons too?

617
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,160
A son would never dare to disappoint

618
00:30:56,461 --> 00:30:57,501
a yearning father's hopes.

619
00:30:58,221 --> 00:30:59,341
I will do my best

620
00:30:59,341 --> 00:31:00,221
to recover the loans

621
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,941
and give the people
of Quliang better days.

622
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:03,981
I will share your burdens.

623
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:14,701
You summoned me

624
00:31:14,701 --> 00:31:16,020
to help change
your father's mind.

625
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:17,730
Why did you change your mind first?

626
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,900
Ms. Jinfang taught you

627
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,621
Father's temper.

628
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:23,180
This time,

629
00:31:23,621 --> 00:31:24,880
Father asked me to recoup the debts.

630
00:31:25,741 --> 00:31:26,970
What do you think his intentions are?

631
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,821
I cannot tell either.

632
00:31:31,341 --> 00:31:33,060
But I think there are
more than meets the eye.

633
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:37,300
There are always two sides to a coin.

634
00:31:38,941 --> 00:31:41,341
Not just one side...

635
00:31:41,701 --> 00:31:42,780
Do you think that

636
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:46,221
this task may not be a bad thing?

637
00:31:48,821 --> 00:31:50,101
I hope I didn't
place my bets wrongly.

638
00:31:50,821 --> 00:31:52,760
The Idle Young Master
has been exposed and can't make it.

639
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:53,621
If I

640
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:57,941
offend the officials,

641
00:31:58,581 --> 00:32:00,741
I am really done for.

642
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:02,861
Young Master.

643
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,341
It rained heavily last night.

644
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,680
Many flower petals fell to the ground,

645
00:32:08,101 --> 00:32:09,900
but the trees are still blooming.

646
00:32:10,621 --> 00:32:12,501
All that's left is all you need.

647
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:16,501
Are you

648
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,000
encouraging me?

649
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,380
Earlier, I said that you can do it.

650
00:32:24,981 --> 00:32:27,621
Although it's to convince your father,

651
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,341
it's not entirely false.

652
00:32:33,581 --> 00:32:35,501
Who keeps saying I'm fickle-minded?

653
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,760
Why have you suddenly changed?

654
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,461
Because you care for the people.

655
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,101
You embody

656
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,840
the spirit and boldness of the people.

657
00:32:46,581 --> 00:32:48,300
You will never be alone.

658
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,540
(Langyue Hall)

659
00:33:04,621 --> 00:33:05,180
What did you say?

660
00:33:05,581 --> 00:33:06,260
I said

661
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,900
someone claims that Ms. Lian

662
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:08,821
has been released.

663
00:33:11,501 --> 00:33:12,221
How can that be?

664
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:13,540
Only five months.

665
00:33:13,941 --> 00:33:15,581
Madam Mo said the same thing.

666
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:16,821
That's enough.

667
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,540
Go back and ask Madam Mo

668
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,140
to take care of herself.

669
00:33:21,341 --> 00:33:22,140
I will figure it out.

670
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,020
Yes.

671
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,540
I'll head off first then.

672
00:33:30,621 --> 00:33:31,101
Madam.

673
00:33:31,701 --> 00:33:32,581
Come with me.

674
00:33:36,101 --> 00:33:36,981
Madam, slow down.

675
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:38,180
You must watch the baby.

676
00:33:39,461 --> 00:33:40,221
Young Master

677
00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:42,300
only cares about her
without caring about my child.

678
00:33:42,701 --> 00:33:44,020
Madam, don't think too much.

679
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,621
Young Master still has to
rely on the Mu family.

680
00:33:45,621 --> 00:33:46,140
How can he

681
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,300
disregard you?

682
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,501
What did you say?

683
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,080
Are you saying he likes me

684
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,300
because of the Mu family?

685
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,861
That's not what I meant.

686
00:33:55,101 --> 00:33:56,341
Of course, he likes you.

687
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,741
He likes only you.

688
00:34:04,861 --> 00:34:05,300
Madam.

689
00:34:06,861 --> 00:34:07,341
Madam.

690
00:34:08,461 --> 00:34:09,701
Madam, are you all right?

691
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,261
Madam.

692
00:34:16,061 --> 00:34:16,580
Madam.

693
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:17,620
Madam.

694
00:34:18,781 --> 00:34:20,461
Help!

695
00:34:20,781 --> 00:34:21,461
Xu Liangchuan.

696
00:34:22,221 --> 00:34:23,100
Madam.

697
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:24,660
Madam.

698
00:34:24,701 --> 00:34:25,520
What's wrong with Madam?

699
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:26,340
Madam fell down.

700
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:27,340
Quick. Call for help.

701
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,140
Madam.

702
00:34:28,461 --> 00:34:29,301
Madam, be careful. Slowly.

703
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:30,140
Madam, slowly.

704
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,501
Madam, be careful.

705
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:49,900
What are you doing?

706
00:34:50,461 --> 00:34:51,340
You're already mine.

707
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,140
Why are you struggling?

708
00:34:52,501 --> 00:34:53,420
Who is yours?

709
00:34:54,461 --> 00:34:56,221
I like how stubborn you are.

710
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,620
All right. I'll be on a mission.

711
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,981
Don't run around these days.

712
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:03,900
Be good

713
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,580
and wait for me at Lianwei Residence.

714
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:21,221
Be good. Wait for me.

715
00:35:38,741 --> 00:35:40,180
(Ms. Jinfang taught you)

716
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,860
(Father's temper.)

717
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,461
This time,

718
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,380
Father asked me to resolve the floods.

719
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:47,701
What do you think his intentions are?

720
00:35:48,221 --> 00:35:49,380
(He has high hopes in me)

721
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,061
(but I feel so helpless.)

722
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,660
(Ms. Jinfang.)

723
00:35:54,501 --> 00:35:55,541
(Can you tell me)

724
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,660
(what the Prince is thinking?)

725
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,140
Miss.

726
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:02,820
Madam Yao sent someone.

727
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:35,380
Greetings, Madam Yao.

728
00:36:51,021 --> 00:36:51,580
Have you

729
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,380
given birth?

730
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:57,501
When?

731
00:37:01,021 --> 00:37:01,660
Yes.

732
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,301
Come.

733
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,660
Have a look at my child.

734
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,600
Isn't he beautiful?

735
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,221
He...

736
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,221
What's wrong?

737
00:37:32,021 --> 00:37:32,541
He...

738
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:35,820
He is dead.

739
00:37:44,501 --> 00:37:45,820
My child is dead.

740
00:38:03,461 --> 00:38:04,741
It's all your fault.

741
00:38:06,741 --> 00:38:07,301
Me?

742
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,741
What are you looking for?

743
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,100
Looking for this?

744
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,900
Open the door!

745
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:23,900
Let me out!

746
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:24,860
Open the door!

747
00:38:25,061 --> 00:38:26,301
Let me out!

748
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,701
Greetings, Madam Rui.

749
00:38:31,261 --> 00:38:32,140
Why have you shut the doors

750
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,461
during the day?

751
00:38:33,741 --> 00:38:34,701
Madam Rui,

752
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,420
Madam Yao isn't feeling well.

753
00:38:36,501 --> 00:38:37,360
She couldn't catch a cold.

754
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,461
Did Madam Yao

755
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,340
really fall?

756
00:38:43,061 --> 00:38:43,860
Madam Rui is asking you.

757
00:38:43,941 --> 00:38:45,061
Did you not hear her?

758
00:38:45,501 --> 00:38:46,340
I wouldn't dare.

759
00:38:46,781 --> 00:38:47,820
Once the news is out,

760
00:38:48,941 --> 00:38:50,420
people flock here
faster than the bees.

761
00:38:51,221 --> 00:38:51,980
Then, I'll answer you.

762
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:52,981
No need.

763
00:38:52,981 --> 00:38:53,981
I'll ask myself.

764
00:38:54,301 --> 00:38:54,781
Open the door.

765
00:38:54,781 --> 00:38:56,461
Madam, I'm afraid
we can no longer hide.

766
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:57,900
Who said we're hiding?

767
00:38:58,301 --> 00:38:59,221
I just don't want

768
00:38:59,221 --> 00:39:01,941
to see their gleeful looks.

769
00:39:02,501 --> 00:39:03,340
Send them away.

770
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,100
Tell them I've fallen asleep
after taking medication.

771
00:39:06,741 --> 00:39:07,140
All right.

772
00:39:07,741 --> 00:39:08,261
How dare you!

773
00:39:09,461 --> 00:39:10,860
How dare you
disobey Madam Rui's orders?

774
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,061
You keep stopping us.

775
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,340
Did something

776
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,580
happen to the child?

777
00:39:15,261 --> 00:39:16,461
Li Qianmo.

778
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,701
Why is she here?

779
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,420
Physician Zhang mentioned

780
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,900
that Madam Yao recently caught a cold.

781
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,010
Shouldn't walk out

782
00:39:23,021 --> 00:39:24,100
so as not to affect the child.

783
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,741
If anything happens,

784
00:39:26,301 --> 00:39:27,900
no one can take responsibility for it.

785
00:39:31,461 --> 00:39:32,021
Qianmo.

786
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,140
Did Lvxia really see

787
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,140
Madam Yao fall down?

788
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:36,541
Why would I simply

789
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,061
make up something so serious?

790
00:39:39,061 --> 00:39:39,820
I heard

791
00:39:40,541 --> 00:39:42,021
she was bleeding.

792
00:39:43,021 --> 00:39:44,021
I even heard

793
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,741
that she fell down

794
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:46,860
because she stepped on

795
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,021
Luo Qinglian's hair pin.

796
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:54,860
Ms. Lian.

797
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,100
When I heard the news,

798
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,180
I was extremely terrified.

799
00:40:08,941 --> 00:40:09,900
Madam Yao and I

800
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,941
got pregnant

801
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,541
not too far apart.

802
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,620
We thought of giving birth together.

803
00:40:15,781 --> 00:40:17,461
My pregnancy journey was difficult.

804
00:40:18,701 --> 00:40:20,741
I know the pains of pregnancy.

805
00:40:21,501 --> 00:40:22,701
If Madam Yao...

806
00:40:23,501 --> 00:40:24,820
I really feel for her.

807
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,820
I would be very sad.

808
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,580
All right. That's enough.

809
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,580
We haven't seen her yet.

810
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,981
Don't speak inauspicious things.

811
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,380
Xu Liangchuan, are you not
going to open the door?

812
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,180
Madam Rui.

813
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,741
Do you want me to do it myself?

814
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:46,461
What good deeds have

815
00:40:46,741 --> 00:40:48,021
Langyue Hall done lately?

816
00:40:53,741 --> 00:40:55,261
Madam Rui visits me.

817
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,340
Even Qianmo

818
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,021
who didn't step out for so long is here.

819
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,301
Qianmo said

820
00:41:06,781 --> 00:41:07,981
you fell down.

821
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,270
Young Master is not around.

822
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,981
As an elder sister,

823
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:12,420
I must check in on you.

824
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,221
I fell in front of my house.

825
00:41:15,781 --> 00:41:16,541
Qianmo, you are

826
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:17,741
so well-informed.

827
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:20,900
It seems

828
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,180
it's true.

829
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,820
Why did you conceal

830
00:41:24,061 --> 00:41:25,140
such a serious matter?

831
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:26,781
How are you?

832
00:41:27,261 --> 00:41:28,140
Is the baby all right?

833
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,660
If the baby is hurt,

834
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,221
would I be standing here

835
00:41:31,221 --> 00:41:32,021
chatting with you?

836
00:41:33,501 --> 00:41:34,701
My baby is

837
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,781
a child of the He family.

838
00:41:37,781 --> 00:41:38,981
The heavens will look after him.

839
00:41:40,061 --> 00:41:42,221
Even if someone wanted to hurt him,

840
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:44,340
it wouldn't be that easy.

841
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,021
