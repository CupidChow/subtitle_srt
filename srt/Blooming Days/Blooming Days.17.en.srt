17
00:01:53,163 --> 00:01:54,324
My child...

18
00:01:58,404 --> 00:01:59,404
My child.

19
00:02:16,524 --> 00:02:17,084
Girl.

20
00:02:23,563 --> 00:02:24,444
Young Master, you're up.

21
00:02:30,004 --> 00:02:31,164
Please wash up, Young Master.

22
00:02:31,804 --> 00:02:33,164
Get me some water.

23
00:02:37,043 --> 00:02:37,603
Young Master!

24
00:02:37,843 --> 00:02:39,084
Young Master, are you up?

25
00:02:40,123 --> 00:02:40,763
Come in.

26
00:02:41,843 --> 00:02:42,444
Young Master.

27
00:02:43,284 --> 00:02:44,884
Young Master, you must come.

28
00:02:45,524 --> 00:02:46,323
Ms. Lian, she's...

29
00:02:46,924 --> 00:02:47,563
Ms. Lian...

30
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:50,843
Young Master, you must go and see her.

31
00:03:46,123 --> 00:03:46,884
Girl...

32
00:03:47,763 --> 00:03:48,683
I knew about it.

33
00:03:58,244 --> 00:03:58,924
Young Master,

34
00:04:02,043 --> 00:04:03,364
our baby is gone.

35
00:04:05,563 --> 00:04:06,084
Girl,

36
00:04:07,043 --> 00:04:08,244
I'm sorry.

37
00:04:09,403 --> 00:04:10,323
It was my fault.

38
00:04:10,603 --> 00:04:11,323
He Lianxin!

39
00:04:11,323 --> 00:04:14,004
You're the reason my child is dead!

40
00:04:18,244 --> 00:04:18,724
Yes,

41
00:04:24,084 --> 00:04:25,043
he died because of me.

42
00:04:26,723 --> 00:04:28,684
Our child is gone.

43
00:04:31,763 --> 00:04:34,443
But we can still have children, right?

44
00:04:36,084 --> 00:04:36,804
Children?

45
00:04:37,763 --> 00:04:39,723
Didn't you say
I don't deserve to be a mother?

46
00:04:41,244 --> 00:04:43,163
I said that out of anger.

47
00:04:43,804 --> 00:04:44,524
Girl,

48
00:04:44,524 --> 00:04:45,483
how can you not tell?

49
00:04:45,644 --> 00:04:46,283
You know

50
00:04:46,964 --> 00:04:48,603
my love for you is real.

51
00:04:48,603 --> 00:04:49,644
Real?

52
00:04:52,003 --> 00:04:53,924
The biggest mistake I made

53
00:04:55,203 --> 00:04:56,084
was believing

54
00:04:56,084 --> 00:04:58,003
that you were sincere.

55
00:05:02,364 --> 00:05:03,244
Is your love

56
00:05:05,043 --> 00:05:07,603
for every consort in your mansion

57
00:05:08,364 --> 00:05:09,644
real too?

58
00:05:22,203 --> 00:05:23,003
Then what about you?

59
00:05:25,163 --> 00:05:27,524
Is your love for Lv Beiyi real too?

60
00:05:36,364 --> 00:05:37,244
What did you say?

61
00:05:39,483 --> 00:05:40,483
Say that again.

62
00:05:50,644 --> 00:05:51,443
I said

63
00:05:54,244 --> 00:05:56,203
your love for Lv Beiyi is real.

64
00:05:59,924 --> 00:06:00,883
He Lianxin!

65
00:06:15,763 --> 00:06:17,524
Everything that we had been through

66
00:06:20,003 --> 00:06:21,804
had turned into dust.

67
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,323
When all is settled,

68
00:06:28,364 --> 00:06:32,003
it will be the end of our relationship.

69
00:07:03,404 --> 00:07:05,684
- Miss!
- Oh, Miss!

70
00:07:05,684 --> 00:07:06,723
Miss, are you all right?

71
00:07:06,723 --> 00:07:10,443
- Miss!
- Miss!

72
00:07:10,443 --> 00:07:11,804
Are you all right, Miss?

73
00:07:13,003 --> 00:07:14,163
Miss, open your eyes.

74
00:07:14,364 --> 00:07:15,603
- Miss!
- Miss!

75
00:07:28,723 --> 00:07:29,364
Lian,

76
00:07:30,603 --> 00:07:31,684
you're strong-willed.

77
00:07:32,883 --> 00:07:33,844
Don't you realize

78
00:07:34,844 --> 00:07:36,763
that life has more suffering
than happiness?

79
00:07:37,844 --> 00:07:39,763
We will lose what we have eventually.

80
00:07:40,203 --> 00:07:41,964
You don't have to be so stubborn

81
00:07:42,443 --> 00:07:44,603
and give up on your life like this.

82
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:46,684
Lian,

83
00:07:47,124 --> 00:07:48,323
was this child

84
00:07:48,323 --> 00:07:49,483
your only family

85
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:52,003
and I'm not?

86
00:07:52,323 --> 00:07:54,043
Are they not your family too?

87
00:08:06,364 --> 00:08:07,043
Miss,

88
00:08:08,124 --> 00:08:10,283
this child has been with you
for eight months.

89
00:08:11,844 --> 00:08:13,964
But I've stayed by your side
since I was young.

90
00:08:15,483 --> 00:08:16,763
Do you really have the heart

91
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,043
to abandon me?

92
00:08:25,564 --> 00:08:27,524
If I knew you were going to die so soon,

93
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:31,323
I wouldn't have stayed by your side
for so long.

94
00:08:32,483 --> 00:08:33,684
Miss.

95
00:08:33,924 --> 00:08:36,084
Miss, please wake up.

96
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:37,643
I can never find a master

97
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:39,643
who is as kind as you.

98
00:08:39,643 --> 00:08:41,324
Open your eyes.

99
00:08:43,004 --> 00:08:43,924
Miss,

100
00:08:45,004 --> 00:08:46,163
wake up.

101
00:09:00,884 --> 00:09:01,403
Girl,

102
00:09:02,924 --> 00:09:07,163
don't you want to see me
live with regret, in pain,

103
00:09:07,843 --> 00:09:10,283
and watch me pay the price for this?

104
00:09:12,723 --> 00:09:13,324
Girl...

105
00:09:16,004 --> 00:09:17,324
Girl, please wake up.

106
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:33,004
Lian is awake.

107
00:09:40,723 --> 00:09:41,884
She's awake.

108
00:09:42,804 --> 00:09:44,764
- She's awake.
- She's finally awake.

109
00:09:45,564 --> 00:09:46,324
That's great.

110
00:09:46,684 --> 00:09:47,643
Miss is awake.

111
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:48,564
Thank goodness!

112
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:58,283
Young Master.

113
00:10:04,643 --> 00:10:05,204
Yes, girl?

114
00:10:07,004 --> 00:10:07,884
Demote me

115
00:10:09,764 --> 00:10:11,004
to a commoner

116
00:10:12,603 --> 00:10:13,860
and move me to the secondary courtyard.

117
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:30,684
All right.

118
00:10:31,204 --> 00:10:31,764
All right.

119
00:10:36,364 --> 00:10:37,204
You agreed?

120
00:10:41,483 --> 00:10:42,364
This is unlike you.

121
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,760
You knew the influence she has
in front of Father.

122
00:10:45,124 --> 00:10:46,460
How could you agree to her angry words?

123
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:50,480
You should have made her stay.

124
00:10:50,924 --> 00:10:52,220
No matter what, you must make her stay.

125
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:55,924
I can't bear

126
00:10:55,924 --> 00:10:57,324
to see when she looks at me.

127
00:10:59,204 --> 00:11:00,083
They're as cold as ice.

128
00:11:01,523 --> 00:11:02,643
There's no warmth at all.

129
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:05,364
I should have.

130
00:11:06,444 --> 00:11:07,244
I have many ways

131
00:11:07,244 --> 00:11:08,444
to make others stay.

132
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:10,603
But when I faced her,

133
00:11:13,723 --> 00:11:14,924
all I felt was feeling sorry for her.

134
00:11:16,963 --> 00:11:18,004
After you leave today,

135
00:11:18,843 --> 00:11:20,364
I don't know
when we'll see each other again.

136
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,070
You must take care of yourself
in the secondary courtyard.

137
00:11:24,804 --> 00:11:25,924
If there's any opportunity,

138
00:11:26,723 --> 00:11:27,643
we'll find a way

139
00:11:27,643 --> 00:11:28,603
to bring you back.

140
00:11:30,364 --> 00:11:31,163
Rong,

141
00:11:33,963 --> 00:11:35,163
what do I have left to cherish?

142
00:11:37,324 --> 00:11:38,564
I've lost everything.

143
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:39,364
Who says that?

144
00:11:42,564 --> 00:11:43,570
You should find out the truth.

145
00:11:45,963 --> 00:11:46,483
What?

146
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:47,764
Do you truly believe

147
00:11:47,764 --> 00:11:48,723
this was an accident?

148
00:11:49,804 --> 00:11:51,220
How could something
so convenient happen?

149
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:53,083
There's only one route.

150
00:11:54,124 --> 00:11:55,643
Young Master could avoid it.

151
00:11:56,124 --> 00:11:57,163
But not you?

152
00:11:58,004 --> 00:11:58,723
Don't you think

153
00:11:58,723 --> 00:12:00,043
this incident is suspicious?

154
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,403
Rou, are you saying...

155
00:12:07,004 --> 00:12:07,804
Nan Ruzhen.

156
00:12:08,963 --> 00:12:09,780
She must be behind this.

157
00:12:16,124 --> 00:12:17,083
I may

158
00:12:17,924 --> 00:12:19,643
not know what method she used.

159
00:12:20,523 --> 00:12:21,444
But don't worry,

160
00:12:22,723 --> 00:12:23,764
Rong and I

161
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:25,843
will help you get to the bottom of this.

162
00:12:26,764 --> 00:12:27,884
The killer must pay the price.

163
00:12:28,963 --> 00:12:30,204
If heaven doesn't give you justice,

164
00:12:30,204 --> 00:12:31,270
you have to seek it for yourself.

165
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,843
The secondary courtyard
in the south outskirts

166
00:12:33,843 --> 00:12:35,163
is just a point in your life.

167
00:12:35,564 --> 00:12:36,603
It's definitely not the end.

168
00:12:37,963 --> 00:12:38,483
Remember,

169
00:12:40,244 --> 00:12:41,244
you must keep on living.

170
00:12:43,244 --> 00:12:44,924
On the day when the truth is revealed,

171
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:47,083
no matter how tough it gets,

172
00:12:48,124 --> 00:12:49,043
you must seek justice

173
00:12:49,043 --> 00:12:50,483
for your child with your own hands.

174
00:12:51,924 --> 00:12:53,204
Thank you for your advice.

175
00:12:55,564 --> 00:12:56,403
I'll remember that.

176
00:13:01,764 --> 00:13:02,324
Lian'er,

177
00:13:03,564 --> 00:13:04,364
remember

178
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:06,564
that Young Master does love you.

179
00:13:07,723 --> 00:13:09,204
He will change his mind

180
00:13:10,043 --> 00:13:10,884
and bring you back.

181
00:14:52,403 --> 00:14:53,960
There are two things
I regret most in my life.

182
00:14:55,324 --> 00:14:55,804
The first one

183
00:14:56,804 --> 00:14:59,010
is failing to stop Lian'er
from entering the Mansion's selection.

184
00:15:00,163 --> 00:15:00,630
The second one

185
00:15:01,564 --> 00:15:02,403
is not taking

186
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:03,684
the three chances you gave me.

187
00:15:07,764 --> 00:15:08,764
Now, I want to know

188
00:15:09,523 --> 00:15:10,444
if

189
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,523
you will ever regret this one day.

190
00:15:20,523 --> 00:15:21,843
Lian'er is now a commoner,

191
00:15:22,364 --> 00:15:23,884
and I'm now asking for a fourth chance.

192
00:15:32,244 --> 00:15:34,403
You'll never have a chance
in this lifetime.

193
00:15:40,444 --> 00:15:41,764
Because in this lifetime,

194
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:46,204
Luo Qinglian

195
00:15:46,204 --> 00:15:47,723
will always be mine.

196
00:15:57,643 --> 00:15:59,083
This reward is from Master.

197
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,004
Besides this,

198
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,970
she also arranged a small official position
for your elder brother,

199
00:16:05,523 --> 00:16:06,564
which he can start immediately.

200
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:09,204
One life

201
00:16:10,204 --> 00:16:11,843
in exchange for my family's honor.

202
00:16:13,843 --> 00:16:14,643
It's worth it.

203
00:16:16,723 --> 00:16:18,163
After serving her for so many years,

204
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:20,723
she has treated me well.

205
00:16:22,204 --> 00:16:23,043
So,

206
00:16:24,043 --> 00:16:24,843
do it.

207
00:16:26,564 --> 00:16:27,643
This is your fate.

208
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:34,684
Young Master.

209
00:16:35,043 --> 00:16:35,523
Young Master!

210
00:16:37,444 --> 00:16:39,083
Young Master,
someone from the Mansion is here.

211
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,270
His Highness has ordered you
to go to the Mansion immediately.

212
00:16:45,564 --> 00:16:46,163
Your Highness,

213
00:16:48,283 --> 00:16:48,884
he's here.

214
00:17:01,163 --> 00:17:03,364
Greetings, Father.

215
00:17:03,843 --> 00:17:05,403
Is my grandson

216
00:17:07,364 --> 00:17:08,283
no longer with us?

217
00:17:10,724 --> 00:17:11,163
Yes.

218
00:17:12,643 --> 00:17:13,844
Please don't be sad.

219
00:17:16,204 --> 00:17:17,043
Did you

220
00:17:19,604 --> 00:17:20,844
demote Luo Qinglian

221
00:17:21,643 --> 00:17:22,844
to a commoner

222
00:17:23,604 --> 00:17:24,444
and send her away today?

223
00:17:26,564 --> 00:17:26,964
Yes, I did.

224
00:17:31,204 --> 00:17:32,003
I thought

225
00:17:33,283 --> 00:17:34,444
this girl was constantly

226
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:35,523
on your mind

227
00:17:36,043 --> 00:17:37,324
and worried about her.

228
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:40,324
Why would you do that to her

229
00:17:41,003 --> 00:17:42,643
and even send her
to the secondary courtyard?

230
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,243
She requested to go
to the secondary courtyard.

231
00:17:48,043 --> 00:17:48,844
This decision

232
00:17:50,204 --> 00:17:51,684
might be the best option for her.

233
00:17:52,883 --> 00:17:53,724
She once said

234
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,324
I have too many women.

235
00:17:57,724 --> 00:17:59,043
She didn't want to be just one of them.

236
00:18:00,043 --> 00:18:00,724
I think

237
00:18:02,243 --> 00:18:03,564
she's no longer one of them.

238
00:18:05,163 --> 00:18:06,484
That's your affair.

239
00:18:07,484 --> 00:18:08,684
You can decide that yourself.

240
00:18:09,444 --> 00:18:10,564
But I heard

241
00:18:11,363 --> 00:18:13,204
the child died

242
00:18:13,204 --> 00:18:15,403
because of your negligence.

243
00:18:17,204 --> 00:18:18,363
Is that true?

244
00:18:20,204 --> 00:18:20,804
I admit

245
00:18:21,924 --> 00:18:22,684
I was negligent.

246
00:18:23,724 --> 00:18:24,924
Please punish me, Father.

247
00:18:30,403 --> 00:18:30,924
All right.

248
00:18:36,204 --> 00:18:37,283
Let me ask you this.

249
00:18:40,804 --> 00:18:42,204
When Luo Qinglian was in labor,

250
00:18:42,844 --> 00:18:43,804
where were you?

251
00:18:48,444 --> 00:18:49,163
I

252
00:18:50,043 --> 00:18:50,844
drank too much

253
00:18:52,163 --> 00:18:52,724
and was drunk.

254
00:18:53,403 --> 00:18:54,043
That means

255
00:18:56,204 --> 00:18:57,564
you were not with her all night.

256
00:18:59,964 --> 00:19:00,484
Yes.

257
00:19:01,804 --> 00:19:03,604
Not a single one reported it to you?

258
00:19:06,243 --> 00:19:06,684
Yes.

259
00:19:10,084 --> 00:19:11,123
I heard

260
00:19:12,643 --> 00:19:13,243
you ordered

261
00:19:14,643 --> 00:19:16,883
the mansion gates to be shut that night,

262
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:18,724
not allowing anyone in or out.

263
00:19:20,484 --> 00:19:21,123
That's impossible.

264
00:19:21,724 --> 00:19:22,964
I would never issue such an order.

265
00:19:22,964 --> 00:19:24,804
Do you think you have too many sons?

266
00:19:27,844 --> 00:19:28,804
Or do you only treat her

267
00:19:28,804 --> 00:19:29,883
as a servant-concubine?

268
00:19:30,123 --> 00:19:31,763
I never treated her
as a servant-concubine.

269
00:19:39,084 --> 00:19:41,643
How do you expect me to believe you?

270
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:46,523
Yu Dechang.

271
00:19:46,724 --> 00:19:47,123
Yes.

272
00:19:47,763 --> 00:19:48,804
Issue an order

273
00:19:49,163 --> 00:19:50,523
to bring all involved servants here

274
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,444
from last night.

275
00:19:51,883 --> 00:19:53,180
I'll personally investigate this matter.

276
00:19:53,804 --> 00:19:56,804
I can't allow the grandson I've been waiting
for half a year to die in vain.

277
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:57,604
Yes.

278
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,084
Did you know Luo Qinglian was in labor

279
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:05,643
last night?

280
00:20:06,403 --> 00:20:08,003
I know.

281
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,570
Then why did the Third Young Master
know nothing about it?

282
00:20:14,043 --> 00:20:16,324
It's because she didn't allow us
to notify Young Master.

283
00:20:21,484 --> 00:20:22,500
Who was in charge of the gate?

284
00:20:25,763 --> 00:20:26,604
I was...

285
00:20:28,964 --> 00:20:31,523
- Why didn't you...
- Why didn't you let them to get a physician?

286
00:20:33,684 --> 00:20:34,804
It was Jianyu.

287
00:20:35,604 --> 00:20:36,800
She said Third Young Master ordered

288
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,403
that no one should go out.

289
00:20:42,403 --> 00:20:43,123
Jianyu should stay.

290
00:20:45,324 --> 00:20:46,324
The rest can leave.

291
00:20:46,564 --> 00:20:47,283
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

292
00:20:54,484 --> 00:20:55,123
Jianyu,

293
00:20:55,243 --> 00:20:56,204
did Third Young Master

294
00:20:56,204 --> 00:20:57,243
order you to do that?

295
00:21:01,804 --> 00:21:02,403
No.

296
00:21:02,964 --> 00:21:05,043
I faked the order
by Third Young Master.

297
00:21:07,243 --> 00:21:08,283
Why did you do that?

298
00:21:08,444 --> 00:21:09,123
Why?

299
00:21:09,844 --> 00:21:10,643
Who ordered you?

300
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,084
Tell me who ordered you to do that!

301
00:21:13,484 --> 00:21:13,924
Who?

302
00:21:14,403 --> 00:21:15,363
Who was it?

303
00:21:16,003 --> 00:21:16,523
Answer me!

304
00:21:22,163 --> 00:21:22,804
Your Highness,

305
00:21:24,523 --> 00:21:26,724
I've been nothing but a loyal servant.

306
00:21:40,684 --> 00:21:41,163
Me?

307
00:21:42,564 --> 00:21:44,123
I've never seen her before in my life.

308
00:21:49,523 --> 00:21:50,084
Stay still!

309
00:22:02,444 --> 00:22:02,924
Someone,

310
00:22:04,283 --> 00:22:04,763
take her away.

311
00:22:20,444 --> 00:22:20,924
Father,

312
00:22:21,363 --> 00:22:22,403
I truly have never seen

313
00:22:22,403 --> 00:22:23,204
that maidservant before.

314
00:22:32,243 --> 00:22:32,844
Lianchu.

315
00:22:34,403 --> 00:22:34,964
Yes, Father.

316
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,461
(Kill the child in Luo Qinglian's womb.)

317
00:22:47,218 --> 00:22:49,450
(Kill the child in Luo Qinglian's womb.)

318
00:22:50,763 --> 00:22:52,163
Lianxin, read it.

319
00:22:55,523 --> 00:22:58,403
"Kill the child in Luo Qinglian's womb."

320
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:13,130
(Kill the child in Luo Qinglian's womb.)

321
00:23:14,163 --> 00:23:15,243
This is your handwriting, right?

322
00:23:31,163 --> 00:23:32,484
Is this your handwriting?

323
00:23:34,243 --> 00:23:35,204
Father.

324
00:23:35,883 --> 00:23:37,564
It's indeed my handwriting.

325
00:23:37,804 --> 00:23:38,324
But...

326
00:23:40,684 --> 00:23:41,403
Lianchu,

327
00:23:41,724 --> 00:23:42,564
did you think

328
00:23:42,564 --> 00:23:43,924
by killing Luo Qinglian's child,

329
00:23:44,964 --> 00:23:46,003
I would let you assist me

330
00:23:46,003 --> 00:23:47,403
in state affairs?

331
00:23:48,964 --> 00:23:49,403
Father,

332
00:23:49,403 --> 00:23:49,883
I

333
00:23:50,403 --> 00:23:51,484
dare not.

334
00:23:52,523 --> 00:23:53,003
Father,

335
00:23:54,123 --> 00:23:55,163
I'm innocent.

336
00:24:03,844 --> 00:24:05,924
Lianxiu, you set me up.

337
00:24:06,243 --> 00:24:07,283
Why did you set me up?

338
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,763
You better explain this to Father.

339
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,523
Explain it to Father!

340
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,363
- Lianchu.
- Father.

341
00:24:10,363 --> 00:24:11,123
Please calm down.

342
00:24:11,163 --> 00:24:12,204
Explain it to Father!

343
00:24:12,204 --> 00:24:12,484
Lianchu!

344
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:13,643
Tell him! Explain...

345
00:24:13,643 --> 00:24:14,403
Lianchu!

346
00:24:18,163 --> 00:24:19,324
Are you still trying to deny it?

347
00:24:26,484 --> 00:24:28,243
The heir did not write this.

348
00:24:44,724 --> 00:24:45,840
Your Highness, please forgive me.

349
00:24:48,564 --> 00:24:49,243
I

350
00:24:50,924 --> 00:24:51,763
acted on my own will

351
00:24:52,523 --> 00:24:54,204
in this matter.

352
00:24:55,724 --> 00:24:56,643
The reason

353
00:24:57,403 --> 00:24:59,163
I imitated the heir's handwriting

354
00:24:59,763 --> 00:25:01,403
and used his name

355
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,900
was because I was afraid

356
00:25:04,844 --> 00:25:06,724
it wouldn't be convincing.

357
00:25:07,403 --> 00:25:07,964
Your Highness,

358
00:25:08,204 --> 00:25:10,043
please do not misunderstand

359
00:25:10,043 --> 00:25:11,643
the heir.

360
00:25:17,523 --> 00:25:18,123
Granduncle,

361
00:25:18,243 --> 00:25:18,804
do not do this.

362
00:25:20,844 --> 00:25:22,003
I did it because of you!

363
00:25:22,883 --> 00:25:24,964
You're not eager
to assist with state affairs.

364
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:26,684
But I am!

365
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,523
To avoid a lifelong regret,

366
00:25:29,924 --> 00:25:30,564
I had no choice

367
00:25:31,444 --> 00:25:34,283
but to resort to this plan.

368
00:25:47,043 --> 00:25:47,604
Your Highness,

369
00:25:49,243 --> 00:25:51,964
I confess.

370
00:25:52,243 --> 00:25:53,844
Please punish me.

371
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:18,604
Put the heir under house arrest.

372
00:26:20,883 --> 00:26:22,684
Deal with  Official Yuan later.

373
00:27:00,724 --> 00:27:01,403
Baili,

374
00:27:04,964 --> 00:27:05,444
here.

375
00:27:07,484 --> 00:27:07,980
Have a drink.

376
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:08,604
Your Highness.

377
00:27:16,724 --> 00:27:17,564
The first toast

378
00:27:18,844 --> 00:27:20,003
is to thank you

379
00:27:20,804 --> 00:27:22,084
for helping me

380
00:27:22,403 --> 00:27:23,844
leave the capital safely

381
00:27:24,844 --> 00:27:26,084
and settle down in Quliang.

382
00:27:41,523 --> 00:27:42,363
The second toast

383
00:27:43,003 --> 00:27:45,363
is to thank you

384
00:27:45,804 --> 00:27:46,844
for working so hard

385
00:27:47,403 --> 00:27:48,604
as my right-hand man all these years

386
00:27:49,003 --> 00:27:50,763
and turning the barren Quliang

387
00:27:51,684 --> 00:27:53,643
into a prosperous city.

388
00:28:05,444 --> 00:28:05,970
One more drink.

389
00:28:12,003 --> 00:28:13,003
For the third toast,

390
00:28:15,003 --> 00:28:16,363
I want to thank you

391
00:28:18,484 --> 00:28:20,123
for taking the fall for Lianchu.

392
00:28:23,924 --> 00:28:24,444
But

393
00:28:26,363 --> 00:28:27,883
I can't let you do it.

394
00:28:32,084 --> 00:28:33,444
I can't let you

395
00:28:35,684 --> 00:28:38,003
ruin your lifetime reputation
because of Lianchu.

396
00:28:59,403 --> 00:29:00,243
Baili,

397
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:02,643
if you have any requests,

398
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,763
I will grant them.

399
00:29:15,883 --> 00:29:16,363
Your Highness,

400
00:29:18,363 --> 00:29:19,444
my life

401
00:29:20,763 --> 00:29:23,003
is near its end.

402
00:29:25,924 --> 00:29:28,084
My only wish

403
00:29:31,283 --> 00:29:35,163
is for the heir's safety.

404
00:29:38,084 --> 00:29:38,604
Your Highness.

405
00:29:46,763 --> 00:29:47,403
Your Highness,

406
00:29:50,844 --> 00:29:53,403
please spare the heir

407
00:29:57,363 --> 00:30:00,523
and sentence me with severe punishment.

408
00:30:02,043 --> 00:30:02,724
Your Highness!

409
00:31:25,883 --> 00:31:26,484
Your Highness.

410
00:31:30,403 --> 00:31:31,204
Your Highness,

411
00:31:33,163 --> 00:31:34,123
until we meet again

412
00:31:35,484 --> 00:31:36,643
in the next life.

413
00:31:48,844 --> 00:31:50,564
(A person's fate
is determined by heaven.)

414
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,763
(No one can control)

415
00:31:53,844 --> 00:31:54,844
(or change it.)

416
00:31:56,924 --> 00:31:57,950
(Trying to change it by force)

417
00:31:58,444 --> 00:32:00,123
(will only bring more suffering.)

418
00:32:04,243 --> 00:32:06,003
(I never believed this.)

419
00:32:42,883 --> 00:32:44,564
(Just like my current situation.)

420
00:32:47,824 --> 00:32:50,624
(Secondary courtyard)

421
00:33:31,043 --> 00:33:31,964
Mu Haiyao.

422
00:33:45,643 --> 00:33:48,003
