17
00:01:49,757 --> 00:01:51,437
Do you want to find out with me?

18
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:01,836
You're also aware

19
00:02:02,516 --> 00:02:04,476
I'm known as the Idle Young Master

20
00:02:04,476 --> 00:02:05,637
where all I think of

21
00:02:06,156 --> 00:02:07,077
are the matters

22
00:02:08,276 --> 00:02:09,717
of Baizhen Lane.

23
00:02:31,436 --> 00:02:33,436
Lianxiu, my brother.

24
00:02:34,317 --> 00:02:36,957
Do you enjoy chatting with me?

25
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,477
Look at you,
happy to the point of tears.

26
00:02:38,477 --> 00:02:39,277
Oh, Lianxin.

27
00:02:40,037 --> 00:02:41,516
Have some tea.

28
00:02:44,156 --> 00:02:46,277
That was a clever way
to achieve one's goal.

29
00:02:46,996 --> 00:02:48,516
The heir's problem is solved.

30
00:02:48,837 --> 00:02:50,197
The silver owed

31
00:02:50,596 --> 00:02:51,757
can finally be paid off.

32
00:02:52,277 --> 00:02:53,596
These things aren't the most important.

33
00:02:54,477 --> 00:02:55,477
From now on,

34
00:02:56,236 --> 00:02:56,876
Young Master Xiu

35
00:02:57,436 --> 00:02:58,037
no longer

36
00:02:58,037 --> 00:02:59,516
has the means to go against you.

37
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:02,596
If I may be bold to ask,

38
00:03:03,277 --> 00:03:05,796
have I passed the test?

39
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:08,677
You're knowledgeable,
excel in military strategies,

40
00:03:08,677 --> 00:03:09,796
and exceptional in medical skills.

41
00:03:10,037 --> 00:03:11,117
If I refused you,

42
00:03:11,117 --> 00:03:13,436
wouldn't that make me
the biggest fool in the world?

43
00:03:13,996 --> 00:03:14,677
Please take a seat.

44
00:03:21,796 --> 00:03:22,636
But

45
00:03:22,917 --> 00:03:25,236
I want to be that fool.

46
00:03:31,037 --> 00:03:32,076
Because of her?

47
00:03:39,596 --> 00:03:40,397
How unexpected of you.

48
00:03:40,957 --> 00:03:42,197
Between a woman and ambition,

49
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,397
you actually chose a woman.

50
00:03:44,796 --> 00:03:45,557
How would you choose?

51
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:46,716
I would choose

52
00:03:46,716 --> 00:03:47,917
to have control over my life.

53
00:03:48,716 --> 00:03:50,197
Only when I live without being controlled

54
00:03:50,317 --> 00:03:51,996
can I have both women and ambitions.

55
00:04:00,117 --> 00:04:00,716
That

56
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:03,516
was the last chance I gave you.

57
00:04:07,796 --> 00:04:08,596
The first time

58
00:04:09,677 --> 00:04:10,970
was when you stood her up in the forest.

59
00:04:11,397 --> 00:04:12,516
That's how she became my woman.

60
00:04:12,876 --> 00:04:15,156
The second time was when you met again
under the moonlight.

61
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:16,477
You rejected her and pushed her away.

62
00:04:17,796 --> 00:04:18,557
Lv Beiyi,

63
00:04:21,557 --> 00:04:23,277
I gave you three chances

64
00:04:23,277 --> 00:04:24,316
to get the woman you want.

65
00:04:25,196 --> 00:04:26,557
But you chose to give up every time.

66
00:04:30,076 --> 00:04:31,796
So, from now on,

67
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,597
you and Luo Qinglian

68
00:04:33,837 --> 00:04:35,236
have no connection.

69
00:04:36,036 --> 00:04:37,916
Is this the condition to become your aide?

70
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:38,677
No.

71
00:04:39,476 --> 00:04:40,316
I don't need to choose

72
00:04:40,316 --> 00:04:42,236
between ambitions and women
because I'll have both.

73
00:04:43,036 --> 00:04:45,236
So, this isn't the condition for you
to be my aide.

74
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:46,796
Remember this.

75
00:04:47,476 --> 00:04:48,476
I'll win her

76
00:04:49,117 --> 00:04:50,677
not because you gave up.

77
00:04:54,117 --> 00:04:56,476
Don't you think you're too confident?

78
00:04:59,476 --> 00:05:00,277
Lv Beiyi,

79
00:05:00,356 --> 00:05:01,437
do you know

80
00:05:01,717 --> 00:05:02,597
my favorite phrase

81
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:05,036
in this world?

82
00:05:05,837 --> 00:05:09,397
"There's a whole lifetime ahead."

83
00:05:11,516 --> 00:05:12,877
There are many things in this world

84
00:05:12,877 --> 00:05:13,957
that are worth waiting for.

85
00:05:14,957 --> 00:05:16,837
Be it women or Quliang.

86
00:05:17,277 --> 00:05:19,877
And what I have is patience.

87
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:23,877
Let's go, Master Lv.

88
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:36,557
Young Master.

89
00:05:38,036 --> 00:05:38,557
Young Master,

90
00:05:38,837 --> 00:05:40,117
we have collected many antiques

91
00:05:40,236 --> 00:05:40,997
at low prices today.

92
00:05:41,117 --> 00:05:42,597
Do you want me to show them to you?

93
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:43,597
Sell them.

94
00:05:45,157 --> 00:05:46,117
Sell them all!

95
00:05:46,516 --> 00:05:47,397
Yes, Young Master.

96
00:05:58,957 --> 00:06:00,157
Madam, aren't you going in?

97
00:06:00,677 --> 00:06:02,397
I heard even Madam Yao
suffered a downfall too.

98
00:06:02,837 --> 00:06:03,476
Yes.

99
00:06:04,316 --> 00:06:05,756
Madam Yao sure was unlucky.

100
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,570
This is just when she thought
she was doing well.

101
00:06:08,397 --> 00:06:09,997
Do you really think it was bad luck?

102
00:06:12,117 --> 00:06:13,236
Luo Qinglian,

103
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,756
it seems my concern about you was right.

104
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:19,076
Have you found the one I asked for?

105
00:06:19,717 --> 00:06:20,677
I've found that person.

106
00:06:20,677 --> 00:06:22,470
She's just waiting for you
to personally instruct her.

107
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:23,476
Well done.

108
00:06:24,397 --> 00:06:25,877
The day we'll need her

109
00:06:26,356 --> 00:06:27,397
won't be too far away.

110
00:06:30,277 --> 00:06:30,877
(Your Highness,)

111
00:06:31,236 --> 00:06:32,837
(I have done as you have instructed)

112
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:34,957
(and returned the silver owed
by Young Master Xin)

113
00:06:34,957 --> 00:06:36,370
(to the Testaments and Treasures Bureau.)

114
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,756
(Official Zheng from the bureau said)

115
00:06:37,756 --> 00:06:39,877
(the treasury in Quliang is full.)

116
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:41,430
(We won't have to worry
about it for years.)

117
00:06:50,437 --> 00:06:51,636
(The growth of Quliang)

118
00:06:51,837 --> 00:06:53,316
(is Mu's hope.)

119
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:24,320
(General Xin's Mansion)

120
00:07:27,877 --> 00:07:28,557
Back then,

121
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:30,516
I used to bask in glory.

122
00:07:31,277 --> 00:07:32,196
Today, I've came down.

123
00:07:33,076 --> 00:07:34,970
I never expected you
would be the only one to see me off.

124
00:07:35,316 --> 00:07:36,597
People's hearts are fickle.

125
00:07:37,516 --> 00:07:38,997
Why take all those pretense

126
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:40,410
during good times seriously?

127
00:07:42,476 --> 00:07:43,236
I never expected

128
00:07:44,516 --> 00:07:45,730
the only one who truly cared for me

129
00:07:46,397 --> 00:07:47,076
would be you.

130
00:07:48,157 --> 00:07:50,316
It's a pity that my plans

131
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,236
had led to this outcome.

132
00:07:57,756 --> 00:07:58,277
How dare you.

133
00:07:58,717 --> 00:07:59,837
How dense can you be?

134
00:07:59,957 --> 00:08:01,877
Is this plain carriage suitable
for Madam Yao to ride in?

135
00:08:02,117 --> 00:08:03,316
Don't you know the usual carriage

136
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,356
that Madam Yao rides in?

137
00:08:05,397 --> 00:08:06,397
I ordered them to do so.

138
00:08:15,397 --> 00:08:16,476
Things are different now.

139
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,670
We're just following the rules.

140
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,557
I hope you won't mind, Haiyao.

141
00:08:20,516 --> 00:08:22,196
Cut the pretentious act here.

142
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,270
I'll make this clear to you.

143
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,877
As long as I'm alive,

144
00:08:26,476 --> 00:08:27,916
you're my enemy.

145
00:08:28,397 --> 00:08:29,636
Well, I never intend

146
00:08:29,636 --> 00:08:30,957
to be your friend anyway.

147
00:08:31,877 --> 00:08:32,916
Since I can be

148
00:08:32,997 --> 00:08:34,277
the person you hate the most,

149
00:08:34,717 --> 00:08:35,636
why not?

150
00:08:36,277 --> 00:08:37,196
The person I hate the most?

151
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,516
You're still not worthy.

152
00:08:40,957 --> 00:08:41,636
Mu Haiyao,

153
00:08:41,756 --> 00:08:42,957
you're now a commoner.

154
00:08:43,516 --> 00:08:44,397
Madam Rui speaking to you

155
00:08:44,397 --> 00:08:45,397
is giving you face.

156
00:08:45,597 --> 00:08:46,516
Watch your manners.

157
00:08:49,116 --> 00:08:50,570
Have you all had enough
of this commotion?

158
00:08:50,876 --> 00:08:51,717
If there's nothing else,

159
00:08:51,717 --> 00:08:52,756
just get back to your place.

160
00:08:53,636 --> 00:08:55,196
I want to wait for Young Master here.

161
00:08:55,597 --> 00:08:56,516
Young Master is not here.

162
00:08:57,196 --> 00:08:57,797
What?

163
00:08:58,477 --> 00:08:59,917
He went out early in the morning.

164
00:09:02,237 --> 00:09:03,037
Why?

165
00:09:04,316 --> 00:09:05,516
You never expect

166
00:09:05,797 --> 00:09:07,717
Young Master wouldn't even see you
one last time?

167
00:09:09,357 --> 00:09:10,116
That's impossible.

168
00:09:11,876 --> 00:09:13,076
Young Master will come back.

169
00:09:13,597 --> 00:09:14,196
You're someone

170
00:09:14,196 --> 00:09:15,676
whom His Highness can't tolerate.

171
00:09:16,996 --> 00:09:18,116
Do you think Young Master

172
00:09:18,597 --> 00:09:19,996
will treat you the same as before?

173
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:37,436
Haiyao.

174
00:09:37,837 --> 00:09:38,477
Young Master.

175
00:09:40,876 --> 00:09:41,717
Since you're leaving,

176
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,770
have you packed enough food
and everything you need?

177
00:09:43,837 --> 00:09:44,930
Is there anything you still need?

178
00:09:48,237 --> 00:09:48,876
Young Master,

179
00:09:49,876 --> 00:09:50,756
I won't be able

180
00:09:51,196 --> 00:09:52,917
to serve you by your side after this.

181
00:09:53,436 --> 00:09:54,676
I hope

182
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,957
you'll take good care of yourself
and be safe.

183
00:10:01,756 --> 00:10:02,477
Get up.

184
00:10:04,756 --> 00:10:05,556
Haiyao.

185
00:10:09,636 --> 00:10:10,516
Thank you for your concern.

186
00:10:11,996 --> 00:10:12,676
Don't worry.

187
00:10:13,516 --> 00:10:14,477
I'll take extra precautions.

188
00:10:15,116 --> 00:10:16,037
Moreover,

189
00:10:16,636 --> 00:10:18,556
Master Lv has excellent medical skills.

190
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:19,917
With him by my side,

191
00:10:20,876 --> 00:10:21,930
I don't have to worry anymore.

192
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:23,957
Lv Beiyi?

193
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:25,876
Listen up, everyone.

194
00:10:26,636 --> 00:10:27,477
From today on,

195
00:10:27,876 --> 00:10:29,516
Master Lv will be my aide.

196
00:10:29,756 --> 00:10:30,756
I don't want to hear anything

197
00:10:31,436 --> 00:10:33,116
about what happened in the past.

198
00:10:33,397 --> 00:10:34,196
- Yes.
- Yes.

199
00:10:43,116 --> 00:10:43,917
Haiyao,

200
00:10:44,996 --> 00:10:45,917
it's getting late.

201
00:10:46,876 --> 00:10:49,076
Do you have any requests?

202
00:10:54,516 --> 00:10:55,196
Young Master,

203
00:10:56,636 --> 00:10:57,756
can I really speak of it?

204
00:10:58,477 --> 00:10:59,116
Of course.

205
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:05,076
Apart from you,

206
00:11:05,237 --> 00:11:06,797
I'm most concerned

207
00:11:07,037 --> 00:11:08,477
about my newborn child.

208
00:11:08,957 --> 00:11:10,837
It's a pity that he'll be separated
from his birth mother

209
00:11:11,477 --> 00:11:12,797
at such a young age.

210
00:11:13,996 --> 00:11:15,196
So, I earnestly request,

211
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,037
if there's a chance,

212
00:11:17,436 --> 00:11:18,837
I hope I can come back

213
00:11:18,957 --> 00:11:20,116
to visit my child more.

214
00:11:26,516 --> 00:11:27,196
You can rest assured.

215
00:11:28,556 --> 00:11:29,516
This child

216
00:11:30,196 --> 00:11:31,516
will have a new mother to care for him.

217
00:11:31,876 --> 00:11:32,996
He won't suffer.

218
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:37,477
What?

219
00:11:42,556 --> 00:11:43,756
Haiyao, you said

220
00:11:44,196 --> 00:11:46,676
the child can't be without a mother.

221
00:11:47,717 --> 00:11:48,397
I've decided

222
00:11:50,037 --> 00:11:50,876
to let

223
00:11:51,636 --> 00:11:53,837
Qianmo raise and care for the child.

224
00:12:03,277 --> 00:12:04,717
Young Master.

225
00:12:05,037 --> 00:12:06,116
Young Master, no.

226
00:12:06,237 --> 00:12:07,957
You must let me raise this child.

227
00:12:07,957 --> 00:12:09,797
He can't live without me, Young Master.

228
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:10,917
Haiyao.

229
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:12,277
Haiyao.

230
00:12:12,436 --> 00:12:12,917
Young Master.

231
00:12:13,157 --> 00:12:13,756
Don't worry.

232
00:12:14,717 --> 00:12:15,957
We will take good care of him.

233
00:12:23,957 --> 00:12:24,597
Raise him well.

234
00:12:25,237 --> 00:12:26,237
I hope he'll be as outstanding

235
00:12:26,676 --> 00:12:28,196
as your father in the future.

236
00:12:28,316 --> 00:12:30,756
Thank you very much, Young Master.

237
00:12:40,756 --> 00:12:41,397
Young Master.

238
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:44,436
Young Master,

239
00:12:46,797 --> 00:12:48,116
I have a request.

240
00:12:49,316 --> 00:12:49,957
Speak.

241
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:52,660
The journey to the southern outskirts

242
00:12:55,756 --> 00:12:56,756
is lonely.

243
00:12:57,597 --> 00:12:58,477
I hope

244
00:13:00,076 --> 00:13:01,397
someone can accompany me.

245
00:13:34,477 --> 00:13:35,597
What is she up to?

246
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:37,477
Mu Haiyao doesn't make decisions

247
00:13:37,876 --> 00:13:39,196
without a purpose.

248
00:13:43,397 --> 00:13:44,237
Luo Qinglian,

249
00:13:44,756 --> 00:13:45,597
congratulations.

250
00:13:47,237 --> 00:13:48,436
Lv Beiyi

251
00:13:49,237 --> 00:13:50,196
is his aide now.

252
00:13:50,636 --> 00:13:52,516
As long as he serves diligently,

253
00:13:52,837 --> 00:13:54,316
Young Master will put his trust in him.

254
00:13:56,076 --> 00:13:56,797
But do you think

255
00:13:56,797 --> 00:13:58,237
Young Master

256
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,316
will elevate Lv Beiyi's status?

257
00:14:01,037 --> 00:14:02,516
Your past with Lv Beiyi

258
00:14:02,597 --> 00:14:04,556
is his lifelong shame.

259
00:14:05,357 --> 00:14:08,277
Lv Beiyi is useful to him for now.

260
00:14:08,876 --> 00:14:10,516
So he'll naturally treat him well.

261
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:12,116
But if he ever inherits

262
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,717
the title and becomes a prince,

263
00:14:14,316 --> 00:14:15,357
the first person he'll kill

264
00:14:16,837 --> 00:14:17,957
is Lv Beiyi.

265
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,157
Impossible.

266
00:14:19,436 --> 00:14:20,556
Do you think Young Master

267
00:14:20,957 --> 00:14:22,636
is a kind and honorable person?

268
00:14:23,516 --> 00:14:24,636
Look at everyone

269
00:14:24,636 --> 00:14:26,196
at the Young Master's Mansion.

270
00:14:26,436 --> 00:14:27,957
They're all his pawns.

271
00:14:28,837 --> 00:14:29,876
Once they're no longer useful,

272
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,597
they're cast aside like old shoes.

273
00:14:33,076 --> 00:14:34,397
I'm the best living proof.

274
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,556
He has no genuine feelings for me.

275
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:37,837
Let alone for you.

276
00:14:38,196 --> 00:14:39,797
Madam Yao, stop wasting your effort.

277
00:14:40,436 --> 00:14:41,917
I won't fall for your instigation.

278
00:14:46,316 --> 00:14:46,917
Luo Qinglian,

279
00:14:47,357 --> 00:14:48,636
you set up such a plot

280
00:14:49,357 --> 00:14:51,076
just to put me in a dire situation.

281
00:14:52,237 --> 00:14:53,316
But you had unwittingly

282
00:14:53,556 --> 00:14:54,837
accomplished one thing.

283
00:14:55,316 --> 00:14:56,996
As long my brother is alive,

284
00:14:57,717 --> 00:14:58,876
Young Master won't take my life

285
00:15:00,076 --> 00:15:01,477
no matter what I do wrong.

286
00:15:03,477 --> 00:15:04,316
What are you trying to do?

287
00:15:11,876 --> 00:15:12,516
Girl.

288
00:15:13,436 --> 00:15:14,037
Girl.

289
00:15:14,556 --> 00:15:15,157
Girl.

290
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:19,636
Bring the physician.

291
00:15:19,876 --> 00:15:20,636
Let me examine her.

292
00:15:33,996 --> 00:15:36,237
Young Master,
should I fetch the physician?

293
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,436
No need.

294
00:15:46,397 --> 00:15:47,070
Take some hot water.

295
00:15:49,037 --> 00:15:51,116
Young Master,
should I get some hot water?

296
00:15:57,196 --> 00:15:57,676
Young Master.

297
00:15:57,876 --> 00:15:59,397
Young Master, your arm is injured too.

298
00:15:59,397 --> 00:16:00,717
Why don't we tend to your wound first?

299
00:16:00,717 --> 00:16:01,436
No matter.

300
00:16:05,477 --> 00:16:06,570
Ms. Lian is not seriously injured.

301
00:16:07,196 --> 00:16:09,157
She passed out from shock, that's all.

302
00:16:29,717 --> 00:16:30,837
Yi...

303
00:16:36,717 --> 00:16:37,917
Yi...

304
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:39,756
I knew...

305
00:16:41,037 --> 00:16:41,837
I knew

306
00:16:41,837 --> 00:16:43,397
you would come and save me.

307
00:16:48,116 --> 00:16:49,076
Yi...

308
00:16:51,397 --> 00:16:52,597
Did you think I wanted to kill her?

309
00:16:53,837 --> 00:16:54,876
Weren't you?

310
00:16:55,277 --> 00:16:56,196
Of course not.

311
00:16:58,717 --> 00:16:59,797
The greatest pain

312
00:17:00,676 --> 00:17:01,957
is not death.

313
00:17:02,436 --> 00:17:03,477
But heartbreak.

314
00:17:09,837 --> 00:17:10,676
Yi...

315
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:12,436
Yi...

316
00:17:20,877 --> 00:17:21,637
Yi...

317
00:17:24,117 --> 00:17:25,556
Girl, take your medicine.

318
00:17:27,196 --> 00:17:27,717
Open up.

319
00:17:32,196 --> 00:17:32,717
Here.

320
00:17:35,517 --> 00:17:36,757
Young Master?

321
00:17:39,676 --> 00:17:41,076
Why are you here?

322
00:17:41,517 --> 00:17:42,036
I...

323
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:48,436
You're seriously injured.

324
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,597
But why do you keep fidgeting?

325
00:17:50,597 --> 00:17:51,196
Yi...

326
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:53,877
Where's Master Lv?

327
00:17:56,237 --> 00:17:57,196
All you need is me.

328
00:17:58,316 --> 00:17:59,170
I could take this chance

329
00:17:59,877 --> 00:18:01,877
to return your favor from last time.

330
00:18:02,556 --> 00:18:03,597
Then is he hurt?

331
00:18:05,196 --> 00:18:06,877
He's perfectly fine.

332
00:18:08,957 --> 00:18:10,076
I'm glad he's not hurt.

333
00:18:15,997 --> 00:18:17,477
Why aren't you concerned about me?

334
00:18:20,436 --> 00:18:21,717
I can't continue to be indebted to him.

335
00:18:22,997 --> 00:18:24,196
I owe him too much.

336
00:18:24,957 --> 00:18:26,196
I can't be indebted to him again.

337
00:18:26,676 --> 00:18:27,276
Why?

338
00:18:27,997 --> 00:18:29,396
Must it be him who saved you?

339
00:18:31,517 --> 00:18:32,237
If it wasn't him,

340
00:18:33,156 --> 00:18:34,436
don't tell me it was you.

341
00:18:35,316 --> 00:18:36,877
Why can't it be me?

342
00:18:37,156 --> 00:18:38,877
You only care about important matters.

343
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,670
Why would you risk your life
for a servant-concubine?

344
00:18:41,517 --> 00:18:42,837
I'm ruthless and only care about profit.

345
00:18:43,436 --> 00:18:43,997
Fine.

346
00:18:44,997 --> 00:18:45,757
Then

347
00:18:46,316 --> 00:18:47,477
what's on Lv Beiyi's mind?

348
00:18:47,837 --> 00:18:48,517
Is it you?

349
00:18:49,477 --> 00:18:50,357
Young Master, I'm tired.

350
00:18:50,837 --> 00:18:51,676
Girl.

351
00:18:52,796 --> 00:18:53,396
Girl,

352
00:18:55,156 --> 00:18:56,036
how well do you know me?

353
00:18:56,796 --> 00:18:58,357
And how well do you know him?

354
00:19:01,837 --> 00:19:02,717
I only need

355
00:19:02,717 --> 00:19:03,837
to know His Highness.

356
00:19:03,997 --> 00:19:04,997
Girl,

357
00:19:04,997 --> 00:19:06,877
is it all just business between us to you?

358
00:19:07,436 --> 00:19:09,156
Does everything that I do

359
00:19:09,396 --> 00:19:10,436
can't even be compared

360
00:19:11,477 --> 00:19:13,436
to one strand of hair
on Lv Beiyi's head?

361
00:19:15,117 --> 00:19:16,556
(Your past with Lv Beiyi)

362
00:19:16,717 --> 00:19:18,316
(is his lifelong shame.)

363
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,036
(But if he ever inherits
the title and becomes a prince,)

364
00:19:21,276 --> 00:19:22,316
(the first person he'll kill)

365
00:19:22,517 --> 00:19:23,477
(is Lv Beiyi.)

366
00:19:29,517 --> 00:19:30,316
What about you?

367
00:19:32,156 --> 00:19:33,357
You saw Mu Haiyao

368
00:19:33,357 --> 00:19:34,916
push me off the carriage.

369
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:36,676
Will you punish her

370
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,036
to seek justice for me?

371
00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:41,196
You knew I had

372
00:19:41,757 --> 00:19:43,517
to endure for now.

373
00:19:43,796 --> 00:19:45,796
Mu Haiyao truly knows you well.

374
00:19:49,196 --> 00:19:51,436
Didn't you promise to protect me?

375
00:19:52,556 --> 00:19:54,556
Is this the promise you made to me?

376
00:19:56,156 --> 00:19:56,757
Girl,

377
00:19:57,517 --> 00:19:58,837
there are many solutions

378
00:19:58,837 --> 00:20:00,597
to solve one problem in this world.

379
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,357
The promise I made

380
00:20:02,357 --> 00:20:03,396
may be fulfilled a little later.

381
00:20:03,396 --> 00:20:04,837
But it will not be broken.

382
00:20:05,156 --> 00:20:06,036
About low status,

383
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:10,036
have you truly considered

384
00:20:10,036 --> 00:20:12,076
elevating Lv Beiyi's status?

385
00:20:15,316 --> 00:20:15,837
(Young Master,)

386
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:17,276
(I thought)

387
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:18,436
(no woman)

388
00:20:18,436 --> 00:20:19,036
(in this world)

389
00:20:19,036 --> 00:20:20,837
(could win even a trace
of your affection.)

390
00:20:21,436 --> 00:20:22,076
(I never expected)

391
00:20:22,396 --> 00:20:24,316
(you would even risk your life for her.)

392
00:20:37,357 --> 00:20:38,556
Girl!

393
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:45,357
(But so what?)

394
00:20:46,196 --> 00:20:47,517
(No matter who saved her,)

395
00:20:48,556 --> 00:20:50,676
(only one person will get hurt
in the end.)

396
00:20:50,676 --> 00:20:51,997
So you think I'm deceiving you?

397
00:20:52,837 --> 00:20:53,997
I only want

398
00:20:53,997 --> 00:20:55,117
to hear the answer from you.

399
00:20:55,276 --> 00:20:56,237
Since you think

400
00:20:56,237 --> 00:20:56,997
I'm such a scoundrel,

401
00:20:56,997 --> 00:20:58,156
why did you make a deal with me?

402
00:20:58,436 --> 00:20:59,916
Why did you ask me to let Lv Beiyi stay?

403
00:21:00,036 --> 00:21:01,357
I only want to hear the answer

404
00:21:01,357 --> 00:21:02,477
from you.

405
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:04,156
(I want you)

406
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,076
(to remember this moment forever.)

407
00:21:06,837 --> 00:21:07,676
(Let this pain create)

408
00:21:07,837 --> 00:21:09,717
(a constant thorn in your heart)

409
00:21:10,396 --> 00:21:12,196
(that won't go away,)

410
00:21:12,436 --> 00:21:14,036
(even after ten, twenty years,
or a lifetime!)

411
00:21:17,717 --> 00:21:18,196
Never.

412
00:21:26,556 --> 00:21:27,270
Where are you going?

413
00:21:27,717 --> 00:21:29,156
Leave a despicable scoundrel like you.

414
00:21:29,156 --> 00:21:30,237
I admit I'm despicable.

415
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,637
I was never a person of good character.

416
00:21:31,637 --> 00:21:33,637
You were the one who misjudged,
misguided and led astray.

417
00:21:34,316 --> 00:21:35,877
Now, you are my servant-concubine.

418
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,637
You belong to me.

419
00:21:38,036 --> 00:21:38,916
This is a fact

420
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,436
that you can never change.

421
00:21:40,637 --> 00:21:41,357
Su Nanchun!

422
00:21:41,357 --> 00:21:41,997
Yes, Young Master.

423
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,796
Tonight, the servant-concubine
of the Luo clan

424
00:21:47,196 --> 00:21:48,036
shall share my bed!

425
00:22:03,637 --> 00:22:04,196
Madam,

426
00:22:05,237 --> 00:22:06,477
there you are.

427
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,830
I've been looking everywhere for you.

428
00:22:08,436 --> 00:22:09,316
Zuiliu,

429
00:22:10,676 --> 00:22:12,837
have you noticed any changes here?

430
00:22:15,396 --> 00:22:16,396
Of course.

431
00:22:16,997 --> 00:22:18,837
Mu Haiyao has been sent away
to the secondary courtyard.

432
00:22:19,117 --> 00:22:20,717
With so many people changing sides,

433
00:22:21,117 --> 00:22:23,637
I'm afraid the number of positions
would be limited.

434
00:22:24,597 --> 00:22:25,396
I don't mean them.

435
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:30,517
Luo Qinglian is sharing
Young Master's bed.

436
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,036
Starting today,

437
00:22:36,357 --> 00:22:37,637
she truly becomes a part

438
00:22:37,637 --> 00:22:38,637
of the Young Master's Mansion.

439
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:40,717
In the future,

440
00:22:40,837 --> 00:22:42,637
which position she'll occupy

441
00:22:43,156 --> 00:22:47,036
is something we can't predict.

442
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:53,820
(General Xin's Mansion)

443
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,580
(Qiege Hall)

444
00:23:17,156 --> 00:23:17,837
Miss!

445
00:23:21,877 --> 00:23:22,517
Ms. Lian!

446
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:25,837
Ms. Lian,

447
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:28,676
this cloak is a gift bestowed
by Young Master.

448
00:23:29,357 --> 00:23:30,237
He specifically said

449
00:23:30,997 --> 00:23:32,396
that this cloak isn't ordinary.

450
00:23:33,156 --> 00:23:35,076
So please cherish it.

451
00:24:57,076 --> 00:24:57,757
What are you doing?

452
00:25:00,357 --> 00:25:01,076
Move aside.

453
00:25:01,357 --> 00:25:02,036
But Young Master.

454
00:25:02,036 --> 00:25:02,837
Move aside!

455
00:25:07,597 --> 00:25:08,436
Young Master...

456
00:25:12,877 --> 00:25:13,717
Lv Beiyi.

457
00:25:14,796 --> 00:25:15,916
If you pierce me with this sword,

458
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:18,196
I will let you go far away.

459
00:25:19,036 --> 00:25:20,196
If you can't do it,

460
00:25:21,036 --> 00:25:22,796
you have no right to criticize anything

461
00:25:23,676 --> 00:25:25,597
about me and Luo Qinglian from now on.

462
00:25:57,117 --> 00:25:57,957
Princess?

463
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,540
(Qiege Hall)

464
00:26:35,957 --> 00:26:37,957
Young Master, you scared me to death.

465
00:26:39,316 --> 00:26:40,357
But you are very bold.

466
00:26:40,637 --> 00:26:41,916
You were sure enough

467
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:43,070
that he wouldn't dare thrust you.

468
00:26:43,997 --> 00:26:44,796
But

469
00:26:47,436 --> 00:26:51,036
I was hoping that he would.

470
00:27:05,597 --> 00:27:06,436
Huairui.

471
00:27:09,316 --> 00:27:10,357
May I be bold to say this?

472
00:27:11,237 --> 00:27:12,196
Please do not take

473
00:27:12,196 --> 00:27:13,597
such a risk in the future.

474
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:17,196
Get up.

475
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:18,396
Thank you, Young Master.

476
00:27:19,877 --> 00:27:20,796
Why are your hands so cold?

477
00:27:22,357 --> 00:27:23,036
I'm fine.

478
00:27:23,957 --> 00:27:24,757
Is she not feeling well?

479
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:26,117
Young Master,

480
00:27:26,517 --> 00:27:28,477
Madam Rui didn't sleep at all night.

481
00:27:28,717 --> 00:27:30,676
She was sitting in Little Master's room
until morning.

482
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,870
No matter how I persuade her,
she wouldn't listen.

483
00:27:32,957 --> 00:27:33,597
Zuiliu.

484
00:27:36,556 --> 00:27:37,156
Huairui,

485
00:27:39,156 --> 00:27:40,260
I've never been able to give you

486
00:27:41,276 --> 00:27:42,997
a proper closure about Hui'er.

487
00:27:45,237 --> 00:27:47,117
Whatever Young Master wishes to do,

488
00:27:47,997 --> 00:27:50,237
I will stand on your side.

489
00:27:52,957 --> 00:27:55,276
Huairui, you didn't sleep well, right?

490
00:27:55,837 --> 00:27:57,076
Why did you come here so early?

491
00:27:58,556 --> 00:28:00,156
I came for two reasons.

492
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:01,676
First,

493
00:28:02,117 --> 00:28:04,477
I want to congratulate you
for favoring Ms. Lian.

494
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:06,117
And the second one?

495
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:08,036
The second reason is,

496
00:28:09,036 --> 00:28:10,676
that I humbly request

497
00:28:11,676 --> 00:28:13,796
that Madam Yao's expenses
in the secondary courtyard

498
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:15,676
be the same as those
in the our mansion.

499
00:28:17,477 --> 00:28:18,156
What did you say?

500
00:28:18,957 --> 00:28:20,156
You want to reward her?

501
00:28:20,676 --> 00:28:21,156
Yes.

502
00:28:21,717 --> 00:28:22,477
Huairui,

503
00:28:22,757 --> 00:28:25,237
she pushed Qinglian off the carriage
just yesterday.

504
00:28:25,517 --> 00:28:26,957
And about Hui'er...

505
00:28:26,957 --> 00:28:27,597
Hui'er...

506
00:28:32,916 --> 00:28:34,757
Hui'er was my flesh and blood.

507
00:28:36,837 --> 00:28:37,916
After he died,

508
00:28:40,316 --> 00:28:42,276
I wept every day,

509
00:28:44,117 --> 00:28:46,676
wishing to make the person who killed him

510
00:28:47,117 --> 00:28:48,196
pay a thousandfold.

511
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:50,036
But...

512
00:28:51,916 --> 00:28:53,156
But now,

513
00:28:54,076 --> 00:28:55,117
you still need her.

514
00:28:55,916 --> 00:28:56,717
You must avoid having

515
00:28:57,396 --> 00:28:58,316
Mu Haiyao

516
00:28:58,556 --> 00:28:59,597
and the Mu family

517
00:29:00,036 --> 00:29:02,637
hold any grudges against you.

518
00:29:08,757 --> 00:29:09,717
Avenging Hui'er

519
00:29:10,757 --> 00:29:11,877
is important.

520
00:29:12,957 --> 00:29:14,436
But what matters most now

521
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:15,676
is the one alive,

522
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:18,396
and that's you, Young Master.

523
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,156
Mu Haiyao killed Little Master.

524
00:29:24,117 --> 00:29:25,036
I wish

525
00:29:25,036 --> 00:29:26,316
I could tear her to pieces.

526
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:27,957
Or at least make her suffer

527
00:29:27,957 --> 00:29:28,916
in the secondary courtyard.

528
00:29:29,396 --> 00:29:30,837
I can't believe

529
00:29:31,316 --> 00:29:33,036
you actually asked for a reward
on her behalf.

530
00:29:35,396 --> 00:29:38,316
Can her suffering
in the secondary courtyard take her life?

531
00:29:38,837 --> 00:29:39,957
Of course not.

532
00:29:42,237 --> 00:29:43,196
But my life

533
00:29:44,597 --> 00:29:47,196
is far from safe here.

534
00:29:47,477 --> 00:29:48,036
How come?

535
00:29:48,316 --> 00:29:49,877
You're the primary consort here.

536
00:29:51,196 --> 00:29:52,076
Primary consort?

537
00:29:54,237 --> 00:29:55,997
A primary consort without a son

538
00:29:56,676 --> 00:29:58,517
doesn't seem to be justified.

539
00:29:59,957 --> 00:30:01,477
When one Mu Haiyao leaves,

540
00:30:01,477 --> 00:30:03,396
another will take her place.

541
00:30:03,796 --> 00:30:05,957
The only thing
that can secure my position

542
00:30:07,156 --> 00:30:08,556
as primary consort

543
00:30:12,796 --> 00:30:14,357
is Young Master's guilt.

544
00:30:15,877 --> 00:30:16,957
You mean...

545
00:30:17,957 --> 00:30:19,597
The more I compromise,

546
00:30:19,877 --> 00:30:21,517
the deeper Young Master's guilt
is to me,

547
00:30:21,957 --> 00:30:23,270
and the more secure my position becomes.

548
00:30:30,396 --> 00:30:31,117
I suppose

549
00:30:31,957 --> 00:30:33,237
Hui'er in the afterlife

550
00:30:36,196 --> 00:30:37,877
will forgive me, right?

551
00:30:39,916 --> 00:30:42,436
Madam, please don't be sad.

552
00:30:43,276 --> 00:30:45,036
Little Master was a sensible boy.

553
00:30:45,597 --> 00:30:47,237
He'll surely forgive you

554
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,276
and watch over you to discipline those

555
00:30:49,276 --> 00:30:50,357
who misbehave.

556
00:30:54,676 --> 00:30:55,637
I just hope

557
00:30:56,477 --> 00:30:57,316
the next one

558
00:30:58,117 --> 00:30:59,357
won't be Luo Qinglian.

559
00:31:05,676 --> 00:31:07,837
Miss, you've been sharpening it
for almost an hour.

560
00:31:07,997 --> 00:31:09,837
This hairpin is sharp enough
to pierce through stones.

561
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:16,957
- Miss!
- Miss!

562
00:31:17,237 --> 00:31:18,597
Miss, are you planning to...

563
00:31:18,796 --> 00:31:19,436
Stay out of this.

564
00:31:19,717 --> 00:31:21,477
Miss, don't do anything foolish.

565
00:31:21,477 --> 00:31:22,396
- Miss.
- Miss, are you...

566
00:31:22,396 --> 00:31:23,196
Stop following me!

567
00:31:25,997 --> 00:31:26,916
Just stay out of this!

568
00:31:32,837 --> 00:31:35,036
Young Master Yi,
you may have stopped me once.

569
00:31:35,396 --> 00:31:36,796
But not the next one.

570
00:31:37,637 --> 00:31:39,196
You're indeed different
from other women.

571
00:31:39,877 --> 00:31:41,357
No wonder Lianxin favors you.

572
00:31:43,837 --> 00:31:44,970
Young Master Yi, don't flatter me.

573
00:31:45,477 --> 00:31:46,436
I can't afford

574
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:47,997
to enjoy his affection.

575
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:50,276
Of course, you can.

576
00:31:54,757 --> 00:31:56,237
Just look at this cloak you're wearing.

577
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:00,717
You probably don't even know

578
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,276
the story behind this cloak, do you?

579
00:32:05,276 --> 00:32:06,316
Does this belong to Madam De?

580
00:32:08,196 --> 00:32:09,196
You only know

581
00:32:09,477 --> 00:32:10,877
that Madam De is Lianxin's birth mother.

582
00:32:11,477 --> 00:32:12,276
Yet you don't know

583
00:32:13,357 --> 00:32:14,717
it was also Madam De

584
00:32:15,357 --> 00:32:16,237
who made him suffer.

585
00:32:19,957 --> 00:32:21,477
Since Lianxin was born,

586
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:23,237
he was raised by Madam Yi.

587
00:32:24,117 --> 00:32:25,436
(It was only when he turned nine)

588
00:32:26,036 --> 00:32:27,436
(that he returned to Madam De's side.)

589
00:32:27,997 --> 00:32:30,637
Mother, I want that cloak.

590
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:33,316
I want that cloak, Mother.

591
00:32:33,436 --> 00:32:34,237
(At that time,)

592
00:32:34,436 --> 00:32:35,036
My dear son.

593
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,036
(Madam De just given birth)

594
00:32:36,036 --> 00:32:37,117
(He Yunshuo's Eighth Son)
(to Eighth Brother, He Lianhua.)

595
00:32:37,117 --> 00:32:37,757
(He Yunshuo's Eighth Son, He Lianhua, childhood)

596
00:32:37,757 --> 00:32:39,717
(He Yunshuo's Eighth Son)
(She wasn't concerned about Lianxin,)

597
00:32:39,717 --> 00:32:40,676
(He Lianhua, childhood)
(who was away from her for many years.)

598
00:32:41,396 --> 00:32:43,316
(She only gave her attention
to Lianhua.)

599
00:32:45,036 --> 00:32:45,757
(Once,)

600
00:32:46,477 --> 00:32:48,196
(Father rewarded Lianxin with a cloak)

601
00:32:48,676 --> 00:32:49,997
(because he excelled in his studies.)

602
00:32:49,997 --> 00:32:50,916
Show it to me.

603
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:52,156
(Lianxin likes it very much.)

604
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:53,276
Hua, do you like it?

605
00:32:56,637 --> 00:32:58,717
- Do it again.
- Turn around.

606
00:32:58,877 --> 00:32:59,436
Watch this.

607
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:00,556
Hua.

608
00:33:01,957 --> 00:33:02,997
How nice.

609
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:09,276
(This is the cloak
that Madam Yi personally sewn.)

610
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,276
(Lianxin has been keeping
and cherishing it all this while.)

611
00:33:12,796 --> 00:33:14,957
(He would get angry
if anyone else touched it.)

612
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:16,877
(But now,)

613
00:33:17,556 --> 00:33:18,637
(it's on you.)

614
00:33:22,156 --> 00:33:23,237
People always say

615
00:33:23,597 --> 00:33:25,997
Lianxin may appear suave.
But he's actually unemotional.

616
00:33:26,957 --> 00:33:27,877
Do you know why?

617
00:33:30,997 --> 00:33:32,676
It's nothing but a facade
for his scheming.

618
00:33:32,957 --> 00:33:33,850
It's because he's afraid.

619
00:33:44,717 --> 00:33:45,637
I was sent to Madam De

620
00:33:45,637 --> 00:33:46,556
when I was young.

621
00:33:47,117 --> 00:33:48,877
It was the nine-year-old Lianxin

622
00:33:48,877 --> 00:33:49,676
who raised me.

623
00:33:50,676 --> 00:33:52,757
Nobody understands his fears
better than I do.

624
00:33:54,436 --> 00:33:55,997
He never received love from his parents.

625
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:57,877
To him,

626
00:33:58,436 --> 00:33:59,877
doing well would earn him rewards.

627
00:34:00,357 --> 00:34:01,357
And doing poorly would result

628
00:34:02,357 --> 00:34:03,477
in abandonment.

629
00:34:04,796 --> 00:34:06,556
He may say he doesn't care
about anything.

630
00:34:06,717 --> 00:34:07,757
But deep down,

631
00:34:07,957 --> 00:34:09,370
he's terrified of losing
more than anyone.

632
00:34:10,036 --> 00:34:11,076
It has been over twenty years.

633
00:34:11,957 --> 00:34:13,717
There isn't a single moment
he doesn't wear a mask.

634
00:34:15,317 --> 00:34:17,037
He's never had a moment of relaxation.

635
00:34:23,557 --> 00:34:24,916
Why are you telling me this?

636
00:34:27,396 --> 00:34:28,557
Because you can save him.

637
00:34:29,757 --> 00:34:30,477
Don't forget

638
00:34:31,077 --> 00:34:32,237
you were the one

639
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,356
who stopped me from killing him

640
00:34:33,356 --> 00:34:34,237
fifteen minutes ago.

641
00:34:35,517 --> 00:34:36,557
If I hadn't stopped you,

642
00:34:37,196 --> 00:34:38,396
would you have killed him?

643
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:42,717
Ms. Lian,

644
00:34:44,596 --> 00:34:45,396
I, He Lianyi,

645
00:34:45,396 --> 00:34:46,757
swear on my life.

646
00:34:47,477 --> 00:34:49,037
(Lianxin can lie to the world.)

647
00:34:49,596 --> 00:34:50,717
(But he won't lie to you.)

648
00:34:54,277 --> 00:34:55,957
(He never received love
from his parents.)

649
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:57,557
(To him,)

650
00:34:58,116 --> 00:34:59,596
(doing well would earn him rewards.)

651
00:35:00,077 --> 00:35:02,836
(And doing poorly would result
in abandonment.)

652
00:35:13,317 --> 00:35:14,436
Mother, I miss you very much.

653
00:35:16,836 --> 00:35:17,916
I miss you very much.

654
00:35:21,517 --> 00:35:22,596
(In this world,)

655
00:35:23,436 --> 00:35:25,237
(there's no genuine affection
without reason.)

656
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:28,037
Does that include Madam De?

657
00:35:29,717 --> 00:35:30,317
What?

658
00:35:31,237 --> 00:35:32,596
You were calling out to your mother

659
00:35:33,396 --> 00:35:34,277
in your dream.

660
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:41,156
That wasn't Madam De.

661
00:35:45,876 --> 00:35:47,196
No matter what you heard just now,

662
00:35:47,757 --> 00:35:48,850
(it's best for you to forget it.)

663
00:35:50,596 --> 00:35:52,050
(You were obviously carrying
so much pain.)

664
00:35:52,757 --> 00:35:54,156
(Why can't you be honest with me)

665
00:35:55,037 --> 00:35:56,477
(and clear up my misunderstanding
of you?)

666
00:35:57,717 --> 00:35:58,477
(He Lianxin,)

667
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:00,396
(if you treat me sincerely,)

668
00:36:01,116 --> 00:36:02,717
(how can I be indifferent to it?)

669
00:36:24,797 --> 00:36:25,836
(But do you think Young Master)

670
00:36:25,836 --> 00:36:27,957
(will elevate Lv Beiyi's status?)

671
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,916
As long my brother is alive,

672
00:36:30,517 --> 00:36:31,916
Young Master won't take my life

673
00:36:32,836 --> 00:36:34,436
no matter what I do wrong.

674
00:36:34,957 --> 00:36:35,860
What are you trying to do?

675
00:36:51,196 --> 00:36:52,116
Mu Haiyao,

676
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:53,997
I calculated every possibility

677
00:36:54,916 --> 00:36:57,156
but couldn't prevent your final move.

678
00:37:01,676 --> 00:37:03,557
Ms. Lian, Su Nanchun is here.

679
00:37:08,797 --> 00:37:09,396
Young Master.

680
00:37:26,356 --> 00:37:27,037
Please sit down.

681
00:37:28,116 --> 00:37:28,836
Join me for a drink.

682
00:37:50,957 --> 00:37:53,156
I can't afford
to enjoy the drink you offer.

683
00:37:53,156 --> 00:37:54,436
Aren't you here to kill me?

684
00:37:55,156 --> 00:37:56,037
Getting me drunk

685
00:37:56,957 --> 00:37:58,317
will make it easier for you.

686
00:38:10,557 --> 00:38:11,317
Do you know

687
00:38:12,037 --> 00:38:13,116
what is the easiest thing

688
00:38:13,596 --> 00:38:15,277
to do in this world?

689
00:38:15,517 --> 00:38:16,957
Tricking women to drink.

690
00:38:18,957 --> 00:38:19,836
But do you know

691
00:38:20,636 --> 00:38:22,237
what's the hardest?

692
00:38:22,797 --> 00:38:23,836
I'm not interested in knowing.

693
00:38:26,636 --> 00:38:27,636
It's deceiving you.

694
00:38:31,916 --> 00:38:32,916
The environment here

695
00:38:33,997 --> 00:38:35,077
forced me to learn how to lie

696
00:38:35,636 --> 00:38:37,116
from a young age.

697
00:38:38,077 --> 00:38:39,717
Be it to women, my brothers,

698
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:40,717
and even my father.

699
00:38:42,916 --> 00:38:44,116
Out of every ten words I say,

700
00:38:45,116 --> 00:38:46,436
nine are lies.

701
00:38:47,636 --> 00:38:49,477
I never worry about remembering them

702
00:38:49,876 --> 00:38:51,477
or my conscience bothering me.

703
00:38:51,916 --> 00:38:52,757
But why is it

704
00:38:56,797 --> 00:38:58,596
so hard to deceive you?

705
00:39:02,517 --> 00:39:03,196
Is it difficult?

706
00:39:05,757 --> 00:39:07,836
You deceived me for six whole months.

707
00:39:08,237 --> 00:39:09,396
Would you believe me

708
00:39:10,636 --> 00:39:11,317
if I said I didn't?

709
00:39:14,957 --> 00:39:15,757
All right.

710
00:39:17,757 --> 00:39:20,116
I'm afraid it's too late for everything

711
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:21,916
after last night.

712
00:39:26,356 --> 00:39:26,957
Girl,

713
00:39:29,676 --> 00:39:30,557
do you hate me?

714
00:39:30,836 --> 00:39:32,237
I hate you to the core.

715
00:40:53,156 --> 00:40:54,237
It's very late.

716
00:40:56,356 --> 00:40:57,237
Princess,

717
00:40:58,596 --> 00:40:59,396
you should leave.

718
00:41:03,037 --> 00:41:04,477
When I refuse to leave,

719
00:41:06,396 --> 00:41:07,237
not even you

720
00:41:08,596 --> 00:41:09,436
can drive me away.

721
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:14,116
Princess,

722
00:41:15,757 --> 00:41:17,517
with your status and riches,

723
00:41:18,356 --> 00:41:19,717
why waste your time

724
00:41:20,477 --> 00:41:21,957
on a weak person

725
00:41:22,876 --> 00:41:24,636
like me?

726
00:41:26,037 --> 00:41:27,077
It must be very tough

727
00:41:28,116 --> 00:41:29,876
to carry so much pain alone,

728
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,356
isn't it?
