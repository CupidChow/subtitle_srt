00:01:51,202 --> 00:01:51,961
I don't understand

18
00:01:52,522 --> 00:01:54,482
what you're talking about.

19
00:01:54,482 --> 00:01:55,361
Of course you don't.

20
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:56,802
If you did,

21
00:01:57,082 --> 00:01:58,601
you wouldn't have been known
as the Idle Young Master.

22
00:01:59,722 --> 00:02:00,241
You...

23
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:02,402
You...

24
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:05,281
You're a smart girl.

25
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:06,881
If I didn't intend to
keep you for my father,

26
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:09,122
I would've kept you for myself.

27
00:02:09,122 --> 00:02:10,042
Why don't you?

28
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:14,122
Lu Beiyi can't even make you stay.

29
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,241
Who am I to make you stay?

30
00:02:17,202 --> 00:02:17,881
You love

31
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:19,122
the man so deeply,

32
00:02:19,562 --> 00:02:20,881
yet parted with him
without batting an eyelid.

33
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:22,961
Are you seriously ruthless

34
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:25,202
or

35
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:26,961
do you have an arrangement?

36
00:02:29,002 --> 00:02:29,842
Stop following me.

37
00:02:33,922 --> 00:02:35,642
What are you doing?

38
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:36,842
- Go to the mansion.
- Put me down.

39
00:02:36,842 --> 00:02:38,362
- Madam Jinfang.
- It's Lianxiu.

40
00:02:38,402 --> 00:02:39,321
Ms. Qinglian.

41
00:02:39,321 --> 00:02:40,482
Come on, enter.

42
00:02:43,002 --> 00:02:43,681
Lianxiu.

43
00:02:46,762 --> 00:02:47,321
Lianxin.

44
00:02:48,282 --> 00:02:49,482
You're panting heavily.

45
00:02:49,922 --> 00:02:50,681
What are you doing

46
00:02:51,081 --> 00:02:51,961
in broad daylight?

47
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:53,521
How

48
00:02:54,122 --> 00:02:55,681
did you end up seeing it?

49
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:57,081
Don't tell a soul.

50
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:02,002
Since when are you

51
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:02,842
afraid of your wife?

52
00:03:06,202 --> 00:03:07,681
I don't want any problem.

53
00:03:08,402 --> 00:03:09,241
You get what I mean.

54
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:11,681
Women are easily jealous.

55
00:03:12,202 --> 00:03:13,282
I don't think all women are like that.

56
00:03:15,002 --> 00:03:16,122
Zhimei isn't.

57
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:22,762
Lianxin, take care.

58
00:04:00,922 --> 00:04:01,321
Mei'er.

59
00:04:03,562 --> 00:04:04,202
Dear.

60
00:04:10,321 --> 00:04:11,122
How can I let you

61
00:04:11,122 --> 00:04:12,122
do such a menial work?

62
00:04:13,441 --> 00:04:14,441
This is for you.

63
00:04:15,081 --> 00:04:15,801
Give me the thread.

64
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:20,801
There's no so-called menial work

65
00:04:21,441 --> 00:04:22,522
between us.

66
00:04:23,401 --> 00:04:24,242
Everything about you matters.

67
00:04:56,721 --> 00:04:57,682
Dear, why are you laughing?

68
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:01,401
I met Lianxin.

69
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:03,321
In broad daylight

70
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:04,841
and right outside the mansion,

71
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:06,281
he simply couldn't wait

72
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:06,922
to carry a woman

73
00:05:06,922 --> 00:05:07,841
into a carriage.

74
00:05:11,202 --> 00:05:12,161
Since when is Lianxin

75
00:05:12,682 --> 00:05:13,522
so

76
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:14,482
horny?

77
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:15,802
He's not that kind of person.

78
00:05:23,161 --> 00:05:24,642
Right outside the mansion?

79
00:05:27,601 --> 00:05:28,561
Did Lady Yao

80
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:29,482
find a candidater?

81
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:33,001
No, I must find out.

82
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:34,242
If this is true,

83
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:35,321
when the Emperor is granting titles,

84
00:05:35,881 --> 00:05:37,441
he might be appointed as
General of Illustrious Virtue.

85
00:05:38,121 --> 00:05:38,561
Liuyan.

86
00:05:38,841 --> 00:05:40,281
Find the blood nest

87
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:40,762
from the mansion.

88
00:05:40,762 --> 00:05:41,242
Yes.

89
00:05:45,441 --> 00:05:46,121
Where are you going?

90
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:47,321
Young Master Xin's mansion.

91
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:49,522
Are you going there to see the lady

92
00:05:49,522 --> 00:05:50,362
or Lianxin?

93
00:05:56,082 --> 00:05:57,401
Since I've chosen you

94
00:05:57,401 --> 00:05:58,202
as my husband,

95
00:05:58,561 --> 00:05:59,922
the one succeeding the prince

96
00:06:00,082 --> 00:06:01,121
will be none other than you.

97
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:03,001
Other people

98
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,642
will be my enemies,

99
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:05,841
including Lianxin.

100
00:06:07,121 --> 00:06:07,561
Hold on.

101
00:06:14,362 --> 00:06:15,001
If you thought

102
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:16,242
I was the unlikeliest

103
00:06:16,841 --> 00:06:17,522
to succeed my father,

104
00:06:18,522 --> 00:06:19,441
would you still have married me?

105
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:32,482
Ms. Qinglian.

106
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:34,082
I'll teach you the way to walk first.

107
00:06:34,682 --> 00:06:35,721
I remember that once,

108
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:37,642
the prince was busy working.

109
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:40,561
The princess served him
with snacks and soup.

110
00:06:41,082 --> 00:06:42,841
She went in and out
of Qingkang Hall thrice

111
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:44,881
yet the prince didn't even notice.

112
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:47,642
The soup didn't even spill.

113
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:50,281
The prince used to praise the princess

114
00:06:50,281 --> 00:06:52,242
for walking lightly and elegantly.

115
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:54,962
All right, let's begin.

116
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:56,802
Two important points.

117
00:06:57,161 --> 00:06:57,721
Firstly,

118
00:06:59,042 --> 00:07:00,242
make sure the bowl on the tray

119
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:01,762
doesn't make any sound.

120
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:03,001
Secondly,

121
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:05,121
make sure the bell on your feet

122
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:06,682
doesn't make any sound either.

123
00:07:07,522 --> 00:07:08,042
All right.

124
00:07:08,682 --> 00:07:09,042
Come on.

125
00:07:12,721 --> 00:07:13,682
This is already the sixth.

126
00:07:14,362 --> 00:07:15,482
None of the ladies can sit still.

127
00:07:15,962 --> 00:07:16,682
Other than the prince's legitimate wife

128
00:07:16,682 --> 00:07:17,802
and Lady Ye,

129
00:07:18,161 --> 00:07:19,121
all other ladies have sent
their servants here to find out.

130
00:07:19,642 --> 00:07:21,242
The legitimate wife and Lady Ye

131
00:07:21,242 --> 00:07:22,161
are calm.

132
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:24,682
Just ignore

133
00:07:24,682 --> 00:07:25,802
the rest.

134
00:07:27,401 --> 00:07:28,561
They try to vie for his attention,

135
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:30,881
but when my husband has a problem,

136
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:32,281
few can share the burden.

137
00:07:33,281 --> 00:07:34,281
You're right.

138
00:07:34,682 --> 00:07:36,121
Luckily you're helping him.

139
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:37,362
Young Master Xin is fortunate.

140
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:40,601
Ruhua.

141
00:07:42,601 --> 00:07:43,242
Do you think

142
00:07:43,682 --> 00:07:45,001
Lianxin really needs me?

143
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:48,001
Do you mean Madam Jinfang?

144
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:50,441
Lady Yao.

145
00:07:50,802 --> 00:07:52,042
Didn't Mr. Xin say?

146
00:07:52,202 --> 00:07:53,362
A few days ago,

147
00:07:53,362 --> 00:07:54,242
Madam Jinfang asked him

148
00:07:54,242 --> 00:07:55,042
for a parrot.

149
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:56,362
She's returning the favour.

150
00:07:58,401 --> 00:07:59,561
I hope so.

151
00:08:01,121 --> 00:08:02,161
Again.

152
00:08:05,881 --> 00:08:07,762
I'm the daughter of
Ceremony Bureau's Luo Rongyu.

153
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:08,762
My name is Luo Qinglian.

154
00:08:09,482 --> 00:08:10,281
Greetings, Your Highness.

155
00:08:10,962 --> 00:08:11,522
What did you say?

156
00:08:13,161 --> 00:08:14,321
Did you not eat?

157
00:08:18,242 --> 00:08:20,401
I'm the daughter of
Ceremony Bureau's Luo Rongyu.

158
00:08:20,642 --> 00:08:21,401
My name is Luo Qinglian.

159
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:22,202
Su Nanchun.

160
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:23,001
Sir.

161
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:24,001
What did she have for lunch?

162
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:25,841
Sir, I think she had beef.

163
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:29,841
No wonder she sounds like a cow.

164
00:08:31,601 --> 00:08:32,321
Young Master Xin.

165
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:34,482
You've never met the late princess.

166
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:36,082
How do you know how she walked

167
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:36,841
or talked?

168
00:08:37,521 --> 00:08:38,201
Young Master Xin, if you're

169
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:39,322
trying to find fault with me,

170
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:40,721
I shall not practise.

171
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:44,641
Ms. Qinglian is tired.

172
00:08:44,961 --> 00:08:45,882
Take a break.

173
00:08:46,562 --> 00:08:47,482
I'm not.

174
00:08:48,521 --> 00:08:49,281
I feel

175
00:08:49,922 --> 00:08:51,002
chest tightness.

176
00:08:51,401 --> 00:08:53,002
I think this environment is stifling.

177
00:08:53,002 --> 00:08:54,601
I would like to go to
a more spacious one.

178
00:08:55,521 --> 00:08:56,161
No.

179
00:09:01,122 --> 00:09:01,562
Why not?

180
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:03,122
There's no reason.

181
00:09:04,802 --> 00:09:05,802
In this mansion,

182
00:09:05,882 --> 00:09:07,401
other than Lianxin's Qiege Hall,

183
00:09:08,002 --> 00:09:08,882
my Langyue Hall

184
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:09,841
is the biggest.

185
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:11,401
I don't believe

186
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:12,601
it's not enough for you.

187
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,482
Su Nanchun.

188
00:09:17,362 --> 00:09:18,442
Let's solve a riddle.

189
00:09:20,562 --> 00:09:22,442
Lady Yao, you want me to learn well.

190
00:09:23,042 --> 00:09:23,841
So you must pay attention

191
00:09:23,841 --> 00:09:24,841
to my needs.

192
00:09:25,641 --> 00:09:26,922
I thought it's too hot at noon.

193
00:09:26,922 --> 00:09:28,201
I wanted somewhere with shelter.

194
00:09:28,562 --> 00:09:29,161
You refused.

195
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:30,802
I feel chest tightness

196
00:09:30,882 --> 00:09:32,322
and want a spacious place.

197
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:33,562
You still refuse.

198
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:34,401
What on earth

199
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:36,081
do you want?

200
00:09:36,482 --> 00:09:37,601
Harbour...

201
00:09:38,201 --> 00:09:39,042
Harbour?

202
00:09:40,802 --> 00:09:42,161
You want to distract us.

203
00:09:44,002 --> 00:09:44,721
An ulterior motive.

204
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:48,242
An ulterior motive?

205
00:09:50,201 --> 00:09:51,401
Am I right?

206
00:09:52,882 --> 00:09:53,961
You're smart,

207
00:09:54,922 --> 00:09:55,761
but do you know

208
00:09:56,081 --> 00:09:57,042
what gave you away?

209
00:10:00,682 --> 00:10:01,882
No woman

210
00:10:02,562 --> 00:10:03,802
would remain as calm as you

211
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:05,922
when she parted with a man she loved.

212
00:10:10,761 --> 00:10:11,322
Wishful...

213
00:10:11,922 --> 00:10:12,721
Don't let her escape.

214
00:10:13,721 --> 00:10:14,521
Thinking.

215
00:10:14,841 --> 00:10:16,081
Wishful thinking.

216
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:17,562
Young Master Xin.

217
00:10:17,802 --> 00:10:20,521
You knew what was going to happen.

218
00:10:23,042 --> 00:10:23,682
Lady Mei!

219
00:10:39,362 --> 00:10:39,802
Girl.

220
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:42,201
Why are you so careless?

221
00:10:42,882 --> 00:10:43,922
If you injure Lady Mei,

222
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:45,322
you'll be punished severely.

223
00:10:45,641 --> 00:10:47,562
Lady Mei, spare my life.
I didn't mean it.

224
00:10:47,562 --> 00:10:48,521
Spare my life, Lady Mei.

225
00:10:49,242 --> 00:10:49,922
You may rise.

226
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:00,042
Lady Mei,

227
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,562
you're usually the most well-behaved.

228
00:11:03,201 --> 00:11:04,922
You barged into Langyue Hall.

229
00:11:05,601 --> 00:11:07,122
It's kind of inappropriate.

230
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:12,362
Lianxiu just got some blood nest.

231
00:11:12,362 --> 00:11:13,161
I specially brought it here

232
00:11:13,161 --> 00:11:14,442
for you to try it.

233
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:15,641
So I was in a rush.

234
00:11:17,521 --> 00:11:18,081
What's the matter?

235
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:20,641
Lady Yao, aren't you inviting me

236
00:11:20,641 --> 00:11:21,521
to go to your place?

237
00:11:23,081 --> 00:11:24,322
Thanks for the blood nest.

238
00:11:24,521 --> 00:11:25,721
Lady Mei, please go back.

239
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:28,081
Ruhua.

240
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:28,721
I think

241
00:11:29,201 --> 00:11:30,641
I should put the bird nest

242
00:11:30,641 --> 00:11:31,601
inside the house.

243
00:11:33,641 --> 00:11:34,081
You...

244
00:11:47,922 --> 00:11:48,482
Lianxin.

245
00:11:51,161 --> 00:11:52,362
Why didn't you tell me you're here?

246
00:12:08,322 --> 00:12:10,002
My father missed the Emperor.

247
00:12:10,802 --> 00:12:12,362
He built this mansion

248
00:12:13,242 --> 00:12:14,601
following the design of
our house in the hometown.

249
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:17,841
When I grew up and had my own mansion,

250
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:21,281
he gave me this mansion

251
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,201
as my official residence.

252
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:25,161
It's beautiful.

253
00:12:26,521 --> 00:12:28,201
When the lotus blooms,

254
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:29,922
it'll surely be more beautiful.

255
00:12:31,242 --> 00:12:32,601
What is the pond called?

256
00:12:43,242 --> 00:12:44,081
Weixi Pond.

257
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:46,201
Weixi Pond?

258
00:12:51,242 --> 00:12:51,841
That's right.

259
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:53,882
This pond

260
00:12:55,122 --> 00:12:56,322
was built for you.

261
00:13:06,081 --> 00:13:07,201
There's so much reed by the river.

262
00:13:08,961 --> 00:13:09,922
There's still dew.

263
00:13:11,882 --> 00:13:12,961
Where's the woman of my dreams?

264
00:13:15,242 --> 00:13:16,322
She's on the bank.

265
00:13:19,002 --> 00:13:20,042
Back when my father

266
00:13:20,281 --> 00:13:21,521
gave me the mansion,

267
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:22,882
the first thing I did

268
00:13:22,882 --> 00:13:24,242
was building this pond.

269
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,961
It's over.

270
00:13:28,562 --> 00:13:29,882
You shouldn't have brought it up.

271
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:30,761
Yes.

272
00:13:31,482 --> 00:13:32,961
It's over. I shouldn't
have brought it up.

273
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:35,562
After all, you're married
to my fourth brother.

274
00:13:35,922 --> 00:13:36,802
I just didn't expect

275
00:13:36,802 --> 00:13:37,641
that my first time bringing you here

276
00:13:37,641 --> 00:13:38,721
would be an act to guard against you.

277
00:13:42,961 --> 00:13:44,281
Guard against me?

278
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,281
You knew I would come.

279
00:13:47,721 --> 00:13:49,081
So you waited for me

280
00:13:49,081 --> 00:13:49,721
at Langyue Hall.

281
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,401
How would I know?

282
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:55,442
You met Lianxiu

283
00:13:55,442 --> 00:13:56,482
at Hongyan Gate.

284
00:13:57,081 --> 00:13:58,601
You knew he'd tell me.

285
00:14:00,922 --> 00:14:02,281
I don't understand.

286
00:14:02,761 --> 00:14:03,641
Do you even know me well

287
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:04,482
or not?

288
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,601
You thought I didn't stand a chance
in succeeding my father.

289
00:14:07,401 --> 00:14:09,161
Hence, you left me and married Lianxiu.

290
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:10,281
However, you're here

291
00:14:11,122 --> 00:14:12,002
suspecting me now.

292
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:15,841
I've lost too much.

293
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:19,362
So I can't afford to make any mistake.

294
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:23,922
Yes.

295
00:15:16,521 --> 00:15:19,482
He's a good lover with multiple talent.

296
00:15:31,882 --> 00:15:33,201
What a pity.

297
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:42,401
Hurry up!

298
00:15:42,761 --> 00:15:43,242
There's an assassin!

299
00:15:43,322 --> 00:15:43,882
Get the assassin!

300
00:15:44,161 --> 00:15:45,042
Hurry up!

301
00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:45,882
Over there!

302
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:46,521
Hurry up!

303
00:15:46,961 --> 00:15:47,362
Over there!!

304
00:15:47,401 --> 00:15:48,002
Su Nanchun

305
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:48,922
Get the assassin!

306
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:50,721
Young Master Xin.

307
00:15:52,002 --> 00:15:54,161
It's late, escort Lady Mei.

308
00:15:54,401 --> 00:15:54,841
Yes.

309
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,362
Lady Mei, this way, please.

310
00:16:53,002 --> 00:16:53,802
Lady Mei!

311
00:16:53,802 --> 00:16:54,562
Lady Mei, are you all right?

312
00:16:54,562 --> 00:16:55,081
What's wrong, Lady Mei?

313
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:55,682
I have stomach ache.

314
00:16:56,322 --> 00:16:57,442
It must be because the servant
bumped into her.

315
00:16:57,442 --> 00:16:57,841
This...

316
00:16:57,841 --> 00:16:58,882
Get a physician.

317
00:16:58,882 --> 00:16:59,961
However, Young Master Xin
instructed me...

318
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:01,362
Lady Mei.

319
00:17:01,362 --> 00:17:02,442
Lady Mei, hang in there.

320
00:17:02,761 --> 00:17:04,122
How dare you. You're a servant.

321
00:17:04,201 --> 00:17:04,961
Are you disregarding

322
00:17:04,961 --> 00:17:05,562
Lady Mei's life?

323
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:06,002
No.

324
00:17:06,242 --> 00:17:06,641
Lady Mei.

325
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:07,802
Hold on, please.

326
00:17:07,922 --> 00:17:08,721
I'll return in no time.

327
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:14,761
Lady Mei, he's gone.

328
00:18:04,922 --> 00:18:05,641
Yi!

329
00:18:05,922 --> 00:18:07,202
Lady Yao, what should we do?

330
00:18:07,722 --> 00:18:08,802
He's an assassin.

331
00:18:08,842 --> 00:18:09,842
What do you think we should do?

332
00:18:11,361 --> 00:18:11,842
No!

333
00:18:12,322 --> 00:18:13,202
No, Lady Yao!

334
00:18:13,202 --> 00:18:14,602
Please don't kill him!

335
00:18:14,842 --> 00:18:15,842
Please don't kill him.

336
00:18:16,121 --> 00:18:17,962
Lian'er, don't plead with her.

337
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:19,361
We'll just perish together.

338
00:18:19,802 --> 00:18:20,682
What's so bad about that?

339
00:18:21,922 --> 00:18:23,641
I landed you in trouble, Yi.

340
00:18:27,082 --> 00:18:27,682
Lady Yao,

341
00:18:28,361 --> 00:18:29,361
I tried to outsmart you

342
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:30,962
and overestimated myself.

343
00:18:31,521 --> 00:18:32,802
Please have mercy

344
00:18:32,922 --> 00:18:33,881
and spare Yi.

345
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:36,361
Lian'er.

346
00:18:37,121 --> 00:18:37,922
Stop.

347
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:39,641
What if your appearance is ruined?

348
00:18:39,922 --> 00:18:40,562
Get her up.

349
00:18:42,082 --> 00:18:42,722
I will stop!

350
00:18:43,281 --> 00:18:43,881
As your servant, I promise

351
00:18:44,322 --> 00:18:45,161
to learn the rules

352
00:18:45,401 --> 00:18:47,481
and devote myself to the selection.

353
00:18:49,202 --> 00:18:50,881
How did you address yourself?

354
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:54,521
From now on,

355
00:18:56,042 --> 00:18:56,962
Lady Yao, you're my master

356
00:18:58,082 --> 00:18:58,881
and I'll be your servant.

357
00:18:59,761 --> 00:19:02,602
I'm at your service, Lady Yao.

358
00:19:02,602 --> 00:19:03,161
Lian'er!

359
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:05,322
Luo Qinglian,

360
00:19:06,802 --> 00:19:08,521
remember what you said today.

361
00:19:20,722 --> 00:19:21,602
I wil.

362
00:19:27,802 --> 00:19:28,682
Your face

363
00:19:29,722 --> 00:19:30,881
brings you fortune,

364
00:19:32,241 --> 00:19:33,521
as well as trouble.

365
00:19:36,322 --> 00:19:36,842
Release him.

366
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:39,802
Lian'er!

367
00:19:40,682 --> 00:19:41,281
Lian'er!

368
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,281
Don't ever

369
00:20:18,722 --> 00:20:20,442
underestimate this woman.

370
00:20:34,521 --> 00:20:36,481
Snowball!

371
00:20:37,682 --> 00:20:39,161
Snowball, where are you?

372
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:40,761
Snowball!

373
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,202
Snowball, come out!

374
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:46,802
Snowball, why are you ignoring me, too?

375
00:20:50,202 --> 00:20:52,562
Everyone in this family fears me.

376
00:20:53,361 --> 00:20:55,042
No one plays with me sincerely.

377
00:20:55,562 --> 00:20:56,442
My mother finally

378
00:20:56,442 --> 00:20:57,361
got you to keep me company,

379
00:20:58,121 --> 00:20:58,881
but why?

380
00:20:58,962 --> 00:21:00,562
Why are you avoiding me, too?

381
00:21:02,082 --> 00:21:04,361
Snowball, come out, please.

382
00:21:04,802 --> 00:21:05,881
I'll give you fish.

383
00:21:06,001 --> 00:21:07,281
I'll give you lots of fishes.

384
00:21:08,361 --> 00:21:10,161
I'll ask more servants to serve you

385
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,922
and make the prettiest
cat house for you,

386
00:21:12,082 --> 00:21:12,722
all right?

387
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:17,682
Perhaps these are not what it wants.

388
00:21:21,401 --> 00:21:22,202
Who are you?

389
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:23,682
How do you know

390
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:24,962
what Snowball wants?

391
00:21:26,722 --> 00:21:27,722
It wants the freedom

392
00:21:28,722 --> 00:21:29,881
to do what it wants

393
00:21:30,602 --> 00:21:31,442
and go out

394
00:21:31,842 --> 00:21:33,161
to do what it wants to do.

395
00:21:33,641 --> 00:21:34,322
Why?

396
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:36,042
Isn't this a nice place?

397
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,401
Don't I treat it well?

398
00:21:37,962 --> 00:21:38,881
It's nice here,

399
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:40,922
but one is unhappy here.

400
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:42,521
Take yourself for an example.

401
00:21:42,962 --> 00:21:44,082
You're the prince's son,

402
00:21:44,562 --> 00:21:45,761
but you're unhappy, too.

403
00:21:46,082 --> 00:21:47,281
How do you know

404
00:21:47,281 --> 00:21:48,361
I'm the prince's son?

405
00:21:54,722 --> 00:21:55,722
The more privileged you are,

406
00:21:56,881 --> 00:21:57,962
the simpler your demands are.

407
00:22:00,481 --> 00:22:01,281
Kids of ordinary families

408
00:22:01,281 --> 00:22:02,481
might be happier than you.

409
00:22:11,641 --> 00:22:13,442
Are you coming in to look for Snowball?

410
00:22:13,722 --> 00:22:15,641
No, I'm not looking for it.

411
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:17,481
Since I like Snowball,

412
00:22:18,082 --> 00:22:18,842
I should let it

413
00:22:18,842 --> 00:22:20,161
do what it likes.

414
00:22:20,802 --> 00:22:22,281
I want to let you out.

415
00:22:22,682 --> 00:22:24,042
You've been confined.

416
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:25,281
You must be unhappy, too.

417
00:22:30,361 --> 00:22:30,842
Hui'er.

418
00:22:31,761 --> 00:22:32,562
What are you doing?

419
00:22:33,202 --> 00:22:35,241
Father, I want to let her out.

420
00:22:35,602 --> 00:22:36,682
You don't have to.

421
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,641
She's leaving tomorrow.

422
00:22:38,722 --> 00:22:39,241
Seriously?

423
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:40,922
Come here.

424
00:22:43,241 --> 00:22:44,521
Have fun over there.

425
00:22:44,761 --> 00:22:46,401
I need to talk to the lady.

426
00:22:46,401 --> 00:22:46,842
All right.

427
00:23:03,001 --> 00:23:04,802
Young Master Xin, you're good

428
00:23:04,802 --> 00:23:05,922
at lying to children and women.

429
00:23:08,322 --> 00:23:09,562
So you resent me a lot.

430
00:23:09,962 --> 00:23:11,842
I think you're blaming me

431
00:23:11,842 --> 00:23:13,042
for what happened to Lu Beiyi.

432
00:23:14,641 --> 00:23:15,922
If you're here to mock me,

433
00:23:15,922 --> 00:23:16,761
go away.

434
00:23:17,001 --> 00:23:17,521
Girl.

435
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:22,202
Can you read?

436
00:23:23,161 --> 00:23:23,761
Take a look.

437
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:24,842
Come on.

438
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:31,361
An examination to recruit talent?

439
00:23:31,842 --> 00:23:32,562
Keep reading.

440
00:23:33,722 --> 00:23:34,361
This...

441
00:23:35,202 --> 00:23:36,121
You didn't see it coming it, did you?

442
00:23:36,761 --> 00:23:38,401
Lu Beiyi participated in
the examination in secret.

443
00:23:39,481 --> 00:23:40,281
Impossible.

444
00:23:41,001 --> 00:23:42,121
He doesn't like it.

445
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:43,082
Why...

446
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:44,361
He likes it.

447
00:23:45,121 --> 00:23:45,881
He didn't go for it openly,

448
00:23:45,962 --> 00:23:47,641
because you didn't like it.

449
00:23:50,602 --> 00:23:52,121
It's the best article

450
00:23:52,121 --> 00:23:53,241
in this examination.

451
00:23:53,842 --> 00:23:55,401
Guess what I see

452
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:56,202
apart from

453
00:23:57,001 --> 00:23:58,042
his abundant talent?

454
00:24:00,082 --> 00:24:01,202
Yearning.

455
00:24:02,161 --> 00:24:03,881
Yearning for fame and fortune.

456
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:05,922
I've never met anyone else

457
00:24:06,202 --> 00:24:07,881
with such strong yearning.

458
00:24:08,842 --> 00:24:09,842
Do you seriously believe

459
00:24:10,802 --> 00:24:13,001
he'll give up for good?

460
00:24:23,481 --> 00:24:24,722
Since I like Snowball,

461
00:24:24,802 --> 00:24:25,682
I should let it

462
00:24:25,682 --> 00:24:26,962
do what it wants to do.

463
00:24:30,161 --> 00:24:30,802
I shall

464
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:31,682
pursue fame and fortune with him then.

465
00:24:31,962 --> 00:24:32,881
I don't mind sacrificing

466
00:24:33,241 --> 00:24:34,641
for true love.

467
00:24:36,802 --> 00:24:37,442
Girl.

468
00:24:37,802 --> 00:24:39,361
True love has no place

469
00:24:39,802 --> 00:24:41,082
in the pursuit of fame and fortune.

470
00:24:44,281 --> 00:24:44,922
Anyway,

471
00:24:45,641 --> 00:24:47,082
remember what I say.

472
00:24:48,001 --> 00:24:48,682
Remember it forever.

473
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:53,401
Move on from him.

474
00:24:54,802 --> 00:24:55,682
To you two,

475
00:24:56,322 --> 00:24:57,881
this might be the best outcome.

476
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:00,202
Why are you comforting me?

477
00:25:02,241 --> 00:25:03,881
You would resort to all means.

478
00:25:04,641 --> 00:25:06,001
Don't tell me you feel bad now.

479
00:25:13,922 --> 00:25:15,082
Go to bed, girl.

480
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:11,401
I'm Luo Qinglian.

481
00:26:11,922 --> 00:26:12,881
Greetings, Your Highness.

482
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:17,481
Your temperament

483
00:26:18,802 --> 00:26:19,641
and mannerism

484
00:26:21,521 --> 00:26:23,562
is exactly the same as the late princess

485
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:24,641
when she first entered the mansion.

486
00:26:28,042 --> 00:26:29,322
My efford in the last few days

487
00:26:29,322 --> 00:26:30,722
are paying off.

488
00:26:35,202 --> 00:26:35,562
Come on.

489
00:26:38,202 --> 00:26:40,361
I'll return to the mansion today, too.

490
00:26:40,802 --> 00:26:41,682
Ms. Qinglian,

491
00:26:41,842 --> 00:26:42,922
if you have any need,

492
00:26:44,161 --> 00:26:45,521
you can turn to me.

493
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:57,082
Why

494
00:26:58,361 --> 00:26:59,442
do you treat me so well?

495
00:27:05,481 --> 00:27:06,641
I treat you well

496
00:27:06,802 --> 00:27:08,281
because I miss Ms. Fu.

497
00:27:09,641 --> 00:27:10,802
However, someone else

498
00:27:11,481 --> 00:27:13,322
misses her much more than I do.

499
00:27:14,241 --> 00:27:15,322
He's feeling even more miserable.

500
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:18,241
Do you mean the prince?

501
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:23,881
Over the years,

502
00:27:26,842 --> 00:27:27,922
I've witnessed

503
00:27:27,922 --> 00:27:29,442
the prince's love and longing.

504
00:27:30,401 --> 00:27:32,881
Since his youth,

505
00:27:33,842 --> 00:27:35,761
he has never forgotten Ms. Fu.

506
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:37,161
The prince

507
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:39,641
is miserable.

508
00:27:41,481 --> 00:27:43,802
I bet Ms. Fu wouldn't
want him to be like this.

509
00:27:45,322 --> 00:27:46,922
If anyone can replace Ms. Fu

510
00:27:46,922 --> 00:27:47,922
to comfort the prince,

511
00:27:48,562 --> 00:27:50,082
I think Ms. Fu

512
00:27:52,761 --> 00:27:54,001
would be delighted.

513
00:27:56,881 --> 00:27:58,161
If I comfort the prince,

514
00:28:00,241 --> 00:28:01,481
who's going to comfort me?

515
00:28:30,922 --> 00:28:32,322
Luo Qinglian is here.

516
00:28:51,761 --> 00:28:54,042
Here comes the prince!

517
00:29:24,361 --> 00:29:26,241
The selection begins.

518
00:29:26,842 --> 00:29:31,042
Dear noble ladies, enter
when your name is called.

519
00:29:39,521 --> 00:29:40,001
Your Highness,

520
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:42,401
look at that.

521
00:29:54,442 --> 00:29:57,602
The daughter of Testaments and
Treasures Bureau's Gao Shouren,

522
00:29:57,761 --> 00:29:59,322
Gao Miao'an.

523
00:30:06,202 --> 00:30:07,281
I'm Gao.

524
00:30:11,161 --> 00:30:12,001
This...

525
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:18,202
Gao Shouren's daughter, Gao Miao'an,

526
00:30:18,521 --> 00:30:22,521
is rewarded with
ten taels for her effort.

527
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:23,922
Clean your face.

528
00:30:24,042 --> 00:30:26,001
Ladies, please clean your faces

529
00:30:26,281 --> 00:30:29,161
to enter the garden and meet the prince.

530
00:30:46,722 --> 00:30:47,481
Ladies.

531
00:30:48,241 --> 00:30:49,602
The water in my basin is clean.

532
00:30:49,842 --> 00:30:50,922
If you don't mind,

533
00:30:51,241 --> 00:30:51,922
we can share it.

534
00:30:52,922 --> 00:30:54,121
Thank you.

535
00:31:11,361 --> 00:31:12,722
My face is in pain!

536
00:31:12,922 --> 00:31:13,521
My face!

537
00:31:13,682 --> 00:31:14,361
What's wrong?

538
00:31:15,121 --> 00:31:16,761
Get up. Show it to me.

539
00:31:22,602 --> 00:31:24,562
What's going on?

540
00:31:25,641 --> 00:31:27,042
What are you waiting for?

541
00:31:27,481 --> 00:31:28,761
Summon a physician!

542
00:31:30,842 --> 00:31:31,922
The daughter of Liu Zhongxian...

543
00:31:31,922 --> 00:31:32,722
We have a report!

544
00:31:45,082 --> 00:31:45,562
Your Highness.

545
00:31:46,722 --> 00:31:47,161
What's the matter?

546
00:31:48,161 --> 00:31:48,761
Anything

547
00:31:48,761 --> 00:31:50,361
that would please me?

548
00:31:51,202 --> 00:31:51,722
No.

549
00:31:52,962 --> 00:31:53,682
Something bad happened.

550
00:31:55,322 --> 00:31:56,042
What happened?

551
00:31:58,802 --> 00:31:59,442
Lady Yao.

552
00:31:59,442 --> 00:32:00,361
Something bad happened.

553
00:32:01,281 --> 00:32:02,042
Why are you panicking?

554
00:32:02,241 --> 00:32:03,602
Luo Qinglian ruined
the ladies' appearance.

555
00:32:03,602 --> 00:32:04,562
She might be executed.

556
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:08,241
Hurry, inform Lianxin.

557
00:32:08,241 --> 00:32:08,802
Yes.

558
00:32:11,042 --> 00:32:11,761
Their appearance is ruined?

559
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:15,962
The one whose appearance is ruined

560
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:18,322
is not Luo Qinglian.

561
00:32:19,121 --> 00:32:19,722
Forget it.

562
00:32:20,442 --> 00:32:22,281
The mansion won't tolerate her anyway.

563
00:32:22,722 --> 00:32:24,641
Liuyan, look for my husband

564
00:32:25,001 --> 00:32:26,281
and ask him to go to
the mansion at once.

565
00:32:27,082 --> 00:32:28,361
He's playing chess.

566
00:32:28,761 --> 00:32:29,562
What?

567
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:30,761
Who is he with?

568
00:32:31,042 --> 00:32:32,322
Mr. Yuan, Chief Clerk of the Right.

569
00:32:33,082 --> 00:32:34,241
Good.

570
00:32:36,602 --> 00:32:37,361
Go to him at once.

571
00:32:37,641 --> 00:32:38,562
Tell my husband

572
00:32:38,562 --> 00:32:40,281
to go along with Mr. Yuan.

573
00:32:42,922 --> 00:32:43,602
Mr. Li.

574
00:32:44,082 --> 00:32:44,922
Are you also here

575
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:45,962
for the ladies' incident?

576
00:32:45,962 --> 00:32:46,761
That's right.

577
00:32:46,761 --> 00:32:48,401
Since the prince came to Quliang,

578
00:32:48,401 --> 00:32:49,202
such a crazy thing

579
00:32:49,202 --> 00:32:50,361
is unheard of.

580
00:32:50,442 --> 00:32:50,922
I wonder

581
00:32:50,922 --> 00:32:52,042
which lady

582
00:32:52,042 --> 00:32:53,322
would dare to do this.

583
00:32:53,521 --> 00:32:54,562
Didn't she know

584
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:56,562
it's a capital crime?

585
00:32:56,802 --> 00:32:57,562
I know, right?

586
00:32:57,641 --> 00:32:58,562
I heard it's the daughter
of Ceremony Bureau's

587
00:32:58,881 --> 00:32:59,962
Luo Rongyu.

588
00:33:00,281 --> 00:33:01,401
Her name is Luo Qinglian.

589
00:33:02,802 --> 00:33:03,922
Let's go.

590
00:33:04,761 --> 00:33:05,481
Gentlemen.

591
00:33:41,082 --> 00:33:41,881
Your Highness.

592
00:33:42,401 --> 00:33:44,161
Here's the lady who poisoned the water.

593
00:33:55,042 --> 00:33:57,281
I'm Luo Qinglian. I hope
you're well, Your Highness.

594
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:06,401
You ruined the appearance

595
00:34:06,401 --> 00:34:08,881
of three ladies of my selection.

596
00:34:09,641 --> 00:34:10,121
You hope I'm well?

597
00:34:11,442 --> 00:34:13,042
Do you think I would be well?

598
00:34:14,281 --> 00:34:15,602
Your Highness, you're
the pillar of Quliang.

599
00:34:16,362 --> 00:34:17,602
No matter what,

600
00:34:18,402 --> 00:34:19,281
as long as you're around,

601
00:34:19,882 --> 00:34:20,842
the sky won't collapse.

602
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:22,402
If you're well,

603
00:34:23,122 --> 00:34:24,322
Quliang will be well.

604
00:34:28,082 --> 00:34:29,921
You're eloquent. Aren't you afraid?

605
00:34:30,961 --> 00:34:32,162
I have a clear conscience.

606
00:34:32,802 --> 00:34:33,481
So I'm not afraid.

607
00:34:34,162 --> 00:34:34,921
Lift your head.

608
00:35:24,562 --> 00:35:26,761
My name is Fu'er.
Greetings, Your Highness.

609
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:38,602
Fu'er.

610
00:35:43,322 --> 00:35:44,322
Are you back?

611
00:35:46,322 --> 00:35:46,961
Fu'er.

612
00:35:52,882 --> 00:35:53,281
You...

613
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:30,842
Your Highness.

614
00:36:31,162 --> 00:36:32,562
The fathers of the three ladies

615
00:36:33,001 --> 00:36:34,362
are outside Qingkang Hall,
waiting to see you.

616
00:36:34,721 --> 00:36:36,122
Many officials are here, too.

617
00:36:36,921 --> 00:36:40,042
They're requesting you
to execute the culprit.

618
00:36:54,681 --> 00:36:56,802
Here comes the prince!

619
00:37:31,602 --> 00:37:32,441
Your Highness.

620
00:37:47,082 --> 00:37:47,882
What's the matter?

621
00:37:52,761 --> 00:37:53,441
Your Highness.

622
00:37:54,281 --> 00:37:56,921
My daughter joined
the mansion's selection,

623
00:37:57,402 --> 00:37:59,562
hoping to serve you

624
00:37:59,721 --> 00:38:00,961
and stay by your side

625
00:38:00,961 --> 00:38:02,201
to fulfil my duty for me.

626
00:38:02,402 --> 00:38:04,162
Before she even got to meet you,

627
00:38:04,842 --> 00:38:06,642
someone plotted against her

628
00:38:07,082 --> 00:38:08,602
and her appearance was ruined.

629
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:13,042
Your Highness, please
seek justice for us

630
00:38:13,402 --> 00:38:14,961
and punish the culprit.

631
00:38:17,322 --> 00:38:20,001
Your Highness, please
seek justice for us

632
00:38:20,201 --> 00:38:21,802
and punish the culprit.

633
00:38:25,921 --> 00:38:26,721
All of you may rise.

634
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:34,642
I know

635
00:38:34,642 --> 00:38:35,481
how you feel.

636
00:38:36,921 --> 00:38:37,562
Luo Qinglian.

637
00:38:38,521 --> 00:38:39,162
Yes, Your Highness.

638
00:38:39,802 --> 00:38:40,441
Do you

639
00:38:40,441 --> 00:38:41,241
hear them?

640
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:43,042
Yes.

641
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:45,441
What do you have to say?

642
00:38:46,362 --> 00:38:46,961
Your Highness,

643
00:38:48,281 --> 00:38:49,201
I have a father, too.

644
00:38:50,122 --> 00:38:51,082
My father

645
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,761
dotes on me, too.

646
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:53,921
Therefore, I understand very well

647
00:38:54,402 --> 00:38:56,122
how the gentlemen feel over
what happened to their daughters.

648
00:38:57,042 --> 00:38:57,562
However,

649
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:58,681
I did not

650
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:00,082
plot against the ladies.

651
00:39:00,481 --> 00:39:01,001
How dare you.

652
00:39:01,562 --> 00:39:03,402
Many witnessed how

653
00:39:03,402 --> 00:39:05,001
their appearance was ruined

654
00:39:05,001 --> 00:39:06,441
after they used the water in your basin.

655
00:39:06,882 --> 00:39:08,721
How dare you try to deny it.

656
00:39:15,761 --> 00:39:16,362
It's strange.

657
00:39:16,602 --> 00:39:17,721
Who would

658
00:39:17,721 --> 00:39:19,122
poison the water in her own basin

659
00:39:19,122 --> 00:39:20,642
in front of everyone

660
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:22,521
and be caught in the act?

661
00:39:25,201 --> 00:39:25,842
Was she

662
00:39:26,441 --> 00:39:27,201
seeking death?

663
00:39:27,602 --> 00:39:29,441
She's cunning.

664
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:30,521
That means

665
00:39:30,921 --> 00:39:31,882
she wanted to shift the blame

666
00:39:31,882 --> 00:39:32,842
by doing this.

667
00:39:33,241 --> 00:39:34,402
It's even stranger.

668
00:39:34,402 --> 00:39:36,001
If I wanted to do that,

669
00:39:36,322 --> 00:39:36,842
why wouldn't I

670
00:39:36,842 --> 00:39:38,441
poison them in secret?

671
00:39:38,882 --> 00:39:39,842
There're many ladies present.

672
00:39:40,162 --> 00:39:41,441
Wouldn't it be better

673
00:39:41,441 --> 00:39:43,481
to have no proof at all?

674
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:44,122
Also,

675
00:39:44,521 --> 00:39:45,082
gentleman,

676
00:39:45,281 --> 00:39:46,441
you should know by now

677
00:39:46,921 --> 00:39:47,802
the ladies' water

678
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,521
was tainted by the leaves

679
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:50,961
blown off a tree.

680
00:39:52,961 --> 00:39:54,761
I'm not Zhuge Liang's sister.

681
00:39:54,921 --> 00:39:55,882
Could I possibly summon
the eastern wind like he did?

682
00:39:56,681 --> 00:39:57,761
Could I have prayed

683
00:39:58,201 --> 00:39:59,441
for wind and rain?
