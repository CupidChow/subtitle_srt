=Episode 28=

17
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,089
I have been working for Ms. Lian
since I was little.

18
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,570
I know that no matter
how many kowtows I present,

19
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,370
it won't be...

20
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,690
It won't be enough to repay
all the kindness I received from you.

21
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:11,049
But I also know

22
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:13,450
that this is where I belong.

23
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,889
Where you belong?

24
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,930
Dongli, your feelings for Young Master Yi...

25
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,849
I have fallen for Young Master Yi,

26
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:24,530
but I also know

27
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:26,479
that the difference
between Young Master Yi and I

28
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,678
is enormous.

29
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:29,849
I never dare to wish for anything.

30
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:32,409
The day before we returned to Quliang,

31
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,038
I saw how virtuous and loyal

32
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,969
Young Master Yi was.

33
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,810
That was when I decided

34
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,530
that no matter
where Young Master Yi goes,

35
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,810
I will forever be at his service

36
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,409
and do all I can to help him.

37
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,049
Do you know

38
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,290
that he might never come back again?

39
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,329
I don't know,

40
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,730
but I don't care either.

41
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,769
Even if I can't go back to Quliang
ever again,

42
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,290
I'm still willing to do it.

43
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,650
You are emotionally invested

44
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,329
and not afraid of pressure.

45
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,769
And you want nothing in return.

46
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,969
You are also

47
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:21,049
a loyal and virtuous person.

48
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:23,798
I am really moved, so, of course,

49
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:25,409
I can't stop you
from chasing after what you want.

50
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,769
Dongli is your maid.

51
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,010
Since you have already agreed to this,

52
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,249
I will do my best to arrange it.

53
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:41,570
Thanks, Young Master.

54
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,129
Thanks, Ms. Lian.

55
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,489
Thank you so much, Ms. Lian.

56
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,090
Here, Dongli.

57
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,810
There's no need to help me.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,689
I'm fine. Go away.

59
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,130
Do you think I'm useless?

60
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,690
We lost a lot this time.

61
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,690
We lost a lot.

62
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,239
A lot.

63
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,729
My armoury.

64
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:38,609
We did everything we could

65
00:04:38,999 --> 00:04:40,889
and still lost our armoury.

66
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,479
In the end,

67
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,479
we only managed to eliminate

68
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,049
the useless He Lianchu

69
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,370
and He Lianyi,
who was of little importance.

70
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,609
We didn't do the slightest harm
to He Lianxin.

71
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,438
Not even the slightest.

72
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,690
He Lianxin...

73
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:56,569
I will surely defeat you, He Lianxin.

74
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:59,009
I will defeat you.

75
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:15,998
Your Highness.

76
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:17,720
The Minister of Rites is returning
to the capital.

77
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,169
He is here to bid farewell.

78
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,530
Send him in.

79
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,250
Greetings, Your Highness.

80
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:35,598
Why are you leaving in such a hurry?

81
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:37,280
Do you have something to attend to
in the capital?

82
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,598
I have ordered my servants

83
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:39,959
to prepare a banquet

84
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,878
to get you ready
for the long journey ahead.

85
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,530
Let's go.

86
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,289
I don't deserve that.

87
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,919
Before I left the capital,

88
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,079
Grand Chancellor told me

89
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,410
that under Your Highness' rule,

90
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,530
Quliang has developed progressively

91
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:59,370
and become this vibrant city.

92
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:02,970
Naturally, Your Highness will want
to choose your successor wisely.

93
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:08,169
It's a pity that the heir didn't live up
to your expectations,

94
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:10,118
causing all the effort
Your Highness invested in him

95
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,930
to go down the drain.

96
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,679
Grand Chancellor also assumed

97
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,410
that Your Highness
must be in a bad mood,

98
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,049
telling me not to disturb Your Highness.

99
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,970
I didn't expect

100
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,440
that Grand Chancellor
would understand my feelings so well

101
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,210
despite the thousands of miles
between us.

102
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,049
Grand Chancellor was right.

103
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,049
Since the passing
of the late princess consort,

104
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:38,729
I spent all my energy and time

105
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,530
on governing Quliang,

106
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,009
only hoping to turn Quliang

107
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,998
into a prosperous city

108
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:46,650
and pass it down to her son.

109
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:48,370
I abolished the heir's position,

110
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,810
and restored it again later.

111
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,650
You can see how much
I cosseted the heir.

112
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,090
But little did I know

113
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,530
what the heir did this time

114
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,329
really let me down.

115
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:04,718
I have long heard about

116
00:07:04,719 --> 00:07:07,289
how deeply Your Highness was in love
with the late princess consort.

117
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:10,009
Today, I witnessed it myself. It's true.

118
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,850
The late princess consort is gone.

119
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,278
It would be better for Your Highness
to get over it as soon as possible.

120
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,289
You're right.

121
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,449
It's time I let it go.

122
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,049
Not many get to live until their 70s.

123
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:25,838
Since the heir let me down,

124
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,850
now...

125
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:29,998
Regarding who should succeed my position,

126
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:31,690
tomorrow will worry about itself.

127
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:32,970
Today onwards,

128
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:35,769
I will live in the moment.

129
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:38,009
If that's what Your Highness thinks,

130
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:39,930
my attending of the banquet

131
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:43,090
is no longer
against Grand Chancellor's order.

132
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,318
Sure. Please.

133
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,250
This way.

134
00:07:54,444 --> 00:07:57,720
(Several Months Later
Mansion of Lord Rui)

135
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,690
Are you missing Zhao'er?

136
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,718
It's been a while since I last saw Zhao'er.

137
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:28,889
I wonder how Zhao'er is doing
in the prince's mansion.

138
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,130
It's good that
His Highness cares for him.

139
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,438
However, every time I'm going through
the pain of loss,

140
00:08:34,439 --> 00:08:36,210
I'd rather have His Highness
not care about him.

141
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,170
It's not that hard

142
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,090
to see him again.

143
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,478
Perhaps...

144
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:48,449
Young Master.

145
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,369
Young Master, Chief Steward Yu is here.

146
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,889
What's the matter?

147
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,650
It's a decree from His Highness.

148
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,759
Knowing that Young Master Xin
and Madam Lian

149
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,878
are missing your son,

150
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:18,520
His Highness has summoned you
to the mansion

151
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,970
to bring junior Young Master Zhao back home.

152
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,290
Thank you, Your Highness.

153
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:30,759
Young Master Xin knows

154
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,050
that Madam Lian misses
junior young master.

155
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,889
He spoke to His Highness
to ask for his approval.

156
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,410
It's a good thing
that we can bring Zhao'er home now.

157
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,249
However,

158
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,490
whenever I think of
how I'll be neglected in the future,

159
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,970
I'd rather not have you bring him home.

160
00:09:54,319 --> 00:09:55,530
Shi'er.

161
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,610
How long has it been
since you last met your father?

162
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,569
A very long time.

163
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,569
Then, do you miss him?

164
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,959
I do.

165
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,519
But I can't remember

166
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,118
what my father looks like.

167
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:08,798
Then,

168
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,079
when you see him later,

169
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,519
you should take a closer look.

170
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,118
You are the eldest son in our mansion.

171
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,970
How could you forget
what your father looks like?

172
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:22,199
Why did we stop, Mother?

173
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,889
Are we still going to meet my father?

174
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,210
There's no need to meet him anymore.

175
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,918
Your Highness.

176
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,159
Junior young master is asleep, right?

177
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,449
Pass it to me.

178
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:43,410
It's fine.

179
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,850
Let me hug him a while more.

180
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,129
Just a while more.

181
00:10:55,439 --> 00:10:57,689
Greeting, Father.

182
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:04,410
Have a seat.

183
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,889
Your Highness.

184
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,170
Your Highness.

185
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,160
Young Master Chu attempted suicide
at the Correctional Institution just now.

186
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,480
Thanks to Young Master Hua and the rest
who had taken precautions,

187
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,329
he is fine now. You don't have to worry.

188
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,249
Here.

189
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,569
The heir was removed from his position

190
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,210
and Lianhua didn't gloat over his loss.

191
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,610
Lianhua is a gem.

192
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,970
Summon Lianhua here tomorrow.

193
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,210
Yes, Your Highness.

194
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,689
Your Highness, are you still feeling sad
about what happened to the heir?

195
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,610
How can I not be sad?

196
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,490
All I did was live a few years longer

197
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,689
and it forced him to commit treachery.

198
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,650
If I knew this would happen,

199
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,809
why would I bother doing what I did?

200
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:07,929
If one day,

201
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,369
Zhao'er does what the heir did,

202
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,678
will Your Highness

203
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:13,129
feel the same?

204
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:16,769
That's really rude of you.

205
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:21,210
Let her continue.

206
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:24,769
If one day,

207
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,519
Zhao'er does something

208
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,719
that upsets and disappoints others,

209
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,478
will Your Highness

210
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:30,050
feel the same too?

211
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,650
As of now, I don't think so.

212
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:38,519
However, after he grows up...

213
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,050
After he grows up,

214
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,970
Your Highness will have already
spent too much time on him.

215
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,329
Then, you will feel the same too.

216
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,290
Your Highness is Prince An of Quliang,

217
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:53,929
but you are also not as young as you were.

218
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:57,129
You have spent 30 years doing this.

219
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,809
There was so much you yearned for,

220
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,850
and you have invested a lot in it too.

221
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,358
How could Your Highness not be sad

222
00:14:04,359 --> 00:14:06,009
and disappointed?

223
00:14:13,439 --> 00:14:14,689
You should leave first.

224
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:16,929
I want to spend some time alone.

225
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,129
You have been really quiet.

226
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:36,090
I'm sad because of
what His Highness is going through.

227
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,530
In my opinion,

228
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,878
His Highness

229
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,050
is the wisest and most capable man.

230
00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:43,558
However,

231
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:45,329
even the wise Prince of Quliang

232
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:47,490
doesn't know what to do with the heir.

233
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:49,599
When he abolished the position,

234
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,998
when he restored the position,

235
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:53,680
and even today, when he is finally
convinced about the heir's disobedience,

236
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,490
he has been confused the whole time.

237
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,050
It's human nature

238
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:01,730
to get distracted by their emotions.

239
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,249
That's what happened to Father too.

240
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,640
Because of the love for his son,
His Highness lost his head.

241
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:07,929
However,

242
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,318
that's also exactly why I think

243
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:13,210
His Highness is very respectable.

244
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,929
Unfortunately,

245
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,970
we couldn't stop

246
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,929
stabbing his heart.

247
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,210
While we are all working hard
to win the prince's title,

248
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,730
we don't realize that we are missing
the chance to care for Father.

249
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,170
Lianchu attempted suicide?

250
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:41,210
Lianxiu, you don't have to visit him.

251
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:43,569
I informed Young Master Hua about it

252
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,290
and he saved him.

253
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:47,998
Why?

254
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:48,798
This incident

255
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:50,639
can remind Father of my presence again.

256
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,399
Why did you give up

257
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,929
such a good opportunity to Lianhua?

258
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,678
Not only did I give up

259
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:56,210
this opportunity,

260
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,730
but I'll also give up those officials
who are loyal to you.

261
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,199
From now on,

262
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,490
they will be
at Young Master Hua's disposal.

263
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,569
Zhimei...

264
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:08,009
Am I drunk?

265
00:16:08,439 --> 00:16:09,970
Or are you drunk?

266
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:13,850
Lianxiu, are you tired or still asleep?

267
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,558
What do you think

268
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,490
are the chances

269
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,050
of you succeeding the title of the prince
after you lost the armoury?

270
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,850
30% chances?

271
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,090
No.

272
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:28,279
20%?

273
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,769
Not even 10%.

274
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:33,290
Have a seat.

275
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:44,210
Instead of struggling to survive,

276
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:45,318
we should find someone else

277
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:46,798
to win the title for you.

278
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,929
We can't trust the older ones now.

279
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:51,369
But some young ones have just grown up.

280
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:53,889
We want someone who's conceited,
but not smart.

281
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:55,159
He must have enough assets

282
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,889
to compete against Lianxin,

283
00:16:57,359 --> 00:16:59,530
but at the same time,
can be manipulated by us.

284
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,478
Who else is a better candidate

285
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:05,129
than Lianxin's blood brother?

286
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:07,689
You're right.

287
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,130
He is a very good candidate.

288
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,850
You always have the best vision

289
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:15,370
about who should succeed
to the title of the prince.

290
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,250
Because

291
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,210
that's the only thing you care about.

292
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,600
(11 Years Later)
We have been turned down

293
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,970
(Qingkang Hall)
for ten consecutive days.

294
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,090
His Highness has always been
a hardworking man.

295
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,198
What has changed His Highness

296
00:17:57,199 --> 00:17:58,569
and distracted him from his job?

297
00:17:58,719 --> 00:17:59,890
Exactly.

298
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:01,809
His Highness has been sick
every so often.

299
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,289
I'm afraid it's coming to an end.

300
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,689
Don't make any assumptions.

301
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:07,649
We should just wait for the order.

302
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:10,198
There are many others
who are more worried than us.

303
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:11,730
We should just wait
and see what happens next.

304
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,370
Just wait.

305
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,010
Enough.

306
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,439
Fine.

307
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,478
You can wait here.

308
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:23,919
I'll go in there to check on Father.

309
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,838
Lianzuo.

310
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,078
Why haven't you changed a bit?

311
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,760
After all these years,
you still have a hot temper.

312
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,970
How can I stay calm?

313
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,399
No one knows

314
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,809
how ill Father is right now.

315
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,730
Besides,

316
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,720
Winter Solstice is around the corner.

317
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,060
We don't know if Father will be able
to make it to the ancestral ritual.

318
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,370
Aren't you worried?

319
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,809
Lianxin, Lianxiu.

320
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,569
Aren't you worried?

321
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:03,770
Fine.

322
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,399
You can keep your composure,

323
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,529
but I can't.

324
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,449
His Highness has sent a decree.

325
00:19:19,719 --> 00:19:21,490
It's a decree for Young Master Xin.

326
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,449
His Highness is feeling ill

327
00:19:23,879 --> 00:19:26,770
and orders Young Master Xin
to hold the ancestral ritual on his behalf.

328
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:29,639
Why did he pick Young Master Xin?

329
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,770
I understand it now.

330
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,850
Yes, Your Highness.

331
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:54,689
His Highness has told me
to send Madam De off.

332
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,319
His Highness
doesn't want to see me, huh?

333
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,370
That was His Highness' order.

334
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:09,490
I will resign first.

335
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,569
It seems like

336
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:17,649
she is upset with my decision.

337
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,198
Lianhua led the troops
to fight against our enemy

338
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:29,730
and achieved great success.

339
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:32,319
The ancestral ritual

340
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,929
is a major event.

341
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,880
I should let Lianhua handle it.

342
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,920
(Quliang's Chief Clerk of the Right, Gu Sinian)
Why would I leave it to Lianxin?

343
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,370
Young Master Xin
and Young Master Hua

344
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,890
are both her sons.

345
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:46,850
Yet, Madam De is obviously biased.

346
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:50,169
After all, the son she raised herself
is more important than the other one.

347
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:51,730
What about you?

348
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:54,809
What do you think?

349
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,559
When Your Highness first said

350
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,439
that you would appoint
Young Master Xin to hold the ritual,

351
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,010
I was quite shocked too.

352
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:04,449
Young Master Hua
is gaining more and more support

353
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,010
and the troops listen to his command.

354
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,929
The heir hasn't been appointed yet.

355
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,399
I made my own guess

356
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,970
that you might summon
Young Master Hua back

357
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:14,130
for the ancestral ritual.

358
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,250
But now...

359
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,998
You have been
spending years together

360
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:21,878
with junior Young Master Zhao

361
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:23,440
and putting a lot of effort
into bringing him up.

362
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,010
I suppose...

363
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:33,409
I shouldn't have speculated
to Your Highness' plan.

364
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,850
Your Highness

365
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:39,360
is planning to choose your heir
according to the grandson you likes, right?

366
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:52,770
Even you think like this,

367
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,970
let alone others.

368
00:22:16,454 --> 00:22:21,730
(To Mu Tianshu)

369
00:22:22,462 --> 00:22:24,530
(Qiege Hall)

370
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,449
Father.

371
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,210
I am ready.

372
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,439
Junior Young Master.

373
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,439
Young Master said

374
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,169
that he didn't want to be disturbed.

375
00:22:39,668 --> 00:22:42,718
(Luo Qinglian's Son, He Nanzhao)

376
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:43,519
Father said

377
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,049
that he would take me hunting.

378
00:22:57,879 --> 00:22:58,890
Mother...

379
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,718
What is with the long face?

380
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:10,049
Did he turn you down?

381
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:12,519
Although I'm disappointed,

382
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,078
I'm not upset,

383
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:14,919
because I know

384
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,370
that Father is busy with work right now.

385
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,329
You haven't even seen him yet.

386
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:21,449
How would you know?

387
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,649
Although I didn't get to meet Father,

388
00:23:25,879 --> 00:23:27,598
I saw Su Nanchun.

389
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:29,610
Father doesn't show his worries
on his face,

390
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,809
but I can usually read it
in Su Nanchun's expression.

391
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:35,920
The fact that you grew up
in the prince's mansion

392
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,130
taught you to be observant
since you were a kid.

393
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,490
I'd rather he has a simpler life.

394
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,210
After all, he is still a kid.

395
00:23:45,239 --> 00:23:46,649
From now on,

396
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:49,090
I'm afraid that he's no longer a kid.

397
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:50,159
Young Master.

398
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,090
Father.

399
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,649
Go back to your room first.

400
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,090
I have something
to discuss with your mother.

401
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,210
Yes.

402
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,078
A royal decree and every man of mine

403
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,329
has turned into a laughing stock.

404
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,210
All the Young Masters...

405
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,449
All the officials...

406
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:25,358
We spent more than a decade
trying to earn a place for ourselves,

407
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:27,449
but we now lost to a boy.

408
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:29,639
Young Master Hua is in his prime now.

409
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,449
I didn't expect

410
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,890
that His Highness made him
the General of Illustrious Virtue,

411
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:38,130
and he's now nothing more
than the General of Illustrious Virtue.

412
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:45,569
This is my fate.

413
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,569
I tried so hard

414
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:49,449
and overcame all the challenges,

415
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,370
but in the end,

416
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,649
it's just a dream.

417
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,049
Have you accepted your fate, Lianxiu?

418
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,010
After all these years,
I finally understand this.

419
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:08,078
It doesn't matter

420
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,640
how the Young Masters fight
among themselves,

421
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,478
in the end

422
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:12,850
we are just the pawns in the game.

423
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:14,730
The player of the game

424
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:16,090
is Father.

425
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:19,929
You have accepted your fate,

426
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,689
but I haven't.

427
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:25,130
We are still far from the ending yet.

428
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,198
His Highness has forgotten
about Young Master Hua,

429
00:25:30,199 --> 00:25:31,478
so I will remind His Highness

430
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:33,130
about Young Master Hua's presence.

431
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,799
As for those

432
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,809
who are distracting His Highness,

433
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,730
we shall just get rid of them.

434
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,680
Conduct the ancestral ritual
on His Highness' behalf?

435
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,890
It seems like

436
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,718
you've already become

437
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:54,078
a thorn in the flesh to them.

438
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:55,649
You're only half right.

439
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,049
Right now,

440
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,730
I'm not their biggest threat.

441
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,770
Zhao'er is.

442
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,958
That's why I'm here.

443
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:05,759
You should bring Zhao'er

444
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,358
to father's mansion in the coming few days.

445
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:09,478
The safest place to keep him right now

446
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:11,130
is by Father's side.

447
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:13,730
Why do you look gloomy?

448
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,449
I'm not.

449
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:19,478
We all know

450
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:20,358
that conducting the ritual

451
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:22,358
means I'm only a step away
from succeeding the prince's title.

452
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:24,439
I have been looking forward
to governing Quliang

453
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,049
for decades.

454
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:29,010
You want His Highness

455
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,529
to pass you Quliang

456
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,689
with full confidence.

457
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,679
You don't want

458
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,610
to rely on your son to win Quliang.

459
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,490
Indeed,

460
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:46,210
I can't hide anything from you.

461
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,809
Little did I know

462
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,850
after all the meticulous planning
and hard work,

463
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,569
at the end of the day,

464
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,439
what Father values

465
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,010
isn't my capability,

466
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:02,130
but my son.

467
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:10,370
His Highness is in his dotage,

468
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,649
but it doesn't mean that he is confused.

469
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,809
He knows what he's seeing.

470
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:17,890
I'm sure that he has his own plan.

471
00:27:25,999 --> 00:27:29,010
Unfortunately, I think

472
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,449
you are the only one

473
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,529
who thinks so.

474
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,809
Who's there? Show yourself.

475
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,169
What's the matter, Zhao'er?

476
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,718
Mother.

477
00:27:47,719 --> 00:27:50,198
There was a guy by the window,
eavesdropping your conversation.

478
00:27:50,199 --> 00:27:51,159
When I ran over,

479
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,929
the guy disappeared into thin air.

480
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,409
You should leave
the first thing tomorrow.

481
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:57,890
There shall be no delay.

482
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:11,250
Who's there?

483
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,679
Open your eyes.

484
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,289
Can't you recognize Young Master Hua?

485
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:16,028
Young Master Hua...

486
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:17,882
(He Yunshuo's Eighth Son, He Lianhua)

487
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,200
It's late in the evening.

488
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,929
Do you have the military order
to be out here?

489
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,279
What a prick.

490
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,130
Young Master Hua needs
no military order.

491
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:26,159
Get out of his way

492
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,689
or you will get punished.

493
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:29,529
Do you think this is a military order?

494
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:30,569
Yes!

495
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,198
Commander.

496
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:35,759
As expected, Young Master Hua,
leading his team,

497
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,130
is on his way to Quliang.

498
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,649
Just like what Young Master Xin expected.

499
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:41,198
Are the soldiers ready for an ambush?

500
00:28:41,199 --> 00:28:44,240
Following your order, they're waiting
in a concealed place along the way to Quliang.

501
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,309
Send my order now and tell them
to ambush the squad.

502
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,940
(Mansion of Prince An)

503
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:51,439
Madam De has told me

504
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,878
to get ready a room
for Madam Lian and junior Young Master.

505
00:28:53,879 --> 00:28:55,878
You can stay here without any worry.

506
00:28:55,879 --> 00:28:57,409
Thank you, Ms. Qiushi.

507
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:59,159
You're welcome, Madam Lian.

508
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,919
Madam De is very happy

509
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,449
that you're here to keep her company.

510
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,198
Madam De ordered me

511
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:06,090
to prepare this Bazhen Cake
for junior Young Master Zhao.

512
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,010
Why don't you try it
while it's still warm?

513
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:10,078
It's getting windy outside.

514
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,490
Let's eat it inside.

515
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,449
We have arrived.

516
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,439
Madam Lian, you should settle down

517
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,519
and take a good rest first

518
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,090
before you go and send your greetings.

519
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:30,319
We don't need to rest.

520
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:30,919
Of course,

521
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,919
we have to greet Madam De first.

522
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,799
I am sure

523
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,770
Madam De will be very happy
to hear this.

524
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,730
Please come with me, then.

525
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,838
Madam De said

526
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:52,078
that she is having a cold.

527
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:53,850
There is no need to greet her.

528
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,679
Besides,

529
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,370
Madam Lian might have to take care
of your own dinner.

530
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,049
I'll get going first.

531
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,049
Why is it so strange?

532
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,329
She even brought the gifts with her.

533
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,610
Madam.

534
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,639
Did you notice

535
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,799
that Ms. Qiushi's expression

536
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,169
was a little awkward?

537
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,730
I assume Madam De has
caught wind of something

538
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:27,210
and changed her mind.

539
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,289
Fair enough.

540
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:31,689
Zhao'er,

541
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:34,649
bear in mind.

542
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,919
Other than what we brought here,

543
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,118
never eat any food here.

544
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:40,118
Not even a bite.

545
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:41,039
Remember?

546
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,929
Yes.

547
00:30:42,879 --> 00:30:45,329
Madam, are you afraid of Madam De?

548
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,970
Madam De won't do anything to us,

549
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,250
but I don't know what others will do.

550
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:54,689
The dish will go through many people.

551
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:57,409
If anything happens,

552
00:30:57,719 --> 00:30:58,439
we won't be able

553
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,610
to find out who's behind it.

554
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,289
Did you bring the dagger with you?

555
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,649
I did.

556
00:31:08,959 --> 00:31:10,929
Beware of anyone who gets near you.

557
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,439
Once you're in danger,

558
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,610
pull out the dagger immediately

559
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,169
and show them no mercy.

560
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,850
Yes.

561
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,078
But Mother...

562
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:20,718
I come to the mansion every day.

563
00:31:20,719 --> 00:31:22,198
It has always been a very safe place.

564
00:31:22,199 --> 00:31:23,850
Things are different now.

565
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,929
Now that His Highness

566
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:30,490
has appointed someone
to conduct the ancestral ritual,

567
00:31:31,879 --> 00:31:33,770
I'm afraid that we will lose
the stability and quietness

568
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,569
we have been enjoying
for the past 11 years.

569
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,010
Your Highness, you're awake.

570
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,370
Why are you serving me this tea?

571
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,569
Your Highness.

572
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:21,409
Madam Lian just moved into the mansion.

573
00:32:21,999 --> 00:32:23,679
She was here with junior Young Master Zhao

574
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,169
to visit you.

575
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,929
This is the Loquat Flower Tea
she brought for you.

576
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,490
She knew that you were asleep,
so she headed back first.

577
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:31,850
Should I

578
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,610
bring them here now?

579
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:45,409
Do you think Madam Lian

580
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:49,169
has been acting differently recently?

581
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,970
Recently,

582
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,639
she has been copying
and reciting scriptures every day.

583
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,759
She still looks

584
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,639
very poised and composed.

585
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,490
However, now she refuses

586
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,010
to leave junior Young Master Zhao alone.

587
00:33:35,239 --> 00:33:36,689
Please have some tea, Mother.

588
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:42,329
Didn't I tell you not to come by?

589
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,250
Mother always cares for me.

590
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:47,759
Now that you're feeling unwell,

591
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,409
how can I not drop by and visit?

592
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,958
I heard that you've caught a cold.

593
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:53,639
I added some ginger and honey in the tea.

594
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,529
It can make your body a little warmer.

595
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,129
Thank you.

596
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,970
But

597
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,169
judging by how much
Lianxin cares for you,

598
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,889
if he successfully succeeds the title,

599
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,198
he will at least

600
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,889
make you his side consort.

601
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,210
How dare I drink the tea you serve?

602
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,649
Why did Madam De say so?

603
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,160
I have been living in the mansion
for a very long time,

604
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,649
and my brain doesn't work
so well anymore.

605
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,879
Today, I heard

606
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,759
that His Highness favors Lianxin

607
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,449
because you gave birth to a good son.

608
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,849
It's a pity...

609
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,718
It's a pity that Lianhua worked so hard

610
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:00,449
to fight on the battlefield,

611
00:35:00,479 --> 00:35:03,010
but eventually lost to a boy.

612
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,889
Madam De, you have misunderstood this.

613
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:11,720
His Highness only gets
Young Master Xin to handle the ritual

614
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,519
because he isn't feeling too well.

615
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,279
It means nothing else.

616
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,649
If His Highness really intends
to pass down the title,

617
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,198
Young Master Hua, who is both
a good scholar and a good fighter

618
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:21,800
and has great achievements
on the battlefield,

619
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,849
will certainly be
His Highness' first choice.

620
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:26,279
Unfortunately, he is
at the frontier right now.

621
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,160
That is why Young Master Xin
earned the opportunity

622
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,849
to hold the ancestral ritual.

623
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:37,849
Fine.

624
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,169
I'm tired.

625
00:35:40,999 --> 00:35:42,330
You should go back.

626
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,330
You can leave now.

627
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:47,689
Yes.

628
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,678
Madam.

629
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:08,039
I just can't understand.

630
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,478
Both Young Master Xin
and Young Master Hua

631
00:36:09,479 --> 00:36:11,369
are Madam De's biological sons.

632
00:36:11,439 --> 00:36:13,478
Why did Madam De

633
00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:15,849
seem so upset when she heard
that Young Master was handling the ritual?

634
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,010
Although they are both her sons,

635
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,449
all parents are biased.

636
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,119
Moreover,

637
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,158
Young Master

638
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:25,379
was raised by Madam Yi.

639
00:36:25,379 --> 00:36:27,240
He only returned to Zhaohui Courtyard
at the age of nine.

640
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,359
Meanwhile, Young Master Hua

641
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,369
was raised personally by Madam De.

642
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,970
Of course, she treats them differently.

643
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,119
Not only does she not care
about her own son,

644
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,640
when she heard that Young Master
was chosen for the ritual because of Zhao'er,

645
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,409
she also doesn't want to see
her own grandson.

646
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,609
Madam...

647
00:36:45,919 --> 00:36:47,050
Madam...

648
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,929
What's on your mind?

649
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,210
I'm just curious.

650
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,449
She said she only found out about it today.

651
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,810
What a coincidence.

652
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:03,810
Madam Lian is indeed
a beautiful and smart woman.

653
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:08,250
It's Forth Madam.

654
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,409
Greetings, Forth Madam.

655
00:37:22,999 --> 00:37:24,210
Please get up.

656
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,519
I heard

657
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,730
that His Highness and Lianxin
favors Madam Lian.

658
00:37:27,919 --> 00:37:30,010
Today, I finally understand why.

659
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:32,519
You know how to win others' hearts,

660
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,119
and you know what to say
to make others happy.

661
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,689
No doubt everyone likes you.

662
00:37:37,919 --> 00:37:39,238
I only speak

663
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:40,849
what's on my mind.

664
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,559
Forth Madam,

665
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,169
what a coincidence
that you're here today too.

666
00:37:44,439 --> 00:37:46,759
I heard that Madam De is feeling
a little gloomy lately.

667
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,250
I'm here to keep her company.

668
00:37:48,479 --> 00:37:50,649
I'm sending her
the Gelatin Soup I cooked.

669
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:52,929
Unfortunately,

670
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,849
both the Honey Ginger Tea

671
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,649
and the Gelatin Soup

672
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,039
won't be able

673
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,599
to cure Madam De's illness.

674
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,770
Forth Madam knows
what she's worried about too.

675
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,918
Madam De always hopes

676
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:06,680
that Young Master Hua
will succeed the prince's title.

677
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,210
I'm sure Madam Lian
knows about this too.

678
00:38:09,439 --> 00:38:11,319
I'm impressed

679
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,889
at how honest Forth Madam is.

680
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,158
However, the succession
of the prince's title is a great matter.

681
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:18,330
I'm afraid that we don't have a say in this
as the women of the family.

682
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:21,158
If everything goes well,

683
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:22,730
then, of course,
we don't have to get involved.

684
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,050
However, if things
go against our will...

685
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:29,889
Madam Lian and I are both women.

686
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,519
Women only want to see their men

687
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,929
achieve great success.

688
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,810
I will do everything for Lianxiu

689
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,770
to ensure his well-being.

690
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,770
I'm sure Madam Lian is just the same.

691
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,158
All right.

692
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:46,490
The soup is getting cold.

693
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,649
I will catch up with Madam Lian again

694
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,889
some other day.

695
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,970
You're doing everything you can
for Young Master Xiu.

696
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,918
However, is that really
what Young Master Xiu wants?

697
00:39:02,919 --> 00:39:05,010
Or is it what you want?

698
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,609
Can you tell them apart?

699
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,810
I'll get going.

700
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:23,490
She reads mind,

701
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,169
and knows how to win others' hearts.

702
00:39:26,399 --> 00:39:28,279
She is a bigger threat

703
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,689
than I thought.

704
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,889
Judging by how calm she is,

705
00:39:31,999 --> 00:39:34,530
I suppose that junior Young Master Zhao
didn't eat the Bazhen Cake.

706
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:35,760
Our effort was in vain.

707
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,440
I spent so much effort
to sneak into the kitchen,

708
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,050
and we wasted a bag of toxics.

709
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:41,678
Madam, your prediction
was really accurate.

710
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,250
You knew that we wouldn't succeed.

711
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,438
She has already heard

712
00:39:48,439 --> 00:39:49,718
about the conversation

713
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:51,810
we had with Madam De just now.

714
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:54,319
"A beautiful and smart woman"

715
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,238
is also a phrase

716
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:56,849
His Highness and I use when we're alone.

717
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,760
She has everything planned out
and gets her news very quickly.

718
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,129
I'm very impressed.

719
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:02,570
Have you arranged everything?

720
00:40:02,999 --> 00:40:03,998
Don't worry, Madam.

721
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:05,570
We can do it tomorrow.

722
00:40:08,479 --> 00:40:10,369
It doesn't matter

723
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:12,290
if it's what Young Master Xiu wants

724
00:40:12,439 --> 00:40:13,810
or what I want.

725
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,250
The only thing that matters
is how we get it.

726
00:40:16,919 --> 00:40:18,478
(Ruan Zhimei has an agenda.)

727
00:40:18,479 --> 00:40:21,638
(Young Master Xiu has been doing evil for years,
and she certainly has been helping him.)

728
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:24,449
(They should never get Quliang.)

729
00:40:29,479 --> 00:40:30,409
Young Master.

730
00:40:30,479 --> 00:40:32,050
It's a confidential letter
from Commander Mu.

731
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,409
(Hope that Young Master Xin
can release Madam Yao.)

732
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,158
(I will do my best)

733
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,970
(to help Young Master win the throne.)

734
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:52,398
Mother.

735

You should stay at home.

Why don't you stay here
and keep me company?
