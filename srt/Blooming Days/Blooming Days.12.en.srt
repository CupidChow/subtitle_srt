=Episode 12=

17
00:01:51,132 --> 00:01:52,611
I always like pink.

18
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:54,691
After giving birth to my child,

19
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:55,651
I particularly like it.

20
00:01:56,212 --> 00:01:57,371
Everytime I see the colour,

21
00:01:57,812 --> 00:01:58,931
I can't take my eyes off it.

22
00:02:01,731 --> 00:02:03,172
Do you like pink

23
00:02:05,172 --> 00:02:06,532
or just the peony?

24
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:08,411
How could you say that?

25
00:02:08,931 --> 00:02:11,172
You're already Young Master's
primary consort.

26
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:13,011
Why do you mind other things?

27
00:02:14,692 --> 00:02:15,211
Young Master,

28
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:17,771
Haiyao is fooling around.

29
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:19,771
Please stop her.

30
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:23,011
My father isn't unhappy.

31
00:02:23,412 --> 00:02:24,532
She isn't fooling around.

32
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:30,052
I wish I could grant your wish,

33
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,571
but a primary consort is
different from side concubines.

34
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,491
I'm afraid you'll spark a controversy.

35
00:02:38,252 --> 00:02:39,771
Since you're unwilling to give in,

36
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,131
why don't you decide, Your Highness?

37
00:02:49,371 --> 00:02:50,211
What did you say?

38
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,692
Compete with Madam Rui
for the reward?

39
00:02:53,571 --> 00:02:54,812
Based on my status today,

40
00:02:55,052 --> 00:02:56,571
how could I be lower than her?

41
00:02:57,252 --> 00:02:58,892
However, if you do this
in front of Prince An,

42
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:00,931
he might be furious.

43
00:03:02,131 --> 00:03:03,491
I want to test Prince An.

44
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:06,612
It isn't an ordinary reward.

45
00:03:07,371 --> 00:03:08,612
It concerns a wife's status.

46
00:03:09,972 --> 00:03:11,692
If His Highness agrees,

47
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:13,972
(Young Master wouldn't disagree.)

48
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:15,571
So...

49
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,371
There's a message!

50
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:21,972
The silk tapestry fan

51
00:03:24,452 --> 00:03:24,972
will...

52
00:03:25,452 --> 00:03:25,931
Your Highness.

53
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:26,972
What's the matter?

54
00:03:26,972 --> 00:03:28,211
Young Master Zuo wants to see you.

55
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:29,332
Okay.

56
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:33,491
You may excuse yourselves.

57
00:03:37,131 --> 00:03:38,771
Summon Young Master Zuo!

58
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:51,851
Greetings, Father.

59
00:03:52,252 --> 00:03:52,812
Rise.

60
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:57,452
I'm hosting a celebration for Lianxin.

61
00:03:58,211 --> 00:03:59,771
Sit down

62
00:04:00,252 --> 00:04:01,131
and drink with us.

63
00:04:01,412 --> 00:04:02,810
The liquor of Lianxin's celebratory feast

64
00:04:04,172 --> 00:04:05,052
doesn't suit for me.

65
00:04:08,571 --> 00:04:09,291
What do you mean?

66
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:20,731
What's this?

67
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:22,132
Father,

68
00:04:22,491 --> 00:04:23,870
Lianxin collected money
for the treasury.

69
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:25,812
He used trickery and extreme ways.

70
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:27,331
The officials feel miserable.

71
00:04:27,331 --> 00:04:28,211
They have been complaining.

72
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:29,560
They drafted the official document

73
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:32,371
and assigned me to present it to you.

74
00:04:47,331 --> 00:04:47,891
Lianxiu,

75
00:04:48,092 --> 00:04:49,611
(He Yunshuo's Sixth Son, He Lianzhi)
Lianxin has contributed.

76
00:04:49,611 --> 00:04:50,012
(He Yunshuo's Sixth Son, He Lianzhi)

77
00:04:50,012 --> 00:04:51,891
Will Father really punish him?

78
00:04:54,651 --> 00:04:56,611
(Used trickery and extreme ways)
Officials of Trials, Ceremonial Guards,

79
00:04:56,611 --> 00:04:59,692
Regional Governor, Education
Officials, Officials of Seals Bureau,

80
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:01,732
high- and low-ranking
county magistrates,

81
00:05:02,132 --> 00:05:03,292
and the Chief Clerk

82
00:05:03,931 --> 00:05:05,331
are involved in issuing the document.

83
00:05:08,972 --> 00:05:09,572
Lianxin.

84
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:16,132
Yes, Father.

85
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:19,371
Of all officials of Quliang,

86
00:05:19,371 --> 00:05:20,732
you've offended half of them.

87
00:05:21,651 --> 00:05:22,651
What do you have to say?

88
00:05:24,012 --> 00:05:26,171
After accepting the job,

89
00:05:27,732 --> 00:05:29,292
I knew I would face this someday.

90
00:05:31,012 --> 00:05:32,012
Lianxin, do you mean

91
00:05:32,491 --> 00:05:33,732
the official job is to blame?

92
00:05:34,171 --> 00:05:34,972
There are ways

93
00:05:34,972 --> 00:05:36,171
for collecting debts.

94
00:05:36,852 --> 00:05:38,651
Why did you provoke the people?

95
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:40,171
Did you have a way?

96
00:05:41,532 --> 00:05:42,211
If you did,

97
00:05:42,211 --> 00:05:42,931
why didn't you

98
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:43,972
volunteer to do the job?

99
00:05:47,252 --> 00:05:48,012
In this world,

100
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:51,331
creditors are disliked.

101
00:05:51,771 --> 00:05:52,771
I know what they

102
00:05:53,532 --> 00:05:54,812
are thinking.

103
00:05:57,611 --> 00:05:58,171
Lianzuo,

104
00:05:59,611 --> 00:06:00,972
if you want to drink,

105
00:06:01,051 --> 00:06:01,852
just sit down.

106
00:06:03,092 --> 00:06:03,771
If you

107
00:06:04,292 --> 00:06:06,051
want to convey a message to them soon,

108
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:07,891
you may leave.

109
00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:11,532
Say something, Lianxiu.

110
00:06:12,292 --> 00:06:13,692
Will Father punish Lianxin?

111
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:14,771
He won't.

112
00:06:16,132 --> 00:06:16,732
Won't he?

113
00:06:17,891 --> 00:06:19,252
Why did you make Lianzuo do it?

114
00:06:19,732 --> 00:06:21,012
You still made the officials

115
00:06:21,012 --> 00:06:22,412
draft the document against him.

116
00:06:22,412 --> 00:06:23,572
The officials' response

117
00:06:24,211 --> 00:06:25,252
would be expected by father.

118
00:06:25,732 --> 00:06:26,451
The document

119
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:27,651
is just a prologue.

120
00:06:28,252 --> 00:06:29,451
If the prologue is too interesting,

121
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:30,891
there's no fun.

122
00:06:32,132 --> 00:06:32,692
Father,

123
00:06:33,931 --> 00:06:36,171
you may understand certain things

124
00:06:37,012 --> 00:06:38,012
but

125
00:06:38,771 --> 00:06:39,891
not others.

126
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,211
What else

127
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:43,451
is beyond my awareness?

128
00:06:44,692 --> 00:06:45,611
We should ask Lianxin.

129
00:06:46,692 --> 00:06:48,692
Lianxin, when collecting
debts for the treasury,

130
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,720
you cornered the good official,
Official Li to death.

131
00:06:50,732 --> 00:06:52,451
Dozens of civilians
were morally outraged

132
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:53,390
and petitioned for justice,

133
00:06:53,692 --> 00:06:55,532
but you killed all of them!

134
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:58,852
Lianxin, don't you dare to deny it.

135
00:07:06,572 --> 00:07:07,451
Is this true?

136
00:07:13,092 --> 00:07:13,572
Yes.

137
00:07:17,331 --> 00:07:18,931
The heir has arrived!

138
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:29,292
Greetings, Father.

139
00:07:29,852 --> 00:07:30,891
You've arrived at this moment.

140
00:07:32,371 --> 00:07:32,931
Do you want

141
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:33,891
to plead for Lianxin?

142
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:34,931
Father,

143
00:07:35,491 --> 00:07:36,051
I'm here

144
00:07:36,371 --> 00:07:37,692
not to plead for Lianxin.

145
00:07:38,412 --> 00:07:39,972
I want to add fuel to the fire.

146
00:07:40,812 --> 00:07:42,891
I want to expose another
crime committed by him.

147
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:53,771
Get up.

148
00:07:54,852 --> 00:07:55,491
Thanks, Father.

149
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:04,812
Add fuel to the fire as you please.

150
00:08:08,371 --> 00:08:09,211
Father, as you know,

151
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,931
during the prayer for my mother,

152
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:12,611
Lianxin and I

153
00:08:12,611 --> 00:08:14,132
encountered falling boulders

154
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,171
and had a misunderstanding.

155
00:08:15,451 --> 00:08:17,771
Later, for the title appointment,

156
00:08:18,092 --> 00:08:19,852
I was scolded by you.

157
00:08:20,412 --> 00:08:22,211
I was very upset.

158
00:08:23,292 --> 00:08:25,331
So when He Lianxin

159
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:27,451
was ordered to collect
the debts this time,

160
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:30,451
I knew chaos would happen.

161
00:08:30,852 --> 00:08:32,211
I had someone stalking him.

162
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:34,012
I wanted to find his mistakes.

163
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:36,371
I wanted to take revenge on him.

164
00:08:39,372 --> 00:08:40,771
You're honest.

165
00:08:43,451 --> 00:08:44,052
Father,

166
00:08:44,932 --> 00:08:46,372
I wanted to observe on the sidelines,

167
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:49,571
but I ended up being unable to do so.

168
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,372
Instead, I discovered

169
00:08:52,451 --> 00:08:53,451
something about him.

170
00:08:54,052 --> 00:08:54,612
Lianchu.

171
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:02,451
Go on.

172
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:03,771
Father,

173
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:05,932
I discovered that

174
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,011
when He Lianxin was collecting debts,

175
00:09:08,412 --> 00:09:09,610
he encountered corrupt officials.

176
00:09:10,172 --> 00:09:12,211
He used an extremely immoral way.

177
00:09:12,771 --> 00:09:13,612
It was so outrageous that

178
00:09:13,612 --> 00:09:14,730
people would jump down his throat,

179
00:09:15,092 --> 00:09:16,811
but when encountering
poor and honest officials,

180
00:09:18,011 --> 00:09:19,372
he never collected debts from them.

181
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:20,771
He even used his own money

182
00:09:21,092 --> 00:09:22,251
to pay for debts on behalf of them.

183
00:09:23,211 --> 00:09:24,651
An example is

184
00:09:25,172 --> 00:09:26,092
the one Lianzuo mentioned,

185
00:09:26,092 --> 00:09:26,811
Official Li.

186
00:09:36,732 --> 00:09:37,451
(That's weird.)

187
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,292
(He seems to be complaining, but
is indirectly extricating Lianxin.)

188
00:09:40,891 --> 00:09:41,571
(That's weird.)

189
00:09:41,691 --> 00:09:43,412
(Doesn't the heir hate
Young Master very much?)

190
00:09:43,852 --> 00:09:45,131
(How come he's helping him?)

191
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:48,211
Today, I want to expose

192
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:49,150
He Lianxin's crimes

193
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,131
of showing favouritism

194
00:09:51,651 --> 00:09:53,331
and cheating.

195
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:00,852
Lianxin,

196
00:10:02,972 --> 00:10:03,811
is it true?

197
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:05,612
Did Official Li die

198
00:10:06,251 --> 00:10:07,612
of suicide?

199
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:10,811
No.

200
00:10:12,331 --> 00:10:13,251
How did he die?

201
00:10:20,612 --> 00:10:21,172
Tell me.

202
00:10:24,651 --> 00:10:25,251
Father,

203
00:10:26,732 --> 00:10:28,251
a day before Official Li's death,

204
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:29,451
I

205
00:10:29,732 --> 00:10:31,092
had seen Official Li briefly.

206
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:33,492
I got to know that Official Li
had been very ill.

207
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:36,211
To avoid worrying his family,

208
00:10:36,211 --> 00:10:37,331
he kept his illness from them.

209
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:40,251
He died due to the illness that day.

210
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:42,732
That's why it looked
like a sudden death.

211
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:45,180
Lianzuo's misunderstanding

212
00:10:46,052 --> 00:10:47,092
is understandable.

213
00:10:51,571 --> 00:10:52,932
What about the civilians?

214
00:10:53,372 --> 00:10:54,412
They weren't civilians,

215
00:10:55,092 --> 00:10:55,852
but robbers.

216
00:10:58,251 --> 00:10:59,732
If Official Mu didn't risk his life

217
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,052
to protect me,

218
00:11:01,811 --> 00:11:02,612
all the treasury's money

219
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:04,691
would've been gone.

220
00:11:10,011 --> 00:11:12,131
Do you mean the heir?

221
00:11:13,251 --> 00:11:14,331
How could it be?

222
00:11:21,011 --> 00:11:22,372
It's a fight among the successors.

223
00:11:23,172 --> 00:11:25,571
There are neither true friends nor enemies.

224
00:11:26,891 --> 00:11:28,451
Once they work together,

225
00:11:29,412 --> 00:11:30,610
from now on, in the imperial court,

226
00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:33,451
I'll have no power.

227
00:11:33,972 --> 00:11:34,771
What should we do?

228
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:38,571
Could you have long
been prepared for this?

229
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:45,372
I know you're eloquent,

230
00:11:49,412 --> 00:11:50,292
but it's a pity.

231
00:11:52,532 --> 00:11:53,412
Father, please allow me

232
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:55,732
to summon someone.

233
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:07,052
Greetings, Your Highness.

234
00:12:09,571 --> 00:12:10,052
Today,

235
00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:11,732
we must seek justice!

236
00:12:14,172 --> 00:12:15,292
Who are you?

237
00:12:17,052 --> 00:12:18,011
Your Highness,

238
00:12:18,211 --> 00:12:19,331
I'm Wang Wu.

239
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:21,131
I'm an ordinary civilian.

240
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:23,251
Official Li helped me every year.

241
00:12:23,571 --> 00:12:24,571
That day, when I knew

242
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,932
Official Li was driven into
a corner by Young Master Xin,

243
00:12:27,092 --> 00:12:28,612
the rest of the people and I

244
00:12:28,612 --> 00:12:30,651
appealed to Young Master Xin.

245
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:32,451
You say you've seen Young Master Xin.

246
00:12:33,092 --> 00:12:34,251
Could you point him out?

247
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:44,052
Lianxin,

248
00:12:44,612 --> 00:12:45,612
I wonder if this man

249
00:12:46,011 --> 00:12:46,932
is familiar to you.

250
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:53,011
Wang Wu,

251
00:12:54,052 --> 00:12:56,492
do you still remember
the incident that day?

252
00:12:57,052 --> 00:12:58,172
How could I forget?

253
00:12:58,771 --> 00:13:00,612
I'll never forget it.

254
00:13:01,092 --> 00:13:03,131
That day, we stopped
Young Master Xin together.

255
00:13:03,211 --> 00:13:04,331
We wanted to seek justice

256
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:05,532
for Official Li.

257
00:13:06,211 --> 00:13:07,571
Unexpectedly, when we

258
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:08,612
talked about our purpose,

259
00:13:08,852 --> 00:13:10,532
Young Master Xin got angry and said

260
00:13:11,131 --> 00:13:12,451
whether Official Li took his own life

261
00:13:12,451 --> 00:13:14,011
wasn't our business.

262
00:13:14,732 --> 00:13:16,092
We wanted to reason with him again,

263
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:19,211
but he ordered that...

264
00:13:20,052 --> 00:13:21,492
I saw

265
00:13:21,492 --> 00:13:23,331
everyone else

266
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:25,891
getting killed by the soldiers.

267
00:13:26,532 --> 00:13:28,612
They were innocent civilians.

268
00:13:29,011 --> 00:13:31,852
They died tragically.

269
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:01,612
Lianxin, what do you have to say?

270
00:14:08,372 --> 00:14:11,612
I came happily

271
00:14:12,331 --> 00:14:13,372
to enjoy your liquor, Father.

272
00:14:14,092 --> 00:14:15,651
The story came as a surprise.

273
00:14:16,651 --> 00:14:17,691
It's considered a bonus.

274
00:14:19,251 --> 00:14:20,412
I'm really stunned

275
00:14:20,412 --> 00:14:22,331
by your misleading argument.

276
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,211
Anyway,

277
00:14:25,412 --> 00:14:26,451
the evidence is obvious!

278
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:28,612
You can't deny it anymore.

279
00:14:30,292 --> 00:14:31,492
I want to see

280
00:14:32,412 --> 00:14:34,251
whether you will still smile

281
00:14:34,932 --> 00:14:36,651
when Father punishes you later.

282
00:14:43,852 --> 00:14:46,331
Lianzuo, based on your view,

283
00:14:47,211 --> 00:14:48,932
how should I handle Lianxin?

284
00:14:50,092 --> 00:14:50,891
Dealing with him

285
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:52,412
is your concern, Father.

286
00:14:52,972 --> 00:14:54,532
I dare not comment on it.

287
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:57,211
So you do know your place.

288
00:14:58,651 --> 00:14:59,612
It's okay.

289
00:15:00,131 --> 00:15:00,612
Go ahead.

290
00:15:02,612 --> 00:15:03,532
I won't blame you.

291
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:08,891
I think

292
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:10,811
a request should be made

293
00:15:18,972 --> 00:15:19,852
to strip him of his title

294
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,730
and send him to the Office of Trials.

295
00:15:31,211 --> 00:15:34,092
Your Highness, I have something to say.

296
00:15:35,211 --> 00:15:35,732
Go ahead.

297
00:15:42,451 --> 00:15:43,451
I have an item here.

298
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,972
Please have a look, Your Highness.

299
00:15:53,372 --> 00:15:53,852
Report!

300
00:15:56,092 --> 00:15:57,532
Young Master, a secret letter from the spy.

301
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,880
(Wanted, Wang Wu)

302
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:09,251
What happened, Lianxiu?

303
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,080
(Wanted, Wang Wu)

304
00:16:15,732 --> 00:16:17,251
After the treasury had been robbed,

305
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:19,972
Young Master Xin was worried
about an oversight.

306
00:16:21,052 --> 00:16:21,811
He told me

307
00:16:21,811 --> 00:16:23,331
to investigate the robbers' backgrounds.

308
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,251
Coincidentally,

309
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,292
one of them was Wang Wu.

310
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,732
After investigating, I found

311
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,492
that Wang Wu
wasn't a law-abiding civilian.

312
00:16:32,651 --> 00:16:35,451
He is a murderer
absconding for more than ten years.

313
00:16:35,891 --> 00:16:36,451
What?

314
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:38,211
What do you mean?

315
00:16:39,612 --> 00:16:40,610
Wang Wu wasn't the only one.

316
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:41,972
Most of the people had

317
00:16:41,972 --> 00:16:43,172
criminal backgrounds.

318
00:16:43,412 --> 00:16:44,492
Why would

319
00:16:45,251 --> 00:16:46,972
Official Li help this kind of people?

320
00:16:47,492 --> 00:16:49,011
Why would they seek justice

321
00:16:49,011 --> 00:16:50,571
for Official Li?

322
00:16:51,292 --> 00:16:52,771
Obviously, after
the failed robbery attempt,

323
00:16:52,932 --> 00:16:54,331
he luckily escaped.

324
00:16:54,331 --> 00:16:55,691
For the sake of money,

325
00:16:58,172 --> 00:17:00,532
he turned to Young Master Zuo
and lied to him.

326
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:02,492
Since you're a killer,

327
00:17:03,011 --> 00:17:04,172
why are you still kneeling here?

328
00:17:04,852 --> 00:17:05,451
Your Highness,

329
00:17:05,451 --> 00:17:06,292
- I'm innocent.
- Take him out!

330
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,651
I'm not a killer!

331
00:17:07,852 --> 00:17:10,411
Your Highness!

332
00:17:10,732 --> 00:17:14,171
Your Highness!

333
00:17:14,931 --> 00:17:17,252
Your Highness!

334
00:17:17,492 --> 00:17:18,012
Father,

335
00:17:18,691 --> 00:17:19,691
I wasn't aware of it.

336
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:21,331
Please punish me, Father.

337
00:17:22,691 --> 00:17:23,691
Whether you should be punished

338
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,372
should be Lianxin's decision.

339
00:17:37,811 --> 00:17:38,652
Lianzuo,

340
00:17:39,211 --> 00:17:40,252
what did you say?

341
00:17:44,211 --> 00:17:45,612
Did you mention
stripping me of my title?

342
00:17:46,211 --> 00:17:47,211
Did you mention sending me

343
00:17:48,171 --> 00:17:48,990
to the Office of Trials?

344
00:18:01,492 --> 00:18:02,132
Father,

345
00:18:02,972 --> 00:18:05,331
Lianzuo cared so much about the people

346
00:18:06,092 --> 00:18:08,132
that he was tricked by the criminals.

347
00:18:09,331 --> 00:18:11,612
Father, I hope you'll
forgive him this time.

348
00:18:18,652 --> 00:18:19,211
Lianxin.

349
00:18:21,171 --> 00:18:21,931
Lianzuo.

350
00:18:23,171 --> 00:18:23,652
Father.

351
00:18:24,691 --> 00:18:25,531
Why don't you get up now

352
00:18:25,531 --> 00:18:26,612
and thank Lianxin?

353
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:31,411
I'd like to

354
00:18:32,931 --> 00:18:33,852
thank you, Lianxin.

355
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:39,531
Father,

356
00:18:41,051 --> 00:18:43,051
I've made a fool of myself today.

357
00:18:43,411 --> 00:18:44,652
I'll do a self-reflection at home.

358
00:18:45,811 --> 00:18:46,571
I'll make a move now.

359
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:56,492
Father, I'll make a move, too.

360
00:19:07,051 --> 00:19:08,492
Okay. Go back to your seats.

361
00:19:18,092 --> 00:19:18,732
Mu Tianshu.

362
00:19:20,132 --> 00:19:20,772
Your Highness.

363
00:19:21,931 --> 00:19:22,852
As for this case,

364
00:19:23,531 --> 00:19:24,451
you did a good job.

365
00:19:24,972 --> 00:19:25,852
I'd like to reward you.

366
00:19:26,492 --> 00:19:29,451
What should I reward you?

367
00:19:30,732 --> 00:19:31,772
I was just

368
00:19:31,772 --> 00:19:32,612
doing my job.

369
00:19:32,852 --> 00:19:34,331
I don't expect a reward.

370
00:19:34,411 --> 00:19:34,931
Okay.

371
00:19:35,852 --> 00:19:36,531
Okay. Sit.

372
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:38,750
Yes, Your Highness.

373
00:19:42,612 --> 00:19:43,291
Mu Haiyao.

374
00:19:52,451 --> 00:19:53,132
Yes, Your Highness.

375
00:19:54,571 --> 00:19:55,691
Didn't you say

376
00:19:56,772 --> 00:19:58,811
you liked the round fan
with peony tapestry?

377
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,331
As we know,

378
00:20:01,732 --> 00:20:03,132
the peony is the king of flowers.

379
00:20:03,892 --> 00:20:04,852
No matter what,

380
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,470
it should be presented to Madam Rui.

381
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,252
However, I really like it.

382
00:20:08,691 --> 00:20:09,811
That's why I acted recklessly.

383
00:20:10,652 --> 00:20:11,811
May you forgive me, Your Highness.

384
00:20:14,132 --> 00:20:15,732
It's just a round fan.

385
00:20:16,691 --> 00:20:17,691
Since you like it,

386
00:20:17,811 --> 00:20:19,331
I'll have another one

387
00:20:19,331 --> 00:20:21,211
specially made

388
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:23,092
with the same design for you.

389
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:24,291
What do you think?

390
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:31,252
Thank you, Your Highness.

391
00:20:31,691 --> 00:20:33,691
I was greedy at that moment,

392
00:20:34,012 --> 00:20:36,051
yet you're taking the effort to
grant my wish, Your Highness.

393
00:20:36,411 --> 00:20:37,331
In the future,

394
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:38,972
I'll do my best

395
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:39,772
to serve Young Master

396
00:20:40,571 --> 00:20:41,772
to repay your benevolence.

397
00:20:43,171 --> 00:20:44,811
Okay. Good.

398
00:20:48,092 --> 00:20:49,732
So you shall present this round fan

399
00:20:50,331 --> 00:20:51,252
to Madam Rui.

400
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:10,291
Sure.

401
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:18,372
Huairui,

402
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:20,092
I was wilful.

403
00:21:20,372 --> 00:21:21,451
I hope you won't mind.

404
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:23,291
We're like sisters.

405
00:21:23,652 --> 00:21:25,571
Don't sound like a stranger.

406
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:12,132
What have you done?

407
00:22:12,691 --> 00:22:14,360
His Highness has offered you
boundless privilege.

408
00:22:14,411 --> 00:22:15,531
Can't you even tolerate

409
00:22:15,531 --> 00:22:16,451
equal treatment?

410
00:22:18,852 --> 00:22:19,331
I...

411
00:22:20,492 --> 00:22:21,012
Your Highness,

412
00:22:23,132 --> 00:22:24,132
I didn't do anything.

413
00:22:24,252 --> 00:22:25,012
I didn't know about it.

414
00:22:28,892 --> 00:22:29,571
If you didn't do it,

415
00:22:30,571 --> 00:22:31,252
why

416
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,012
would the fan have broken?

417
00:22:33,972 --> 00:22:35,931
Your Highness, I swear

418
00:22:36,132 --> 00:22:37,051
I didn't do anything.

419
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:39,171
I don't know how it happened.

420
00:22:39,772 --> 00:22:42,652
I shouldn't have trusted you just now.

421
00:22:43,092 --> 00:22:44,372
What else do you want?

422
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:51,571
How come Lianxin

423
00:22:52,211 --> 00:22:53,972
has a jealous concubine like you?

424
00:22:59,051 --> 00:22:59,612
Lianxin.

425
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:06,132
Father.

426
00:23:06,732 --> 00:23:07,570
You will deal with her.

427
00:23:09,171 --> 00:23:09,652
Okay.

428
00:23:12,772 --> 00:23:13,270
Your Highness,

429
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,051
Haiyao is young and ignorant.

430
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,830
She has just given birth to
a child of the He family.

431
00:23:16,852 --> 00:23:17,772
- Please...
- Mu Tianshu.

432
00:23:18,571 --> 00:23:20,612
I've just rewarded you.

433
00:23:21,331 --> 00:23:23,012
Do you think you're
above everyone else now?

434
00:23:23,211 --> 00:23:24,492
No, I don't!

435
00:23:34,531 --> 00:23:35,211
Lianxin.

436
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:45,931
Side concubine, Mu Haiyao,

437
00:23:46,571 --> 00:23:48,811
is unreasonable, jealous,
indecorous and immoral.

438
00:23:49,372 --> 00:23:50,372
Demote her to a commoner.

439
00:23:51,732 --> 00:23:54,132
She'll settle down in the residence
of the southern outskirts.

440
00:24:21,531 --> 00:24:22,571
Today is full-moon day.

441
00:24:23,411 --> 00:24:24,892
It's like the day Hui'er died.

442
00:24:25,012 --> 00:24:26,612
It's been long since you
last mentioned Hui'er.

443
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:28,772
I thought you've forgotten.

444
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:31,092
When did you figure out

445
00:24:31,892 --> 00:24:33,092
my father's intention?

446
00:24:35,411 --> 00:24:37,252
I didn't figure it out.

447
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:38,652
I guessed it.

448
00:24:40,531 --> 00:24:41,772
I've said that

449
00:24:41,972 --> 00:24:44,270
Prince An wants you
to be the third most powerful man,

450
00:24:44,892 --> 00:24:46,571
but the achievement of collecting debts

451
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:47,492
is too minor

452
00:24:47,492 --> 00:24:48,852
to give you a strong foothold.

453
00:24:50,372 --> 00:24:51,691
To rise to power,

454
00:24:51,931 --> 00:24:53,612
you must have adherents standing by you.

455
00:24:54,211 --> 00:24:54,732
This

456
00:24:54,892 --> 00:24:56,171
must've crossed the prince's mind.

457
00:24:56,772 --> 00:24:57,372
So,

458
00:24:57,531 --> 00:24:58,531
the cultivation of adherents

459
00:24:58,811 --> 00:25:00,492
is what the prince tacitly approves.

460
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,331
As for how strong the adherents can be,

461
00:25:03,331 --> 00:25:05,252
he must be in control.

462
00:25:05,811 --> 00:25:06,772
The group can't be so weak

463
00:25:06,852 --> 00:25:09,012
that it can't match the two
forces in strength.

464
00:25:09,372 --> 00:25:10,531
Neither can the group be

465
00:25:10,772 --> 00:25:11,811
so close to you

466
00:25:12,092 --> 00:25:13,331
that it can't be controlled.

467
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:14,252
So,

468
00:25:14,691 --> 00:25:16,931
while the prince is
supporting your adherents,

469
00:25:17,372 --> 00:25:18,691
he would surely find

470
00:25:19,092 --> 00:25:19,972
something for repression.

471
00:25:20,492 --> 00:25:21,732
If your adherent was

472
00:25:22,051 --> 00:25:22,892
Official Mu,

473
00:25:23,132 --> 00:25:23,931
the manipulated one

474
00:25:24,171 --> 00:25:26,132
would conveniently be Madam Yao.

475
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:27,892
Once she is no longer

476
00:25:27,892 --> 00:25:28,892
your concubine,

477
00:25:28,972 --> 00:25:29,652
Official Mu

478
00:25:29,811 --> 00:25:30,772
surely won't be

479
00:25:30,772 --> 00:25:32,252
like Yuan Baili.

480
00:25:36,892 --> 00:25:38,492
So you pretended

481
00:25:38,852 --> 00:25:39,892
to side with Mu Haiyao

482
00:25:41,012 --> 00:25:42,612
and helped her to promote Mu Tianshu.

483
00:25:43,372 --> 00:25:44,171
By doing so,

484
00:25:45,732 --> 00:25:47,411
not only the adherent can be cultivated,

485
00:25:47,772 --> 00:25:49,171
we can also use my father

486
00:25:50,372 --> 00:25:51,012
to get rid of her.

487
00:25:58,092 --> 00:25:58,652
Go on.

488
00:26:01,531 --> 00:26:02,092
Go on.

489
00:26:06,171 --> 00:26:07,211
When the prince offered us

490
00:26:07,211 --> 00:26:08,252
the round fans,

491
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:09,852
I knew that

492
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,691
Madam Yao's round fan

493
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:13,211
had most likely been tampered with.

494
00:26:13,892 --> 00:26:15,372
How did my father guess

495
00:26:15,652 --> 00:26:16,931
or how could he be sure that

496
00:26:17,211 --> 00:26:18,372
Haiyao would fight

497
00:26:18,372 --> 00:26:19,132
for the peony pattern?

498
00:26:19,691 --> 00:26:20,571
He didn't make a guess.

499
00:26:21,171 --> 00:26:22,670
Guessing isn't based
on reasonable grounds.

500
00:26:22,931 --> 00:26:24,012
Instead, understanding a person

501
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,331
and leading him or her slowly

502
00:26:25,331 --> 00:26:26,772
to a certain path

503
00:26:26,892 --> 00:26:27,931
is based on knowledge.

504
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,811
Madam Yao's elder brother gained power.

505
00:26:29,811 --> 00:26:30,892
She gave birth to a son.

506
00:26:30,892 --> 00:26:32,372
At this point of favourable conditions,

507
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:35,411
how could she miss
the chance to gain more?

508
00:26:35,852 --> 00:26:36,411
So,

509
00:26:36,811 --> 00:26:38,571
the prince had never made guesses.

510
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:40,652
He just knew.

511
00:26:44,411 --> 00:26:45,451
You think

512
00:26:46,211 --> 00:26:47,652
you're in control,

513
00:26:48,492 --> 00:26:49,252
but you don't know that

514
00:26:50,092 --> 00:26:51,171
the one in full control

515
00:26:51,852 --> 00:26:52,892
has always been the prince.

516
00:26:59,092 --> 00:26:59,892
However, you

517
00:27:02,252 --> 00:27:03,291
knew about it all along.

518
00:27:07,372 --> 00:27:08,190
Since when did you know?

519
00:27:10,852 --> 00:27:12,451
I think I've talked too much.

520
00:27:12,852 --> 00:27:13,892
I should return.

521
00:27:17,652 --> 00:27:18,612
Since when?

522
00:27:21,612 --> 00:27:22,372
I did since you and I

523
00:27:22,372 --> 00:27:23,652
came back from the prince's mansion.

524
00:27:26,571 --> 00:27:27,492
I heard

525
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:29,331
the prince mentioning Yuan Baili.

526
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:31,772
His tone was tinged with dislike.

527
00:27:32,331 --> 00:27:33,571
I didn't know at the time.

528
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:35,252
Later, I remembered

529
00:27:35,252 --> 00:27:36,772
Ms. Jinfang had said that

530
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:39,252
after the late princess consort
married the prince,

531
00:27:40,331 --> 00:27:41,732
she started avoiding her family.

532
00:27:42,331 --> 00:27:44,852
The late princess consort had not
been close to her family.

533
00:27:45,171 --> 00:27:46,372
After marrying the prince,

534
00:27:46,612 --> 00:27:48,012
she distanced herself even more.

535
00:27:48,772 --> 00:27:49,612
Why?

536
00:27:50,331 --> 00:27:51,451
The prince

537
00:27:52,331 --> 00:27:53,372
is fair in handling matters.

538
00:27:53,892 --> 00:27:55,560
He's seldom influenced
by personal relationships.

539
00:27:56,211 --> 00:27:57,331
To him,

540
00:27:58,451 --> 00:27:59,772
some relationships

541
00:28:01,092 --> 00:28:02,772
are better distant than close.

542
00:28:03,811 --> 00:28:04,772
From then on,

543
00:28:05,211 --> 00:28:06,012
I've realised

544
00:28:06,531 --> 00:28:07,691
the prince has always disliked

545
00:28:08,092 --> 00:28:09,531
nepotism.

546
00:28:16,691 --> 00:28:18,012
I asked Ms. Jinfang

547
00:28:19,171 --> 00:28:20,972
to teach you to speculate
my father's thoughts,

548
00:28:23,132 --> 00:28:24,652
but I never thought

549
00:28:26,492 --> 00:28:27,451
you'd use the knowledge

550
00:28:27,451 --> 00:28:28,531
to defeat my woman.

551
00:28:33,171 --> 00:28:34,531
I acted on my own.

552
00:28:34,811 --> 00:28:35,870
Please punish me, Young Master.

553
00:28:35,972 --> 00:28:36,920
What should I punish you for?

554
00:28:36,931 --> 00:28:38,331
What exactly should I punish you for?

555
00:28:39,012 --> 00:28:40,250
For helping me to cultivate adherents?

556
00:28:41,691 --> 00:28:42,211
For helping me

557
00:28:43,331 --> 00:28:44,492
to seek revenge for my son's death?

558
00:28:46,051 --> 00:28:46,612
Girl,

559
00:28:47,732 --> 00:28:48,531
what you did

560
00:28:49,931 --> 00:28:51,372
was what I'd wanted,

561
00:28:51,372 --> 00:28:52,211
but weren't able to do

562
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:53,732
or couldn't do.

563
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:54,451
Girl,

564
00:28:54,451 --> 00:28:55,691
in fact, you

565
00:28:56,012 --> 00:28:56,571
didn't have to

566
00:28:57,691 --> 00:28:58,772
confess this to me.

567
00:28:58,972 --> 00:29:00,051
Even if I forced you,

568
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:02,372
you could've chosen to hide it from me.

569
00:29:04,092 --> 00:29:04,571
Girl,

570
00:29:08,211 --> 00:29:09,372
I understand what you think.

571
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:12,972
I understand.

572
00:29:15,892 --> 00:29:16,531
Since

573
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:18,772
you don't blame me,

574
00:29:18,772 --> 00:29:19,531
I shall...

575
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,252
You understand my father.

576
00:29:25,811 --> 00:29:26,571
What about me?

577
00:29:28,772 --> 00:29:30,331
You've drunk too much
at the prince's mansion.

578
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:31,691
I'm afraid you're drunk.

579
00:29:35,092 --> 00:29:35,612
You're right.

580
00:29:37,811 --> 00:29:38,691
I'm drunk.

581
00:29:41,372 --> 00:29:42,811
Since long ago,

582
00:29:43,691 --> 00:29:46,012
I've aimed to become
Prince An of the country.

583
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,652
For more than twenty years,

584
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:48,931
everything I've done

585
00:29:48,931 --> 00:29:50,892
is a stepping stone to the aim.

586
00:29:52,051 --> 00:29:52,652
Perhaps,

587
00:29:54,171 --> 00:29:56,132
the liquor today was so strong

588
00:29:57,051 --> 00:29:58,492
that my drunkenness makes me delirious.

589
00:29:59,252 --> 00:30:00,291
No. I would say

590
00:30:00,531 --> 00:30:01,811
I've been drunk for decades.

591
00:30:01,931 --> 00:30:02,571
I've never been

592
00:30:02,571 --> 00:30:03,931
as sober as I am now.

593
00:30:06,051 --> 00:30:06,972
I even feel that

594
00:30:07,811 --> 00:30:08,732
if we

595
00:30:10,051 --> 00:30:10,972
could become

596
00:30:11,652 --> 00:30:13,012
a normal married couple,

597
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,411
even without inheriting the royal title,

598
00:30:16,972 --> 00:30:18,772
I wouldn't regret it.

599
00:30:22,451 --> 00:30:23,531
I, Luo Qinglian,

600
00:30:24,051 --> 00:30:25,211
swear to the moon that

601
00:30:27,012 --> 00:30:29,132
if I don't help Lv Beiyi
abolish low-caste identity,

602
00:30:30,331 --> 00:30:31,811
I won't live as a human.

603
00:30:36,571 --> 00:30:37,451
You're wrong, Young Master.

604
00:30:38,772 --> 00:30:40,211
I'm not the one you want.

605
00:30:40,331 --> 00:30:41,652
I know my desires.

606
00:30:43,012 --> 00:30:43,612
What about you?

607
00:30:45,531 --> 00:30:46,531
What do you want?

608
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:54,012
Do you really want to know?

609
00:30:54,612 --> 00:30:55,331
In this world,

610
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:56,732
what do you think I

611
00:30:56,732 --> 00:30:57,510
can't afford to offer,

612
00:30:57,931 --> 00:30:58,892
especially for you, girl?

613
00:30:58,892 --> 00:31:00,211
I can offer anything you want.

614
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:01,211
Side consort?

615
00:31:02,171 --> 00:31:02,732
Primary consort?

616
00:31:03,811 --> 00:31:05,372
I can offer you anything you want.

617
00:31:08,691 --> 00:31:09,811
I'd like you to

618
00:31:11,451 --> 00:31:12,852
recruit Lv Beiyi as your adviser.

619
00:31:14,451 --> 00:31:15,811
Lv Beiyi is a versatile man.

620
00:31:16,171 --> 00:31:17,291
He can definitely become

621
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:18,051
your right-hand man.

622
00:31:19,571 --> 00:31:20,051
Also,

623
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:21,772
the state he's in now

624
00:31:22,492 --> 00:31:23,451
was caused by you.

625
00:31:37,132 --> 00:31:38,411
Is this what you want?

626
00:31:39,852 --> 00:31:41,252
Is this your intent?

627
00:31:43,732 --> 00:31:44,612
At this point,

628
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:46,291
you still think about Lv Beiyi.

629
00:31:46,652 --> 00:31:48,252
It was my original aim.

630
00:31:49,531 --> 00:31:50,811
We had a deal.

631
00:31:51,852 --> 00:31:52,691
You've just forgotten.

632
00:31:55,571 --> 00:31:56,171
Excuse me.

633
00:32:15,331 --> 00:32:16,171
It was a deal to you.

634
00:32:47,451 --> 00:32:48,811
I hadn't come here for many days.

635
00:32:49,132 --> 00:32:50,571
There're no changes.

636
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:52,960
How come there're no changes?

637
00:32:53,411 --> 00:32:54,772
When you came last time,

638
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:56,092
you looked sad,

639
00:32:56,132 --> 00:32:57,931
but you're smiling now.

640
00:32:58,732 --> 00:32:59,972
Young girl,

641
00:33:00,092 --> 00:33:01,211
you kept it from us.

642
00:33:01,972 --> 00:33:04,012
If not for Madam's observation tonight,

643
00:33:04,171 --> 00:33:04,931
we wouldn't

644
00:33:04,931 --> 00:33:06,372
have stopped blaming you.

645
00:33:09,451 --> 00:33:10,772
I was just taking risk.

646
00:33:11,451 --> 00:33:12,612
I wasn't confident.

647
00:33:12,852 --> 00:33:13,732
I wouldn't want you

648
00:33:13,972 --> 00:33:15,211
to worry.

649
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:16,732
Also,

650
00:33:16,732 --> 00:33:18,931
Mu Haiyao is very skeptical.

651
00:33:19,772 --> 00:33:21,132
If I couldn't even hide it from you,

652
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:22,291
how could I trick her?

653
00:33:33,691 --> 00:33:36,051
I'd like to thank you for Hui'er.

654
00:33:36,852 --> 00:33:39,652
If I hadn't told Hui'er about Snowball,

655
00:33:41,691 --> 00:33:42,531
Hui'er might not have

656
00:33:42,531 --> 00:33:44,252
died at Langyue Hall.

657
00:33:47,811 --> 00:33:48,772
I must resolve

658
00:33:50,092 --> 00:33:51,092
what I caused earlier on.

659
00:33:55,171 --> 00:33:55,772
By the way,

660
00:34:01,892 --> 00:34:03,012
Hui'er's bangle

661
00:34:04,571 --> 00:34:05,451
will be returned to you.

662
00:34:35,652 --> 00:34:36,531
Thanks.

663
00:34:38,731 --> 00:34:39,612
Thanks.

664
00:34:45,892 --> 00:34:47,291
You've changed a lot.

665
00:34:49,652 --> 00:34:51,212
I remember when I first met you,

666
00:34:52,011 --> 00:34:53,291
you didn't believe in fate.

667
00:34:55,172 --> 00:34:56,212
I still don't believe in it.

668
00:34:56,731 --> 00:34:57,571
I believe in debts.

669
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:07,172
We'll live our lives peacefully.

670
00:35:07,612 --> 00:35:09,092
You seem to have
forgotten about a person.

671
00:35:09,811 --> 00:35:10,372
Who's that?

672
00:35:10,612 --> 00:35:11,491
Young Master.

673
00:35:16,412 --> 00:35:17,771
We can live a quiet life.

674
00:35:18,852 --> 00:35:19,811
Whether we live peacefully

675
00:35:21,571 --> 00:35:22,971
depends on our hearts.

676
00:35:40,212 --> 00:35:42,452
I'm seeking shelter
from you, Young Master Xin.

677
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:45,811
What brings you here, Young Master?

678
00:35:46,212 --> 00:35:47,051
I'm here for a test.

679
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:53,892
Mei'er, I won't lose out to Lianxin.

680
00:35:54,412 --> 00:35:56,491
Mei'er, don't leave me.

681
00:35:56,892 --> 00:35:57,412
Mei'er.

682
00:35:57,971 --> 00:35:59,011
Mei'er, don't leave me.

683
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:00,692
Mei'er.

684
00:36:00,852 --> 00:36:02,291
Young Master.

685
00:36:05,771 --> 00:36:06,692
Lianxin is here.

686
00:36:17,932 --> 00:36:19,412
Lianxin, good morning.

687
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:20,932
Good morning, Lianxiu.

688
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:28,051
I'm envious.

689
00:36:29,172 --> 00:36:31,771
Since I started collecting
debts for the treasury,

690
00:36:31,932 --> 00:36:33,412
I haven't been as lucky

691
00:36:33,412 --> 00:36:34,331
as you to get

692
00:36:34,491 --> 00:36:35,652
drunk overnight.

693
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,452
Didn't Father host

694
00:36:38,452 --> 00:36:39,892
a celebration for you yesterday?

695
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:40,830
What happened?

696
00:36:41,212 --> 00:36:43,452
Did you help Father to save his liquor?

697
00:36:44,331 --> 00:36:46,331
Father's liquor was not nice.

698
00:36:47,132 --> 00:36:49,731
The collected debts were
just enough for flood prevention.

699
00:36:50,132 --> 00:36:51,452
Compared to the total debt,

700
00:36:51,452 --> 00:36:52,510
we still have a long way to go.

701
00:36:53,132 --> 00:36:55,372
Unfortunately, I'm stupid.

702
00:36:55,932 --> 00:36:57,180
Debt collection doesn't suit for me.

703
00:36:57,412 --> 00:36:58,092
Otherwise,

704
00:36:58,491 --> 00:37:00,251
I could've shared the burden with you.

705
00:37:03,212 --> 00:37:04,652
Do you really want to help me?

706
00:37:05,372 --> 00:37:05,852
Of course.

707
00:37:11,852 --> 00:37:13,412
You're the most loyal.

708
00:37:14,452 --> 00:37:14,932
Come on.

709
00:37:15,011 --> 00:37:15,852
Come on.

710
00:37:19,892 --> 00:37:20,571
What's this?

711
00:37:21,971 --> 00:37:22,932
This is

712
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:25,051
the ledger.

713
00:37:30,011 --> 00:37:30,892
Ledger?

714
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,270
(Unpaid)

715
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,060
(820,000 tales in total)

716
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:40,771
Are these debts?

717
00:37:41,251 --> 00:37:42,331
Exactly. Money is owed.

718
00:37:42,852 --> 00:37:44,051
Don't you want to help me?

719
00:37:44,331 --> 00:37:45,030
You can pay it back.

720
00:37:58,531 --> 00:38:00,051
You said you weren't drunk.

721
00:38:00,251 --> 00:38:00,932
I think

722
00:38:00,932 --> 00:38:02,212
you're so drunk that you're confused.

723
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:06,011
Do you see

724
00:38:06,132 --> 00:38:07,051
how stupid I am?

725
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:10,011
I didn't know I took
out the wrong thing.

726
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:11,571
I was very confused.

727
00:38:16,331 --> 00:38:18,291
I was supposed to take this out.

728
00:38:18,852 --> 00:38:22,491
Do you recognise this?

729
00:38:30,932 --> 00:38:31,892
You know,

730
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:35,372
Official Li

731
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,212
died tragically.

732
00:38:37,412 --> 00:38:38,132
I

733
00:38:38,132 --> 00:38:39,372
made a lot of effort

734
00:38:39,571 --> 00:38:40,692
to find his killer.

735
00:38:43,051 --> 00:38:43,971
Do you know the outcome?

736
00:38:44,692 --> 00:38:45,811
He said

737
00:38:46,212 --> 00:38:48,331
you ordered him.

738
00:38:51,692 --> 00:38:52,771
Did I?

739
00:38:53,811 --> 00:38:54,892
That's ridiculous!

740
00:38:55,692 --> 00:38:57,291
That's ridiculous!

741
00:38:58,051 --> 00:38:59,011
Yesterday, Lianzuo,

742
00:38:59,011 --> 00:39:01,011
cornered me in front of Father.

743
00:39:01,011 --> 00:39:02,531
but I didn't identify the culprit.

744
00:39:02,571 --> 00:39:03,612
Lianzuo isn't mature.

745
00:39:08,892 --> 00:39:11,892
Did you mean the person is still alive?

746
00:39:11,892 --> 00:39:12,771
He is.

747
00:39:15,132 --> 00:39:16,212
So,

748
00:39:16,892 --> 00:39:17,971
why didn't you summon him?

749
00:39:19,412 --> 00:39:21,291
Do you want me to summon him?

750
00:39:25,652 --> 00:39:26,731
To be honest with you,

751
00:39:27,612 --> 00:39:30,331
the job related to the treasury
is driving me crazy.

752
00:39:30,491 --> 00:39:31,571
To me,

753
00:39:31,571 --> 00:39:33,692
completing the job
is the most important matter.

754
00:39:33,892 --> 00:39:34,612
Also,

755
00:39:34,892 --> 00:39:36,692
I'm giving you a chance to offer help.

756
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:43,852
Since you're not bothered,

757
00:39:48,491 --> 00:39:49,412
we shall

758
00:39:50,092 --> 00:39:51,372
see each other at the mansion.

759
00:39:53,212 --> 00:39:54,212
Hang on, Lianxin.

760
00:40:03,011 --> 00:40:04,291
Your good intent

761
00:40:04,971 --> 00:40:06,291
shouldn't be underappreciated.

762
00:40:07,051 --> 00:40:08,132
However, you know

763
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:09,412
I'm stupid.

764
00:40:09,652 --> 00:40:10,652
I'm poor.

765
00:40:11,051 --> 00:40:11,971
I can't contribute

766
00:40:11,971 --> 00:40:12,652
so much money.

767
00:40:12,932 --> 00:40:14,692
Can't you contribute that much?

768
00:40:16,571 --> 00:40:17,452
Then it's troublesome.

769
00:40:25,251 --> 00:40:25,932
Lianxiu,

770
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:31,811
this is good writing.

771
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:34,692
Without virtue,
one grows old shamefully.

772
00:40:34,771 --> 00:40:37,531
May virtue be protected like money.

773
00:40:38,491 --> 00:40:40,251
Well-said!

774
00:40:40,932 --> 00:40:42,491
It suits a virtuous master

775
00:40:42,971 --> 00:40:45,452
like you.

776
00:40:46,531 --> 00:40:47,490
Thanks for your compliment.

777
00:40:50,251 --> 00:40:52,932
The verses are well-written.

778
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:56,771
It's a pity that it's not authentic.

779
00:40:57,731 --> 00:41:00,892
This is the mansion of General Xiu.

780
00:41:01,132 --> 00:41:02,092
Having this here

781
00:41:03,531 --> 00:41:06,692
reflects poor taste.

782
00:41:08,852 --> 00:41:09,692
Lianxiu,

783
00:41:10,011 --> 00:41:11,251
don't you have a book titled

784
00:41:11,251 --> 00:41:12,811
"The Ode to the Goddess of the Luo River"?

785
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:19,372
Also "Dancing and Singing"
and "The Towering Clouds".

786
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:20,571
Show them to me.

787
00:41:26,011 --> 00:41:27,531
Lianxiu, do you know

788
00:41:27,531 --> 00:41:29,652
a weird incident has happened
in Quliang recently?

789
00:41:30,811 --> 00:41:31,971
To repay their debts,

790
00:41:32,132 --> 00:41:33,270
high-ranking and powerful officials

791
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,811
took out their antiques

792
00:41:35,051 --> 00:41:36,212
and sold them at the lowest prices

793
00:41:36,212 --> 00:41:37,251
at Baizhen Alley.

794
00:41:38,132 --> 00:41:38,892
Unexpectedly,

795
00:41:38,892 --> 00:41:40,092
after they were
taken into the shop,

796
00:41:41,172 --> 00:41:42,450
they were taken away by someone else.

797
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:45,971
I was curious.

798
00:41:45,971 --> 00:41:47,132
So I investigated.

799
00:41:47,452 --> 00:41:48,932
Surprisingly, the antiques

800
00:41:49,892 --> 00:41:51,491
were moved to a residence.

801
00:41:53,172 --> 00:41:55,652
Which residence is it?
Whose residence is it?

802
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,270
Do you want to find out with me?
