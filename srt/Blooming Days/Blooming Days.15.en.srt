00:01:50,029 --> 00:01:51,590
Dongli, I think you dropped something.

18
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,230
What's this?

19
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:13,669
Father, it's...

20
00:02:15,109 --> 00:02:16,880
What are you planning to do
by preparing these things?

21
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:23,120
Your Highness, please calm down.

22
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,680
I was the one who prepared it.

23
00:02:27,749 --> 00:02:28,430
You?

24
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,630
Why did you...

25
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:33,550
Do you want to leave Quliang?

26
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,800
Your Highness, please forgive me.

27
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,830
Indeed,

28
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:41,710
I want to leave with my child.

29
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:44,830
Why?

30
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,480
Forgive me, Your Highness.

31
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:54,190
I only want

32
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,589
this child

33
00:02:56,589 --> 00:02:57,910
to live a peaceful life.

34
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:43,350
Lian,

35
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:46,109
do you like these lotus flowers?

36
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,309
There are many kinds of flowers
in the world.

37
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:54,229
But the lotus

38
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:56,350
is my favorite.

39
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:59,749
I knew you'd like it too.

40
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,229
I won't force you to stay.

41
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,509
Father!

42
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,750
(I'm certain)

43
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:29,310
(this baby is going to be a boy.)

44
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,069
Your Highness,

45
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,870
please give me some time.

46
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,789
You're so clueless.

47
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,430
Where do you think
your power comes from?

48
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,189
Prince An has been favoring you
for many years

49
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,310
because you're

50
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,830
the late princess consort's only child.

51
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:12,430
But now, everyone knows

52
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,229
that Luo Qinglian is a substitute
for the late princess consort.

53
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,270
What about her child?

54
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,389
You already have a high probability

55
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:24,949
of inheriting the title.

56
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:25,870
But now,

57
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,789
I'm afraid your future is unpredictable.

58
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,870
Why do you keep looking at me like that?

59
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,949
I just want to see

60
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:55,509
how unfathomable your heart is.

61
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,750
No matter how unfathomable it is,

62
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,710
it still can't beat your perceptiveness.

63
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:10,150
Girl, the truth is...

64
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,189
He Lianxin,

65
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,870
you don't even spare a child.

66
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:23,949
What else can't you use
for your benefit?

67
00:06:27,109 --> 00:06:27,669
You're right.

68
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,750
I intentionally wanted Father to know

69
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,310
you're pregnant to make him visit.

70
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,550
So he can stop you from leaving.

71
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:35,150
Girl,

72
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,349
you have your way
of protecting the child.

73
00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:40,789
But don't forget

74
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,349
that the child also has me
as his father.

75
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:43,750
My protection

76
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,949
for him

77
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:47,870
is to let him be born safely

78
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,389
and grow up happily.

79
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,270
Ever since I was young,

80
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,310
there's no emotion I can't control.

81
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:57,909
But when you passed out,

82
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:58,949
I was so nervous

83
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:00,150
that my palms were sweaty.

84
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,310
I've never been afraid.

85
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:05,789
Even when a knife is held
against my throat,

86
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:07,430
I wouldn't even bat an eye.

87
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,830
But now,

88
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,990
I'm getting more and more scared.

89
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:16,150
I'm afraid when I lose the child,

90
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,990
I will lose you too.

91
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:22,229
Girl,

92
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,030
I think...

93
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:29,629
I think I've truly

94
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:30,750
fallen for you.

It wasn't easy to leave the mansion.
I'm sorry to have made you wait.

no longer a performer.

Madam Mo.

113
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:31,150

Why is she afraid of Li Qianmo?

124
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,230
Ms. Lian, here's the medicine
for your pregnancy.

125
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,910
(I'm getting more and more scared.)

126
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,910
I'm afraid when I lose the child,

127
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,910
I will lose you too.

129
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:24,910
(I think)

130
00:10:24,989 --> 00:10:26,150
(I've truly fallen for you.)

131
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,150
Ms. Lian.

132
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:43,830
I...

133
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:46,710
Ms. Lian,

134
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:49,309
Young Master

135
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:51,470
may have gone overboard in the past.

136
00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:53,309
But he has been treating you
very well lately.

137
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,230
Putting aside all the gifts he bestowed,

138
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:56,549
just his effort alone

139
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,760
when he runs to Lianwei House
eight times a day is enough.

140
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,160
No matter what you needed,
food or drink,

141
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,400
as long as you thought about it,

142
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,790
he would have them delivered instantly.

143
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:06,030
Not even the most filial child
can be compared to him.

144
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,680
You comment anyhow you wish.

145
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,869
Aren't you afraid of being punished?

146
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:12,470
Please take your medicine.

147
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,920
(Lianwei House)

148
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,230
Rong,

149
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,509
look at this.

150
00:11:24,869 --> 00:11:25,470
What do you think?

151
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:29,270
Your stitches aren't as tight.

152
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:31,560
Look at my needlework.

153
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:35,400
It should be sewn this way.

154
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:36,989
Ms. Lian! Ms. Lian!

155
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,920
Young Master sent someone
to deliver gifts again.

156
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,320
It's a box of blood bird's nest this time.

157
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,200
Where should I place them?

158
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,749
No need.

159
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:43,189
Just send them to Liuyun Cottage.

160
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:44,189
No, thank you.

161
00:11:44,749 --> 00:11:46,429
Liuyun Cottage has limited space.

162
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,160
It's already packed to the brim there.

163
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:49,309
Those who don't know

164
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:50,880
would think I'm the one who's pregnant.

165
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:52,230
Well, that's right.

166
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,350
Ms. Lian, these are blood bird's nests

167
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:55,429
we're talking about.

168
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,350
How many swallows
must have spat out blood

169
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,280
to produce this little amount
of blood bird's nests?

170
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:00,030
Who told you

171
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,800
a blood bird's nest is produced
from a swallow's blood?

172
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,270
Wasn't it?

173
00:12:04,869 --> 00:12:05,989
Since you turn them down,

174
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:07,309
then we'll keep them.

175
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:09,110
Wait.

176
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:12,869
Rong,

177
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:14,670
it must be tiring to just sit around.

178
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,670
Why don't we go to Qiyan Tower?

179
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,790
I want to be alone.

180
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,389
You can go back now.

181
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,790
Lately, your health is...

182
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:38,389
I should come with you.

183
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,989
At least, I can watch over you.

184
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,309
I'm fine. Just go back.

185
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,160
She didn't tell you where she's going
and you didn't even follow her?

186
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,309
We wanted to go with her.

187
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:22,389
Madam Rou's health has been...

188
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,309
Is Madam Rou ill?

189
00:13:28,989 --> 00:13:30,270
Thank you for your concern, Ms. Lian.

190
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:31,270
Madam

191
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,549
only caught a cold.

192
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:33,749
It's not anything serious.

193
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:36,710
Didn't Huafu say

194
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,910
that she had a cold?

195
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,629
If it was a simple cold,

196
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:43,389
why did she cut off Lin Zhao's word
in such a hurry?

197
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,710
Madam Rou has always been
a tough person.

198
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:48,910
Perhaps she just didn't want
to cause a fuss.

199
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:50,910
But I don't think it's that simple.

200
00:13:51,989 --> 00:13:54,230
We may have been spending time together.

201
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,069
But I still think

202
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:57,949
Xu Jirou is hard to read

203
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:59,989
and not trustworthy.

204
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:02,309
Especially when I remember

205
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:05,110
how ruthless she was
when she joined hands with Mu Haiyao

206
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,949
to go against you,

207
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,710
it still gives me chills.

208
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:11,110
That was all in the past.

209
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:15,549
Lian'er,

210
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:17,670
are you...

211
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,150
Rong, you're the closest person to me

212
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:26,429
in this mansion.

213
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,150
If Madam Rou

214
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,350
is on our side,

215
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,480
wouldn't it be better

216
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,960
for the three of us
to have each other's back?

217
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,150
Do you think

218
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,790
I'm jealous because you're nice to her?

219
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:40,030
Well...

220
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:41,150
I know.

221
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,189
You've always been
more thorough than I am.

222
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,509
What use is there for me to worry?

223
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,910
You're now with child.

224
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,509
So you should get more rest.

225
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:56,309
Zhihui, let's go back.

226
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,470
Ms. Rong looks sad.

227
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:09,670
I said something that upset her.

228
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,069
I'll apologize to her another day.

229
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,509
Ms. Lian,

230
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,230
do you really think Ms. Rong

231
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,470
is worried over nothing?

232
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:19,189
Huafu's behavior was indeed suspicious.

233
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:20,350
Besides,

234
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,749
Madam Rou has always been cunning

235
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,830
and ruthless.

236
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:25,309
There's nothing wrong

237
00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:26,309
for Rong to think that way.

238
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,790
If you think the same,

239
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:29,150
why are you still...

240
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:34,389
I don't know why.

241
00:15:36,189 --> 00:15:37,150
But I can't help feeling

242
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,189
that Madam Rou is straightforward

243
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:40,360
and someone with principle.

244
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:41,960
She doesn't seem like a devious person.

245
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,030
Even though

246
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,189
she's cold and distant now,

247
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,629
it's better
than her previous deceitful behavior.

248
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:52,309
It feels like
we're truly getting closer now.

249
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:53,869
Well, time reveals true character.

250
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:56,030
I hope you are right about her.

251
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,790
What a fool.

252
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,069
Who do you mean?

253
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:20,270
Greetings, Madam.

254
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:24,710
It's a hot day today.

255
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,670
But I'm wearing

256
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,549
thick clothing

257
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,030
and now hiding from the sun.

258
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:29,549
Isn't that foolish of me?

259
00:16:30,869 --> 00:16:32,110
So you were talking about yourself.

260
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:34,520
Well, you're right about that.

261
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,869
You're wearing too much clothing.

262
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,869
I didn't notice it got torn.

263
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,670
I've completely

264
00:16:48,869 --> 00:16:50,429
embarrassed myself before you.

265
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,590
Next time,

266
00:16:51,629 --> 00:16:52,670
I'll be more careful.

267
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,230
Rou, feel free to leave.

268
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:06,590
I heard

269
00:17:06,749 --> 00:17:07,590
she's been getting close

270
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,629
to those from Lianwei House.

271
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,669
That's right.

272
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:11,350
I also find it strange.

273
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,789
Weren't they enemies?

274
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,789
How did they become friends

275
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:16,149
as soon as Mu Haiyao left?

276
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,949
Birds of a feather

277
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,549
sure flock together.

278
00:17:28,149 --> 00:17:29,429
I just can't stand people

279
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,309
like these.

280
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,590
Since you can't stand it,

281
00:17:34,149 --> 00:17:34,990
I can just leave.

282
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,230
Stop right there.

283
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,870
Madam Rou,

284
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:45,029
I didn't expect
you can be this submissive for once.

285
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:46,630
Before, when you were with Mu Haiyao,

286
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,390
you wouldn't even glance at me.

287
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,630
So tell me,

288
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,429
where did all your arrogance go?

289
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,309
What is so funny?

290
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,429
It's funny

291
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,830
because I still
don't look directly at you.

292
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,230
Why you!

293
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:03,400
Since we're doing this
for our self-interests,

294
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:05,710
no need to display your authority
as a side consort.

295
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:07,029
I may be under your control.

296
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,470
But it doesn't mean I'm scared of you.

297
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,280
I gave her a standing screen
with Su embroidery the other day.

298
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:15,269
Yesterday,

299
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,189
I gave her

300
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,390
the long-lost Immortal Beauty Powder.

301
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,069
Today, it's a box of blood bird's nest.

302
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:22,269
Any of these gifts

303
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,990
could make any female immortal happy.

304
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:24,789
But...

305
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:26,429
But why is this woman

306
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,029
so hard to please?

307
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:31,230
Young Master, look.

308
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,110
You understand women very well.

309
00:18:33,569 --> 00:18:35,110
Even you're at a loss
when it's about Ms. Lian,

310
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,429
let alone me?

311
00:18:39,069 --> 00:18:40,040
She's not fond of wealth,

312
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,510
beauty, or gourmet.

313
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,640
What on earth does she like?

314
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,029
Could it be power?

315
00:18:50,149 --> 00:18:50,800
Young Master,

316
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,350
how about granting her

317
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,590
as the ordinary consort?

318
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:56,230
I'm sure she'd be happy.

319
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,429
Ordinary consort?

320
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:05,669
Don't tell me it's side consort?

321
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:07,949
Side consort...

322
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,149
Young Master,

323
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:15,320
you're not considering making her
the primary consort, are you?

324
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,230
As long she can give birth to a grandson

325
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,269
for my father,

326
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:21,549
granting her as the primary consort
is possible.

327
00:19:21,949 --> 00:19:22,630
But too bad,

328
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,949
she's focusing on leaving
with the child.

329
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:25,710
This is what I'm concerned about.

330
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,269
Young Master, I heard

331
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,990
Ms. Lian has changed her mind.

332
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,470
She wants to stay at here.

333
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,830
Really?

334
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,710
I wouldn't dare to lie to you.

335
00:19:37,949 --> 00:19:39,960
She didn't miss a day
of taking her pregnancy medicine.

336
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,920
She's now taking all the tonic
she refused to take before.

337
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,429
Also,

338
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:44,710
she even sews a small pouch
for Junior Young Master.

339
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,069
Why...

340
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,549
Why would she

341
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:49,830
suddenly want to stay?

342
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:51,429
Look at yourself, Young Master.

343
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:54,949
You're handsome, charming, and dashing.

344
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,710
You care for her deeply

345
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,309
and are both warm and considerate
toward her.

346
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,350
No woman can resist that.

347
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,429
Even a stone

348
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:03,390
would melt

349
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,269
under your gentleness.

350
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:11,149
Is it because of this?

351
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:12,830
Because of what?

352
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:13,830
Just that time when I...

353
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:16,029
How dare you!

354
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,269
Young Master.

355
00:20:17,269 --> 00:20:18,700
This isn't something
you should probe into.

356
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:20,120
Young Master, please calm down.

357
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:21,870
Wait for me, Young Master.

358
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:22,590
Young Master.

359
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:28,549
Madam, don't take it seriously.

360
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,309
Young Master would never

361
00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:31,870
let Luo Qinglian be the primary consort.

362
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:34,269
He must be joking with Su Nanchun.

363
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,510
It may be a joke now.

364
00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:40,269
What about in the future?

365
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:49,069
Hello, Dongli.

366
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:49,750
Hello, Ranyun.

367
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:58,510
Greetings, Ms. Lian.

368
00:20:58,909 --> 00:20:59,590
Ranyun.

369
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:00,309
Ms. Lian.

370
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:03,429
Ms. Lian, wait.

371
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,069
Did you change your clothes?

372
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:07,110
Look at Ms. Lian's belly.

373
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:08,429
Her belly

374
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,309
is almost as big as Ranyun's belly.

375
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:13,069
Everything is great about Ms. Lian.

376
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,789
Only that

377
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:16,069
you're too thin.

378
00:21:16,949 --> 00:21:18,069
When the baby starts kicking,

379
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,520
that's when you'll have a hard time.

380
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,269
Madam Rou.

381
00:21:27,949 --> 00:21:29,590
You gave me
so many blood bird's nest yesterday.

382
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:30,909
It's been bothering me.

383
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,080
So I've prepared some gifts
as a token of gratitude.

384
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,110
It seems

385
00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:35,149
they'll come in handy now.

386
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:37,110
Come, Huafu.

387
00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:42,350
Madam Rou made all

388
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,510
of these clothes herself.

389
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:45,069
They're all for a pregnant mother.

390
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,149
Madam Rou, were you pregnant before?

391
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:53,440
These clothes are
for when you're four months pregnant.

392
00:21:55,309 --> 00:21:56,510
This one is for six months.

393
00:21:57,909 --> 00:21:59,169
This one is for eight months pregnant.

394
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:02,909
The one at the bottom
is for the time of delivery.

395
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:11,230
Such delicate craftsmanship.

396
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,470
But why do the clothes

397
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:17,470
after the sixth month appear
as if they had never been worn?

398
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,750
It's because I only managed

399
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,590
to carry my child

400
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,390
for six months.

401
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:29,470
Ms. Rong, are we going in?

402
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:33,510
There are too many people here.

403
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:35,350
They don't need me here.

404
00:22:36,909 --> 00:22:37,590
Let's go back.

405
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:38,750
Yes, Ms. Rong.

406
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,149
The weather is nice today.

407
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:44,870
Come, Lian'er.

408
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:47,269
Let's put this one on

409
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,669
and go for a walk with me.

410
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:56,510
I've never heard you
talk about this before.

411
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,149
Something trivial like this

412
00:23:00,269 --> 00:23:01,350
isn't worth mentioning.

413
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:05,470
I was also a servant-concubine
when I entered the mansion.

414
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:08,549
I was appointed as the ordinary consort
because I was pregnant.

415
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,669
I had a miscarriage

416
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:11,760
when I was six months pregnant.

417
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,269
It was a baby girl.

418
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:16,800
You know the person
who caused the miscarriage too.

419
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:17,830
It was Madam Ye.

420
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,230
I didn't know
you had suffered such an ordeal.

421
00:23:27,069 --> 00:23:27,830
Suffer?

422
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,940
There's something
more painful than that.

423
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:33,429
After that miscarriage,

424
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,429
I can never become

425
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:36,630
a mother again.

426
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:42,710
I thought this matter would be over

427
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,269
after Madam Ye had lost her mind.

428
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,110
But every time I see these clothes,

429
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,230
it's like a knife

430
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,590
stabbing in my heart.

431
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:53,630
It hurts terribly.

432
00:24:11,949 --> 00:24:13,189
If you don't mind,

433
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:14,750
when he's born,

434
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:16,990
he can also call you "Mother."

435
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,189
Mother?

436
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:28,669
What's wrong?

437
00:24:28,949 --> 00:24:29,590
Nothing.

438
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:31,949
He's your child.

439
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,760
I don't deserve to be his mother.

440
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:35,390
My child

441
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:37,949
might have ended up

442
00:24:39,149 --> 00:24:40,149
like your daughter

443
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,069
if it weren't

444
00:24:42,069 --> 00:24:43,269
for your help.

445
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:49,110
Lian'er, it's getting windy.

446
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,390
You can't be out in the cold.

447
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,669
Let's go back and change your clothes.

448
00:24:54,429 --> 00:24:55,510
Let's stay out a little longer.

449
00:24:56,309 --> 00:24:58,949
There are too many dark and damp things
in this mansion.

450
00:25:00,069 --> 00:25:01,909
It's quite nice to be out in the sun.

451
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:19,429
Go and get it done.

452
00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:21,789
Yes, Madam.

453
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,880
(Tinglan Pavilion)

454
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,750
I've been here in the mansion
for some time.

455
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,029
But this place

456
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,909
seems completely unfamiliar.

457
00:25:55,549 --> 00:25:56,870
I supposed I haven't been here before.

458
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,230
Rou,

459
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:07,990
what's wrong?

460
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,549
Lian'er, I'm not feeling well.

461
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,470
Why don't we go back?

462
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,390
I forgot

463
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:22,909
you caught a cold.

464
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,630
All right, let's go back.

465
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:34,110
What's wrong? Are you dizzy?

466
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,429
What was that?

467
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:38,269
What?

468
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,470
Where did it go?

469
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,110
Madam Rou.

470
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,069
Madam Rou.

471
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:48,949
Madam Rou.

472
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:53,590
Madam Rou.

473
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,189
Madam Rou!

474
00:27:16,909 --> 00:27:17,590
Go and save her.

475
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,949
Girl, are you all right?

476
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:20,029
Are you hurt?

477
00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:20,870
No, I'm fine.

478
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:36,949
Tell me.

479
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,470
Who sent you here?

480
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:42,909
There's no need to say.

481
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,470
He's from Tinglan Pavilion.

482
00:27:54,669 --> 00:27:55,230
Young Master,

483
00:27:56,429 --> 00:27:57,990
Dongzi is indeed from Tinglan Pavilion.

484
00:27:59,029 --> 00:27:59,549
But

485
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:00,830
I don't know anything about this.

486
00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:02,870
You didn't know?

487
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:04,470
Zuiliu.

488
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,189
Yes, Madam.

489
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,510
Tell us everything

490
00:28:07,949 --> 00:28:09,069
that you saw.

491
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:09,750
Yes, Madam.

492
00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:11,909
This morning, Madam Rui ordered me

493
00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:13,510
to sort out some things in the backyard.

494
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,110
I took the wrong way

495
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,189
because I was lost in thought

496
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:17,909
and ended up at the old warehouse.

497
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,350
As I was about to turn back, I saw him

498
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,909
sneaking into the warehouse.

499
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,110
The old warehouse
has been abandoned for so long.

500
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,830
(Why would someone go inside?)

501
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,750
(I felt something was amiss.)

502
00:28:28,189 --> 00:28:29,189
(So I waited at the door.)

503
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,510
(After a while,)

504
00:28:30,949 --> 00:28:32,470
(I saw him walking out)

505
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,230
(with a large dog.)

506
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:39,230
What else did you see? Keep talking.

507
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:40,600
Yes, Young Master.

508
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:41,949
I found it

509
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:43,309
quite strange

510
00:28:44,069 --> 00:28:44,949
and decided to follow him.

511
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,189
I saw him lead the animal

512
00:28:47,189 --> 00:28:48,269
into the courtyard.

513
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,789
It's the place
where madams always go.

514
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:53,470
I was worried it might lead to trouble.

515
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:57,390
So I hurried back to Jingqiu Courtyard
to report what I saw.

516
00:28:58,149 --> 00:29:00,110
Coincidentally,
you and Madam were together.

517
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:01,669
And you know what happened

518
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:03,029
after that.

519
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:03,990
Young Master,

520
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,590
I really don't know anything about this.

521
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:09,990
Please give me one day

522
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,110
to interrogate this servant thoroughly.

523
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:12,870
Interrogate?

524
00:29:13,549 --> 00:29:14,990
I'm afraid he may end up dead

525
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:17,280
and the truth
becomes a case of injustice.

526
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:18,149
Madam Rui,

527
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,750
what do you mean by that?

528
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,590
Madam Mo,

529
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:23,429
ever since Mu Haiyao

530
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:24,510
went to the side courtyard,

531
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,189
you're the only side consort

532
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,710
in this mansion.

533
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:29,510
You're the one

534
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,920
who handles all the matters
in the mansion.

535
00:29:30,949 --> 00:29:32,309
Only you have the key

536
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,949
to this old warehouse.

537
00:29:35,429 --> 00:29:36,029
Am I right?

538
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:38,949
Key...

539
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,560
The key went missing several days ago.

540
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:44,750
That's right.

541
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,189
He must have stolen the key.

542
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,120
Young Master,
please take strict measures.

543
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:51,590
You must not show any leniency.

544
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,189
Madam Mo.

545
00:29:56,269 --> 00:29:57,390
Do you have anything else to say?

546
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,110
I have nothing to say.

547
00:30:01,429 --> 00:30:02,110
He confessed.

548
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,029
Young Master, did you hear that?
He confessed!

549
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,269
Did I say you can speak?

550
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,760
Who else do you have in your family?

551
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,390
I have an elderly mother,

552
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,549
two brothers and their wives,

553
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,390
and a nephew and niece.

554
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:15,710
Do you know

555
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,549
conspiring against the royal bloodline

556
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:19,760
would implicate your entire family?

557
00:30:22,189 --> 00:30:23,149
I know.

558
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:25,269
If you tell the truth,

559
00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:26,669
I will only punish you

560
00:30:27,069 --> 00:30:27,909
and spare your family.

561
00:30:29,909 --> 00:30:31,149
Don't speak recklessly!

562
00:30:34,029 --> 00:30:34,669
Madam Mo,

563
00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:37,149
do you think

564
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:40,029
you can still threaten me at this point?

565
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:41,949
I lack judgment.

566
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:44,720
You're simply not worthy
of someone risking their life for you.

567
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:51,189
Young Master, I'll confess.

568
00:30:51,949 --> 00:30:53,149
Everything I did

569
00:30:54,149 --> 00:30:55,350
was under the orders of Madam Mo.

570
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,350
Young Master, please keep your word

571
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,470
and spare my family.

572
00:31:16,029 --> 00:31:17,470
Someone, take him away.

573
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:24,549
Qianmo,

574
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,390
I've repeatedly tolerated your behavior

575
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,830
for the sake of your father.

576
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,309
It's a shame

577
00:31:32,429 --> 00:31:33,350
that you've forgotten

578
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,149
your place here.

579
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:38,440
Young Master, please have mercy.

580
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,309
I had a moment of lack of judgment.

581
00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:42,429
Please show mercy, Young Master.

582
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,710
Side consort, Li Qianmo,

583
00:31:49,189 --> 00:31:51,710
was overcame by jealousy
and plotted against my unborn child.

584
00:31:52,069 --> 00:31:53,840
She shall be stripped of her title
as the side consort

585
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,269
and confined in Yonghan Pavilion.

586
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:56,480
Young Master, have mercy on me.

587
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,750
Young Master, have mercy!
Please have mercy!

588
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,069
I won't do it again.

589
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,720
Please show mercy, Young Master.

590
00:32:04,949 --> 00:32:07,029
Shi, my dear Shi.

591
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:09,110
My dear Shi.

592
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:11,189
I'm afraid you won't be able

593
00:32:11,189 --> 00:32:12,909
to teach Shi anything useful
if he's by your side.

594
00:32:13,429 --> 00:32:13,990
From now on,

595
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,069
Huairui will raise him.

596
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,230
No.

597
00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:23,949
Shi! Shi! My Shi!

598
00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:26,069
Shi!

599
00:32:27,069 --> 00:32:29,269
Young Master! Young Master!

600
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,909
Young Master!

601
00:32:36,269 --> 00:32:38,189
I'll love and care for Shi

602
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,429
as if he's my own.

603
00:32:43,069 --> 00:32:44,160
Thank you, Young Master.

604
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,669
Get up.

605
00:32:50,949 --> 00:32:51,549
All right.

606
00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:53,320
Everyone can leave now.

607
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,630
I'll send you back to Lianwei House.

608
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,309
Young Master, please wait.

609
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:05,110
I need to clarify something.

610
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:07,040
I ask that you give your permission.

611
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:11,669
Madam Rou,

612
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,590
Ms. Lian told me

613
00:33:13,949 --> 00:33:14,990
you were with her

614
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,320
before she was attacked by the dog.

615
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,760
Why did you disappear before that?

616
00:33:18,189 --> 00:33:18,990
At that time,

617
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,710
I heard some strange sounds in the woods.

618
00:33:21,309 --> 00:33:22,590
Since Ms. Lian is pregnant,

619
00:33:22,949 --> 00:33:24,480
it's inconvenient for her to move about.

620
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,640
So I went to check on my own.

621
00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:27,189
But I didn't discover anything.

622
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,830
By the time I left the woods,

623
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:30,309
I learned

624
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,350
that Ms. Lian had been attacked
by the large dog.

625
00:33:34,149 --> 00:33:35,230
I want to stand closer

626
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,110
to Madam Rou.

627
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:55,470
My guess is right.

628
00:33:56,189 --> 00:33:56,789
What is it?

629
00:33:58,149 --> 00:33:59,110
I already found it odd

630
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,110
when I was in the woods.

631
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,909
Dogs don't usually attack people
on their own.

632
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:04,870
For a weak woman

633
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,269
like Ms. Lian

634
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,350
wouldn't pose

635
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,549
any threat to a dog.

636
00:34:09,029 --> 00:34:09,750
So,

637
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,149
why did this dog suddenly attack her?

638
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:14,080
You've found out the reason?

639
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:14,989
It's medicated powder.

640
00:34:15,549 --> 00:34:17,150
When I was rescuing Ms. Lian earlier,

641
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,749
I already smelled

642
00:34:18,749 --> 00:34:19,960
a faint unusual fragrance on her.

643
00:34:23,309 --> 00:34:25,029
Dogs have a very keen sense of smell,

644
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,400
but their vision isn't good.

645
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,870
If someone used a particular scent
and trained the dog with it,

646
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:31,950
(the dog would act
as if it received a command)

647
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:33,670
(when they detected that scent again)

648
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,640
(and immediately launched an attack.)

649
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:39,709
Let's put this one on

650
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:40,950
and go for a walk with me.

651
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,350
Am I right, Madam Rou?

652
00:34:44,309 --> 00:34:45,390
The scent on you

653
00:34:46,229 --> 00:34:47,549
is exactly the same as Ms. Lian's.

654
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,110
Jirou,

655
00:34:50,269 --> 00:34:51,670
you've always been different
from others.

656
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:54,029
You never vie for favors
or flatter others.

657
00:34:54,789 --> 00:34:56,350
Despite your gentle appearance,

658
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:59,509
you exude a strong feminine spirit.

659
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,350
Could I have been mistaken?

660
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:16,269
Young Master.

661
00:35:16,749 --> 00:35:18,040
You were not mistaken, Young Master.

662
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:18,910
This incident

663
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,880
indeed has nothing to do with Madam Rou.

664
00:35:21,549 --> 00:35:22,630
I happened to run into Dongzi

665
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,280
when I was going out this morning.

666
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,080
Since he had the intention to harm me,

667
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,069
he must have sprinkled

668
00:35:27,069 --> 00:35:28,749
the medicated powder on me at that time.

669
00:35:29,789 --> 00:35:31,630
Madam Rou has been with me

670
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,110
this morning.

671
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,630
So naturally,

672
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,150
she has the same scent as me.

673
00:35:45,029 --> 00:35:46,509
Oh, why haven't I seen you wear

674
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,870
these clothes before?

675
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,430
(Madam Rou made all)

676
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,749
of these clothes herself.

677
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:53,680
These clothes are
for when you're four months pregnant.

678
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:54,950
This one is for six months.

679
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,160
This one is for eight months pregnant.

680
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,709
Yes, I've never worn them before.

681
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,269
This is newly made.

682
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,590
Newly made?

683
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,670
Who made it for you?

684
00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:11,390
I go to Lianwei House every day.

685
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,709
But I've never seen anyone sewing there.

686
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,600
Who made it for you?

687
00:36:20,029 --> 00:36:21,029
I made it.

688
00:36:22,309 --> 00:36:25,269
I had nothing to do at Liuyun Cottage.

689
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,590
When I saw Ms. Lian's belly was showing,

690
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:28,950
I made several clothes for her.

691
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:30,269
The one she's wearing

692
00:36:30,269 --> 00:36:31,229
is for six month pregnant.

693
00:36:31,549 --> 00:36:32,840
There's one for eight months pregnant

694
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:33,910
and also for delivery.

695
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,549
If you don't believe me,

696
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,430
you'll know
when you go to Lianwei House.

697
00:36:37,749 --> 00:36:38,549
All right, fine.

698
00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:40,630
That's thoughtful of you.

699
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:44,950
You're all thoughtful.

700
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,870
So are the rest of you.

701
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,110
Why can't the women

702
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:59,430
in my mansion live in peace?

703
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:10,989
Rong.

704
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,069
Ms. Lian, slow down.

705
00:37:13,469 --> 00:37:14,110
Rong.

706
00:37:14,989 --> 00:37:15,870
Slow down.

707
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:17,549
Rong,

708
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,466
(Lianwei House)

709
00:37:20,469 --> 00:37:21,229
it's scorching hot.

710
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,120
Why don't you come
to Lianwei House for a while?

711
00:37:23,789 --> 00:37:24,509
You're already tired.

712
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,630
You should go back and rest well.

713
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:32,029
Are you still angry with me?

714
00:37:35,549 --> 00:37:36,870
Since you're angry with me,

715
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,150
why did you help me?

716
00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:45,150
Usually,

717
00:37:45,749 --> 00:37:46,830
you treat me the best.

718
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:51,709
But now you're being cold.

719
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,029
Could it be

720
00:37:53,029 --> 00:37:54,549
that you're going to ignore me forever?

721
00:37:55,789 --> 00:37:57,190
There are many people
who treat you well.

722
00:37:57,789 --> 00:37:59,029
Why should I be any different?

723
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:04,670
Rong,

724
00:38:06,469 --> 00:38:07,630
you treat me well.

725
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,309
So, I naturally care about you.

726
00:38:11,029 --> 00:38:12,430
Even if thousands of people treat me well,

727
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:16,430
the one I care about the most
is still you.

728
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,309
Don't think a few kind words

729
00:38:19,309 --> 00:38:20,229
can make me happy.

730
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,520
The reason I'm willing to help you today

731
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,229
is because I've figured something out.

732
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:25,630
That day...

733
00:38:36,789 --> 00:38:37,350
Young Master,

734
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,480
someone from Baizhen Lane came by.

735
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,830
They said the thing you wanted is ready.

736
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:52,350
"Who taught the red lotus
to bloom year after year?

737
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:55,309
Two people understand each other
as they sigh in silence."

738
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,190
Everything is fated.

739
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,350
Whether we obtain it

740
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:00,190
or not is still fate.

741
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,029
Not being able to have it now

742
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,709
doesn't mean you can't have it after.

743
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:06,390
Girl,

744
00:39:07,549 --> 00:39:10,509
fate is the result, not the cause.

745
00:39:11,989 --> 00:39:12,749
What did I say?

746
00:39:13,029 --> 00:39:14,830
What have I been saying all this while?

747
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:18,029
After waiting for so long,

748
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,590
you finally have me in your heart,

749
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,630
and you're finally willing
to have children with me.

750
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,120
Young Master, where are you going?

751
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,440
Someone suffered from shock just now.

752
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,590
I should go and make her happy.

753
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:35,309
I'll leave after I say three things.

754
00:39:44,709 --> 00:39:45,870
This is for harming you.

755
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:53,350
This is for saving me.

756
00:39:57,989 --> 00:39:59,360
I don't like being indebted to anyone.

757
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,430
If you need my help in the future,

758
00:40:03,229 --> 00:40:04,069
I, Xu Jirou,

759
00:40:04,749 --> 00:40:06,400
will repay you,
even if it means risking my life.

760
00:40:06,789 --> 00:40:07,509
Wait.

761
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,150
You want to know
why I wanted to harm you.

762
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,549
I wanted to know

763
00:40:13,229 --> 00:40:14,390
why you wanted to save me.

764
00:40:16,549 --> 00:40:18,630
Lian'er, I'm not feeling well.

765
00:40:18,989 --> 00:40:20,549
Why don't we go back?

766
00:40:21,229 --> 00:40:23,789
You wanted to harm me and then save me.

767
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:25,709
Won't your effort go in vain?

768
00:40:27,309 --> 00:40:28,520
Do you have any difficulties?

769
00:40:31,749 --> 00:40:33,069
No, there's none.

770
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,190
I approached you with ulterior motives
from the beginning.

771
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:39,509
It's just that you were foolish
and too trusting.

772
00:40:39,509 --> 00:40:40,670
Why so stubborn?

773
00:40:47,549 --> 00:40:48,390
Heart-devouring Poison.

774
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:51,580
How long have you been poisoned by it?

775
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:54,789
What Heart-devouring Poison?

776
00:40:55,509 --> 00:40:56,820
I don't know what you're talking about.

777
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:01,910
Of course, you do.

778
00:41:03,469 --> 00:41:05,190
Heart-devouring Poison
is a strange poison.

779
00:41:05,509 --> 00:41:07,110
Those who are poisoned by it

780
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,229
will inevitably die within a year.

781
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,350
Maybe you're not afraid of death.

782
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,910
But the most terrifying thing
about this poison isn't death.

783
00:41:13,549 --> 00:41:14,630
It's the pain before death.

784
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,309
Right now, your eyesight

785
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:18,430
is already affected.

786
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:19,950
And

787
00:41:20,749 --> 00:41:21,749
you often

788
00:41:21,749 --> 00:41:22,709
hear piercing noises.

789
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:26,190
(At night, you even feel like
your heart is about to jump out.)

790
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,309
(In the days to come,)

791
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,029
your seven orifices will be damaged
one by one.

792
00:41:31,469 --> 00:41:32,390
Within a year,

793
00:41:33,469 --> 00:41:34,749
the poison will consume your heart,

794
00:41:34,989 --> 00:41:35,870
leading to your death.
