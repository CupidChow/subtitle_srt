17
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,710
Have some tea, Young Master.

18
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:09,589
Young Master,

19
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,469
you spend every night

20
00:02:12,149 --> 00:02:13,550
in the study.

21
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:15,390
I'm busy with the state affairs.

22
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:17,229
Who else can take care of them
if not me?

23
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:18,390
You?

24
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,349
State affairs may be important.

25
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,470
But you can't neglect some things.

26
00:02:23,869 --> 00:02:25,989
It's not like I can do it
on your behalf either.

27
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,950
It's a beautiful night.

28
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,069
I think you should go out

29
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,589
to grow your family tree.

30
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,830
You little rascal,

31
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:47,030
I didn't expect you to know
about "beautiful night."

32
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:52,030
Well, go to Lianwei House then.

33
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,910
Young Master,

34
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:53,989
earlier

35
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:55,509
Ranyun reported

36
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,550
that Madam Lian

37
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,589
isn't feeling well again.

38
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,550
Is she not feeling well again?

39
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,910
Ms. Lian,

40
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,270
you're over three months pregnant now.

41
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:08,869
Do you still want to keep it a secret?

42
00:03:11,869 --> 00:03:12,910
The baby is still in your belly.

43
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,830
But you're already carrying it.

44
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,670
Worrying too much
would lead to problems.

45
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,470
I hope to have heaven's protection.

46
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:19,310
Right now, your belly doesn't show yet.

47
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:21,429
But the child will grow.

48
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,390
How can he stand it

49
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,629
if you bind him around like this?

50
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,190
I only had to bind my belly

51
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,470
when I had to go out.

52
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:29,229
He can endure this little suffering.

53
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,270
He's the descendant of the He family

54
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,670
with my blood flowing in him.

55
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,270
He can certainly take it.

56
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,750
The baby can take it.

57
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,190
But I can't endure it any longer.

58
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:41,589
Madam, you have no idea.

59
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,869
When you keep rejecting
the bedchamber duty,

60
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,509
the Young Master
won't say anything to you.

61
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:45,509
But every time

62
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:46,390
I go to report it,

63
00:03:46,589 --> 00:03:48,670
my heart is about
to jump out of my chest.

64
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:49,670
Do you know

65
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,789
the annoyance and dissatisfaction
on Young Master's face

66
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:52,869
when he looked at me?

67
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,950
He scares me to death.

68
00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:57,509
Just bear with it a little longer

69
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,270
until my pregnancy is more stable

70
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,989
and have more upper hand.

71
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,950
Young Master has arrived.

72
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,029
Why is she so seriously ill?

73
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:27,950
Young Master,

74
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,349
please forgive me
for not giving a proper greeting.

75
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,110
There's no need for a proper greeting.

76
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,430
Do you have a fever?

77
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:38,830
Let me check your temperature.

78
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:48,309
You don't have a fever.

79
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,670
Then why did you cover her

80
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,590
with such a thick blanket?

81
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,950
What if it's too stuffy?

82
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,150
Young Master,

83
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,309
I feel cold

84
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:01,590
and sleepy.

85
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,110
All right. Then...

86
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:13,870
Then get some proper rest.

87
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,229
Get some proper rest.

88
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:20,029
Su Nanchun, let's go. Come on.

89
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,590
Young Master,

90
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,069
Madam Lian is sick.

91
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:27,430
Why are you so happy?

92
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,990
You silly boy,

93
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,430
can't you tell?

94
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,270
She's pretending to be sick.

95
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:38,710
Did he just leave?

96
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:40,629
That's unlike him.

97
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,349
He usually stays

98
00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:43,670
for quite some time.

99
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,590
What's up with him today?

100
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:45,950
Why is she pretending to be sick?

101
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,069
What else?

102
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:51,029
There was a piece of cloth

103
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,990
under her blanket.

104
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:54,069
Cloth?

105
00:05:58,229 --> 00:05:59,229
Did he notice?

106
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,110
I don't think he noticed.

107
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,110
She thought I didn't notice.

108
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:14,710
This silly girl is...

109
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,789
She's making clothes for me.

110
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,670
Is she making clothes for you?

111
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:22,509
Yes.

112
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:25,029
This silly girl

113
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,150
usually doesn't do needlework.

114
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:27,189
I never expected her

115
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:28,110
to have such thoughts.

116
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,950
No wonder she has been avoiding me.

117
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:32,189
It turns out
she wants to give me a surprise.

118
00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:34,229
I can't believe myself.

119
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,509
I've misunderstood her.

120
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:37,150
Well, well.

121
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:41,390
No, wait.

122
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,029
What is it, Young Master?

123
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:43,110
When Ms. Jinfang

124
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,909
was training her,

125
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:45,509
needlework was her weakest skill.

126
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,229
She was so clumsy.

127
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:48,590
What if she pricked her fingers?

128
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,270
What should we do?

129
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:50,509
Later,

130
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:53,309
I want you to select
some good-quality thimbles

131
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:53,990
and send them over to her.

132
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,909
Yes, Young Master.

133
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,950
- Yes, Young Master?
- What if she had pricked her fingers?

134
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:02,229
What should I do?

135
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:03,550
What should we do?

136
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,349
Ah, yes.

137
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:06,189
Select high-quality ointment

138
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:07,430
and send it to her.

139
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,349
Yes, Young Master.

140
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,430
- Young Master.
- Knowing her personality,

141
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:15,629
is it possible

142
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:17,270
that she stayed up all night
to sew this for me?

143
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,710
Then you should pick out
some good quality candles.

144
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,029
We can't let her damage her eyes.

145
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:24,390
Of course, Young Master.

146
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,279
Anything else, Young Master?

147
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:39,990
My dear,

148
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,270
your heartfelt gesture

149
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,590
has made

150
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,870
this beautiful night worthwhile.

151
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,469
Why did the Young Master reward Madam

152
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:06,670
these things?

153
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:11,870
Oh, I know.

154
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:15,909
Madam did not have a fever,

155
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,990
but the Young Master did.

156
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,789
Madam,

157
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:23,670
Young Master went
to Lianwei House again.

158
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:27,990
Young Master

159
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,110
hasn't visited you in a long time.

160
00:08:34,069 --> 00:08:35,150
So what?

161
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,109
Have you taken care

162
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:40,749
of all the previous matters?

163
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,069
Rest assured.

164
00:08:42,069 --> 00:08:43,429
Not a single thing will be leaked.

165
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,710
What I have to do now

166
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,270
is maintain stability.

167
00:08:54,989 --> 00:08:56,270
As long as my position remains stable,

168
00:08:57,989 --> 00:08:59,309
everything will be mine.

169
00:09:03,157 --> 00:09:04,790
(Mansion of Prince An)

170
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,549
Before, I heard from Yuan Baili

171
00:09:08,189 --> 00:09:09,509
that he dreamt

172
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:10,830
of a little qilin.

173
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,509
I didn't believe him.

174
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:14,549
But last night,

175
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:18,590
I dreamt of one.

176
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,230
That little qilin

177
00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:23,790
was really vivid and lifelike

178
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:24,869
to the point

179
00:09:24,869 --> 00:09:26,189
that I can even draw it out right now.

180
00:09:28,749 --> 00:09:29,390
Court Diviner.

181
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:30,230
Present.

182
00:09:32,069 --> 00:09:32,629
Your Highness.

183
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,150
What's the meaning of this dream?

184
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,470
Your Highness,

185
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,749
This dream is very auspicious.
It's a sign of good fortune.

186
00:09:42,189 --> 00:09:42,950
Auspicious?

187
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,030
Exactly.

188
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,109
The dream conveys that the little qilin

189
00:09:46,429 --> 00:09:47,869
was conceived by loving parents.

190
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,910
This sign indicates
you'll have descendants

191
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,429
to continue your lineage.

192
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,669
I'll have descendants?

193
00:09:56,069 --> 00:09:57,189
It means

194
00:09:58,189 --> 00:09:59,350
a grandson

195
00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:02,189
will be born

196
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:03,790
to inherit my title, right?

197
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,429
You're absolutely correct, Your Highness.

198
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:15,150
Excellent.

199
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,989
So, Young Masters of the He family,

200
00:10:17,749 --> 00:10:18,950
which of your female members

201
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:19,910
is pregnant?

202
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,989
This is such a wonderful news.

203
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:24,590
I wonder which Young Master

204
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,669
is so fortunate.

205
00:10:25,669 --> 00:10:27,069
- I think so too.
- My thoughts exactly.

206
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:27,950
I have no idea.

207
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,309
Lianxiu,

208
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,030
is it you?

209
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:32,350
I should ask you the same.

210
00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:34,109
How could it be me?

211
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:35,669
Lianzuo.

212
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:36,910
Yes, Father?

213
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:40,120
Is one of your consorts pregnant?

214
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:41,549
This is such a piece of good news.

215
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,109
I certainly want to have a son.

216
00:10:43,869 --> 00:10:44,590
But...

217
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,189
But I've been busy
with my official duties lately.

218
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,830
So I didn't pay attention.

219
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,590
So it's not you.

220
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,230
Then you need to work harder on it.

221
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:55,470
I will, Father.

222
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:56,590
Yu Dechang.

223
00:10:57,429 --> 00:10:58,069
Yes, Your Highness.

224
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:59,069
I want you to bring some people

225
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,669
to pay a visit to each
of the Young Master's Mansion.

226
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:04,509
Madams,

227
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,390
Chief Steward Yu is here

228
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:07,590
and went to Jingqiu Courtyard.

229
00:11:07,869 --> 00:11:08,390
Madam Rui ordered

230
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,509
all the consorts to be present.

231
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,509
What is it about?

232
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:12,350
It's good news.

233
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:13,749
I suppose

234
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,150
we can no longer hide your pregnancy.

235
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:16,710
Did the news leak?

236
00:11:16,869 --> 00:11:18,590
Now, I heard the news.

237
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,030
Prince An dreamt

238
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,150
of a golden qilin.

239
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,910
The Court Diviner said
it's an auspicious sign.

240
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:23,830
Ms. Lian,

241
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,390
the one in your belly

242
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,150
could be the future young prince.

243
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:29,109
In my opinion,

244
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:30,470
we should tell the Young Master.

245
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,189
No, we can't.

246
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:32,710
Why can't we still tell him?

247
00:11:33,549 --> 00:11:34,710
It's such a great opportunity.

248
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,549
Why should we let it slip away?

249
00:11:36,869 --> 00:11:38,030
Lian, please reconsider.

250
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:39,790
The honor of being born

251
00:11:40,109 --> 00:11:41,189
under an auspicious sign

252
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,710
is incomparable.

253
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,230
While you must protect the baby,

254
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:45,950
losing the opportunity

255
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,230
for the sake of protecting the baby

256
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:48,830
might be more loss than gain.

257
00:11:54,989 --> 00:11:55,869
I know

258
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,390
both of you meant well.

259
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,390
But do you know

260
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,429
what is frowned upon

261
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,350
in the Young Master's Mansion

262
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,150
and also the Mansion of Prince An?

263
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,030
It's greed.

264
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:14,470
A greedy person

265
00:12:14,749 --> 00:12:16,270
is most likely to reveal flaws.

266
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,230
Auspicious omens may be tempting.

267
00:12:19,109 --> 00:12:20,509
But they can also expose
one's weaknesses.

268
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,470
Perhaps this is the test

269
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,590
heaven is giving me.

270
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,069
I must remain steady

271
00:12:27,109 --> 00:12:28,470
and not give Nan Ruzhen

272
00:12:28,669 --> 00:12:30,390
any chance to harm me.

273
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,509
I've visited all
of the Young Masters' mansions.

274
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:37,669
But I still end up

275
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:39,030
leaving empty-handed.

276
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,429
It's truly a letdown

277
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:42,629
to His Highness's hopeful expectations.

278
00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:43,749
Do you think

279
00:12:44,109 --> 00:12:45,509
it's Young Master Shi?

280
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:46,989
The Court Diviner has said

281
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,590
only new pregnancy counts.

282
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,309
How strange.

283
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,069
The Court Diviner was so confident.

284
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:55,749
But there's no news

285
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,030
from any of the Young Master's Mansions.

286
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,270
It's truly such a shame.

287
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:00,830
Such a matter

288
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,669
is beyond one's wishes.

289
00:13:03,989 --> 00:13:06,390
The auspicious omen
is naturally a good thing.

290
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,509
But if our mansion

291
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,910
has no such blessing,

292
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:13,270
we can only accept it.

293
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:17,429
You don't have to send me further.

294
00:13:17,749 --> 00:13:19,030
I shall return now.

295
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,950
When I report back,

296
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,470
His Highness
will surely be disappointed.

297
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,790
I'll have to trouble you
to keep an eye on my behalf.

298
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:27,109
It's possible for anyone to not realize

299
00:13:27,109 --> 00:13:28,350
that they're pregnant.

300
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,470
A pregnant person

301
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,109
is undoubtedly very fortunate.

302
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:35,189
Madam, this is a heaven-sent opportunity.

303
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,309
What are you waiting for?

304
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,270
When it comes to theatrics,

305
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,790
Madam Zhen is the best.

306
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,869
She didn't show any signs
of morning sickness for so many days.

307
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:00,309
At the news of the auspicious omen,

308
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:02,030
she suddenly shows signs of sickness?

309
00:14:02,749 --> 00:14:04,869
Jingshu Pavilion is different now.

310
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:06,910
Such nausea and discomfort

311
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,790
are probably from indigestion.

312
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,390
Quiet.

313
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:11,069
You're embarrassing yourselves

314
00:14:11,069 --> 00:14:12,069
in front of Chief Steward Yu.

315
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,150
Chief Steward Yu,
we can't take this lightly.

316
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:18,830
Please order your men
to check her pulse.

317
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,189
Physician Chen,

318
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:23,590
I'll leave it to you.

319
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:25,910
Madam Zhen, please.

320
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,390
Madam Zhen, if I may.

321
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,390
Congratulations, Madam Zhen.

322
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,309
You too, Madam Rui.

323
00:14:56,509 --> 00:14:58,590
Her pulse is indicating
that she's two months pregnant.

324
00:15:07,989 --> 00:15:08,669
Really?

325
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,749
Yes, Your Highness.

326
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:12,749
Great!

327
00:15:14,989 --> 00:15:16,590
This is great!

328
00:15:17,109 --> 00:15:19,509
Heaven truly has blessed me!

329
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:23,470
Congratulations, Your Highness.

330
00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:25,150
Congratulations, Your Highness.

331
00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:28,549
Heaven bless Your Highness and Quliang!

332
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,710
Wonderful.

333
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,350
Heaven sure blesses Quliang.

334
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:43,989
An auspicious pregnancy

335
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,350
is enough for Nan Ruzhen's comeback.

336
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,150
She's clearly wicked.

337
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,989
But why does she seem to have good luck?

338
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,069
We still don't know if it's good luck.

339
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:54,749
As far as I know,

340
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,669
the Young Master has been occupied
with his duties lately.

341
00:15:56,669 --> 00:15:58,150
He hasn't slept with her
for a long time.

342
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:00,230
Could it be

343
00:16:00,749 --> 00:16:02,150
that she's faking her pregnancy

344
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:03,790
like Madam Yao did?

345
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,230
Whether it's a fake pregnancy or not,

346
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:09,390
we will know once we visit a place.

347
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,509
Greetings, Madam Rui.

348
00:16:22,869 --> 00:16:24,669
This place doesn't get
that many visitors.

349
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,109
But it's quite lively today.

350
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:30,429
It looks like

351
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,470
I'm not the only one
who's being suspicious.

352
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:39,390
These are the things

353
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:41,109
that all of you want to see.

354
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,125
(The Register of Consort Livings)

355
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,669
The last time Nan Ruzhen performed
her bedchamber duties

356
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,230
was two months ago.

357
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,509
This matches the time frame

358
00:17:05,509 --> 00:17:06,590
the physician mentioned.

359
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,710
Lian'er, wait.

360
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,149
Lian'er,

361
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,950
I've carefully examined the register.

362
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,710
We've discovered

363
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:28,710
something suspicious.

364
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,309
This wretched woman deserves to die!

365
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:34,750
She's clearly the spy

366
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,189
we planted by Lianxin's side.

367
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:37,630
Now, she has turned it into

368
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,590
some auspicious sign.

369
00:17:39,389 --> 00:17:40,750
If Lianxin's son
will be the future successor,

370
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,549
what about Lianxin?

371
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:42,830
He could legitimately

372
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,950
become Prince An.

373
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,309
Father is so pleased

374
00:17:45,389 --> 00:17:46,230
that he even

375
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,269
let him handle Yuanxue's marriage!

376
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:49,510
Young Master, you must calm down.

377
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:50,830
The one who wins last

378
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,309
is the real winner.

379
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,990
The more things don't go well,
the more you need to endure patiently.

380
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,990
You'll become the target of criticism
if you don't endure.

381
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,870
If you're not patient,
you won't be able to make careful plans.

382
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,470
Achievements

383
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,029
are nothing but superficial.

384
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,350
It's the same
with Nan Ruzhen's pregnancy.

385
00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:12,110
It's also the same

386
00:18:13,149 --> 00:18:14,230
for the other matter.

387
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:16,990
The other matter?

388
00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:22,470
You mean Yuanxue's wedding?

389
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,909
There were moments of bitterness,

390
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,269
and lingering emotions were hard to end.

391
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,510
Lady Xue, if you ask me,

392
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,470
it's best to end it.

393
00:19:06,189 --> 00:19:07,149
Did Father

394
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,230
bring up the matter of marriage again?

395
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:11,029
It has already been decided.

396
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:13,149
Today, His Highness invited
the officials to the banquet

397
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,669
because of the auspicious sign.

398
00:19:15,149 --> 00:19:16,590
Qi Liangfu took the chance to bring up

399
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,510
the marriage between two families.

400
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,350
His Highness was overjoyed

401
00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:21,990
and unexpectedly agreed to it.

402
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:33,069
I can understand.

403
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,069
Why wouldn't he agree to it?

404
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:42,029
After all, people do love

405
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:45,630
when good things come in pairs.

406
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,590
No, stop it!

407
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:05,950
You mad!

408
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:06,750
Stop making trouble here again!

409
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,789
I'll beat you every time I see you!

410
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,029
If you come again, I'll break your legs!

411
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:09,950
Get lost!

412
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,389
What's wrong?

413
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:13,990
I'm not mad!

414
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,789
I'm not mad.

415
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,630
I'm just a hopeless romantic.

416
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,549
I've searched

417
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:22,990
every big and small rouge shop
in Quliang

418
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,870
just to search

419
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,510
for a woman with a fragrant scent.

420
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,230
Hopeless romantic?

421
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:30,189
(Lian'er,)

422
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:31,669
(don't blame me.)

423
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,350
I can't implicate you.

424
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,149
Don't blame me.

425
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,630
Don't blame me.

426
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:43,189
("A coral red bean inlaid in ivory dice,)

427
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,069
(the wistful yearning for you
deep into my bones.")

428
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,389
Lady Xue,

429
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,389
this person is speaking nonsense

430
00:20:50,389 --> 00:20:51,230
and has no shame at all.

431
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:51,990
Have you seen her?

432
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,870
Yet, he denies being a mad man.

433
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,590
Have you seen her?

434
00:20:54,909 --> 00:20:56,029
Can you help me

435
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:56,830
by telling me

436
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,870
if you saw her?

437
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,110
Let's leave now.

438
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,830
Don't let such nonsense

439
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,950
taint your ears.

440
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,269
Isn't it fortunate to be able

441
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,909
to act like mad without restraint?

442
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,470
Let's go.

443
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,149
Have you seen her?

444
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,429
Did you happen to see her?

445
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:19,630
Haven't you met her?

446
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:22,669
Madam,

447
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,350
the weather is lovely today.

448
00:21:25,149 --> 00:21:26,110
Would you like me

449
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,590
to accompany you for a walk outside?

450
00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:30,110
No.

451
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,309
Nothing is more important
than securing the baby.

452
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,110
Madam.

453
00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:42,830
What did you say?

454
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,669
Didn't you say you've taken care of it?

455
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,320
That person has gone to every rouge shop
in the city to search for fragrant powder?

456
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:54,789
Exactly.

457
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:58,870
No.

458
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,750
He's seeking death.

459
00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:19,029
Lady Xue, I'll go and find Mr. Lv.

460
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:30,630
Mr. Lv, are you home?

461
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,029
Mr. Lv?

462
00:22:36,069 --> 00:22:36,789
Mr. Lv?

463
00:22:39,389 --> 00:22:41,389
Mr. Lv, Lady Xue is here.

464
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:45,230
Lady Xue, you can't do such rough chores.

465
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:46,710
If you don't mind,

466
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:47,830
come inside for tea.

467
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:18,870
Lady Xue.

468
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:21,149
Lady Xue, no.

469
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:26,990
That's right.

470
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,440
If the daughter of the prince
does dishes for a commoner in outcast status,

471
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,189
it would cost you your life.

472
00:23:33,149 --> 00:23:34,630
My family would be shamed by this

473
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,389
and this would be
the laughingstock among the people.

474
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,669
I guess

475
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,149
I still can't be an ordinary woman.

476
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,510
I can't sweep the courtyard,

477
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,309
do laundry, and cook for you.

478
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,630
In the future,

479
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,950
forget about such a life,

480
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:08,950
I'm afraid we'll only be able

481
00:24:11,429 --> 00:24:12,710
to meet in dreams.

482
00:24:15,189 --> 00:24:15,950
Lady Xue.

483
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,269
Father has arranged my marriage.

484
00:24:24,189 --> 00:24:25,669
I'm getting married tomorrow.

485
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:30,189
Congratulations, Lady Xue

486
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:31,669
and your future husband.

487
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:34,710
My future husband?

488
00:24:45,789 --> 00:24:46,789
You

489
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,549
never say things that I want to hear.

490
00:24:54,069 --> 00:24:54,710
Then

491
00:24:56,029 --> 00:24:57,230
what do you want to hear?

492
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,950
I want you to tell me to ask my father

493
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:02,950
to break the engagement

494
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,870
and let me marry you.

495
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,189
Lady Xue, you can't be willful.

496
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,590
Willful?

497
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:31,230
Last night, I walked barefoot

498
00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:34,230
to every corner of Changze Courtyard.

499
00:25:39,149 --> 00:25:42,149
Everything there

500
00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:46,669
doesn't tolerate my willfulness.

501
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,710
I sat on the stairs

502
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,149
the whole night.

503
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,029
Surprisingly,

504
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:03,909
I felt no attachment

505
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:05,350
to the place I had lived in

506
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,710
for over a decade.

507
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,909
I only wanted to come

508
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:13,350
to this small courtyard of yours.

509
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,189
I truly wanted to be willful for once.

510
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,429
As long as you agree to marry me.

511
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,110
But it's a shame.

512
00:27:12,389 --> 00:27:13,830
(Can you help me comb my hair?)

513
00:27:15,789 --> 00:27:17,269
(The depth of affection)

514
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,029
(and longing)

515
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:23,870
(are all left behind)

516
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,309
(the day before the wedding.)

517
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,630
("A coral red bean inlaid in ivory dice,)

518
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:37,870
(the wistful yearning for you
deep into my bones.")

519
00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:41,830
(I know your longing.)

520
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,269
(But no one will care)

521
00:27:46,909 --> 00:27:48,789
(about my longing anymore.)

522
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:41,870
Mr. Lv?

523
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,269
I'm here to apologize, Young Master Xiu.

524
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:46,350
I'm afraid someone has taken away

525
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,630
the item you gave me earlier.

526
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:51,950
Where to?

527
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:52,830
Prince An's mansion.

528
00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:08,029
I've come here

529
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,350
to ask for a favor.

530
00:29:11,389 --> 00:29:12,510
How can I help you, Lianxiu?

531
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,470
I want to retrieve something

532
00:29:16,309 --> 00:29:17,510
from you.

533
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:27,029
Yuanxue,

534
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,309
this item belongs to Lv Beiyi.

535
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,990
You'll marry someone else.

536
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,149
It won't be appropriate for you

537
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:35,590
to take this along with you.

538
00:29:37,389 --> 00:29:38,429
Even if your words

539
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:40,389
aren't trustworthy,

540
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,669
I'm still willing to believe them.

541
00:29:43,069 --> 00:29:44,069
But this flask

542
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:45,470
has nothing to do with you.

543
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:47,549
The most precious thing

544
00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:49,269
I cherished in my life

545
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:51,429
was the longevity lock Father gave me.

546
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:53,630
But after this,

547
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:57,909
it will be this.

548
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:00,830
Yuanxue,

549
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,470
I'm begging you.

550
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:05,590
If you give it to me today,

551
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,389
I will explain it

552
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:07,750
to you in the future, all right?

553
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:12,909
Lianxiu, please go back.

554
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,069
No one

555
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:16,350
can touch this item.

556
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,429
What is this?

557
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,630
Thunder God Vine.

558
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,429
Lianxiu, why are you giving me poison?

559
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:30,750
Do you know

560
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,429
why I must take this flask?

561
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:36,510
To be honest, it's not me who wants it.

562
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:38,149
It was Lv Beiyi.

563
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:40,149
He came to me on horseback urgently

564
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:42,309
to ask me to retrieve this flask
at all costs.

565
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:44,590
(Do you know)

566
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,549
(what he said to me?)

567
00:30:49,069 --> 00:30:49,830
(Mr. Lv,)

568
00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:51,429
(Lady Xue asked me)

569
00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:52,230
(to deliver this to you.)

570
00:30:56,553 --> 00:30:59,553
(Yuanxue)

571
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,269
(This is the first time)

572
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:09,669
I've ever seen the moon outside

573
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:10,710
since I was born.

574
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:13,069
The place where I live

575
00:31:15,389 --> 00:31:18,309
is a tomb

576
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,069
filled with beautiful clothes
and jewelry.

577
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,189
(There is only one way to leave,)

578
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,990
(which is to marry)

579
00:31:26,309 --> 00:31:27,350
(a high-ranking official)

580
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,429
(I've never met before)

581
00:31:28,909 --> 00:31:30,269
(and go to another tomb.)

582
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:35,950
(Yuanxue.)

583
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,309
(Lv Beiyi.)

584
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:42,669
(Is this your current state of mind?)

585
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,630
(He said someone like you,)

586
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,510
(who claims to love him.)

587
00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:49,590
Yet, she's marrying to become
another man's wife.

588
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,029
A woman like this,

589
00:31:51,189 --> 00:31:52,230
even if she still

590
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,269
has the slightest affection for him

591
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,510
he still finds her utterly repulsive.

592
00:31:56,909 --> 00:31:57,830
Repulsive?

593
00:31:59,389 --> 00:32:00,950
(He said I was repulsive?)

594
00:32:02,669 --> 00:32:03,429
Yuanxue,

595
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:07,149
I know you're pure and virtuous,

596
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,429
who cares not about material wealth.

597
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,269
Perhaps

598
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,750
this is your best dowry.

599
00:32:20,149 --> 00:32:21,309
(No, Lv Beiyi.)

600
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,389
(Qingkang Hall)
(This is unlike you.)

601
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:25,710
(Lianxiu's lies won't deceive me.)

602
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,909
(But what he said)

603
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:32,350
(is the truth.)

604
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:44,269
Forgive me for no longer being able

605
00:32:45,149 --> 00:32:47,110
to perform my duty as a child.

606
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:51,149
I hope you will take care
of your health,

607
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:53,870
and not worry about me.

608
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:00,309
When a daughter grows up,
they have to marry eventually.

609
00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:04,110
The husband I've chosen for you

610
00:33:05,069 --> 00:33:06,750
is considered a talented man.

611
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:08,669
I believe you

612
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:10,750
would be satisfied with him.

613
00:33:35,189 --> 00:33:36,630
You've always been clever

614
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,669
and have high ambitions.

615
00:33:41,549 --> 00:33:42,830
But after today,

616
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:45,230
you'll be a daughter-in-law

617
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,870
in someone else's house.

618
00:33:48,149 --> 00:33:50,069
You must fulfill your wifely duties
with the utmost diligence,

619
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:52,870
without the slightest negligence.

620
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,429
You don't have to worry
about matters here.

621
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,350
Your husband's mansion
is in Quliang.

622
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,029
If you miss us,

623
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,750
you can come home anytime.

624
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,550
I shall remember your advice.

625
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,429
I want

626
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:19,950
to thank you

627
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,589
for giving birth to me.

628
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:26,109
Thank you

629
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:29,869
for raising me all these years.

630
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:48,510
Go.

631
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,510
Don't miss the auspicious time.

632
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,470
You went to Prince An's mansion
to retrieve the flask last night.

633
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:56,550
Did you get it?

634
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:01,149
Not yet.

635
00:36:02,429 --> 00:36:03,770
We need to take our time
to plan this out.

636
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,589
Why?

637
00:36:06,429 --> 00:36:07,310
Since when

638
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,270
have you been this patient?

639
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,990
If this matter leaks out,

640
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,189
not only our overall situation
is at stake,

641
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,270
but also your wealth and life.

642
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,149
What did you do to Yuanxue?

643
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,629
(As the daughter of Prince An,)

644
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:26,909
(you're destined)

645
00:36:26,909 --> 00:36:28,349
(to never break away from the cage.)

646
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:30,109
(To break free forever,)

647
00:36:30,109 --> 00:36:31,189
(there's only one option.)

648
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:37,230
(Yuanxue,)

649
00:36:38,189 --> 00:36:38,909
(you can't!)

650
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,230
Out of the way!

651
00:36:44,589 --> 00:36:46,550
Young Master, we're almost here.

652
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,070
It looks like this task

653
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:48,829
is going pretty smoothly.

654
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,909
It's surprisingly

655
00:36:51,189 --> 00:36:52,149
smooth.

656
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,429
Why did you say that?

657
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,790
After all, this marriage

658
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:56,950
isn't what Yuanxue wants.

659
00:36:57,189 --> 00:36:58,429
I hope I'm overthinking it.

660
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:20,680
Move aside!

661
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,950
- Move aside!
- Don't just stand there.

662
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,030
Take that man down!

663
00:37:23,389 --> 00:37:24,470
If you want to save Lady Xue' life,

664
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:25,750
move aside now!

665
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,909
Lady Xue is poisoned
and in grave danger.

666
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,389
We can't afford to delay any longer.

667
00:37:30,109 --> 00:37:30,909
Return to the Mansion of Prince!

668
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:33,869
Is there no way at all?

669
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,990
Lady Xue consumed

670
00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:36,950
a highly toxic poison

671
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,149
in a large quantity.

672
00:37:38,669 --> 00:37:39,950
It's extremely difficult to treat.

673
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:41,990
Indeed.

674
00:37:42,189 --> 00:37:43,990
Last night, when I was checking
the medicinal ingredients inventory

675
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,149
at the Office of Medication,

676
00:37:45,669 --> 00:37:46,629
I noticed several components

677
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:48,470
of the poison were missing.

678
00:37:48,869 --> 00:37:49,909
Who could have guessed

679
00:37:50,389 --> 00:37:51,829
it was the Lady Xue who took them?

680
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,230
She consumed such a large amount.

681
00:37:53,909 --> 00:37:55,790
She's truly beyond saving now.

682
00:37:56,429 --> 00:37:57,510
Office of Medication?

683
00:38:03,589 --> 00:38:04,470
Our top priority

684
00:38:04,629 --> 00:38:05,790
is Yuanxue's life.

685
00:38:06,149 --> 00:38:06,790
Lv Beiyi,

686
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:08,470
you're a skilled physician.

687
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:09,550
Do you have a solution?

688
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,669
Do you?

689
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:16,950
We can only give it a try.

690
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:17,950
How are we going to try?

691
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,429
Using poison to fight poison.

692
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:20,950
Absolutely not!

693
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,510
That's right, Young Master.
You must think about this.

694
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:23,510
Lv Beiyi,

695
00:38:24,389 --> 00:38:25,629
I was wrong to trust you before.

696
00:38:26,589 --> 00:38:27,070
Can

697
00:38:28,109 --> 00:38:29,189
I trust you again now?

698
00:38:29,389 --> 00:38:30,710
I was able to enter Prince An's mansion

699
00:38:31,669 --> 00:38:33,550
and stand here.

700
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,270
Didn't I manage to do these

701
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,389
because you trusted me?

702
00:38:36,869 --> 00:38:37,990
You trusted me from the beginning

703
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,589
when I carried Lady Xue out

704
00:38:39,629 --> 00:38:40,990
from the wedding sedan.

705
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:45,310
Do as he says.

706
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:48,829
I'll bear all the consequences.

707
00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:04,109
Father, forgive me.

708
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,270
I failed in my duties.

709
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:09,589
Father,

710
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:10,909
Yuanxue is...

711
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:11,750
Don't mention her.

712
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,270
Your Highness,

713
00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:17,230
Madam Jing seeks an audience.

714
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:17,829
Denied.

715
00:39:22,349 --> 00:39:24,389
She failed to educate her daughter.

716
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,710
How dare she come to see me?

717
00:39:26,429 --> 00:39:27,149
Your Highness,

718
00:39:28,389 --> 00:39:29,909
Lady Xue's life
is hanging by the thread.

719
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:31,310
Madam Jing only wants you

720
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,629
to see Lady Xue.

721
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,589
Forgive me for being disrespectful.

722
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,550
What if anything bad happens
to Lady Xue,

723
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:42,589
it might be your last chance to see her.

724
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,829
She doesn't respect me

725
00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:49,869
as her father,

726
00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:52,950
why should I go and see her?

727
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,669
Before the wedding procession

728
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,510
even entered the groom's residence,

729
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,470
she had already taken her life
in the wedding sedan.

730
00:40:01,589 --> 00:40:02,589
By doing this,

731
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,070
she deliberately aimed

732
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,149
to tarnish my reputation in Quliang.

733
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,710
From that moment on,

734
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,869
she is no longer my daughter.

735
00:40:16,149 --> 00:40:17,109
Your Highness,

736
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:21,109
please go and see Yuanxue.

737
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,310
She is still unconscious.

738
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,149
We don't know if she'll ever regain
her consciousness.

739
00:40:28,189 --> 00:40:30,550
We also don't know how long
we can keep her alive.

740
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:34,990
Your Highness,
she may have made many mistakes.

741
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,909
But she's still your flesh and blood.

742
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:42,310
Are you really that heartless,
Your Highness?

743
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:43,990
Please.

744
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,030
I beg you.

745
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:50,230
Please, Your Highness.

746
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:50,790
Father,

747
00:40:52,109 --> 00:40:52,510
can't you...

748
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,510
It's not your place to speak!

749
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:55,950
I'm begging you.

750
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,189
Is this how you complete your task?

751
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:04,270
