=Episode 10=

17
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:00,671
Greetings, madams.

18
00:02:01,192 --> 00:02:01,712
Ms. Lian.

19
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:03,792
Just now, Young Master Xin
sent someone to Lianwei House.

20
00:02:03,911 --> 00:02:05,832
He said he wanted
to take you to Baizhen Lane.

21
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:14,511
I think there's good news for Ms. Lian.

22
00:02:14,951 --> 00:02:15,912
Baizhen Lane,

23
00:02:16,431 --> 00:02:17,112
as everyone knows,

24
00:02:17,552 --> 00:02:19,151
is Lianxin's favourite place.

25
00:02:20,951 --> 00:02:21,671
However, until now,

26
00:02:21,671 --> 00:02:23,760
he's never let his wives
and concubines accompany him there,

27
00:02:24,272 --> 00:02:25,552
myself included.

28
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:28,832
Madam,

29
00:02:30,032 --> 00:02:31,192
Su Nanchun has arrived.

30
00:02:35,552 --> 00:02:36,120
Let him in.

31
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:45,192
Madam Yao,

32
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,591
the prince just rewarded
a box of silk flowers to our mansion.

33
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:49,032
Young Master Xin knew you liked them.

34
00:02:49,032 --> 00:02:49,912
He sent me

35
00:02:49,912 --> 00:02:51,071
to deliver them promptly.

36
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:53,992
Are all in this box for me?

37
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:56,060
That's what Young Master Xin said.

38
00:02:56,431 --> 00:02:57,662
Doesn't his wife even get any?

39
00:02:57,912 --> 00:02:58,680
Young Master Xin said

40
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,280
that Official Mu had contributed a lot

41
00:03:00,392 --> 00:03:01,591
and as long as you liked it,

42
00:03:01,752 --> 00:03:02,951
everything would be yours.

43
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:04,151
He said it depended on you

44
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:06,192
whether others would have any.

45
00:03:09,832 --> 00:03:11,311
I'm flattered.

46
00:03:11,431 --> 00:03:12,752
Let Ms. Lian decide, shall we?

47
00:03:13,231 --> 00:03:13,912
I dare not.

48
00:03:14,032 --> 00:03:15,832
With all the love he has for you,

49
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:18,311
he could give you
the entire Langyue Hall,

50
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:20,392
not to mention a few fake flowers.

51
00:03:20,552 --> 00:03:21,311
Su Nanchun.

52
00:03:21,632 --> 00:03:22,871
Let Ms. Lian choose.

53
00:03:29,992 --> 00:03:31,112
Madam Yao, you see

54
00:03:31,112 --> 00:03:32,112
a few fake flowers,

55
00:03:32,431 --> 00:03:33,552
but I see

56
00:03:33,992 --> 00:03:36,272
the entire garden at our mansion.

57
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:38,151
I never realised

58
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,511
you could be a sweet talker.

59
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:44,032
Enough, choose a few.

60
00:03:44,272 --> 00:03:44,871
Yes.

61
00:03:48,992 --> 00:03:50,112
I know

62
00:03:50,192 --> 00:03:51,511
my place.

63
00:03:52,112 --> 00:03:53,192
I get to have a share

64
00:03:53,552 --> 00:03:54,231
because

65
00:03:54,392 --> 00:03:55,832
you have been gracious to me.

66
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:57,791
How could I overstep my boundaries?

67
00:03:58,511 --> 00:04:00,231
All right, put the flower on you.

68
00:04:01,112 --> 00:04:01,992
Thank you, Madam Yao.

69
00:04:16,431 --> 00:04:17,752
Ms. Lian, this bracelet

70
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:19,032
seems quite precious.

71
00:04:20,151 --> 00:04:21,632
It doesn't look like something
you would have.

72
00:04:23,192 --> 00:04:25,551
It's from my ancestors.
I've always worn it.

73
00:04:26,912 --> 00:04:28,320
Madams, please continue
your conversation.

74
00:04:28,512 --> 00:04:29,472
I'll make a move first.

75
00:04:36,912 --> 00:04:37,831
What are you doing?

76
00:04:42,952 --> 00:04:43,431
Do you see

77
00:04:43,431 --> 00:04:44,672
any inconsistency?

78
00:04:45,991 --> 00:04:46,952
I don't,

79
00:04:48,032 --> 00:04:49,192
but since when did it become

80
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:51,431
about trusting someone

81
00:04:51,752 --> 00:04:53,151
based on whether they slip up or not?

82
00:04:54,472 --> 00:04:55,391
It's not that.

83
00:04:56,912 --> 00:04:57,991
I can't fathom

84
00:04:57,991 --> 00:04:59,271
how someone who pretends to like us

85
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,192
would help

86
00:05:00,192 --> 00:05:01,472
her enemy's family

87
00:05:01,711 --> 00:05:03,551
and not give herself
any chance of making a comeback.

88
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:06,632
I'm tired. You should leave too.

89
00:05:11,192 --> 00:05:12,352
Let's hope

90
00:05:12,352 --> 00:05:13,271
this won't happen again.

91
00:05:34,952 --> 00:05:35,512
Young Master Xin.

92
00:05:35,792 --> 00:05:36,871
Why did you bring me here?

93
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:38,151
What else can you do here

94
00:05:38,632 --> 00:05:39,512
but to spend money?

95
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:44,151
Young Master Xin,

96
00:05:44,752 --> 00:05:46,311
welcome. Your presence is an honour.

97
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,391
Come on, have a seat.

98
00:05:50,192 --> 00:05:50,831
Recently,

99
00:05:51,111 --> 00:05:52,311
we've received a batch

100
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:53,672
of excellent items in our shop.

101
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:54,871
I'd like you to take a look.

102
00:05:55,111 --> 00:05:55,591
Come on,

103
00:05:55,711 --> 00:05:56,352
bring them over.

104
00:05:56,512 --> 00:05:56,991
All right.

105
00:05:59,111 --> 00:06:00,072
Have some tea.

106
00:06:00,072 --> 00:06:00,752
Thank you.

107
00:06:04,271 --> 00:06:05,551
Young Master Xin, look at this.

108
00:06:07,591 --> 00:06:09,072
It's quite nice.

109
00:06:11,952 --> 00:06:13,752
Many have tried on these earrings,

110
00:06:15,472 --> 00:06:16,991
but none looks

111
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:18,271
as good as you do with them.

112
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:19,551
If I put the scallion

113
00:06:19,632 --> 00:06:20,912
on this large pancake,

114
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,032
it is ready to be served.

115
00:06:23,111 --> 00:06:24,311
You must be joking, Young Master Xin.

116
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:26,192
How can a face the size of a palm

117
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:27,352
look like a cake?

118
00:06:28,151 --> 00:06:29,551
I have something even better.

119
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:30,632
Bring it over.

120
00:06:30,952 --> 00:06:31,431
Yes.

121
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:34,920
Young Master Xin, take a look at this one.

122
00:06:40,072 --> 00:06:41,752
The colour is good.

123
00:06:45,512 --> 00:06:46,952
With a scale beam like this

124
00:06:48,472 --> 00:06:50,271
and a weight,

125
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,632
it's the perfect match

126
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,032
for the large pancake.

127
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:58,232
Young Master Xin.

128
00:06:58,391 --> 00:06:59,912
All these

129
00:06:59,912 --> 00:07:00,952
are the treasures of our store.

130
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:02,431
If you don't fancy anything here,

131
00:07:02,711 --> 00:07:04,352
we truly have nothing left.

132
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,151
You're being too humble, Mr. Zhang.

133
00:07:06,391 --> 00:07:08,072
If even your shop has nothing to offer,

134
00:07:08,072 --> 00:07:09,151
where else in Baizhen Lane

135
00:07:09,271 --> 00:07:10,632
can one shop?

136
00:07:12,151 --> 00:07:13,912
I'm not being humble.

137
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:16,551
You've almost browsed through
the entire Baizhen Lane.

138
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:18,632
If you found something you liked here,

139
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:19,512
we

140
00:07:19,752 --> 00:07:21,151
would be honoured.

141
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:24,752
Unfortunately,
your standards are too high.

142
00:07:25,072 --> 00:07:27,232
My shop has
truly run out of precious stuff.

143
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,311
Are you saying
that you've brought out everything?

144
00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:32,632
We've brought out all of them.

145
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:35,752
Really?

146
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:38,871
Didn't you purchase

147
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:41,072
golden leaf filigree glass beads yesterday

148
00:07:41,551 --> 00:07:43,192
from Lecture Bureau's Official Qi?

149
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,752
On the day before that,

150
00:07:44,871 --> 00:07:47,431
you acquired the peony-patterned
porcelain vase from Official Feng

151
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:49,512
at the Magistrate's Office?

152
00:07:50,952 --> 00:07:51,472
Also,

153
00:07:52,232 --> 00:07:54,151
you even bought a silver platter
with scale-patterned enamel

154
00:07:54,151 --> 00:07:56,512
from Mr. Zuo.

155
00:07:56,991 --> 00:07:58,672
They were all purchased
at extremely low prices.

156
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:00,591
Where are these items? Show them to me.

157
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:02,711
Look.

158
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:05,120
I can't hide anything from you,
Young Master Xin.

159
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,151
I did buy those items,

160
00:08:07,512 --> 00:08:08,600
but as you know, it's business

161
00:08:08,672 --> 00:08:09,991
and it's all about buying and selling.

162
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:11,391
Those items

163
00:08:11,831 --> 00:08:12,600
have been sold already.

164
00:08:13,072 --> 00:08:14,360
- All of them?
- All of them.

165
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,640
- They're sold so quickly?
- Yes.

166
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,960
- All to one person?
- Right.

167
00:08:17,991 --> 00:08:19,431
Who was so generous?

168
00:08:20,912 --> 00:08:23,151
The buyer wishes to remain anonymous.

169
00:08:23,831 --> 00:08:25,792
Young Master Xin,
you understand the rules.

170
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:27,512
Please don't make it difficult for me.

171
00:08:36,192 --> 00:08:37,552
How long do you want to shop?

172
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:40,312
We'll shop until we
find something you like.

173
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:43,071
Do you mean shop
until I find something I like

174
00:08:43,071 --> 00:08:44,151
or until you figure out

175
00:08:44,151 --> 00:08:45,472
the secrets of Baizhen Lane?

176
00:08:47,472 --> 00:08:49,751
Lately, Official Mu has worked hard.

177
00:08:49,751 --> 00:08:52,112
If you want to reward anyone,
you should reward him.

178
00:08:52,672 --> 00:08:53,591
I'm a bit tired.

179
00:08:54,511 --> 00:08:55,432
Let me rest for a while.

180
00:08:56,232 --> 00:08:57,151
Waiter, bring some tea.

181
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:00,112
Didn't you contribute too?

182
00:09:00,312 --> 00:09:01,711
Haven't you been busy lately?

183
00:09:02,831 --> 00:09:03,711
What could I be busy with?

184
00:09:04,232 --> 00:09:05,672
I'm staying home all day.

185
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,032
How could I be busy?

186
00:09:08,831 --> 00:09:09,672
Why

187
00:09:10,032 --> 00:09:11,112
haven't I seen Li Tang?

188
00:09:11,472 --> 00:09:13,992
He said he had some family matters
and applied leave.

189
00:09:14,232 --> 00:09:15,160
He went home for a few days.

190
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:15,912
He'll be back today.

191
00:09:16,672 --> 00:09:17,951
How come I heard

192
00:09:18,112 --> 00:09:19,472
that someone saw him

193
00:09:19,472 --> 00:09:21,470
outside the house of my fifth
sister-in-law's younger brother

194
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,780
who has stolen
money from the Treasury.

195
00:09:26,751 --> 00:09:28,951
First, you provided a false testimony
to get Huairui punished.

196
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:30,472
Then, you provided information

197
00:09:30,472 --> 00:09:31,872
to help Mu Tianshu to gain merit.

198
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:32,992
It seems like everything

199
00:09:32,992 --> 00:09:35,151
is going according to Haiyao's plan.

200
00:09:35,511 --> 00:09:36,951
What's your plan, girl?

201
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,112
I don't quite understand.

202
00:09:40,432 --> 00:09:41,271
You know

203
00:09:41,271 --> 00:09:42,352
that Madam Rui was wronged,

204
00:09:42,672 --> 00:09:44,112
yet you're going with the flow.

205
00:09:44,912 --> 00:09:46,312
Aren't we planning

206
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:48,151
for the same thing?

207
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:51,271
I don't have any plan.

208
00:09:52,271 --> 00:09:53,831
I'm just the Idle Young Master,

209
00:09:54,191 --> 00:09:55,271
who wants to spend my days

210
00:09:55,271 --> 00:09:56,872
in this world of art and culture.

211
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:58,591
Are you?

212
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,191
However, I've heard recently

213
00:10:00,191 --> 00:10:00,831
that Baizhen Lane

214
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,992
has been extremely merry.

215
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:03,711
All the high-ranking officials and nobles

216
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:04,912
are selling their treasures

217
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,071
to pay off their debts.

218
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:08,831
Who wants to pay back

219
00:10:08,831 --> 00:10:10,032
and who doesn't?

220
00:10:10,271 --> 00:10:11,872
It's all in this world of art and culture.

221
00:10:17,432 --> 00:10:18,591
What else

222
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:19,552
do you know?

223
00:10:20,711 --> 00:10:21,631
I do know something.

224
00:10:21,992 --> 00:10:23,151
Whenever you feel awkward,

225
00:10:23,151 --> 00:10:24,912
you'll speak in a prolonged manner.

226
00:10:28,951 --> 00:10:30,751
You're so smumg.

227
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:32,872
Hey, let go.

228
00:10:34,032 --> 00:10:34,631
Let go.

229
00:11:06,352 --> 00:11:09,951
The one I think of year after year?

230
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:12,872
Only you and I know the feeling.

231
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:14,191
Shopkeeper,

232
00:11:14,271 --> 00:11:15,552
please pack this ring.

233
00:11:18,452 --> 00:11:19,800
It's quite unfortunate, Young Master Xin.

234
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,552
This ring has already been reserved.

235
00:11:22,151 --> 00:11:24,151
Reserved again? Who reserved it?

236
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:24,792
This...

237
00:11:26,792 --> 00:11:28,992
I see. The person
wants to remain anonymous.

238
00:11:29,432 --> 00:11:30,472
I'm sorry, Young Master Xin.

239
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,271
Everything is fated.

240
00:11:34,591 --> 00:11:35,751
It's fated to acquire something

241
00:11:35,751 --> 00:11:37,391
or not.

242
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:42,831
Not getting it now

243
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,432
doesn't mean you won't
get it in the future.

244
00:11:46,352 --> 00:11:46,872
Girl.

245
00:11:47,872 --> 00:11:50,112
Fate is an effect, not a cause.

246
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:55,711
There's nothing of value here.

247
00:11:55,711 --> 00:11:56,591
Who would buy them?

248
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,640
If I didn't keep some
of Official Li's belongings,

249
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,591
he wouldn't leave.

250
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:01,751
He said he's in a hurry
to repay the debt.

251
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:03,760
I only agreed to sell them for him.

252
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,432
Sell them for him?

253
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,792
That's if someone wants to buy them.

254
00:12:06,631 --> 00:12:07,191
Go.

255
00:12:07,191 --> 00:12:07,951
Throw them away.

256
00:12:08,552 --> 00:12:10,232
Wait, these things...

257
00:12:10,591 --> 00:12:11,980
Don't get the wrong idea,
Young Master Xin.

258
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,232
My shop never deals
with these low-quality items.

259
00:12:14,312 --> 00:12:16,032
I was pestered and had no choice.

260
00:12:17,992 --> 00:12:20,032
I'm taking these.

261
00:12:33,477 --> 00:12:34,940
(Li's Residence)

262
00:12:38,511 --> 00:12:39,751
Do you know whose house this is?

263
00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:46,717
(Li's Residence)

264
00:12:59,391 --> 00:13:00,032
Don't take it.

265
00:13:02,751 --> 00:13:03,432
Please come down.

266
00:13:05,312 --> 00:13:06,032
Be careful.

267
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,000
(Li Qianmo's Father, Official Li)
Greetings, Young Master Xin.

268
00:13:11,672 --> 00:13:13,191
Father-in-law, please get up.

269
00:13:20,391 --> 00:13:20,912
Your Highness.

270
00:13:22,191 --> 00:13:23,872
Young Master Xin has left Baizhen Lane.

271
00:13:27,511 --> 00:13:28,672
Is everything done?

272
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:30,751
It's almost done.

273
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,151
First, he discovered the smuggling
in the Treasury

274
00:13:33,151 --> 00:13:36,160
and pressured Young Master Zuo and others
to take the lead in repaying the money.

275
00:13:36,312 --> 00:13:38,032
He's at Baizhen Lane now
to observe the situation

276
00:13:38,232 --> 00:13:39,112
and control it.

277
00:13:39,831 --> 00:13:41,792
The difficult task
of collecting the debts

278
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:43,631
is cleverly managed

279
00:13:43,951 --> 00:13:45,071
by Young Master Xin.

280
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:50,071
I don't know

281
00:13:50,591 --> 00:13:52,151
if Young Master Xin has passed your test.

282
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:56,312
Yu Dechang.

283
00:13:57,352 --> 00:13:57,831
Yes.

284
00:13:59,112 --> 00:14:00,432
Have you noticed anything

285
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,120
that doesn't seem right
about this situation?

286
00:14:07,432 --> 00:14:08,232
It all appears

287
00:14:09,872 --> 00:14:10,912
too calm

288
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:12,992
and too smooth, doesn't it?

289
00:14:23,271 --> 00:14:24,112
Just wait and see.

290
00:14:24,711 --> 00:14:26,280
The most heart-pounding
part of the story

291
00:14:27,792 --> 00:14:30,232
has yet to happen.

292
00:14:30,553 --> 00:14:32,880
(Li's Residence)

293
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:46,560
I never thought that Madam Mo would
be so lucky to have such kind father.

294
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,960
Other people borrow from the Treasury

295
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,232
for their own indulgences,

296
00:14:49,672 --> 00:14:50,391
but Official Li

297
00:14:51,352 --> 00:14:52,792
did it to help the poor.

298
00:14:53,992 --> 00:14:55,872
I remember the first time

299
00:14:55,992 --> 00:14:57,271
I met him a few years ago.

300
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:58,880
There was also a flood happend.

301
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:01,912
He sold his own fur coat

302
00:15:02,552 --> 00:15:03,872
to buy grain for the disaster victims.

303
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:04,912
I asked him,

304
00:15:04,912 --> 00:15:06,160
"How would you pass the winter?

305
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,792
Are you going
to sell all your silk clothes?"

306
00:15:08,171 --> 00:15:09,032
Do you know what he said?

307
00:15:09,032 --> 00:15:09,751
What did he say?

308
00:15:10,552 --> 00:15:11,112
He said

309
00:15:12,151 --> 00:15:12,792
that he had already

310
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:14,240
sold his silk clothes the previous year.

311
00:15:15,751 --> 00:15:16,951
At that moment, I thought

312
00:15:17,312 --> 00:15:18,711
that he was truly a good official.

313
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:20,631
No matter what,

314
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:22,151
I couldn't let him down.

315
00:15:22,992 --> 00:15:23,552
Unfortunately,

316
00:15:24,711 --> 00:15:26,951
aside from clearing his debt,

317
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:29,312
there's not much I can do for him.

318
00:15:30,232 --> 00:15:31,312
I just hope

319
00:15:31,391 --> 00:15:32,391
that Qianmo's child

320
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:33,591
can be born safely.

321
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:36,552
I'll take good care

322
00:15:37,432 --> 00:15:38,391
of the child.

323
00:15:39,432 --> 00:15:42,071
Aren't you afraid
that people will say you're unfair?

324
00:15:42,391 --> 00:15:43,071
Unfair?

325
00:15:43,672 --> 00:15:44,312
In this world,

326
00:15:44,591 --> 00:15:46,232
there's good and bad, rich and poor,

327
00:15:46,232 --> 00:15:47,151
and injustice everywhere.

328
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:50,312
I only believe
in one person's conscience.

329
00:16:05,352 --> 00:16:06,232
What's the matter, girl?

330
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:09,711
Do you suddenly think I'm not so bad

331
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:11,112
after all?

332
00:16:13,391 --> 00:16:14,112
Lv Beiyi

333
00:16:14,472 --> 00:16:15,312
isn't the only good man

334
00:16:15,312 --> 00:16:16,060
in the world.

335
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,352
Look at him being all stern and rigid.

336
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:18,151
What's good about him?

337
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:22,391
I'm much better than him
who's like a cold and hard stone, right?

338
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:24,912
Aren't you tired

339
00:16:24,912 --> 00:16:25,992
of teasing me every day?

340
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:31,232
Why would I tease you?

341
00:16:31,711 --> 00:16:33,511
You're the treasure I obtained

342
00:16:33,511 --> 00:16:35,112
with a great horse.

343
00:16:35,112 --> 00:16:37,391
I cherish you more than you can imagine.

344
00:16:38,032 --> 00:16:38,631
Really?

345
00:16:39,151 --> 00:16:40,992
Do you really like me that much?

346
00:16:43,591 --> 00:16:44,672
If you like me so much,

347
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:46,872
you must be willing
to do whatever I want.

348
00:16:48,232 --> 00:16:49,472
I think

349
00:16:49,472 --> 00:16:51,312
there are too many women in your house.

350
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:51,951
I want you

351
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:53,151
to get rid

352
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:54,191
of all your women.

353
00:16:56,631 --> 00:16:57,672
Since you

354
00:16:58,831 --> 00:17:00,711
love the beauty more than power,

355
00:17:01,992 --> 00:17:03,872
then the Fang and Mu families

356
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:05,312
are useless.

357
00:17:05,672 --> 00:17:08,071
Even the title of your father
becomes meaningless.

358
00:17:08,552 --> 00:17:09,151
Why don't we

359
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:12,271
elope and live happily together
under the moon and stars?

360
00:17:13,192 --> 00:17:14,032
Wouldn't that be better?

361
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:21,631
If you're afraid,

362
00:17:22,072 --> 00:17:24,712
please keep your distance
from me in the future.

363
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:46,952
I'm not a servant.

364
00:17:48,072 --> 00:17:50,672
Where did this girl learn all this?

365
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:05,192
Miss, it's Young Master Xin.

366
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,991
I told you not to turn around.

367
00:18:10,511 --> 00:18:11,432
What should we do now?

368
00:18:13,432 --> 00:18:14,072
Follow me.

369
00:18:19,271 --> 00:18:20,111
Quick.

370
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:26,832
Yuanxue.

371
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:29,792
Is that you, Yuanxue?

372
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:33,912
Yuanxue.

373
00:18:39,672 --> 00:18:40,231
What's wrong?

374
00:18:43,111 --> 00:18:43,672
Nothing.

375
00:18:44,192 --> 00:18:45,672
Maybe I was mistaken.

376
00:18:49,391 --> 00:18:50,552
It's all right. Let's go.

377
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,511
My Lady, let's go back.

378
00:19:02,991 --> 00:19:04,871
We'll go back when I've seen
whatever I want to see.

379
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:05,912
However, we...

380
00:19:24,111 --> 00:19:25,871
What if your father finds out

381
00:19:26,072 --> 00:19:27,312
we've gone out without his permission?

382
00:19:27,712 --> 00:19:28,420
Forget about that.

383
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,440
(He Yunshuo's Daughter)
As long as we return before nightfall,

384
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,391
(He Yuanxue)
no one will know.

385
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:35,391
Who are you?

386
00:19:35,712 --> 00:19:36,312
Stay away!

387
00:19:37,032 --> 00:19:37,760
What are you doing?

388
00:19:39,351 --> 00:19:40,032
Lady Xue.

389
00:19:40,832 --> 00:19:42,991
Lady Xue.

390
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,712
Why did you try to kill me?

391
00:19:54,712 --> 00:19:56,111
You got in the way of Young Master Xiu.

392
00:20:39,111 --> 00:20:40,511
Enjoy your meal, sir.

393
00:20:40,871 --> 00:20:41,511
Eat and drink well.

394
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:44,120
Sir, would you like anything to drink?

395
00:20:47,071 --> 00:20:48,200
May I borrow this for a moment?

396
00:20:48,471 --> 00:20:51,192
Hello, brother. Eight horses.

397
00:21:00,672 --> 00:21:01,312
Help me.

398
00:21:02,672 --> 00:21:04,231
Thank you, sir.
Have a pleasant journey.

399
00:21:04,912 --> 00:21:05,511
Excuse me.

400
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:08,040
Here's your liquor.

401
00:21:08,192 --> 00:21:08,832
Let me tell you,

402
00:21:08,832 --> 00:21:09,832
This is the last of it.

403
00:21:09,952 --> 00:21:11,391
Go somewhere else tomorrow.

404
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:12,751
It's okay if you come alone,

405
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:13,351
but you brought

406
00:21:13,351 --> 00:21:14,511
a friend with you.

407
00:21:14,511 --> 00:21:15,792
I'm talking to you. Do you hear me?

408
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,231
Also, you

409
00:21:17,712 --> 00:21:18,631
seem feminine.

410
00:21:18,631 --> 00:21:19,792
You don't look like a good person.

411
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:20,631
Keep your voice down.

412
00:21:35,072 --> 00:21:35,471
Sorry!

413
00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:36,792
- Why are you in such a hurry?
- Sorry!

414
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:38,072
What's the rush?

415
00:21:42,271 --> 00:21:43,480
Can't you see where you're going?

416
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,680
What kind of person is this?

417
00:22:13,351 --> 00:22:15,432
Help! Is anyone there?

418
00:22:15,432 --> 00:22:15,991
Help...

419
00:22:21,672 --> 00:22:22,552
Don't come any closer.

420
00:22:22,912 --> 00:22:23,432
You...

421
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:28,871
Do you know who I am?

422
00:22:31,871 --> 00:22:32,312
I...

423
00:24:03,912 --> 00:24:05,511
Red beans on the dice.

424
00:24:05,832 --> 00:24:07,832
Do you know how much I miss you?

425
00:24:08,471 --> 00:24:09,871
In the future, when you drink,

426
00:24:10,151 --> 00:24:11,712
you'll see how much I miss you.

427
00:24:11,712 --> 00:24:13,280
Let's see if you would
still dare to do it.

428
00:24:40,151 --> 00:24:43,471
Can you please take me somewhere?

429
00:24:48,032 --> 00:24:48,991
Just tell me

430
00:24:49,471 --> 00:24:50,271
whatever you want.

431
00:24:50,712 --> 00:24:51,792
I will make sure...

432
00:24:52,072 --> 00:24:54,032
I just want to peacefully
retrieve my jug

433
00:24:54,032 --> 00:24:55,991
and find a place to drink quietly.

434
00:24:57,832 --> 00:24:59,351
If you keep making noise,

435
00:25:00,471 --> 00:25:02,560
I'll make sure you won't be able
to speak in the future.

436
00:25:10,072 --> 00:25:10,991
Greetings, Madam Rou.

437
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,111
Why did you come unannounced?

438
00:25:15,832 --> 00:25:17,360
(Xu Jirou's Maid, Huafu)
Huafu, bring some tea.

439
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:17,751
Yes.

440
00:25:20,072 --> 00:25:22,151
It's been a while since I was released
from my confinement

441
00:25:22,832 --> 00:25:24,312
and I hadn't come
to visit you, Madam Rou.

442
00:25:24,631 --> 00:25:25,672
Please forgive me.

443
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:30,912
It's late and you've come to see me.

444
00:25:31,192 --> 00:25:32,271
It's very kind of you.

445
00:25:37,751 --> 00:25:39,672
Hui'er's bracelet isn't
suitable for you.

446
00:25:40,792 --> 00:25:41,860
If you wear it for a long time,

447
00:25:42,231 --> 00:25:43,312
it will hurt you.

448
00:25:49,351 --> 00:25:50,111
I didn't expect

449
00:25:50,672 --> 00:25:51,712
that you had such deep feelings

450
00:25:51,712 --> 00:25:52,592
for Madam Yao.

451
00:25:53,111 --> 00:25:54,511
I'm impressed.

452
00:25:55,351 --> 00:25:56,072
I have

453
00:25:56,432 --> 00:25:57,792
a message for you.

454
00:25:58,751 --> 00:26:00,672
Insincerity begets insincerity,

455
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:03,751
while truthfulness
may not beget truthfulness.

456
00:26:04,432 --> 00:26:05,640
When you sleep with the tiger,

457
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,271
watch out,

458
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,552
you might be hurt one day.

459
00:26:12,192 --> 00:26:12,871
Dongli, let's go.

460
00:26:23,552 --> 00:26:25,111
When Madam Rou returned,

461
00:26:25,231 --> 00:26:26,631
did you notice her hands?

462
00:26:27,631 --> 00:26:28,631
What happened to her hands?

463
00:26:31,271 --> 00:26:32,072
They were very red.

464
00:26:33,991 --> 00:26:35,271
I deliberately touched them

465
00:26:36,871 --> 00:26:38,032
and they felt like ice,

466
00:26:38,751 --> 00:26:39,712
like a pair of hands

467
00:26:39,712 --> 00:26:41,032
exposed to the harsh winter.

468
00:26:41,192 --> 00:26:42,511
What does that mean?

469
00:26:43,432 --> 00:26:44,592
It's not winter now.

470
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:48,072
Where did she go

471
00:26:48,952 --> 00:26:50,552
to have made her hands so cold?

472
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:53,991
The Ice Chamber.

473
00:26:54,672 --> 00:26:56,032
It's not summer.

474
00:26:57,231 --> 00:26:58,360
What would she be doing there

475
00:26:58,672 --> 00:27:00,471
so late at night?

476
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:04,792
Ms. Lian, be careful.

477
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,600
Ms. Lian, take it slow.

478
00:27:10,592 --> 00:27:12,032
It's so cold.

479
00:27:12,751 --> 00:27:13,672
It's all ice here.

480
00:27:14,552 --> 00:27:15,672
Is there really something there?

481
00:27:40,631 --> 00:27:41,751
Ms. Lian, does that mean...

482
00:27:43,432 --> 00:27:44,500
The children will be exchanged.

483
00:28:03,751 --> 00:28:04,600
Have a rest.

484
00:28:05,952 --> 00:28:06,920
He doesn't dare to come in.

485
00:28:11,511 --> 00:28:12,592
He doesn't dare

486
00:28:13,511 --> 00:28:14,471
because you're here.

487
00:28:16,471 --> 00:28:17,880
However, you're going
to leave eventually.

488
00:28:20,351 --> 00:28:23,552
He's waiting for you to leave.

489
00:28:24,631 --> 00:28:26,231
You mentioned that you
wanted to go somewhere.

490
00:28:27,312 --> 00:28:27,952
Where is it?

491
00:28:29,672 --> 00:28:30,432
Kongxin Temple.

492
00:28:34,952 --> 00:28:36,871
Is the life of
a wealthy young lady too leisurely,

493
00:28:37,391 --> 00:28:39,471
that you want
to play the game of becoming a nun?

494
00:28:39,912 --> 00:28:40,952
You wouldn't understand.

495
00:29:04,312 --> 00:29:05,712
Since I was born,

496
00:29:08,351 --> 00:29:09,151
this is my first time

497
00:29:09,151 --> 00:29:10,271
seeing the moon outside.

498
00:29:19,952 --> 00:29:21,151
The place I live

499
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,592
is like

500
00:29:25,471 --> 00:29:27,792
a grave,

501
00:29:29,312 --> 00:29:30,880
piled up with beautiful clothes
and jewellery.

502
00:29:31,712 --> 00:29:33,391
The only way to leave

503
00:29:34,271 --> 00:29:35,511
is to marry

504
00:29:35,871 --> 00:29:36,912
a rich and powerful man

505
00:29:36,912 --> 00:29:37,751
I've never met before.

506
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:40,192
Then I would move to another grave.

507
00:29:42,751 --> 00:29:44,072
Since I have no way

508
00:29:44,871 --> 00:29:46,751
of living an ordinary life.

509
00:29:49,592 --> 00:29:51,192
I can at least seek refuge
in monastic life

510
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,520
and the tranquillity
of the ancient lamps and Buddhas.

511
00:29:56,312 --> 00:29:57,672
An ordinary life?

512
00:29:59,871 --> 00:30:00,712
Do you know

513
00:30:00,712 --> 00:30:01,751
what an ordinary life is?

514
00:30:09,471 --> 00:30:10,552
One rises at sunrise

515
00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:13,391
and retires at sunset.

516
00:30:16,432 --> 00:30:17,552
Simple meals

517
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,240
and mutual support
between family members.

518
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:24,912
You're so sheltered.

519
00:30:27,672 --> 00:30:28,312
Let me tell you

520
00:30:28,312 --> 00:30:29,792
about an ordinary life.

521
00:30:32,432 --> 00:30:34,032
Have you ever tried

522
00:30:35,151 --> 00:30:36,151
losing everything overnight

523
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:39,231
and watching your family, young and old,

524
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:41,520
hanging themselves in front of you?

525
00:30:43,271 --> 00:30:44,271
Have you tried

526
00:30:45,471 --> 00:30:46,751
being well-educated,

527
00:30:48,312 --> 00:30:49,871
but discarded like worn-out shoes

528
00:30:50,871 --> 00:30:52,832
and trampled like weeds?

529
00:30:56,712 --> 00:30:57,631
Have you tried

530
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,672
being on the verge

531
00:31:05,672 --> 00:31:07,111
of marrying your beloved,

532
00:31:08,151 --> 00:31:10,192
only to have her

533
00:31:11,592 --> 00:31:13,072
snatched away

534
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:13,871
by another man?

535
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:21,151
When you've experienced all this,

536
00:31:22,231 --> 00:31:23,111
come and talk to me

537
00:31:23,111 --> 00:31:24,151
about an ordinary life.

538
00:31:38,792 --> 00:31:39,471
Lianxin,

539
00:31:40,391 --> 00:31:42,312
please come back early tonight.

540
00:31:44,672 --> 00:31:45,912
I'm about to give birth.

541
00:31:47,391 --> 00:31:48,511
Without your company,

542
00:31:49,271 --> 00:31:50,511
I'm worried.

543
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,312
I won't be back early today.

544
00:31:55,751 --> 00:31:57,471
Although we have enough
money for the flood relief,

545
00:31:57,631 --> 00:31:59,312
I still need to escort

546
00:31:59,832 --> 00:32:01,080
the official funds from the Treasury.

547
00:32:02,552 --> 00:32:03,511
You're delicate.

548
00:32:04,432 --> 00:32:06,271
Am I not accompanying you
for meals early in the morning?

549
00:32:06,271 --> 00:32:07,111
Isn't that enough?

550
00:32:07,511 --> 00:32:08,351
I can't stay away

551
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:09,631
from you for even a day.

552
00:32:13,072 --> 00:32:13,991
Look,

553
00:32:13,991 --> 00:32:15,832
I even peeled the egg for you.

554
00:32:16,712 --> 00:32:17,832
Stop bothering me.

555
00:32:19,432 --> 00:32:20,471
I'm just teasing you.

556
00:32:22,432 --> 00:32:24,432
Young Master Xin!

557
00:32:25,032 --> 00:32:25,731
Official Mu is here,

558
00:32:25,991 --> 00:32:26,712
waiting outside.

559
00:32:27,751 --> 00:32:28,351
Just right.

560
00:32:28,751 --> 00:32:29,471
Let him in.

561
00:32:29,792 --> 00:32:31,312
You two

562
00:32:31,312 --> 00:32:32,111
can have a good chat.

563
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,520
Official Mu said that many commoners
were protesting in front

564
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,760
of Testaments and Treasures Bureau.

565
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,960
He asked you to go and take a look.

566
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:39,312
They don't owe the treasury money.

567
00:32:39,511 --> 00:32:40,631
Why are they causing trouble?

568
00:32:40,631 --> 00:32:41,312
Official Li...

569
00:32:43,032 --> 00:32:44,000
He took his own life.

570
00:32:48,692 --> 00:32:50,914
(Loan Reminder
from Testaments and Treasures Bureau)

571
00:32:57,871 --> 00:32:58,471
Su Nanchun,

572
00:32:59,072 --> 00:33:00,172
look for Official Mu immediately

573
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:02,072
and have him appease
the protesting commoners.

574
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:03,432
Tell him

575
00:33:03,832 --> 00:33:04,592
I've already

576
00:33:04,592 --> 00:33:05,832
cleared Official Li's debt.

577
00:33:05,832 --> 00:33:07,312
There's no reason for him
to commit suicide.

578
00:33:07,912 --> 00:33:11,160
Also, I will also investigate the truth
and provide an explanation to everyone.

579
00:33:11,832 --> 00:33:12,192
Go.

580
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,552
Lianxin.

581
00:33:17,672 --> 00:33:19,471
What about Mo?

582
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:20,511
Don't tell her.

583
00:33:22,312 --> 00:33:24,351
Her pregnancy is unstable.
She can't handle this.

584
00:33:32,712 --> 00:33:33,391
She will have to

585
00:33:34,391 --> 00:33:35,912
endure even more soon.

586
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,391
Madam. Madam Ye has arrived.

587
00:33:41,912 --> 00:33:42,832
Why is she here?

588
00:33:43,631 --> 00:33:44,871
Greetings, Madam Yao.

589
00:33:46,552 --> 00:33:47,280
Please have a seat.

590
00:33:47,832 --> 00:33:49,192
What a rare guest.

591
00:33:51,312 --> 00:33:51,751
Have you

592
00:33:51,751 --> 00:33:53,192
not been to Madam Rui's place recently?

593
00:33:53,712 --> 00:33:55,832
I do have a desire
to be of service to her,

594
00:33:56,312 --> 00:33:57,871
but when I told her frankly,

595
00:33:58,351 --> 00:33:59,712
she didn't even

596
00:33:59,832 --> 00:34:01,192
open the curtain.

597
00:34:01,552 --> 00:34:02,871
She is meticulous.

598
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:04,792
Someone ordinary like me
can't get close to her.

599
00:34:05,792 --> 00:34:06,672
So, today,

600
00:34:07,432 --> 00:34:09,592
I came to seek a different master.

601
00:34:10,511 --> 00:34:11,832
What kind of place

602
00:34:11,832 --> 00:34:12,952
do you think this is?

603
00:34:13,352 --> 00:34:14,471
I appreciate

604
00:34:14,471 --> 00:34:15,751
your kind intentions.

605
00:34:16,511 --> 00:34:18,191
Although I'm insignificant,

606
00:34:19,511 --> 00:34:21,271
I don't need your service.

607
00:34:22,911 --> 00:34:24,592
Please go. I shall not see you off.

608
00:34:26,592 --> 00:34:27,751
You don't need my service,

609
00:34:28,312 --> 00:34:29,770
but what about the secret
in the Ice Chamber?

610
00:34:34,392 --> 00:34:34,832
What?

611
00:34:38,392 --> 00:34:39,471
If this mansion

612
00:34:39,632 --> 00:34:41,191
truly has no place for me,

613
00:34:41,751 --> 00:34:43,312
it might not be a bad idea for me

614
00:34:43,511 --> 00:34:44,552
to lie in the Ice Chamber

615
00:34:44,991 --> 00:34:45,991
like your child.

616
00:34:49,112 --> 00:34:50,352
You're talking nonsense

617
00:34:50,352 --> 00:34:51,511
early in the morning.

618
00:34:51,991 --> 00:34:53,632
How come I don't understand
a word you're saying?

619
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,431
You don't understand?

620
00:34:55,911 --> 00:34:57,072
I wonder if Lianxin does.

621
00:34:58,191 --> 00:34:59,671
Are you trying to threaten me?

622
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:00,880
(Testaments and Treasures Bureau)

623
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,011
Official Li was a good official!

624
00:35:02,231 --> 00:35:03,552
He died under such pressure!

625
00:35:04,152 --> 00:35:05,492
Exactly. If it weren't for Official Li,

626
00:35:05,492 --> 00:35:07,072
our entire family would
have starved to death!

627
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:09,592
- We want to see Young Master Xin!
- We want to see Young Master Xin!

628
00:35:09,592 --> 00:35:16,392
We want to see Young Master Xin!

629
00:35:16,911 --> 00:35:18,832
Sir, the commoners
are causing a serious disturbance.

630
00:35:18,832 --> 00:35:19,832
It might not be good for you.

631
00:35:19,832 --> 00:35:20,760
Should I send the troops?

632
00:35:21,991 --> 00:35:23,431
It's a big deal to deliver the money.

633
00:35:24,231 --> 00:35:25,112
Just let them be.

634
00:35:25,951 --> 00:35:26,720
Use the back door.

635
00:35:26,911 --> 00:35:27,352
Yes.

636
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:36,471
Yuanxue?

637
00:36:37,191 --> 00:36:37,832
Lianchu.

638
00:36:40,592 --> 00:36:41,911
Stop, have a rest.

639
00:36:52,152 --> 00:36:53,471
Madam, if you can't take it,

640
00:36:53,671 --> 00:36:54,991
let's go back today

641
00:36:55,231 --> 00:36:56,112
and walk tomorrow.

642
00:36:56,471 --> 00:36:57,471
I'm enduring it

643
00:36:58,951 --> 00:37:00,431
for a better future.

644
00:37:02,152 --> 00:37:02,832
I hope I can

645
00:37:02,832 --> 00:37:04,751
give birth to a son
without any complication.

646
00:37:05,352 --> 00:37:06,231
It's almost time, Madam.

647
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:07,352
Just one more month.

648
00:37:08,671 --> 00:37:11,392
Yes, only one more month.

649
00:37:12,352 --> 00:37:12,991
Really?

650
00:37:13,152 --> 00:37:13,872
Is there no doubt?

651
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,552
I heard it directly from Young Master Xin.

652
00:37:15,991 --> 00:37:16,592
He also said

653
00:37:16,592 --> 00:37:18,312
that Madam Mo must not know this.

654
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:19,471
So, what's the reason?

655
00:37:19,632 --> 00:37:20,792
Isn't it clear?

656
00:37:21,112 --> 00:37:22,271
Madam Mo's pregnancy

657
00:37:22,271 --> 00:37:23,032
is already unstable.

658
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:24,392
If she finds out

659
00:37:24,392 --> 00:37:25,751
that her father committed suicide...

660
00:37:25,751 --> 00:37:26,312
What did you say?

661
00:37:27,352 --> 00:37:28,231
I deserve to die.

662
00:37:28,352 --> 00:37:29,152
Sorry, Madam.

663
00:37:30,112 --> 00:37:30,792
What did you say?

664
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,152
Say it again.

665
00:37:33,832 --> 00:37:34,632
I said...

666
00:37:34,632 --> 00:37:36,112
I told you to say it again!

667
00:37:36,392 --> 00:37:37,312
I said

668
00:37:37,431 --> 00:37:39,352
Official Li committed suicide

669
00:37:39,471 --> 00:37:40,792
because he couldn't repay his debt.

670
00:37:42,032 --> 00:37:42,592
Madam.

671
00:37:43,032 --> 00:37:44,792
Madam, please stay strong.

672
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:48,471
Madam.

673
00:37:48,471 --> 00:37:49,231
Madam!

674
00:37:49,592 --> 00:37:49,951
Madam!

675
00:37:50,552 --> 00:37:51,832
Madam is bleeding!

676
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:53,711
Get a physician!

677
00:37:56,271 --> 00:37:57,191
A flower parasol.

678
00:37:58,191 --> 00:38:00,072
Take a look at this! A flower parasol.

679
00:38:00,271 --> 00:38:00,991
Flower parasol.

680
00:38:08,671 --> 00:38:10,872
(I laughed at your self-importance.)

681
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,832
You are the most cowardly of all.

682
00:38:15,231 --> 00:38:16,271
Your suffering today

683
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:17,792
is not due to your circumstances,

684
00:38:18,231 --> 00:38:19,560
but because you've lost your dignity.

685
00:38:20,112 --> 00:38:21,431
(However, your chosen way of life)

686
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,511
(is to willingly discard)

687
00:38:23,832 --> 00:38:25,040
(the last shred of your dignity.)

688
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:28,777
(Tinglan Pavilion)

689
00:38:31,191 --> 00:38:31,671
Madam.

690
00:38:31,991 --> 00:38:32,911
Please breathe.

691
00:38:33,832 --> 00:38:35,951
Hold on, Madam.

692
00:38:37,592 --> 00:38:39,431
Madam, Madam Ye is here.

693
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,792
She seems...

694
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:47,951
Madam.

695
00:38:50,511 --> 00:38:51,271
Madam Ye, you...

696
00:38:52,152 --> 00:38:53,392
I was ordered

697
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,271
to help Madam Mo with the childbirth,

698
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:57,312
as the situation is dire

699
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,872
and can't be delayed.

700
00:39:00,191 --> 00:39:01,632
It won't take much of your time.

701
00:39:04,271 --> 00:39:05,392
I have something to show you.

702
00:39:05,592 --> 00:39:07,991
Mu Haiyao lost her child.

703
00:39:09,032 --> 00:39:09,632
What?

704
00:39:11,112 --> 00:39:11,751
Madam Yao.

705
00:39:12,511 --> 00:39:13,072
Tell me.

706
00:39:13,832 --> 00:39:14,671
What should we do next?

707
00:39:15,191 --> 00:39:16,711
Can you spare my life?

708
00:39:18,511 --> 00:39:19,911
I will do

709
00:39:20,352 --> 00:39:21,471
whatever you ask me to do.

710
00:39:21,911 --> 00:39:22,592
She...

711
00:39:23,191 --> 00:39:25,191
She wants Li Qianmo's child.

712
00:39:28,951 --> 00:39:29,431
Madam Ye.

713
00:39:29,632 --> 00:39:30,072
Madam.

714
00:39:30,352 --> 00:39:31,592
Madam.

715
00:39:31,592 --> 00:39:32,191
Madam Ye.

716
00:39:34,032 --> 00:39:35,951
Madam. Madam Yao is in premature labour.

717
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:43,176
(Langyue Hall)

718
00:39:43,231 --> 00:39:43,832
Madam.

719
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:48,471
Almost.

720
00:39:49,032 --> 00:39:49,511
Madam.

721
00:39:49,832 --> 00:39:50,632
Push!

722
00:39:58,511 --> 00:39:59,072
Madam.

723
00:40:01,552 --> 00:40:02,431
Hold on.

724
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,671
Madam is too weak
from her premature birth.

725
00:40:04,671 --> 00:40:06,320
She can't be exposed to the wind.
Close the door.

726
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:06,592
Yes.

727
00:40:07,632 --> 00:40:08,911
Madam, please hold on.

728
00:40:14,352 --> 00:40:14,872
Madam Rui.

729
00:40:15,392 --> 00:40:15,832
Step aside.

730
00:40:16,231 --> 00:40:17,580
I'm afraid it's not appropriate.

731
00:40:19,471 --> 00:40:20,480
Madam Yao has given an order.

732
00:40:20,511 --> 00:40:21,711
No one is allowed to enter.

733
00:40:21,872 --> 00:40:22,471
Xu Liangchuan.

734
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,392
She is just a side consort.

735
00:40:24,392 --> 00:40:25,352
Have you lost your senses?

736
00:40:25,352 --> 00:40:26,652
You won't even make way for Madam Rui.

737
00:40:26,832 --> 00:40:27,312
Get out!

738
00:40:30,152 --> 00:40:30,711
Madam Rui.

739
00:40:31,112 --> 00:40:31,592
All right,

740
00:40:32,032 --> 00:40:33,352
I want to see Yao. Let me through.

741
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:34,032
Madam Rui.

742
00:40:34,312 --> 00:40:35,511
Madam Yao is in labour.

743
00:40:35,592 --> 00:40:37,112
Even you can't force your way in.

744
00:40:37,112 --> 00:40:38,352
It is improper.

745
00:40:38,632 --> 00:40:39,511
Since when is it your turn

746
00:40:39,711 --> 00:40:41,072
to determine whether it's proper or not?

747
00:40:41,312 --> 00:40:41,792
Jingshan!

748
00:40:41,792 --> 00:40:42,271
Yes.

749
00:40:43,471 --> 00:40:43,991
Madam Rui!

750
00:40:45,352 --> 00:40:46,552
Madam, hold on.

751

Xu Liangchuan!

What are you waiting for?

00:40:52,632 --> 00:40:53,191
How dare you!

755
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:54,832
You're just servants.

756
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:56,320
How dare you disobey my orders.

757
00:40:56,471 --> 00:40:57,832
Aren't you afraid of being fired?

758
00:40:57,832 --> 00:40:58,991
Madam Rui, don't forget that.

00:40:58,991 --> 00:40:59,751

Do you still think you can boss us around?

763
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:04,671
Just do as you're told.

764
00:41:04,872 --> 00:41:05,720
No matter what happens,

765
00:41:05,751 --> 00:41:07,072
Young Master Xin will defend us.

766
00:41:07,191 --> 00:41:07,751
Yes.

767
00:41:07,951 --> 00:41:09,872
Madam, hold on.

768
00:41:15,751 --> 00:41:22,751
We want to see Young Master Xin!
