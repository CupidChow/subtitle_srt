Do you know

18
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:51,742
who the murderer is?

19
00:01:55,342 --> 00:01:56,901
Did anyone else see you

20
00:01:57,422 --> 00:01:58,621
when you met us?

21
00:02:00,142 --> 00:02:01,022
I don't think so.

22
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:04,861
Serve the tea!

23
00:02:12,062 --> 00:02:13,261
Yuanxue, don't be afraid.

24
00:02:13,461 --> 00:02:14,222
Soon, I will

25
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:15,560
send you back to the mansion.

26
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:42,661
He Lianxin is there!

27
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:44,582
We want justice for Official Li!

28
00:02:46,702 --> 00:02:47,261
Hurry!

29
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,062
There he is!

30
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:55,000
Protect the Treasury's money.

31
00:02:56,181 --> 00:02:56,582
Understood.

32
00:02:57,502 --> 00:02:58,520
Protect the Treasury's money!

33
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:09,222
What are you doing?

34
00:03:09,582 --> 00:03:10,582
Are you Young Master Xin?

35
00:03:11,222 --> 00:03:11,741
That's right.

36
00:03:12,702 --> 00:03:13,901
If there's anything you wish to say,

37
00:03:14,702 --> 00:03:15,821
just say it.

38
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:16,582
We want...

39
00:03:16,582 --> 00:03:17,541
Young Master Xin should know

40
00:03:17,862 --> 00:03:19,181
what we're after!

41
00:03:21,062 --> 00:03:23,181
Is it worth risking
your lives over some money?

42
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:24,862
If you think it's not worth it,

43
00:03:25,342 --> 00:03:26,381
why don't you pretend

44
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:27,021
to not know it?

45
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,381
You caused a death!

46
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:30,280
That's right!

47
00:03:30,402 --> 00:03:31,600
Human lives are the most important.

48
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,930
How can money be as important as a life?

49
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:34,901
Do you know what crime
you're committing?

50
00:03:38,582 --> 00:03:39,502
We don't care anymore!

51
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:40,862
We are

52
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:42,582
impoverished to begin with.

53
00:03:42,862 --> 00:03:44,040
There's no other way to survive!

54
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,702
We want to survive!

55
00:03:44,702 --> 00:03:51,661
We want to survive!

56
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:53,422
Who shot him?

57
00:03:56,702 --> 00:03:57,720
The officers murdered someone!

58
00:03:57,741 --> 00:04:00,381
The officers murdered someone!

59
00:04:01,381 --> 00:04:03,702
Let's fight with them! Come on!

60
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:04,582
Fight!

61
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:14,582
When Young Master Xin
drove an official to his death,

62
00:04:14,782 --> 00:04:17,302
the prince can still tolerate him.

63
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:19,741
If

64
00:04:20,901 --> 00:04:23,541
he kills the prince's daughter,

65
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:25,661
then...

66
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:35,022
(He Yunshuo's Concubine, Madam Jing)
Your Highness, Yuanxue is missing.

67
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:11,142
Push!

68
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:15,182
Hang in there!

69
00:05:16,422 --> 00:05:17,061
How's it going?

70
00:05:17,702 --> 00:05:19,422
The midwife said her baby is weak.

71
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:21,022
She may have to put in more effort.

72
00:05:21,182 --> 00:05:21,742
Bring me in.

73
00:05:21,742 --> 00:05:22,261
Yes, Madam.

74
00:05:22,582 --> 00:05:23,341
Wait.

75
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:30,022
Rou, you and Yao

76
00:05:30,022 --> 00:05:31,142
are as close as siblings.

77
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,661
Why are you here

78
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:34,261
instead of Langyue Hall?

79
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:35,982
You came here faster than us.

80
00:05:36,862 --> 00:05:37,941
I'm the primary consort.

81
00:05:38,462 --> 00:05:39,821
All the concubines' children

82
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:40,862
are my children.

83
00:05:41,061 --> 00:05:42,101
Of course I'm here for a visit.

84
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:43,360
Since you're here for a visit,

85
00:05:43,462 --> 00:05:44,661
you should be like me

86
00:05:45,142 --> 00:05:46,862
and wait outside patiently.

87
00:05:47,941 --> 00:05:49,261
Why must you go inside?

88
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:52,742
Mo hasn't even said anything,

89
00:05:53,661 --> 00:05:55,742
why do I have to let you decide?

90
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:57,702
Mo is in labour.

91
00:05:57,781 --> 00:05:59,120
She couldn't bother about these things.

92
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,101
Anyway, the servants are careless.

93
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:02,742
They are so useless.

94
00:06:04,061 --> 00:06:05,080
What are you trying to say?

95
00:06:05,862 --> 00:06:07,862
Must I make it so obvious?

96
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:10,840
Of course it's to keep
my guard up against you.

97
00:06:11,261 --> 00:06:13,221
Do I have to repeat what you did

98
00:06:13,462 --> 00:06:14,742
at Langyue Hall?

99
00:06:15,061 --> 00:06:15,661
That's outrageous.

100
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,982
How could I possibly harm Mo's baby?

101
00:06:18,702 --> 00:06:19,742
I didn't say that,

102
00:06:21,142 --> 00:06:22,501
but this is Lianxin's child.

103
00:06:22,622 --> 00:06:23,902
We can't afford to make a mistake.

104
00:06:25,022 --> 00:06:25,661
Moreover,

105
00:06:26,101 --> 00:06:27,541
since you don't mean harm,

106
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:30,462
why are you acting in a way
which will arouse suspicion?

107
00:06:31,622 --> 00:06:34,142
If anything happens to Mo's child,

108
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:35,941
I do believe you,

109
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,870
but I don't know whether Lianxin
will choose to believe you or not.

110
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:43,702
Ms. Lian.

111
00:06:44,381 --> 00:06:45,101
As you've guessed,

112
00:06:45,462 --> 00:06:46,902
Xu Jirou went to Tinglan Pavilion.

113
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:49,622
Ms. Lian.

114
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:51,920
Young Master Xin is in trouble.

115
00:07:03,182 --> 00:07:03,880
Sorry, My Lady.

116
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,880
When you go to the underworld,

117
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,600
don't forget to blame your death
on Young Master Xin.

118
00:08:05,941 --> 00:08:06,501
It's you.

119
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:07,880
I'm sorry for arriving late.

120
00:08:21,661 --> 00:08:22,261
Ms. Lian!

121
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:24,022
Ms. Lian.

122
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:25,182
No.

123
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:26,501
You can't do it, Ms. Lian.

124
00:08:27,061 --> 00:08:28,200
These are all Young Master Xin's...

125
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,862
I knew he wasn't hiding it from me.

126
00:08:29,862 --> 00:08:30,781
If you take it away,

127
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:32,221
Young Master Xin will kill me.

128
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:32,862
Ms. Lian.

129
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,142
He will kill you
if you don't let me leave.

130
00:08:35,142 --> 00:08:35,742
Ms. Lian,

131
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:36,902
I can't let you go.

132
00:08:37,382 --> 00:08:37,862
Do you know

133
00:08:37,862 --> 00:08:38,701
the items in this carriage

134
00:08:38,942 --> 00:08:40,422
concerns Young Master Xin's fortune, his life

135
00:08:40,422 --> 00:08:41,182
and his future?

136
00:08:41,382 --> 00:08:42,062
Do you believe me?

137
00:08:42,942 --> 00:08:43,661
I don't.

138
00:08:47,622 --> 00:08:48,062
Madam.

139
00:08:48,901 --> 00:08:49,661
You may go.

140
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:53,622
Greetings, Madam.

141
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:54,581
Nowadays,

142
00:08:54,982 --> 00:08:56,781
do you still respect me?

143
00:08:57,661 --> 00:08:58,382
No matter when,

144
00:08:59,302 --> 00:09:00,461
I will always respect you.

145
00:09:01,101 --> 00:09:02,461
My respect and affection for you

146
00:09:03,141 --> 00:09:03,862
will never change.

147
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:05,581
Can I trust you?

148
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,200
Since things have come to this point,

149
00:09:10,461 --> 00:09:11,581
I need you to do something for me.

150
00:09:12,382 --> 00:09:15,341
I really have
an important business to do right now.

151
00:09:18,382 --> 00:09:19,141
What is more important

152
00:09:19,701 --> 00:09:21,182
than Lianxin's offspring?

153
00:09:21,822 --> 00:09:22,341
Luo Qinglian,

154
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,141
I would never have come to you

155
00:09:24,262 --> 00:09:25,262
if I had another way.

156
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:27,661
Are you going to watch Mu Haiyao

157
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:28,742
twisting the truth once more

158
00:09:28,942 --> 00:09:30,062
and take away another child?

159
00:09:30,302 --> 00:09:30,742
Madam.

160
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,502
I have an urgent matter to handle.

161
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,862
Please let me through.

162
00:09:36,502 --> 00:09:37,581
An urgent matter?

163
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,141
Do you know what is urgent now?

164
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:43,822
All the flowers
in the garden of the mansion

165
00:09:44,982 --> 00:09:46,382
are Madam Yao's favourite.

166
00:09:47,622 --> 00:09:48,942
Also, the materials of servants'

167
00:09:49,062 --> 00:09:51,021
spring clothing were chosen by her.

168
00:09:51,862 --> 00:09:53,862
Even the carriage
was replaced because she requested it.

169
00:09:54,422 --> 00:09:55,461
Before the child was even born,

170
00:09:55,882 --> 00:09:57,740
half of the mansion
already belongs to her.

171
00:09:58,182 --> 00:09:59,520
What will happen when the child is born?

172
00:10:14,622 --> 00:10:15,622
I'm no match for her.

173
00:10:17,302 --> 00:10:18,141
Only you

174
00:10:18,461 --> 00:10:19,382
could stop her now.

175
00:10:23,382 --> 00:10:26,101
I'm also asking you on behalf

176
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:27,680
of all the ladies in the mansion,
for a favour.

177
00:10:41,862 --> 00:10:42,461
I'm sorry.

178
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:45,461
I have to go out right now.

179
00:11:02,182 --> 00:11:03,622
(Young Master Xin is in danger.)

180
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,661
(If I don't go to rescue him,)

181
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,822
(I'm afraid he might die.)

182
00:11:08,742 --> 00:11:09,302
(Madam Rui,)

183
00:11:09,862 --> 00:11:10,461
(I'm sorry.)

184
00:11:10,901 --> 00:11:12,422
(You may resent me,)

185
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:14,021
(but for Quliang's future,)

186
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,822
(I'm going to give it a shot today.)

187
00:11:21,221 --> 00:11:22,062
Push!

188
00:11:31,622 --> 00:11:32,221
Harder!

189
00:11:32,982 --> 00:11:33,622
Push!

190
00:11:34,581 --> 00:11:35,581
Push harder!

191
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:43,942
The baby is born!

192
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:18,382
Madam, you will understand

193
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:20,221
my intentions one day.

194
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,862
However, I have something
important to do now.

195
00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:24,302
Please let me through, Madam.

196
00:12:24,302 --> 00:12:25,262
There's no need to wait.

197
00:12:26,781 --> 00:12:28,901
There is nothing wrong
with picking the right side.

198
00:12:30,502 --> 00:12:33,901
Luo Qinglian, you are very smart.

199
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:37,742
Is it a boy or a girl?

200
00:12:41,502 --> 00:12:42,862
Let me take a look at the baby.

201
00:12:47,341 --> 00:12:48,182
What's wrong?

202
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:51,302
Why isn't the baby crying?

203
00:12:52,862 --> 00:12:53,581
Madam.

204
00:12:55,982 --> 00:12:56,502
Madam.

205
00:13:01,302 --> 00:13:03,182
I'll go to Langyue Hall again.

206
00:13:03,781 --> 00:13:05,661
At worst, I will abandon
the title of primary consort.

207
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:07,670
- At least my Hui'er isn't gone for nothing.
- It's too late.

208
00:13:09,862 --> 00:13:11,982
Madam Yao just gave birth to a son

209
00:13:12,622 --> 00:13:14,021
while Madam Mo's child

210
00:13:14,182 --> 00:13:15,382
died at birth.

211
00:13:35,901 --> 00:13:37,062
Congratulations, Ms. Lian.

212
00:13:38,742 --> 00:13:39,982
Your wish was granted.

213
00:13:40,982 --> 00:13:42,862
I hope you will

214
00:13:43,502 --> 00:13:44,581
have a bright future

215
00:13:45,502 --> 00:13:46,622
with your new master.

216
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:55,101
Are you still the same Lian'er

217
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:55,942
whom I know?

218
00:14:09,781 --> 00:14:10,302
Li Tang.

219
00:14:10,422 --> 00:14:10,822
Yes.

220
00:14:11,382 --> 00:14:11,982
Let's go.

221
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,062
How did you know
someone was going to rob us?

222
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,262
I didn't.

223
00:14:44,622 --> 00:14:46,982
Maybe the heaven is helping you

224
00:14:47,182 --> 00:14:48,341
to test me.

225
00:14:49,182 --> 00:14:49,822
What do you mean?

226
00:14:52,262 --> 00:14:54,341
I came here to seek refuge, Young Master Xin.

227
00:15:00,382 --> 00:15:01,302
Seek refuge?

228
00:15:03,622 --> 00:15:05,170
Are you seeking refuge
by turning to your enemy?

229
00:15:08,101 --> 00:15:09,520
Those with the same goals
are my friends,

230
00:15:10,021 --> 00:15:11,480
while those who aren't are my enemies.

231
00:15:12,221 --> 00:15:13,622
Helping you to achieve great things

232
00:15:14,141 --> 00:15:15,341
is the same as freeing myself

233
00:15:15,661 --> 00:15:16,622
from my outcast status.

234
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:18,502
Compared to this,

235
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:20,701
our past grudges are nothing.

236
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,502
Forsaking kindness or resentment,

237
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:25,302
you're a wise man indeed.

238
00:15:26,141 --> 00:15:27,062
A skilled physician

239
00:15:28,021 --> 00:15:29,160
who is proficient in literature

240
00:15:29,622 --> 00:15:30,982
and martial arts.

241
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:33,622
Great, Lv Beiyi.

242
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,581
What else do you want me to know?

243
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,502
If you wish to know,

244
00:15:40,302 --> 00:15:41,221
you will, sooner or later.

245
00:15:43,622 --> 00:15:44,360
Young Master Xin.

246
00:15:45,262 --> 00:15:46,120
What are the casualties?

247
00:15:46,901 --> 00:15:48,781
Young Master Xin, the casualties are severe,

248
00:15:49,622 --> 00:15:51,221
but most of them are bandits.

249
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:56,781
I always thought that Quliang

250
00:15:57,901 --> 00:15:58,942
was a rich place.

251
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:00,502
Who knew

252
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,221
its people were so poor

253
00:16:03,781 --> 00:16:05,781
that they would risk
robbing the Treasury's money?

254
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:08,341
Not only they got nothing,

255
00:16:08,742 --> 00:16:09,942
they also lost their lives.

256
00:16:12,742 --> 00:16:13,701
Do you really think

257
00:16:14,221 --> 00:16:15,382
they were just commoners?

258
00:16:19,622 --> 00:16:20,062
Tianshu.

259
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,182
If they were indeed commoners

260
00:16:22,901 --> 00:16:24,581
and were young and strong,

261
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:25,822
how many do you think

262
00:16:25,822 --> 00:16:27,021
you could fight at once?

263
00:16:33,781 --> 00:16:34,701
I can fight three at a time.

264
00:16:34,942 --> 00:16:36,182
However, I don't think

265
00:16:37,422 --> 00:16:38,341
you could fight some of them

266
00:16:38,341 --> 00:16:39,422
even if it's one on one.

267
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:43,182
Wait.

268
00:16:51,502 --> 00:16:52,680
Since when did the locals of Quliang

269
00:16:53,302 --> 00:16:54,701
learn to use such weapons?

270
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,182
Sir, forgive me.
Our people were wiped out.

271
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,822
What about the Lady Xue?

272
00:17:03,182 --> 00:17:04,182
She is with Young Master Xin.

273
00:17:09,581 --> 00:17:10,101
Thank you.

274
00:17:11,221 --> 00:17:13,240
If you hadn't called me a coward
and gave me a reality check,

275
00:17:14,321 --> 00:17:14,902
I wouldn't know

276
00:17:14,902 --> 00:17:16,620
how long I would continue
to muddle through my life.

277
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:20,142
You're right.

278
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,502
Instead of living without dignity,

279
00:17:24,421 --> 00:17:25,662
it's better

280
00:17:26,902 --> 00:17:28,142
to fight for what I've lost.

281
00:17:33,941 --> 00:17:34,821
Bring the horse over.

282
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,581
Official Mu, I have to leave for a moment.

283
00:17:39,301 --> 00:17:40,941
Please take care
of Yuanxue and the money.

284
00:17:41,301 --> 00:17:42,061
Where are you going?

285
00:17:42,622 --> 00:17:44,120
Young Master Xin, you have to think clearly.

286
00:17:44,262 --> 00:17:45,542
Once the prince learns about this

287
00:17:46,022 --> 00:17:47,341
and the heir successfully escapes,

288
00:17:47,782 --> 00:17:49,680
in the future, he will regard you
as a mortal enemy.

289
00:17:51,982 --> 00:17:52,982
Please wait, Young Master Xin!

290
00:17:58,461 --> 00:17:59,101
Young Master Xin,

291
00:18:00,022 --> 00:18:01,941
he works for Young Master Xiu.

292
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:05,382
He is also Official Li's murderer.

293
00:18:06,742 --> 00:18:08,782
Young Master Xin, you might think

294
00:18:09,101 --> 00:18:11,461
the heir was the one
who killed Official Li.

295
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:13,821
In fact, someone else

296
00:18:13,821 --> 00:18:16,941
has been observing from afar.

297
00:18:18,382 --> 00:18:19,301
Everyone knows

298
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:22,542
you're ambitious and cunning,
Young Master Xin.

299
00:18:23,341 --> 00:18:25,902
However, you lack

300
00:18:26,181 --> 00:18:28,022
the most important thing,

301
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:30,022
(which is)

302
00:18:31,382 --> 00:18:32,382
(power.)

303
00:18:37,662 --> 00:18:40,461
(I don't have to emphasise)

304
00:18:41,301 --> 00:18:43,941
Young Master Xiu's power in Quliang.

305
00:18:44,181 --> 00:18:46,701
(In case the heir falls from power,)

306
00:18:47,221 --> 00:18:50,862
(even if I get the remaining people)

307
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:54,902
(in Quliang to follow you,)

308
00:18:55,622 --> 00:18:58,421
(I'm afraid you are
still no match for him.)

309
00:19:01,461 --> 00:19:02,560
(Official Li is a good official.)

310
00:19:02,982 --> 00:19:03,742
(No matter what,)

311
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,101
(I can't let him down.)

312
00:19:06,341 --> 00:19:07,101
(I, He Lianxin,)

313
00:19:07,341 --> 00:19:09,662
(will seek justice for those seeking it.)

314
00:19:10,142 --> 00:19:11,622
(I want to have a clear conscience.)

315
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:13,520
(Lianxiu is eyeing
the position of the heir.)

316
00:19:13,581 --> 00:19:15,022
(Only by assisting the heir)

317
00:19:15,262 --> 00:19:16,440
(can we compete with him)

318
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,022
(and prevent Qu Liang
from falling into the hands of a crook.)

319
00:19:19,262 --> 00:19:21,061
(I just resent myself
for being weak and powerless.)

320
00:19:21,341 --> 00:19:23,640
(There's no other choice
other than waiting for the right moment.)

321
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,622
(However, I will not go
against my conscience.)

322
00:19:25,941 --> 00:19:27,662
(Will Lianxin listen to us?)

323
00:19:27,742 --> 00:19:29,101
Now that things have come to this,

324
00:19:30,061 --> 00:19:32,382
which side he chooses to be on

325
00:19:33,782 --> 00:19:35,862
is up to fate.

326
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:44,701
All right.

327
00:20:07,421 --> 00:20:08,061
Li Tang.

328
00:20:10,821 --> 00:20:11,480
Young Master Xin.

329
00:20:18,101 --> 00:20:20,040
Young Master Xin,
it seems that you have made a choice.

330
00:20:25,782 --> 00:20:26,680
What are you doing here?

331
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,630
(Quliang)

332
00:20:46,782 --> 00:20:47,181
Sir.

333
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,480
Young Master Xin had a few carriages

334
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,030
heading in the direction
of the prince's Mansion.

335
00:20:50,101 --> 00:20:51,262
On the way, a box fell.

336
00:20:51,421 --> 00:20:52,061
I brought it here.

337
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:52,502
Open it.

338
00:20:56,382 --> 00:20:56,902
Isn't this

339
00:20:57,821 --> 00:20:59,701
that carved agarwood brocade box?

340
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:00,880
You know what it is?

341
00:21:01,421 --> 00:21:01,902
Great-uncle.

342
00:21:02,581 --> 00:21:02,941
This...

343
00:21:04,022 --> 00:21:05,502
This was a gift to my father.

344
00:21:05,701 --> 00:21:07,262
After intercepting it,

345
00:21:07,262 --> 00:21:07,982
a while ago,

346
00:21:08,061 --> 00:21:09,262
I gave it to a courtesan.

347
00:21:09,382 --> 00:21:10,461
How did Lianxin get hold of it?

348
00:21:14,101 --> 00:21:14,581
This is bad.

349
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:16,421
A few carriages?

350
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:18,941
I'm done for if those thing
go to my father.

351
00:21:19,662 --> 00:21:20,821
Your Highness,

352
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:24,622
you will get me killed!

353
00:21:25,142 --> 00:21:25,701
I have a report!

354
00:21:26,982 --> 00:21:27,461
Sir,

355
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:29,560
Young Master Xin brought
a few carriages full of items

356
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,400
and asked for a meeting.

357
00:21:32,262 --> 00:21:33,542
Great-uncle, this is...

358
00:21:33,742 --> 00:21:34,262
You...

359
00:21:35,181 --> 00:21:35,821
Leave us.

360
00:21:37,061 --> 00:21:37,421
Yes.

361
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:42,142
Official Yuan.

362
00:21:43,782 --> 00:21:46,382
Young Master Xin, this is...

363
00:21:47,701 --> 00:21:49,821
Inside those carriages

364
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:51,382
are all the heir's belongings.

365
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:52,742
I know he's here.

366
00:21:54,061 --> 00:21:55,200
So I came to return his items.

367
00:21:55,382 --> 00:21:56,382
I wonder if it is all right.

368
00:21:57,181 --> 00:21:58,701
Sure.

369
00:21:59,502 --> 00:22:01,181
Official Yuan's gift

370
00:22:02,022 --> 00:22:03,421
enlightened me,

371
00:22:03,701 --> 00:22:04,622
except for one thing.

372
00:22:05,622 --> 00:22:06,982
I don't want to be
the Idle Young Master.

373
00:22:10,341 --> 00:22:11,622
I wish to assist the heir

374
00:22:13,022 --> 00:22:14,181
in his great achievements.

375
00:22:21,301 --> 00:22:24,742
As your younger brother, I, He Lianxin,
wish to assist you to ahieve the great goal.

376
00:22:31,461 --> 00:22:32,400
(Young Master Xin,)

377
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,840
(getting rid of the heir is not an option)

378
00:22:34,101 --> 00:22:36,742
because it is an impossible feat.

379
00:22:39,382 --> 00:22:40,360
Young Master Xin, do you think

380
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:41,862
you were asked to collect the debt

381
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:43,821
because of Yuan Baili's recommendation?

382
00:22:45,301 --> 00:22:46,262
The prince

383
00:22:46,502 --> 00:22:47,982
was just playing along with it.

384
00:22:49,421 --> 00:22:50,941
(When all his sons were granted titles,)

385
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:52,862
(His Highness has already understood)

386
00:22:53,262 --> 00:22:56,461
(the heir's weaknesses
in his conduct, ability and power.)

387
00:22:57,742 --> 00:22:58,782
(He also saw)

388
00:22:58,782 --> 00:23:00,862
(Young Master Xiu's growing strength.)

389
00:23:01,502 --> 00:23:03,020
He is also contesting
for the prince's title

390
00:23:03,262 --> 00:23:04,821
other than the heir.

391
00:23:05,262 --> 00:23:06,622
General of Valiant's

392
00:23:07,301 --> 00:23:08,301
competition

393
00:23:08,902 --> 00:23:09,862
with the heir

394
00:23:10,461 --> 00:23:12,902
will cause Quliang's officials
to divide into two factions.

395
00:23:13,342 --> 00:23:14,600
(It'll lead to political unstability.)

396
00:23:15,782 --> 00:23:17,742
(It is the last thing
His Highness wishes to see.)

397
00:23:18,142 --> 00:23:19,680
(In order to stabilise
the political situation,)

398
00:23:19,682 --> 00:23:21,480
(other than controlling
all forces through competition,)

399
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,502
there is undoubtedly

400
00:23:22,742 --> 00:23:23,982
a smarter way.

401
00:23:25,502 --> 00:23:26,862
Why didn't you join them?

402
00:23:27,902 --> 00:23:28,902
I'm weak

403
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:30,262
and I can't beat them.

404
00:23:32,461 --> 00:23:32,902
No.

405
00:23:32,902 --> 00:23:34,061
No, you can't do this.

406
00:23:34,941 --> 00:23:36,941
The descendants
of the He family are brave.

407
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:38,622
Go, snatch it from them.

408
00:23:40,221 --> 00:23:41,461
Come on.

409
00:23:42,142 --> 00:23:42,581
Here.

410
00:23:43,502 --> 00:23:44,902
Tripartite balance of forces.

411
00:23:47,142 --> 00:23:48,622
(I'm sure you already understand)

412
00:23:48,622 --> 00:23:50,061
(his intention to collect arrears.)

413
00:23:50,941 --> 00:23:51,982
(In two tigers' fight,)

414
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:53,941
(His Highness' hope)

415
00:23:54,742 --> 00:23:56,341
isn't to let you kill one of the tigers.

416
00:23:57,181 --> 00:23:58,160
On the contrary, you should...

417
00:23:58,742 --> 00:23:59,880
Become the third tiger.

418
00:24:11,862 --> 00:24:12,581
Your Highness.

419
00:24:12,821 --> 00:24:14,061
The spies returned with news.

420
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:18,101
Everything is as you wished,
Your Highness.

421
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:30,262
Very well.

422
00:24:32,941 --> 00:24:34,142
Lianxin did a good job.

423
00:24:34,782 --> 00:24:37,181
I also brought someone back with me.

424
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:02,382
Greetings, Father.

425
00:25:03,782 --> 00:25:04,821
I was unfilial

426
00:25:05,461 --> 00:25:06,782
and made you worry.

427
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,160
After Lady Xue returns,

428
00:25:19,461 --> 00:25:21,022
will she...

429
00:25:21,701 --> 00:25:23,240
She understood
the seriousness of the situation.

430
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:24,262
So she won't tell.

431
00:25:27,662 --> 00:25:28,221
Right.

432
00:25:29,421 --> 00:25:30,941
Perhaps for those
in the prince's mansion,

433
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:34,502
it is much easier
to be silent than to confide.

434
00:25:37,022 --> 00:25:38,101
She dislikes her identity

435
00:25:38,862 --> 00:25:39,982
and hopes to be a commoner.

436
00:25:41,821 --> 00:25:42,662
When the commoners

437
00:25:43,221 --> 00:25:44,782
opened their eyes in the morning,

438
00:25:45,742 --> 00:25:46,662
they must be thinking

439
00:25:46,662 --> 00:25:48,142
how to earn more money

440
00:25:48,142 --> 00:25:49,982
and fill their stomachs in the evening.

441
00:25:50,662 --> 00:25:52,101
They would never think

442
00:25:54,581 --> 00:25:56,421
that it would be the last time

443
00:25:58,262 --> 00:25:59,581
they woke up in their lives.

444
00:26:05,742 --> 00:26:08,022
Forget about promotion,

445
00:26:08,622 --> 00:26:11,301
a general's glory is built
upon the death of a thousand.

446
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:14,341
Right.

447
00:26:17,941 --> 00:26:19,061
Girl, do you know

448
00:26:20,382 --> 00:26:22,181
how Quliang looked like in the past?

449
00:26:23,941 --> 00:26:25,142
My father used to tell me

450
00:26:25,821 --> 00:26:28,542
that 30 years ago,
Quliang was a desolate place.

451
00:26:29,782 --> 00:26:33,742
His Highness built everything

452
00:26:33,982 --> 00:26:35,382
and made it the way it is today.

453
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:36,982
That's right.

454
00:26:38,421 --> 00:26:40,941
The land of Quliang was barren.

455
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,142
My father

456
00:26:44,701 --> 00:26:46,662
painstakingly worked day and night,

457
00:26:46,821 --> 00:26:49,662
to little effect.

458
00:26:50,662 --> 00:26:52,622
I remember that when I was 15 years old,

459
00:26:53,502 --> 00:26:54,502
Quliang experienced a drought.

460
00:26:55,061 --> 00:26:57,502
My father held me high on the city wall

461
00:26:57,662 --> 00:26:59,862
and pointed at a withered land in front.

462
00:27:00,382 --> 00:27:00,902
He said,

463
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:04,181
"Xin'er, this is Quliang."

464
00:27:06,301 --> 00:27:08,622
Quliang is blessed
with fertile land and fluorishing agriculture.

465
00:27:09,542 --> 00:27:13,440
It is also true that the people
are suffering and displaced.

466
00:27:14,782 --> 00:27:15,461
At that time,

467
00:27:17,421 --> 00:27:19,262
I made an oath deep down inside.

468
00:27:21,821 --> 00:27:23,022
One day,

469
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:28,941
I will let the locals of Quliang

470
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:34,181
cease to live a life of misery.

471
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:43,662
I will.

472
00:27:46,022 --> 00:27:46,622
Today,

473
00:27:48,941 --> 00:27:50,421
they died tragically because of me,

474
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:52,382
yet I could not

475
00:27:54,742 --> 00:27:56,022
redress their grievances.

476
00:28:02,662 --> 00:28:03,742
Says who?

477
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:07,101
In the eyes of those
who make great things,

478
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:09,061
it is always about more
than just a few people.

479
00:28:10,862 --> 00:28:11,701
If you want,

480
00:28:12,782 --> 00:28:13,622
you should take Quliang

481
00:28:13,982 --> 00:28:15,502
into your own hands.

482
00:28:16,262 --> 00:28:16,941
From now on,

483
00:28:18,341 --> 00:28:19,662
no one will be wronged.

484
00:29:19,022 --> 00:29:19,742
How are you?

485
00:29:23,581 --> 00:29:24,662
I'd been looking for you,

486
00:29:26,701 --> 00:29:27,701
but to no avail.

487
00:29:31,581 --> 00:29:32,742
It's easy to avoid someone

488
00:29:34,382 --> 00:29:35,421
yet so hard to find someone.

489
00:29:39,701 --> 00:29:40,461
How have you been?

490
00:29:44,622 --> 00:29:45,701
You're indeed avoiding me.

491
00:30:01,581 --> 00:30:02,221
I'm fine.

492
00:30:03,142 --> 00:30:04,640
The life behind
the closed walls of a mansion

493
00:30:04,782 --> 00:30:05,542
may be tough,

494
00:30:06,902 --> 00:30:08,240
but you know that I always manage

495
00:30:09,981 --> 00:30:11,160
to survive in the end.

496
00:30:18,022 --> 00:30:19,181
I went to He Lianxin

497
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,200
and volunteered to be his adviser.

498
00:30:23,301 --> 00:30:24,101
What did you say?

499
00:30:24,542 --> 00:30:25,461
I've already figured it out.

500
00:30:27,142 --> 00:30:28,581
Instead of living in chaos,

501
00:30:29,221 --> 00:30:30,862
I might as well achieve
something by his side.

502
00:30:31,461 --> 00:30:32,520
He already made me a promise.

503
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:34,800
As long as he can succeed his father,

504
00:30:35,341 --> 00:30:36,960
he will definitely free me
from my outcast status.

505
00:30:39,662 --> 00:30:40,502
Don't you mind

506
00:30:41,221 --> 00:30:42,640
the suffering you endured because of him?

507
00:30:55,581 --> 00:30:57,142
He's not the only person
who did this to me.

508
00:30:58,662 --> 00:31:00,461
Those who used to treat me
with great respect

509
00:31:02,662 --> 00:31:04,301
are avoiding me now.

510
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:07,421
I flipped through medical
books with little sleep.

511
00:31:09,022 --> 00:31:09,821
I climbed the mountains

512
00:31:09,821 --> 00:31:11,622
and dug up the herbs with great effort.

513
00:31:12,622 --> 00:31:13,560
However, I could do nothing

514
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,179
when I saw them
being made into medicinal dregs.

515
00:31:17,662 --> 00:31:18,862
Everyone could criticise me.

516
00:31:20,782 --> 00:31:21,542
Even the beggars

517
00:31:23,142 --> 00:31:24,581
threw my alms out.

518
00:31:29,461 --> 00:31:30,301
What is a lowly class?

519
00:31:31,502 --> 00:31:32,382
Someone of a lowly class

520
00:31:33,742 --> 00:31:35,022
is like having sores and blisters

521
00:31:35,821 --> 00:31:36,662
on the body.

522
00:31:39,221 --> 00:31:40,461
Even the things I take

523
00:31:41,502 --> 00:31:42,862
and the air I breathe are cheap.

524
00:31:43,941 --> 00:31:44,542
Moreover,

525
00:31:46,221 --> 00:31:47,581
a marriage with someone
from a lowly class

526
00:31:49,022 --> 00:31:51,101
can cause the entire clan to be demoted.

527
00:31:57,461 --> 00:31:58,502
The entire Lv family

528
00:32:00,022 --> 00:32:02,502
died tragically
because they could not endure it.

529
00:32:03,941 --> 00:32:05,502
I'm the only one left behind.

530
00:32:13,341 --> 00:32:14,101
Pride.

531
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:16,782
Conduct.

532
00:32:19,301 --> 00:32:20,821
Being in this state,

533
00:32:22,581 --> 00:32:23,301
what right do I have

534
00:32:23,301 --> 00:32:24,221
to bother about such things?

535
00:32:39,581 --> 00:32:40,461
It's me.

536
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:44,142
You're in this state because of me.

537
00:32:50,742 --> 00:32:54,502
Yi, I should be the one
to be treated like this.

538
00:32:58,461 --> 00:32:59,022
No.

539
00:33:00,502 --> 00:33:01,181
It's not your fault.

540
00:33:03,301 --> 00:33:03,902
Lian'er.

541
00:33:05,701 --> 00:33:06,341
Forgive me.

542
00:33:08,902 --> 00:33:10,022
I cannot implicate you

543
00:33:11,581 --> 00:33:12,941
and your family.

544
00:33:15,262 --> 00:33:15,821
I can't let you

545
00:33:15,821 --> 00:33:17,142
and your entire family

546
00:33:18,142 --> 00:33:19,862
to end up like my family.

547
00:33:31,221 --> 00:33:32,421
I, Luo Qinglian,

548
00:33:34,101 --> 00:33:35,461
swear to the moon.

549
00:33:37,301 --> 00:33:39,542
I will do anything

550
00:33:40,581 --> 00:33:42,061
to remove Lv Beiyi's outcast status.

551
00:33:58,941 --> 00:34:00,622
Although we live under the same roof,

552
00:34:04,821 --> 00:34:06,221
after all,

553
00:34:12,142 --> 00:34:14,502
things have changed.

554
00:34:15,502 --> 00:34:16,822
From today onwards,

555
00:34:17,661 --> 00:34:18,141
you

556
00:34:20,302 --> 00:34:21,582
will be Mr. Lv,

557
00:34:22,421 --> 00:34:22,941
while I

558
00:34:24,102 --> 00:34:25,582
will be Ms. Lian.

559
00:34:45,621 --> 00:34:47,822
(Langyue Hall)
Greetings, Madam Yao.

560
00:34:47,941 --> 00:34:50,421
Congratulations on giving birth
to a son, Madam Yao.

561
00:34:51,502 --> 00:34:52,062
Have a seat.

562
00:34:58,822 --> 00:34:59,381
Why is everyone

563
00:34:59,381 --> 00:35:00,502
gathered at my place?

564
00:35:01,982 --> 00:35:02,742
I heard

565
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:05,661
Madam Ye had fallen ill.

566
00:35:06,181 --> 00:35:08,302
She has gone out of her mind

567
00:35:08,302 --> 00:35:09,421
and become delirious.

568
00:35:10,421 --> 00:35:14,221
On the other hand,
Mo and I were both pregnant.

569
00:35:15,621 --> 00:35:16,701
I gave birth to my child safely,

570
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:19,901
but she had to endure
the passing of her young child.

571
00:35:20,502 --> 00:35:21,342
How pitiful.

572
00:35:21,782 --> 00:35:23,502
Not at all.

573
00:35:23,941 --> 00:35:25,421
Each person has their own fate.

574
00:35:25,661 --> 00:35:27,181
She isn't as fortunate as you, Madam Yao.

575
00:35:27,381 --> 00:35:29,022
So naturally she couldn't
enjoy this honour.

576
00:35:30,062 --> 00:35:31,022
At the end of the day,

577
00:35:31,502 --> 00:35:33,102
it's because you're kind

578
00:35:33,822 --> 00:35:36,181
and keep considering others.

579
00:35:37,822 --> 00:35:40,302
I welcome your visit to my place,

580
00:35:41,421 --> 00:35:42,542
but I can't bear to see

581
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:45,421
other places being empty
and desolate, right?

582
00:35:46,661 --> 00:35:47,782
Everyone is here

583
00:35:47,782 --> 00:35:49,141
because our hearts are here.

584
00:35:49,701 --> 00:35:50,381
In fact,

585
00:35:50,661 --> 00:35:52,661
you don't have to keep thinking
about Madam Rui.

586
00:35:53,062 --> 00:35:54,102
We've done

587
00:35:54,381 --> 00:35:56,582
the necessary greetings and visits.

588
00:35:57,621 --> 00:35:58,221
Have you?

589
00:35:59,102 --> 00:36:00,461
Have you been to Lianwei House then?

590
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:03,782
Lianwei House?

591
00:36:05,661 --> 00:36:06,701
To see that servant-concubine?

592
00:36:07,141 --> 00:36:09,062
Although Luo Qinglian
is a servant-concubine,

593
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,941
the prince favours her.

594
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:13,542
Lianxin likes her too.

595
00:36:14,181 --> 00:36:15,062
Therefore,

596
00:36:15,782 --> 00:36:17,221
we should be fond of her, too,

597
00:36:17,701 --> 00:36:18,221
understand?

598
00:36:18,742 --> 00:36:19,461
Yes.

599
00:36:20,302 --> 00:36:21,661
Now that you've said it,

600
00:36:21,742 --> 00:36:22,941
I'm starting to feel

601
00:36:22,941 --> 00:36:24,262
that I was being negligent.

602
00:36:25,022 --> 00:36:25,582
Ladies,

603
00:36:25,901 --> 00:36:26,982
let's

604
00:36:27,262 --> 00:36:28,421
visit Ms. Lian.

605
00:36:28,421 --> 00:36:29,221
Okay.

606
00:36:29,582 --> 00:36:30,621
While we're at it,

607
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:32,022
let's also mention
Madam Yao's generosity.

608
00:36:32,782 --> 00:36:33,421
Madam Yao,

609
00:36:33,661 --> 00:36:34,822
we will get going.

610
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:46,102
You chased them away to Lianwei House.

611
00:36:47,022 --> 00:36:47,582
That's right.

612
00:36:50,381 --> 00:36:51,342
Luo Qinglian

613
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,982
is on my side now.

614
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:56,080
In the future, there will be instances
where she can be of use.

615
00:36:56,782 --> 00:36:57,701
Being kind to her now

616
00:36:58,982 --> 00:36:59,901
is nothing.

617
00:37:00,181 --> 00:37:01,141
She works for you?

618
00:37:01,461 --> 00:37:02,600
On the day I gave birth,

619
00:37:03,461 --> 00:37:04,661
I heard Madam Rui knelt down

620
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:06,102
and begged her to come to Langyue Hall,

621
00:37:07,461 --> 00:37:08,621
yet she didn't agree.

622
00:37:19,421 --> 00:37:20,421
Since it's an act,

623
00:37:20,901 --> 00:37:22,262
of course it has to be convincing.

624
00:37:27,742 --> 00:37:29,782
Do you mean I'm ignorant?

625
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:31,840
Of course you're not ignorant,

626
00:37:32,822 --> 00:37:34,000
but no matter how smart you are,

627
00:37:34,062 --> 00:37:35,782
there are still times when you're careless.

628
00:37:36,742 --> 00:37:37,502
Do you know

629
00:37:38,181 --> 00:37:39,782
Luo Qinglian is still wearing Hui'er's...

630
00:37:41,742 --> 00:37:43,141
When shall I help someone?

631
00:37:43,342 --> 00:37:44,461
When shall I use someone?

632
00:37:45,022 --> 00:37:47,782
Since when did you have the right
to tell me what to do?

633
00:37:49,941 --> 00:37:50,582
Haiyao,

634
00:37:51,661 --> 00:37:54,302
are you going to grow distant with me
because of a servant-concubine?

635
00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:57,461
That's also what I want to ask you.

636
00:37:57,861 --> 00:37:59,502
I've been flattering Luo Qinglian

637
00:37:59,982 --> 00:38:00,901
in order to use her.

638
00:38:01,421 --> 00:38:03,141
Why are you so concerned about it?

639
00:38:03,461 --> 00:38:04,022
So this is how

640
00:38:04,022 --> 00:38:04,901
you think of me.

641
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:06,221
Fine.

642
00:38:07,381 --> 00:38:09,062
Since you have someone
else to help you,

643
00:38:09,661 --> 00:38:10,621
then I won't come

644
00:38:11,381 --> 00:38:12,621
to Langyue Hall again.

645
00:38:24,922 --> 00:38:25,920
(Mansion of Prince An)
Lianxin.

646
00:38:26,302 --> 00:38:27,941
You did a great job.

647
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,262
What reward do you want?

648
00:38:34,302 --> 00:38:34,982
Father,

649
00:38:35,342 --> 00:38:37,221
I was just doing my job.

650
00:38:37,461 --> 00:38:38,520
I dare not ask for a reward.

651
00:38:39,062 --> 00:38:40,062
On the contrary, Official Mu

652
00:38:40,461 --> 00:38:42,701
handled the matter
with impartiality and swiftness.

653
00:38:42,801 --> 00:38:44,801
Otherwiise, we would not have
collected the arrears timely.

654
00:38:44,861 --> 00:38:45,640
What's more,

655
00:38:45,982 --> 00:38:47,742
the flood relief
might even have been delayed.

656
00:38:48,062 --> 00:38:49,502
True.

657
00:38:49,941 --> 00:38:51,141
This was no easy job.

658
00:38:52,022 --> 00:38:55,062
It's rare for Mu Tianshu
to volunteer to help out.

659
00:38:55,421 --> 00:38:58,102
He even did it so neatly.

660
00:38:58,542 --> 00:38:59,701
What a surprise.

661
00:39:00,141 --> 00:39:02,141
The Mu family is really full of talents.

662
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:04,381
The younger generation
is very promising indeed.

663
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:05,901
Mu Tianshu.

664
00:39:07,502 --> 00:39:08,240
Yes, Your Highness.

665
00:39:09,421 --> 00:39:11,822
I got His Majesty's decree.

666
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,160
Pingnan Army's General Commander
has just stepped down.

667
00:39:14,342 --> 00:39:15,720
Would you like to take on the position?

668
00:39:22,102 --> 00:39:24,302
Thank you, Your Highness.

669
00:39:26,102 --> 00:39:27,880
The Mu family has received
your grace for generations.

670
00:39:28,102 --> 00:39:29,302
I will do my very best

671
00:39:29,861 --> 00:39:30,822
to repay your kindness.

672
00:39:32,461 --> 00:39:34,141
Serving the imperial court well

673
00:39:34,661 --> 00:39:36,941
is repaying my recommendation.

674
00:39:38,701 --> 00:39:39,102
Rise.

675
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:40,621
Thank you, Your Highness.

676
00:39:49,062 --> 00:39:49,502
Come on.

677
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:52,742
Ladies, come here.

678
00:40:03,661 --> 00:40:05,941
Lianxin can work outside

679
00:40:06,822 --> 00:40:07,822
without worries,

680
00:40:09,221 --> 00:40:11,181
thanks to you.

681
00:40:11,861 --> 00:40:13,861
You should take credit for it.

682
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:16,381
Today, regardless of your position,

683
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:18,000
all of you can attend the banquet.

684
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,502
Moreover,

685
00:40:19,062 --> 00:40:20,240
each of you shall receive a reward.

686
00:40:21,221 --> 00:40:21,782
Someone.

687
00:40:24,621 --> 00:40:28,022
These fans were given
by Grand Chancellor.

688
00:40:28,621 --> 00:40:29,502
They are of fine quality.

689
00:40:30,102 --> 00:40:31,621
Each of you should choose one.

690
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,542
Sure enough,
the craftsmanship is excellent,

691
00:40:37,302 --> 00:40:38,982
especially the gold engraving.

692
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:41,421
It is so refined.

693
00:40:43,782 --> 00:40:44,461
Lian,

694
00:40:45,421 --> 00:40:46,262
which one will you choose?

695
00:40:48,381 --> 00:40:49,600
I dare not overstep my bounderies.

696
00:40:50,542 --> 00:40:52,022
Both of you should choose first.

697
00:40:55,742 --> 00:40:57,861
Lian, just choose one as you're told to.

698
00:40:58,221 --> 00:40:59,661
Official Mu contributed greatly

699
00:40:59,822 --> 00:41:00,941
with your help.

700
00:41:01,381 --> 00:41:01,941
Come on.

701
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,480
Sedentary for a long time, I don't
know if the fragrance is in the room.

702
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,421
When I push the window open,
I see butterflies flying.

703
00:41:25,742 --> 00:41:27,381
Lian, you have good taste.

704
00:41:28,022 --> 00:41:29,102
Madam Yao, I'm flattered.

705
00:41:35,982 --> 00:41:36,701
Hold on.

706
00:41:38,381 --> 00:41:39,342
Why don't you

707
00:41:39,342 --> 00:41:40,901
let me have the one with pink peonies?

708
00:41:41,861 --> 00:41:42,360
