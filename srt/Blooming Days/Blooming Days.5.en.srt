00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:53,473
Luo Qinglian

18
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:55,033
You killed Hui'er.

19
00:01:55,552 --> 00:01:56,153
I didn't.

20
00:01:56,153 --> 00:01:57,232
You killed my son.

21
00:01:57,232 --> 00:01:57,992
Return my son to me!

22
00:01:58,113 --> 00:01:59,153
Return my son to me!

23
00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:00,793
Bring Madam back to rest!

24
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:02,632
Return him to me!

25
00:02:03,113 --> 00:02:04,073
- Dear.
- Madam.

26
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:06,793
Why did you kill him?

27
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,113
Why did you kill him?

28
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:11,113
- Madam.
- Madam.

29
00:02:11,113 --> 00:02:12,713
Jingshan, stay back.

30
00:02:26,232 --> 00:02:26,753
Servants.

31
00:02:29,753 --> 00:02:31,193
Lift Young Master out.

32
00:02:58,193 --> 00:02:59,152
Sir, please stay strong.

33
00:03:00,432 --> 00:03:01,633
I'm not the murderer.

34
00:03:04,712 --> 00:03:05,312
Master.

35
00:03:07,432 --> 00:03:08,432
I haven't even investigated it.

36
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:10,273
Why would I simply get anyone arrested?

37
00:03:13,753 --> 00:03:15,273
Jingshan, you'll talk first.

38
00:03:19,273 --> 00:03:20,273
Two hours ago,

39
00:03:21,712 --> 00:03:23,353
I accompanied Master
to look for Ms. Lian.

40
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:25,113
When we're at Ms. Lian,

41
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:26,872
Master didn't allow us to go in.

42
00:03:27,232 --> 00:03:28,393
We're asked to wait
at Jingqiu Courtyard.

43
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:29,633
Who would've thought?

44
00:03:29,952 --> 00:03:30,512
Later,

45
00:03:31,473 --> 00:03:32,712
this happened.

46
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:34,353
Lan'er.

47
00:03:36,553 --> 00:03:37,353
I'm a witness

48
00:03:37,512 --> 00:03:38,792
to what Jingshan said.

49
00:03:43,592 --> 00:03:44,672
Jingshan, go back.

50
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:45,592
Take care of Madam.

51
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:46,193
Yes.

52
00:03:49,232 --> 00:03:50,353
Lan'er, go on.

53
00:03:50,913 --> 00:03:52,633
Although Ms. Lian stayed,

54
00:03:52,872 --> 00:03:53,553
Lady Yao was worried that

55
00:03:53,553 --> 00:03:54,633
she might not behave.

56
00:03:54,952 --> 00:03:56,712
So she asked me to
monitor Liuyun Cottage.

57
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,633
I saw Young Master going into the room,

58
00:03:58,633 --> 00:03:59,712
yet he never came out.

59
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,353
Ms. Lian and her servant

60
00:04:01,353 --> 00:04:02,232
came out quietly

61
00:04:02,553 --> 00:04:03,473
with a package.

62
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:05,033
I thought something was wrong.

63
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:06,232
So I went into the room to have a look.

64
00:04:07,553 --> 00:04:09,353
Who knew Young Master would...

65
00:04:09,712 --> 00:04:10,952
He died here?

66
00:04:23,312 --> 00:04:24,033
Hui'er

67
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,872
discovered that his Snowball was dead.

68
00:04:27,953 --> 00:04:29,353
So he looked for Ms. Lian
to find out what happened.

69
00:04:30,673 --> 00:04:31,473
Who would have thought?

70
00:04:32,793 --> 00:04:34,353
If one could kill a cat,

71
00:04:34,793 --> 00:04:36,033
of course she could kill a person.

72
00:04:36,552 --> 00:04:37,712
Am I right, Ms. Lian?

73
00:04:44,592 --> 00:04:45,872
Lady Yao, you planned this carefully.

74
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:47,193
What else can I say?

75
00:04:48,312 --> 00:04:48,712
Yes.

76
00:04:49,712 --> 00:04:50,753
I kill without batting an eyelid.

77
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:52,712
I'm heartless.

78
00:04:52,913 --> 00:04:53,633
I wouldn't even spare

79
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:54,193
a child.

80
00:04:54,913 --> 00:04:55,312
Fine.

81
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,152
If I'd killed him,

82
00:04:57,432 --> 00:04:58,953
I must've thought Master

83
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:00,193
wouldn't pursue the case.

84
00:05:00,193 --> 00:05:00,953
Master, please be wise.

85
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,592
Ms. Lian is speaking sarcastically.

86
00:05:02,592 --> 00:05:03,272
Her words make sense.

87
00:05:03,592 --> 00:05:04,953
She had no grudge against Young Master.

88
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:06,312
She had no reason to kill him.

89
00:05:18,112 --> 00:05:19,312
Of course she did.

90
00:05:24,193 --> 00:05:25,633
Hui'er was ignorant

91
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:27,552
for getting in your way of escape.

92
00:05:30,513 --> 00:05:31,392
No.

93
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:33,033
Master, I didn't.

94
00:05:33,353 --> 00:05:33,953
Guards!

95
00:05:36,073 --> 00:05:36,473
Master,

96
00:05:36,673 --> 00:05:38,272
Drown Luo Qinglian and Lv Beiyi

97
00:05:39,312 --> 00:05:40,832
in Weixi Pond!

98
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:42,233
- Yes.
- Yes.

99
00:05:42,793 --> 00:05:43,193
Wait!

100
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:44,152
Master!

101
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:45,552
Think twice.

102
00:05:45,992 --> 00:05:46,712
Stay out of it!

103
00:05:46,712 --> 00:05:49,112
Master, think about
the duke's instruction!

104
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,913
Don't ever treat her as a concubine.

105
00:06:07,832 --> 00:06:08,913
Don't treat her as a concubine.

106
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:12,233
Don't treat her as a concubine.

107
00:06:19,552 --> 00:06:20,033
Master.

108
00:06:20,832 --> 00:06:21,793
I don't mind being wronged,

109
00:06:22,272 --> 00:06:23,592
but we must know the truth
behind Young Master's death.

110
00:06:24,312 --> 00:06:25,552
If I can't find the murderer,

111
00:06:26,073 --> 00:06:27,872
I'm willing to be executed!

112
00:06:34,272 --> 00:06:34,872
Guards.

113
00:06:35,592 --> 00:06:35,913
Yes.

114
00:06:36,753 --> 00:06:38,073
Lock this stableman up.

115
00:06:38,793 --> 00:06:40,033
Don't give him any water

116
00:06:40,392 --> 00:06:41,112
nor food!

117
00:06:41,312 --> 00:06:41,832
Yes.

118
00:06:46,953 --> 00:06:48,073
If you can't find out about the truth,

119
00:06:48,513 --> 00:06:49,392
I shall starve him.

120
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:50,193
He'll starve

121
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:51,073
for the time you take to
find out what happened.

122
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:52,432
I want you to see how

123
00:06:52,432 --> 00:06:53,832
he dies of starvation and thirst!

124
00:07:21,953 --> 00:07:25,272
Hui'er, get up.

125
00:07:27,073 --> 00:07:28,353
Get up.

126
00:07:31,353 --> 00:07:32,592
Get up.

127
00:07:58,392 --> 00:08:01,112
Madam, Ms. Lian is here.

128
00:08:01,473 --> 00:08:02,432
She wants to see you.

129
00:08:14,272 --> 00:08:15,392
Ms. Lian, please go back.

130
00:08:15,673 --> 00:08:16,432
Madam

131
00:08:16,832 --> 00:08:17,673
doesn't want to see you,

132
00:08:17,673 --> 00:08:18,633
whether you're here

133
00:08:18,673 --> 00:08:19,712
to pay your last respects
to Young Master

134
00:08:19,793 --> 00:08:20,432
or apologise.

135
00:08:36,753 --> 00:08:37,873
Madam, please stay strong.

136
00:08:38,592 --> 00:08:39,152
I'm

137
00:08:39,592 --> 00:08:41,033
not here to pay my last
respects to Young Master.

138
00:08:41,712 --> 00:08:43,313
Nor am I here to apologise.

139
00:08:44,072 --> 00:08:47,192
I'll try my best

140
00:08:47,632 --> 00:08:48,592
to identify the murderer.

141
00:08:50,952 --> 00:08:51,592
It's not just

142
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:53,233
for myself and Lv Beiyi.

143
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:57,473
It's also due to my guilt

144
00:08:57,952 --> 00:08:59,233
for what happened to Young Master.

145
00:09:00,793 --> 00:09:01,793
On the night of the incident,

146
00:09:02,832 --> 00:09:04,353
if I dropped everything

147
00:09:04,512 --> 00:09:05,632
to bring him back,

148
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:06,873
he might not have...

149
00:09:09,512 --> 00:09:10,192
This might not have happened.

150
00:09:17,993 --> 00:09:19,192
Madam, please have mercy on me.

151
00:09:20,673 --> 00:09:21,873
Perhaps others think that

152
00:09:22,592 --> 00:09:23,392
Young Master

153
00:09:24,113 --> 00:09:25,433
was nobler than others

154
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:26,353
and enjoyed a glamorous life,

155
00:09:27,353 --> 00:09:28,353
but I think

156
00:09:30,192 --> 00:09:31,313
he's pitiful.

157
00:09:32,993 --> 00:09:34,512
He had no true friend.

158
00:09:35,313 --> 00:09:37,272
Nor had he enjoyed
love from his parents,

159
00:09:37,793 --> 00:09:38,873
like how an ordinary family would.

160
00:09:40,152 --> 00:09:41,873
He's just a kid,

161
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:44,712
yet he's restrained by
rules and regulations.

162
00:09:45,632 --> 00:09:46,113
He couldn't

163
00:09:46,113 --> 00:09:47,793
p

164
00:09:49,553 --> 00:09:50,072
Madam.

165
00:09:51,152 --> 00:09:53,993
Young Master was unhappy.

166
00:09:55,072 --> 00:09:56,512
He's dead now.

167
00:09:57,873 --> 00:10:00,272
Don't you want him

168
00:10:01,512 --> 00:10:03,152
to rest in peace?

169
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:01,873
Ms. Lian is something.

170
00:11:02,113 --> 00:11:03,313
Even after what happened,

171
00:11:03,392 --> 00:11:04,632
Madam actually allowed her

172
00:11:04,632 --> 00:11:06,113
to interrogate the servants.

173
00:11:10,313 --> 00:11:11,673
If he didn't speak out of turn

174
00:11:11,673 --> 00:11:12,673
and mentioned the duke,

175
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,072
she would've have drowned in Weixi Pond

176
00:11:14,272 --> 00:11:14,913
and become food for the fishes.

177
00:11:16,553 --> 00:11:17,673
Next, Lan'er.

178
00:11:27,192 --> 00:11:28,712
Are you Lady Yao's

179
00:11:28,712 --> 00:11:29,752
trusted maid?

180
00:11:30,592 --> 00:11:31,033
Yes.

181
00:11:38,113 --> 00:11:38,832
Ms. Lian.

182
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,113
Do you have anything else to ask?

183
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:43,033
No. Go back.

184
00:12:00,873 --> 00:12:01,712
Next.

185
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:21,553
She just asked you a question?

186
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:23,152
It's just for formality.

187
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:25,632
Isn't it troublesome?

188
00:12:31,993 --> 00:12:33,152
Are you Lady Yao's

189
00:12:33,313 --> 00:12:34,072
maid from her family?

190
00:12:34,632 --> 00:12:35,113
Yes.

191
00:12:42,592 --> 00:12:43,192
Ms. Lian, since you have

192
00:12:43,192 --> 00:12:44,033
nothing else to ask,

193
00:12:44,033 --> 00:12:45,313
I shall go back first.

194
00:12:45,752 --> 00:12:47,473
What's the rush? Sit down.

195
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:01,632
Tell me.

196
00:13:04,752 --> 00:13:06,473
How did Young Master

197
00:13:06,473 --> 00:13:07,512
die at the hands of Lady Yao?

198
00:13:08,233 --> 00:13:08,632
Ms. Lian,

199
00:13:08,632 --> 00:13:09,913
don't simply accuse anyone.

200
00:13:10,192 --> 00:13:11,113
Young Master

201
00:13:11,113 --> 00:13:12,553
died in your room.

202
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:14,793
How many times did Lady Yao

203
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,512
come to Liuyun Cottage last night?

204
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:17,832
What did she do every time?

205
00:13:19,392 --> 00:13:21,392
She came to Liuyun Cottage twice.

206
00:13:21,913 --> 00:13:23,752
She did the first time when she
discovered that Young Master

207
00:13:23,752 --> 00:13:24,832
died in your room.

208
00:13:25,152 --> 00:13:26,233
She came the second time

209
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:27,433
to capture you.

210
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:28,632
She came with Master.

211
00:13:29,512 --> 00:13:31,433
Before she came to
Liuyun Cottage for the first time,

212
00:13:31,993 --> 00:13:33,512
Lan'er saw me and Dongli going out.

213
00:13:33,592 --> 00:13:34,392
When she went back,

214
00:13:34,832 --> 00:13:36,152
what did she tell Lady Yao?

215
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:38,913
She said

216
00:13:39,473 --> 00:13:41,433
you and Dongli held a package

217
00:13:41,832 --> 00:13:42,673
and left the house.

218
00:13:57,993 --> 00:13:58,592
Ms. Lian.

219
00:14:00,152 --> 00:14:01,392
I might have to go back now.

220
00:14:02,993 --> 00:14:03,592
No rush.

221
00:14:04,272 --> 00:14:05,233
Dongli, pour tea for me.

222
00:14:05,673 --> 00:14:06,272
Yes.

223
00:14:09,993 --> 00:14:10,873
Madam, rest assured.

224
00:14:11,152 --> 00:14:12,632
You told us before we went

225
00:14:12,913 --> 00:14:13,553
to play dumb if we're asked

226
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:14,553
too many questions.

227
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:17,152
Ruhua wouldn't mess it up.

228
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:25,233
The girl is not smart to begin with.

229
00:14:25,793 --> 00:14:26,632
She's spent four hours

230
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:27,752
at Liuyun Cottage.

231
00:14:29,072 --> 00:14:29,952
Since there's no problem

232
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:30,913
with others,

233
00:14:31,392 --> 00:14:32,752
she would've let her guard down.

234
00:14:36,632 --> 00:14:37,233
No.

235
00:14:38,952 --> 00:14:39,832
She can't stay there.

236
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:47,072
Let me ask you again.

237
00:14:48,553 --> 00:14:48,993
After Lan'er saw

238
00:14:48,993 --> 00:14:50,313
me and Dongli going out,

239
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:53,152
what did she tell Lady Yao?

240
00:14:53,152 --> 00:14:54,832
I've answered you so many times.

241
00:14:54,993 --> 00:14:56,473
She said you and Dongli went out.

242
00:14:56,752 --> 00:14:57,473
How dare you!

243
00:14:59,113 --> 00:15:00,272
If Madam were asking you in person,

244
00:15:00,793 --> 00:15:02,152
would you dare to lie like that?

245
00:15:02,632 --> 00:15:04,072
Lan'er has revealed everything.

246
00:15:04,673 --> 00:15:06,632
How dare you try to conceal it.

247
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:07,632
Lan'er?

248
00:15:07,993 --> 00:15:09,072
What did Lan'er say?

249
00:15:09,632 --> 00:15:10,512
Lan'er said

250
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:11,793
Lady Yao

251
00:15:12,113 --> 00:15:13,553
didn't want to kill Young Master,

252
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,913
but your presence beside her

253
00:15:16,152 --> 00:15:17,113
distracted her.

254
00:15:17,113 --> 00:15:18,913
Lan'er was lying! She obviously...

255
00:15:19,272 --> 00:15:19,873
Ruhua.

256
00:15:23,993 --> 00:15:24,993
Bring Ruhua back.

257
00:15:25,113 --> 00:15:25,673
Yes.

258
00:15:26,553 --> 00:15:27,793
Madam issued the order.

259
00:15:27,952 --> 00:15:28,553
How dare you try

260
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:29,473
to bring away

261
00:15:29,632 --> 00:15:30,712
such an important witness.

262
00:15:31,353 --> 00:15:31,793
This girl?

263
00:15:32,752 --> 00:15:33,673
How can she be a witness?

264
00:15:34,272 --> 00:15:35,192
She was unwell that day.

265
00:15:36,192 --> 00:15:36,952
She was never there.

266
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:38,433
How could a person who wasn't there

267
00:15:39,113 --> 00:15:40,033
be a  witness?

268
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,072
Madam is right.

269
00:15:41,353 --> 00:15:42,592
I was unwell that night.

270
00:15:42,592 --> 00:15:43,632
I don't know anything.

271
00:15:43,873 --> 00:15:45,752
Ms. Lian, you tried to
keep a patient here.

272
00:15:46,632 --> 00:15:48,152
Are you trying to get
a coerced confession out of her

273
00:15:48,152 --> 00:15:49,192
to get out of this?

274
00:15:54,152 --> 00:15:55,313
If she's unrelated to it,

275
00:15:56,192 --> 00:15:57,712
Lady Yao, why would you care

276
00:15:58,233 --> 00:15:59,272
and insist on taking her away?

277
00:16:00,113 --> 00:16:00,673
It's because

278
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,712
she stole my possession.

279
00:16:06,512 --> 00:16:07,072
My beloved pair

280
00:16:07,072 --> 00:16:08,272
of decorative flowers are missing.

281
00:16:08,272 --> 00:16:09,192
Did you steal them?

282
00:16:09,793 --> 00:16:10,553
I...

283
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:13,473
I'm not sure.

284
00:16:13,832 --> 00:16:14,913
How can you be not sure?

285
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:16,272
Bring her back for interrogation.

286
00:16:16,752 --> 00:16:17,072
Come on!

287
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,192
Ms. Lian, thanks for the investigation.

288
00:16:23,712 --> 00:16:25,392
I thank you on behalf
of Madam and Master.

289
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:38,673
Madam, you're smart.

290
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,313
Who does Luo Qinglian think she is?

291
00:16:40,592 --> 00:16:42,392
She even wanted to fight you.

292
00:16:42,873 --> 00:16:43,272
Shut up!

293
00:16:46,712 --> 00:16:47,832
Do you think we've won?

294
00:16:49,952 --> 00:16:50,433
Madam.

295
00:16:51,993 --> 00:16:53,072
What did Luo Qinglian say to you?

296
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:54,272
Tell me everything.

297
00:16:58,832 --> 00:16:59,512
What a pity,

298
00:16:59,873 --> 00:17:01,272
we almost found out who it was.

299
00:17:03,433 --> 00:17:04,553
Didn't we?

300
00:17:06,313 --> 00:17:07,272
What did Ruhua say?

301
00:17:07,473 --> 00:17:08,632
I didn't hear anything.

302
00:17:09,472 --> 00:17:10,472
I wasn't expecting her

303
00:17:10,472 --> 00:17:11,073
to confess in the first place.

304
00:17:11,793 --> 00:17:12,512
I'm waiting

305
00:17:13,313 --> 00:17:14,472
for the mastermind
who's getting impatient.

306
00:17:16,392 --> 00:17:19,152
Mu Haiyao, it's indeed you.

307
00:17:21,033 --> 00:17:22,073
What are we going to do next?

308
00:17:22,313 --> 00:17:23,232
Have you figured it out, Miss?

309
00:17:24,232 --> 00:17:25,033
Since we've identified the murderer,

310
00:17:25,313 --> 00:17:26,313
we'll have clues.

311
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:28,713
Nothing

312
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:29,632
shall remain a secret

313
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:30,673
in this world.

314
00:17:54,112 --> 00:17:56,112
Come on, please have tea.

315
00:17:58,073 --> 00:17:59,872
Are you going out?

316
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:02,272
Yes.

317
00:18:03,272 --> 00:18:04,272
I was unwell

318
00:18:04,272 --> 00:18:05,553
when I woke up this morning.

319
00:18:06,073 --> 00:18:07,553
I want to visit a physician.

320
00:18:09,992 --> 00:18:11,472
If you wash and change the clothes,

321
00:18:11,992 --> 00:18:13,033
they can last for a month.

322
00:18:13,632 --> 00:18:15,272
Are you looking for a physician

323
00:18:15,593 --> 00:18:16,992
or going to be an apprentice for him?

324
00:18:23,593 --> 00:18:24,073
Sister Rong.

325
00:18:24,953 --> 00:18:26,232
We stay the closest.

326
00:18:27,752 --> 00:18:28,593
You must've

327
00:18:29,272 --> 00:18:30,352
seen something last night.

328
00:18:35,992 --> 00:18:38,433
We don't know each other,

329
00:18:39,112 --> 00:18:39,793
but

330
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:42,073
I'm framed.

331
00:18:43,512 --> 00:18:45,033
Master Hui died tragically.

332
00:18:45,632 --> 00:18:46,472
Also, Madam

333
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:48,232
will remain alone
for the rest of her life.

334
00:18:49,673 --> 00:18:50,392
After what happened,

335
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:53,033
are you still not going to testify

336
00:18:53,872 --> 00:18:54,833
against Lady Yao?

337
00:19:00,193 --> 00:19:00,673
Miss.

338
00:19:01,553 --> 00:19:02,872
If you saw anything,

339
00:19:02,913 --> 00:19:03,833
just tell them.

340
00:19:04,433 --> 00:19:05,992
We're suffering,

341
00:19:06,193 --> 00:19:07,833
thanks to Lady Yao.

342
00:19:08,392 --> 00:19:09,553
As long as she's around,

343
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,472
we'll remain lowly.

344
00:19:12,033 --> 00:19:12,673
Why don't you...

345
00:19:12,673 --> 00:19:13,352
Stop talking.

346
00:19:14,472 --> 00:19:15,152
I really

347
00:19:16,593 --> 00:19:17,872
didn't see anything.

348
00:19:24,152 --> 00:19:26,193
Sorry for trying to make you talk.

349
00:19:27,512 --> 00:19:28,752
You're so gentle and kind.

350
00:19:29,433 --> 00:19:30,593
Even if you say nothing,

351
00:19:31,433 --> 00:19:32,392
I won't blame you.

352
00:19:33,313 --> 00:19:34,992
The worst outcome is death.

353
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,232
Dying with someone I love

354
00:19:37,992 --> 00:19:40,272
is better than seeing him

355
00:19:41,793 --> 00:19:43,433
being deprived of food and water

356
00:19:43,992 --> 00:19:44,913
and having to bear the sunlight.

357
00:20:04,193 --> 00:20:04,913
Sorry to disturb you.

358
00:20:14,232 --> 00:20:15,872
Miss, aren't we leaving?

359
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:20,073
Where else can we go?

360
00:20:22,593 --> 00:20:23,392
How can we ever

361
00:20:23,392 --> 00:20:24,833
escape Lady Yao?

362
00:20:25,953 --> 00:20:27,793
Miss, did you seriously see something?

363
00:20:28,313 --> 00:20:28,953
I just wish

364
00:20:28,953 --> 00:20:30,392
I had never seen anything.

365
00:20:43,673 --> 00:20:44,833
Stop looking. Go.

366
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:45,913
He's pitiful.

367
00:20:46,232 --> 00:20:47,553
Stop looking. Come on.

368
00:20:55,152 --> 00:20:55,793
Greetings, Master.

369
00:20:57,392 --> 00:20:58,232
Thanks to you,

370
00:20:59,033 --> 00:20:59,913
I'm fine.

371
00:21:01,232 --> 00:21:02,073
Master, you can resent me,

372
00:21:02,632 --> 00:21:03,593
but if you summoned me

373
00:21:03,593 --> 00:21:04,752
just to humiliate me,

374
00:21:05,392 --> 00:21:06,152
well, I'm running out of time,

375
00:21:06,313 --> 00:21:06,953
excuse me.

376
00:21:07,953 --> 00:21:08,673
Are you busy?

377
00:21:09,713 --> 00:21:10,553
Why am I not busy?

378
00:21:11,232 --> 00:21:12,272
The outcome is clear.

379
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,112
What are you trying to investigate?

380
00:21:15,112 --> 00:21:16,073
What can you find out?

381
00:21:19,392 --> 00:21:20,193
I'll ask you again.

382
00:21:21,232 --> 00:21:22,313
Did you kill Hui'er?

383
00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:24,833
Master, you indeed have
too much free time.

384
00:21:25,073 --> 00:21:25,673
You enjoy asking

385
00:21:25,673 --> 00:21:26,913
questions with obvious answers.

386
00:21:26,992 --> 00:21:28,152
I want you to answer me directly.

387
00:21:28,152 --> 00:21:28,752
No!

388
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:00,713
Look at your face.

389
00:22:03,232 --> 00:22:04,112
You look innocent

390
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:06,833
and honest.

391
00:22:08,073 --> 00:22:09,913
I was almost convinced.

392
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:18,913
I'll let you investigate

393
00:22:19,313 --> 00:22:20,512
and put on an act if
that's what you want!

394
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:22,272
However, remember,

395
00:22:22,913 --> 00:22:24,593
when you are at your wits' end,

396
00:22:25,033 --> 00:22:27,313
everything will be over and he'll die!

397
00:23:15,472 --> 00:23:17,553
Miss, it's already the third day.

398
00:23:18,793 --> 00:23:20,193
Since Ms. Rong knew something,

399
00:23:20,472 --> 00:23:21,433
why don't you think of a way

400
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:22,272
to make her speak?

401
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,152
There're many ways.

402
00:23:24,872 --> 00:23:25,872
Ms. Rong is gentle and kind.

403
00:23:26,632 --> 00:23:27,433
How could I bear

404
00:23:27,593 --> 00:23:28,872
to use the ways on her?

405
00:23:30,193 --> 00:23:31,833
It's all right if the truth
would be revealed,

406
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,632
but if we failed to
find out about the truth,

407
00:23:34,593 --> 00:23:35,992
the culprit would retaliate against her.

408
00:23:36,512 --> 00:23:37,512
I'd end up landing her in trouble.

409
00:23:39,193 --> 00:23:40,593
If Madam offers protection,

410
00:23:41,073 --> 00:23:41,913
Ms. Rong

411
00:23:41,992 --> 00:23:42,992
won't be in danger then.

412
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,553
Madam doesn't even trust me.

413
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:48,193
How can you gain her trust?

414
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:49,553
Ms. Rong remains tight-lipped,

415
00:23:49,632 --> 00:23:50,752
while the dead can't speak.

416
00:23:51,193 --> 00:23:52,112
How to investigate the case?

417
00:23:54,193 --> 00:23:55,392
The dead can't speak?

418
00:23:58,313 --> 00:23:59,593
It's the third day.

419
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,593
It's Hui'er's funeral.

420
00:24:17,392 --> 00:24:17,913
Forget it.

421
00:24:18,272 --> 00:24:18,872
Forget it.

422
00:24:25,152 --> 00:24:25,793
What a pity.

423
00:24:38,152 --> 00:24:40,033
Brother, you specially came to
pay your last respects to Hui'er.

424
00:24:41,632 --> 00:24:42,752
I'm grateful.

425
00:24:44,272 --> 00:24:45,433
Father asked me to come

426
00:24:46,313 --> 00:24:47,313
to pay his last respects
to his grandson.

427
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,193
Brother, stay strong.

428
00:24:51,793 --> 00:24:52,433
Thanks, brother.

429
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:11,593
Murderer.

430
00:25:12,472 --> 00:25:14,073
How dare you show up
at Hui'er's funeral.

431
00:25:15,112 --> 00:25:16,553
Lady Yao, we used to act differently,

432
00:25:17,272 --> 00:25:18,913
but this time, we think the same.

433
00:25:19,553 --> 00:25:20,913
The gods are watching.

434
00:25:21,392 --> 00:25:22,272
Isn't the culprit

435
00:25:23,433 --> 00:25:25,033
afraid of retribution?

436
00:25:29,713 --> 00:25:31,112
Seal the coffin!

437
00:25:42,512 --> 00:25:43,913
No.

438
00:25:43,913 --> 00:25:44,872
- Please don't do it.
- Madam.

439
00:25:45,352 --> 00:25:45,752
Madam.

440
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:46,713
No. Hui'er.

441
00:25:47,752 --> 00:25:48,433
Hui'er.

442
00:25:51,553 --> 00:25:53,073
My son!

443
00:25:55,793 --> 00:25:56,193
Madam.

444
00:25:56,193 --> 00:25:56,713
Go away!

445
00:25:56,713 --> 00:25:57,472
Madam, please...

446
00:25:57,593 --> 00:25:59,392
Madam, calm down.

447
00:25:59,512 --> 00:26:00,392
Calm down.

448
00:26:01,232 --> 00:26:03,392
Trust me.

449
00:26:03,752 --> 00:26:04,392
It's Mu Haiyao.

450
00:26:08,793 --> 00:26:10,673
Guards, let me out!

451
00:26:13,953 --> 00:26:15,033
Young Master is not dead yet.

452
00:26:16,392 --> 00:26:17,313
Save me.

453
00:26:18,112 --> 00:26:18,913
I just

454
00:26:18,913 --> 00:26:19,833
dozed off here.

455
00:26:20,313 --> 00:26:21,472
Why can't I get out?

456
00:26:23,272 --> 00:26:24,193
Let me out.

457
00:26:25,512 --> 00:26:26,512
Let me out.

458
00:26:27,913 --> 00:26:29,713
Guards, let me out.

459
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:40,713
Let me out.

460
00:26:41,512 --> 00:26:43,313
Guards, let me out.

461
00:26:44,992 --> 00:26:45,992
Let me out.

462
00:26:48,152 --> 00:26:49,232
Let me out.

463
00:26:49,553 --> 00:26:50,392
Guards.

464
00:26:56,433 --> 00:26:57,352
(Mu Haiyao's guard, Xu Liangchuan)
Why are you here?

465
00:26:58,073 --> 00:26:58,953
You put on an act just now.

466
00:26:59,272 --> 00:27:00,152
What are you up to?

467
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:05,673
Ms. Lian,

468
00:27:05,752 --> 00:27:06,433
you asked your servant

469
00:27:06,433 --> 00:27:07,232
to put on an act.

470
00:27:07,232 --> 00:27:08,232
What are you up to?

471
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,073
My servant made a mistake.

472
00:27:10,472 --> 00:27:11,632
Of course I'll punish her.

473
00:27:13,152 --> 00:27:14,112
However, Lady Yao,

474
00:27:14,872 --> 00:27:16,152
why were you so scared just now?

475
00:27:19,752 --> 00:27:21,193
Who wouldn't be scared
if a dead person spoke?

476
00:27:21,553 --> 00:27:23,073
You wouldn't be unless you
knew beforehand, Ms. Lian.

477
00:27:23,193 --> 00:27:23,793
Yes.

478
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:26,112
She disrupted Young Master's funeral.

479
00:27:26,713 --> 00:27:29,112
In my opinion, she should
be punished severely.

480
00:27:32,392 --> 00:27:32,992
Enough.

481
00:27:34,112 --> 00:27:34,673
Lift the coffin.

482
00:27:40,632 --> 00:27:43,673
It's time! Lift the coffin!

483
00:27:50,112 --> 00:27:51,553
You should've told us

484
00:27:51,673 --> 00:27:52,392
if the money from
the heir wasn't enough.

485
00:27:52,752 --> 00:27:53,472
A kid is dead,

486
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:54,752
yet Luo Qinglian remains alive.

487
00:27:55,392 --> 00:27:56,752
Please tell the heir not to worry.

488
00:27:57,073 --> 00:27:58,673
It's been three days.
The murderer is not identified.

489
00:27:58,913 --> 00:28:00,033
Master Xin will

490
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:00,992
drown her in Weixi Pond.

491
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:04,433
Regardless of whether
the truth will be revealed,

492
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:05,193
if she's not dead

493
00:28:05,193 --> 00:28:06,833
by today, you'll die instead.

494
00:28:56,392 --> 00:28:57,112
You've seen everything.

495
00:28:58,913 --> 00:29:00,512
Based on the evidence and motives,

496
00:29:01,232 --> 00:29:02,752
you're undoubtedly the murderer.

497
00:29:03,752 --> 00:29:05,793
Why would I believe you

498
00:29:06,632 --> 00:29:07,632
based on Mu Haiyao's expression?

499
00:29:08,632 --> 00:29:09,872
Madam, if you think carefully,

500
00:29:10,073 --> 00:29:11,512
you'll realise the so-called evidence

501
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:13,073
is flawed.

502
00:29:14,472 --> 00:29:16,193
Hui'er hit the edge
of the table and died.

503
00:29:17,152 --> 00:29:18,512
There must have been a lot of blood.

504
00:29:18,992 --> 00:29:21,112
However, in my room, other
than the edge of the table,

505
00:29:21,673 --> 00:29:22,953
there's minimal bloodstain

506
00:29:23,033 --> 00:29:24,152
in other places.

507
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:26,193
When I saw Hui'er,

508
00:29:26,352 --> 00:29:27,433
you're holding him.

509
00:29:28,193 --> 00:29:29,352
The blood on you

510
00:29:29,752 --> 00:29:31,433
was more than the blood in my room.

511
00:29:39,992 --> 00:29:40,512
Madam,

512
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:42,953
one's expression might not be obvious,

513
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:45,193
but it shows the person's intention.

514
00:29:46,872 --> 00:29:48,793
Who would kill a cat

515
00:29:48,793 --> 00:29:50,112
just to frame another person?

516
00:29:51,193 --> 00:29:52,752
Madam, you've been in
the mansion for years.

517
00:29:53,872 --> 00:29:55,232
You know everyone's character

518
00:29:55,673 --> 00:29:56,992
very well.

519
00:30:16,073 --> 00:30:17,112
It's her.

520
00:30:29,512 --> 00:30:30,752
However, I have no evidence.

521
00:30:33,512 --> 00:30:34,152
How can I

522
00:30:34,152 --> 00:30:35,433
seek justice for Hui'er?

523
00:30:36,313 --> 00:30:37,512
Madam, since you believe it,

524
00:30:38,352 --> 00:30:39,433
I'll tell you one more

525
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,992
person who might have evidence.

526
00:30:49,352 --> 00:30:50,272
Madam summoned me.

527
00:30:50,992 --> 00:30:51,793
She's not here.

528
00:30:52,193 --> 00:30:52,953
Where is she?

529
00:30:53,793 --> 00:30:54,793
Liuyun Cottage.

530
00:30:58,433 --> 00:30:59,193
Lady Yao.

531
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:01,232
Madam asked me

532
00:31:01,232 --> 00:31:02,392
to keep you company.

533
00:31:02,673 --> 00:31:04,152
Please wait for a while.

534
00:31:40,472 --> 00:31:41,073
I...

535
00:31:41,953 --> 00:31:42,392
I

536
00:31:42,392 --> 00:31:43,472
seriously didn't see anything.

537
00:31:45,073 --> 00:31:46,752
Do you have no respect for me

538
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:48,752
now that I've lost

539
00:31:48,752 --> 00:31:49,593
my son?

540
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:50,713
I wouldn't dare.

541
00:31:51,152 --> 00:31:51,953
You wouldn't dare?

542
00:31:53,232 --> 00:31:53,872
Guards!

543
00:31:54,673 --> 00:31:56,112
Hit her

544
00:31:56,593 --> 00:31:57,593
until she speaks.

545
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:58,392
Madam,

546
00:31:58,632 --> 00:31:59,793
please give me one more chance

547
00:32:00,313 --> 00:32:01,152
to convince her.

548
00:32:04,433 --> 00:32:04,953
You may leave.

549
00:32:07,112 --> 00:32:07,752
Sister Rong,

550
00:32:08,433 --> 00:32:09,793
I bet you know perfectly well

551
00:32:10,073 --> 00:32:11,272
I could've used

552
00:32:11,872 --> 00:32:13,232
any method

553
00:32:13,232 --> 00:32:14,073
to make you speak.

554
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,512
When you interrogated the servants,

555
00:32:17,553 --> 00:32:18,593
I could tell that

556
00:32:19,193 --> 00:32:20,433
you're intelligent.

557
00:32:21,752 --> 00:32:23,033
However, I didn't do that.

558
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:26,433
I've brought Madam here

559
00:32:26,992 --> 00:32:29,152
because

560
00:32:29,593 --> 00:32:30,713
she can protect you.

561
00:32:31,872 --> 00:32:33,033
We meet each other of all the people.

562
00:32:33,752 --> 00:32:34,152
It's

563
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:35,472
fate's arrangement.

564
00:32:36,553 --> 00:32:37,632
If I had a choice,

565
00:32:38,352 --> 00:32:39,793
I wouldn't want to land you in trouble.

566
00:32:41,512 --> 00:32:43,033
However, I'm not the only one

567
00:32:43,313 --> 00:32:44,632
who's being wronged here.

568
00:32:45,232 --> 00:32:46,152
Another person

569
00:32:46,392 --> 00:32:47,472
is suffering because of me.

570
00:32:48,953 --> 00:32:49,512
Sister Rong.

571
00:32:49,953 --> 00:32:51,793
Can you help me for once?

572
00:32:53,512 --> 00:32:55,593
I'll do anything in my future life

573
00:32:56,352 --> 00:32:57,593
to repay you.

574
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:02,992
It seems

575
00:33:03,193 --> 00:33:04,193
your words

576
00:33:04,713 --> 00:33:05,953
are not as effective as the beating.

577
00:33:07,272 --> 00:33:07,953
Guards!

578
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:09,472
Madam,

579
00:33:10,112 --> 00:33:11,033
I proposed the idea.

580
00:33:11,313 --> 00:33:12,272
You should just hit me.

581
00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:13,313
It's not her fault!

582
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:15,872
Do you think I dare not hit you?

583
00:33:16,553 --> 00:33:17,913
Jingshan, slap her!

584
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:18,472
I'll tell.

585
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:24,472
That night,

586
00:33:26,112 --> 00:33:27,352
I saw a girl

587
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:29,512
holding a gunny sack

588
00:33:29,793 --> 00:33:31,193
and walking into Ms. Lian's room.

589
00:33:32,512 --> 00:33:33,793
The gunny sack contained something.

590
00:33:34,553 --> 00:33:37,433
It was the size of a child.

591
00:33:37,953 --> 00:33:38,472
Who was it?

592
00:33:40,193 --> 00:33:41,313
Who was holding the gunny sack?

593
00:33:42,512 --> 00:33:43,313
It's too dark.

594
00:33:43,793 --> 00:33:45,193
I couldn't see clearly.

595
00:33:52,872 --> 00:33:53,632
Sister Rong.

596
00:33:54,272 --> 00:33:54,913
Get up.

597
00:34:00,313 --> 00:34:01,033
Thank you.

598
00:34:07,752 --> 00:34:08,793
With your clue,

599
00:34:09,713 --> 00:34:11,313
I can surely find evidence.

600
00:34:17,192 --> 00:34:17,712
Sister Lian.

601
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:18,313
Miss!

602
00:34:18,593 --> 00:34:19,073
Miss, what's wrong?

603
00:34:19,073 --> 00:34:19,793
Sister Lian, what's wrong with you?

604
00:34:19,793 --> 00:34:22,153
Miss!

605
00:34:22,752 --> 00:34:23,553
Miss!

606
00:34:24,393 --> 00:34:24,952
Sister Lian.

607
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:25,952
Miss.

608
00:34:44,192 --> 00:34:44,633
Madam.

609
00:34:45,272 --> 00:34:46,153
Forgive me,

610
00:34:46,672 --> 00:34:48,593
Ms. Lian is dying, I'm afraid.

611
00:35:16,272 --> 00:35:17,712
Please stay awake,
no matter how tired you are.

612
00:35:18,313 --> 00:35:19,472
Both of us are lowly.

613
00:35:19,712 --> 00:35:20,952
We have to give in to everybody,

614
00:35:21,393 --> 00:35:22,272
but we can't

615
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:23,672
give up in life.

616
00:35:28,553 --> 00:35:29,432
Tell me.

617
00:35:29,952 --> 00:35:31,272
I would do whatever I could.

618
00:35:33,313 --> 00:35:34,113
Look...

619
00:35:35,553 --> 00:35:36,712
Look for Lv Beiyi.

620
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:39,512
All right, I'll go right away.

621
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:44,912
Miss.

622
00:35:45,752 --> 00:35:48,272
Stay awake.

623
00:35:48,512 --> 00:35:49,232
The physician said if
you lost consciousness,

624
00:35:49,793 --> 00:35:51,113
you would never wake up.

625
00:36:00,432 --> 00:36:01,912
Lv Beiyi, wake up.

626
00:36:02,353 --> 00:36:03,113
Wake up.

627
00:36:03,432 --> 00:36:04,113
Ms. Lian is dying.

628
00:36:04,113 --> 00:36:04,712
Miss.

629
00:36:05,353 --> 00:36:07,113
Why don't we stay out of this?

630
00:36:07,393 --> 00:36:08,712
If Lady Yao sees us...

631
00:36:10,553 --> 00:36:12,192
I've let Ms. Lian down once.

632
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:13,512
I can't bear to see her

633
00:36:13,512 --> 00:36:14,432
dying.

634
00:36:15,752 --> 00:36:17,393
Lv Beiyi, wake up.

635
00:36:17,512 --> 00:36:19,073
Wake up, Ms. Lian is dying.

636
00:36:19,593 --> 00:36:21,472
Wake up.

637
00:36:26,033 --> 00:36:27,272
Ms. Lian drank this.

638
00:36:27,593 --> 00:36:28,313
What should I do?

639
00:36:50,153 --> 00:36:51,553
Wake up.

640
00:36:51,752 --> 00:36:52,512
You must wake up.

641
00:36:52,672 --> 00:36:53,712
Wake up.

642
00:36:54,192 --> 00:36:55,633
Hurry up, wake up.

643
00:37:07,313 --> 00:37:07,912
Miss.

644
00:37:08,752 --> 00:37:10,992
Stay awake.

645
00:37:11,432 --> 00:37:12,192
Miss!

646
00:37:12,912 --> 00:37:13,593
Miss!

647
00:37:18,472 --> 00:37:19,672
You have unbelievable tactics.

648
00:37:20,393 --> 00:37:21,672
You could try to take a person's life

649
00:37:22,232 --> 00:37:23,633
without even leaving the house.

650
00:37:29,073 --> 00:37:30,593
I already told you

651
00:37:30,672 --> 00:37:32,192
the poison was not from me.

652
00:37:33,153 --> 00:37:34,512
So you kept me here

653
00:37:34,512 --> 00:37:35,633
to monitor me.

654
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:38,232
Since when do you treat me

655
00:37:38,393 --> 00:37:39,992
as your enemy?

656
00:37:42,952 --> 00:37:44,912
One's biggest enemy is oneself,

657
00:37:45,232 --> 00:37:47,472
while his or her
best friend is the heaven.

658
00:37:48,073 --> 00:37:49,313
Do you believe

659
00:37:49,432 --> 00:37:52,113
in retribution?

660
00:37:52,873 --> 00:37:54,153
Of course I do.

661
00:37:54,793 --> 00:37:55,873
My love for Master

662
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,952
is true.

663
00:37:58,432 --> 00:37:59,793
That's why Master

664
00:38:00,073 --> 00:38:02,113
cares the most about me.

665
00:38:04,752 --> 00:38:06,073
I'm tired. I won't see you off.

666
00:38:15,992 --> 00:38:18,153
Did Ruhua poison Luo Qinglian?

667
00:38:21,873 --> 00:38:22,593
No.

668
00:38:23,672 --> 00:38:24,793
Was it Lan'er?

669
00:38:30,793 --> 00:38:32,992
Ms. Rong.

670
00:38:33,712 --> 00:38:34,553
Master instructed us

671
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,553
not to give him

672
00:38:35,672 --> 00:38:36,313
any food or water.

673
00:38:36,432 --> 00:38:37,553
We're supposed to starve him.

674
00:38:37,672 --> 00:38:38,952
I'm not going to give him water.

675
00:38:39,153 --> 00:38:40,353
I have to pour water

676
00:38:40,432 --> 00:38:41,232
on him to wake him up.

677
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:42,472
Ms. Rong...

678
00:38:50,593 --> 00:38:51,272
Wake up.

679
00:38:54,192 --> 00:38:54,793
Wake up.

680
00:39:20,113 --> 00:39:20,912
Lan'er is unbelievable.

681
00:39:21,113 --> 00:39:22,633
She rarely speaks,

682
00:39:22,752 --> 00:39:23,512
but would even poison her

683
00:39:23,512 --> 00:39:24,512
just to please Lady Yao.

684
00:39:24,633 --> 00:39:25,833
She's scheming.

685
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:44,712
Miss, slow down.

686
00:39:44,912 --> 00:39:45,793
Slow down.

687
00:40:00,353 --> 00:40:00,833
Who is it?

688
00:40:04,272 --> 00:40:05,033
Is there anyone here?

689
00:40:17,952 --> 00:40:18,672
Sun Yong!

690
00:40:20,153 --> 00:40:20,992
Come out to move stuff.

691
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:21,472
Yes.

692
00:40:54,073 --> 00:40:55,793
You gave me old clothes

693
00:40:56,272 --> 00:40:57,272
and told me

694
00:40:57,712 --> 00:40:58,952
someone went to my place

695
00:40:58,952 --> 00:41:00,033
to frame me.

696
00:41:01,232 --> 00:41:03,873
You're now running around

697
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:05,873
to save my life.

698
00:41:07,553 --> 00:41:09,432
I'm indebted to you.

699
00:41:10,472 --> 00:41:11,472
I don't know how to repay you.

700
00:41:11,952 --> 00:41:13,353
Throughout my four years in the mansion,

701
00:41:14,232 --> 00:41:15,353
I've been weak and timid.

702
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:17,192
I can only

703
00:41:17,873 --> 00:41:19,432
protect myself.

704
00:41:20,793 --> 00:41:23,793
I never go all out in anything.

705
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:25,593
I'm never

706
00:41:26,672 --> 00:41:27,952
entirely truthful in what I say.

707
00:41:28,873 --> 00:41:30,073
Even so,

708
00:41:31,232 --> 00:41:33,432
you're willing to tell the truth for me.

709
00:41:35,472 --> 00:41:37,680
You treat me good enough.
