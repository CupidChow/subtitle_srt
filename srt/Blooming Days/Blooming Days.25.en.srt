00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:51,572
Madam, please drink tea.

18
00:02:01,213 --> 00:02:01,853
Madam.

19
00:02:01,972 --> 00:02:03,493
Are you still angry at Madam Lian?

20
00:02:03,972 --> 00:02:05,012
I'm not angry.

21
00:02:05,853 --> 00:02:07,572
She actually set aside
the revenge for her son

22
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:09,612
and helped Madam Zhen
to deliver her child.

23
00:02:11,493 --> 00:02:12,892
She set aside revenge for her son?

24
00:02:14,653 --> 00:02:15,612
Nothing

25
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:18,293
on earth

26
00:02:18,892 --> 00:02:20,612
can compare to revenge for a son.

27
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:24,653
Luo Qinglian

28
00:02:24,892 --> 00:02:26,252
wouldn't help Nan Ruzhen.

29
00:02:27,293 --> 00:02:28,573
She must have done everything

30
00:02:29,413 --> 00:02:30,653
for another purpose.

31
00:02:45,172 --> 00:02:45,812
Be good, Yun'er.

32
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:46,812
Hurry.

33
00:02:47,653 --> 00:02:48,812
Smile to your father.

34
00:02:54,612 --> 00:02:55,892
When Yun'er was newly born,

35
00:02:56,452 --> 00:02:58,013
the physician said he
could develop asthma

36
00:02:58,532 --> 00:02:59,892
after the lengthy labour process.

37
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:02,493
Fortunately, he was given a sachet

38
00:03:02,493 --> 00:03:03,373
to bring along.

39
00:03:04,573 --> 00:03:05,972
No worries, Yun'er.

40
00:03:06,373 --> 00:03:08,213
You'll be fine with me around.

41
00:03:10,452 --> 00:03:11,293
Young Master, look.

42
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:12,773
Yun'er smiles

43
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,532
exactly like you.

44
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:22,452
I think

45
00:03:23,692 --> 00:03:25,092
he looks more like you.

46
00:03:28,332 --> 00:03:29,332
Thank you for your compliment.

47
00:03:30,573 --> 00:03:32,252
Young Master, hurry back.

48
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,770
An assassin has been nabbed
at Lianwei House.

49
00:03:37,172 --> 00:03:37,812
Young Master.

50
00:03:39,532 --> 00:03:40,293
An assassin?

51
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,170
Why would there be an assassin
at Lianwei House?

52
00:03:42,293 --> 00:03:44,373
Luo Qinglian must have

53
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:46,252
offended someone outside.

54
00:03:49,853 --> 00:03:51,213
She helped me to deliver the child.

55
00:03:52,653 --> 00:03:53,773
Then she encountered an assassin.

56
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:57,150
That's too much a coincidence.

57
00:03:57,293 --> 00:03:57,532
Girl.

58
00:03:57,532 --> 00:03:58,092
Young Master.

59
00:03:58,092 --> 00:03:58,773
Are you okay?

60
00:03:59,092 --> 00:03:59,573
I'm okay.

61
00:04:01,213 --> 00:04:01,853
Good.

62
00:04:02,853 --> 00:04:03,560
This is good enough.

63
00:04:09,532 --> 00:04:10,413
Remove his mask.

64
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,172
It's a woman.

65
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:22,292
It's her.

66
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:25,693
Do you know her?

67
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:27,213
Young Master.

68
00:04:27,693 --> 00:04:29,053
I went out with Miss Lian in the evening.

69
00:04:29,973 --> 00:04:31,530
We found someone following us
along the way.

70
00:04:31,973 --> 00:04:33,213
She was a woman.

71
00:04:33,452 --> 00:04:34,570
I thought it's just a coincidence.

72
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:36,213
I didn't know she was up to no good

73
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,773
and would follow us all the way here.

74
00:04:38,332 --> 00:04:40,412
She did it on purpose then.

75
00:04:41,373 --> 00:04:42,292
Who sent you here?

76
00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:44,332
No one.

77
00:04:45,172 --> 00:04:46,332
I act on behalf of heaven.

78
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,530
I want to kill this vicious
and promiscuous woman!

79
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:49,933
Guards.

80
00:04:50,813 --> 00:04:51,933
Cut off one of her legs.

81
00:04:52,653 --> 00:04:53,373
Hold on, Young Master.

82
00:04:56,012 --> 00:04:57,773
I would like to hear

83
00:04:58,253 --> 00:04:59,172
what she has to say.

84
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,132
I don't need your sanctimony.

85
00:05:01,973 --> 00:05:03,253
I've failed to kill you.

86
00:05:03,813 --> 00:05:05,150
Even if I become a ghost in the future,

87
00:05:05,452 --> 00:05:06,892
I want to claim your life

88
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:07,670
with my elder brother!

89
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:09,653
Your elder brother?

90
00:05:10,493 --> 00:05:11,452
Who's your elder brother?

91
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:13,493
Young Master.

92
00:05:13,852 --> 00:05:15,332
There could be a misunderstanding.

93
00:05:19,773 --> 00:05:20,253
Say.

94
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:21,653
Who are you?

95
00:05:22,292 --> 00:05:23,533
Why did you try to assassinate her?

96
00:05:24,612 --> 00:05:25,693
(You're looking)

97
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:27,493
(for this kind of scent
throughout the city.)

98
00:05:28,693 --> 00:05:29,572
Is this the one?

99
00:05:32,093 --> 00:05:32,973
Where did we meet?

100
00:05:33,493 --> 00:05:34,892
The road to hell.

101
00:05:41,493 --> 00:05:42,213
Who are you?

102
00:05:43,653 --> 00:05:44,732
Why do you want to kill me?

103
00:05:48,572 --> 00:05:50,093
I'm actually not the one
you're looking for.

104
00:05:50,973 --> 00:05:52,253
Just like you're finding ways

105
00:05:52,253 --> 00:05:53,493
to find this person,

106
00:06:00,213 --> 00:06:01,053
I wear this perfume

107
00:06:02,213 --> 00:06:03,572
to lure you out.

108
00:06:04,253 --> 00:06:05,172
You aren't that person?

109
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:07,132
You could've died

110
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:08,732
if I were the person.

111
00:06:13,813 --> 00:06:14,533
Don't worry.

112
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:16,813
Tell us everything.

113
00:06:18,093 --> 00:06:18,813
I promise

114
00:06:19,093 --> 00:06:20,533
you'll get what you want.

115
00:06:26,132 --> 00:06:27,132
I'm Zhao Qingyun.

116
00:06:27,773 --> 00:06:28,653
My parents died early.

117
00:06:29,852 --> 00:06:30,973
My brother, Zhao Qingze,

118
00:06:31,332 --> 00:06:32,493
brought me up.

119
00:06:33,612 --> 00:06:34,213
We

120
00:06:34,732 --> 00:06:36,053
made a living by farming

121
00:06:36,053 --> 00:06:36,773
a few acres of land.

122
00:06:37,172 --> 00:06:38,292
I'm a girl,

123
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,130
but I like martial arts
since I was little.

124
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:41,373
I was unlike my brother.

125
00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:45,132
He was knowledgeable and talented.

126
00:06:45,612 --> 00:06:46,973
When my brother had time,

127
00:06:47,852 --> 00:06:48,892
he studied poetry,

128
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:50,892
classic text and history with his peers.

129
00:06:52,053 --> 00:06:53,973
He used to come home before dark

130
00:06:54,732 --> 00:06:56,132
until one day half a year ago.

131
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:58,412
I made dinner.

132
00:06:58,852 --> 00:06:59,732
The sky was dark.

133
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:01,572
He had yet to come back.

134
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:03,933
I was worried.

135
00:07:04,732 --> 00:07:05,892
It was until 1 AM.

136
00:07:06,773 --> 00:07:08,373
(I suddenly heard someone
knocking on the door.)

137
00:07:09,132 --> 00:07:09,813
Who is it?

138
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:17,412
Qingze.

139
00:07:18,332 --> 00:07:19,253
Is it you?

140
00:07:22,373 --> 00:07:22,852
Qingze.

141
00:07:24,053 --> 00:07:24,732
Qingze!

142
00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:26,213
Qingze!

143
00:07:26,773 --> 00:07:27,892
What happened to you?

144
00:07:32,012 --> 00:07:32,572
Qingze!

145
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:35,452
Qingze!

146
00:07:36,292 --> 00:07:36,813
Qingze!

147
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:38,253
What happened to you?

148
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:39,973
What happened?

149
00:07:40,612 --> 00:07:41,292
Qingze!

150
00:07:42,813 --> 00:07:44,292
I wanted to stop his bleeding,

151
00:07:46,012 --> 00:07:47,373
but there was too much of blood.

152
00:07:47,813 --> 00:07:49,533
I couldn't stop it at all.

153
00:07:50,373 --> 00:07:54,253
I couldn't help but watch his face

154
00:07:54,852 --> 00:07:58,732
becoming pale gradually.

155
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:05,973
Madam.

156
00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:13,012
Get up.

157
00:08:24,892 --> 00:08:25,732
My brother used

158
00:08:25,732 --> 00:08:26,813
his remaining strength

159
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:28,892
to tell me

160
00:08:29,572 --> 00:08:31,292
what happened that night.

161
00:08:35,653 --> 00:08:36,373
What did he say?

162
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:38,573
My brother said...

163
00:08:39,373 --> 00:08:40,612
On my way back,

164
00:08:41,532 --> 00:08:43,013
I passed by an alley.

165
00:08:44,412 --> 00:08:44,893
Then,

166
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:47,292
someone knocked me out.

167
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:49,070
(They bagged him in a sack)

168
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,852
(and brought him to an unknown place.)

169
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:52,813
(He could see nothing.)

170
00:08:53,852 --> 00:08:54,693
(All he knew)

171
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:56,532
(was a nice scent around.)

172
00:08:57,972 --> 00:08:59,852
(A shameless girl)

173
00:09:00,412 --> 00:09:01,612
(kept seducing him.)

174
00:09:02,732 --> 00:09:04,292
(He lost control.)

175
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:09,970
What happened next?

176
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,532
He thought that was the end of it.

177
00:09:15,652 --> 00:09:17,453
Who would know the people were crazy?

178
00:09:17,813 --> 00:09:19,013
They wanted to kill him.

179
00:09:20,013 --> 00:09:21,732
My brother was only a scholar.

180
00:09:22,013 --> 00:09:23,933
He was no match for these people.

181
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:25,693
Fortunately, he was smart.

182
00:09:26,253 --> 00:09:27,693
He feigned death to fool them.

183
00:09:28,053 --> 00:09:29,133
He ran home

184
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:30,532
only after they left.

185
00:09:30,972 --> 00:09:33,092
However, he was severely wounded.

186
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,870
After saying all that with
his remaining strength...

187
00:09:39,053 --> 00:09:39,972
My brother died!

188
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,573
My only family in the world

189
00:09:43,893 --> 00:09:45,893
won't wake up anymore.

190
00:09:48,612 --> 00:09:51,652
How is it related to your assassination?

191
00:09:53,532 --> 00:09:54,253
It's her.

192
00:09:55,772 --> 00:09:56,532
She was the murderer

193
00:09:56,532 --> 00:09:58,373
who seduced my brother!

194
00:09:58,652 --> 00:09:59,493
Nonsense!

195
00:10:00,412 --> 00:10:02,292
Even your brother didn't see
the girl's face.

196
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:03,493
How can you identify her?

197
00:10:03,493 --> 00:10:04,253
I can.

198
00:10:05,212 --> 00:10:06,573
My brother stayed with her till midnight.

199
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:07,693
They're intimate.

200
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:09,893
Her scent was naturally left on his body.

201
00:10:10,092 --> 00:10:11,453
I've kept the scent in mind.

202
00:10:11,732 --> 00:10:12,732
I swear I must find her

203
00:10:12,732 --> 00:10:13,612
to avenge my brother.

204
00:10:14,253 --> 00:10:15,172
Over half a year,

205
00:10:16,092 --> 00:10:18,373
I searched every perfume shop in Quliang,

206
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:20,732
but I couldn't find it,

207
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:22,133
until today,

208
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:24,652
when I smelled the scent
on her from afar.

209
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,813
I won't forget the scent until I die!

210
00:10:32,253 --> 00:10:32,852
Young Master.

211
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,333
I swear that is not true.

212
00:10:36,412 --> 00:10:37,053
Young Master.

213
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,453
I've been following Miss Lian every day.

214
00:10:38,532 --> 00:10:40,253
I can guarantee she didn't do that.

215
00:10:40,732 --> 00:10:41,612
May the lightning strike me

216
00:10:41,732 --> 00:10:42,652
if I ever lie about this.

217
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:56,933
Get up.

218
00:10:58,852 --> 00:11:00,333
Did I say I was suspecting you?

219
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:01,732
Get up, everyone.

220
00:11:05,092 --> 00:11:05,693
Young Master.

221
00:11:06,813 --> 00:11:09,013
I suppose the girl wouldn't lie

222
00:11:09,652 --> 00:11:10,693
as she cried so badly.

223
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,013
That scent

224
00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:14,573
is the only clue to her brother's death.

225
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:16,092
She won't remember it wrongly.

226
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:19,573
The perfume used in our mansion
is customised.

227
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,170
It's different from
the perfume outside.

228
00:11:21,732 --> 00:11:23,972
Even when I have a clear conscience,

229
00:11:24,732 --> 00:11:26,373
I can't give a convincing explanation.

230
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:32,453
However, the scent on you today

231
00:11:33,373 --> 00:11:34,813
is certainly different from usual.

232
00:11:36,532 --> 00:11:37,573
I almost forgot.

233
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:40,092
Qinyi perfume
that you usually used ran out.

234
00:11:40,453 --> 00:11:41,453
It's not stocked up for now.

235
00:11:41,813 --> 00:11:42,933
So I asked for another box

236
00:11:42,933 --> 00:11:43,813
of perfume from the butler

237
00:11:43,813 --> 00:11:44,493
for temporary use.

238
00:11:46,013 --> 00:11:47,292
Who is using it? What's the perfume?

239
00:11:48,532 --> 00:11:49,772
I'm not sure.

240
00:11:50,212 --> 00:11:51,732
I think it's called Bai...

241
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:53,133
Bai...

242
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:54,852
Baiyue perfume.

243
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:56,573
Yes, Baiyue perfume.

244
00:11:57,453 --> 00:11:58,732
I don't know who is using it.

245
00:11:59,133 --> 00:12:00,453
I'll go to ask the butler.

246
00:12:00,772 --> 00:12:01,292
Nevermind.

247
00:12:01,893 --> 00:12:02,373
Su Nanchun.

248
00:12:02,373 --> 00:12:03,053
Yes, Young Master.

249
00:12:03,453 --> 00:12:04,133
Inform everyone.

250
00:12:04,852 --> 00:12:07,292
Tell everyone to go to
Jingqiu Courtyard at once,

251
00:12:08,253 --> 00:12:09,612
Jingshu Pavilion in particular.

252
00:12:10,013 --> 00:12:10,693
Understood.

253
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:13,133
(You can't kill her.)

254
00:12:14,852 --> 00:12:15,253
Go back.

255
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:17,053
Pack up quickly.

256
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:17,772
Leave Quliang.

257
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:19,732
Forget everything here.

258
00:12:20,893 --> 00:12:22,133
Get back on with life.

259
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:26,373
I'm sure your brother

260
00:12:27,212 --> 00:12:28,612
would want you to do that.

261
00:12:33,573 --> 00:12:34,693
I can't deal with her,

262
00:12:36,732 --> 00:12:38,212
but I can lend you a hand.

263
00:12:39,373 --> 00:12:40,652
You came to me on purpose

264
00:12:40,772 --> 00:12:41,893
and asked so many things.

265
00:12:42,412 --> 00:12:44,172
It's definitely more than your curiosity.

266
00:12:47,013 --> 00:12:48,030
Do you really want to help me,

267
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,933
even if you have to

268
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:52,133
put your life in danger?

269
00:12:54,972 --> 00:12:57,732
If I can't avenge my brother,

270
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,212
living is no different from death.

271
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:07,893
Do you dare to go to assassinate

272
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:09,772
at Young Master Xin's mansion?

273
00:13:17,532 --> 00:13:18,292
(Nan Ruzhen.)

274
00:13:19,212 --> 00:13:20,612
(I don't mean to exterminate you,)

275
00:13:21,453 --> 00:13:23,092
(but you're unforgivable.)

276
00:13:24,013 --> 00:13:25,813
(If there is really karma,)

277
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:27,933
(I would like to see)

278
00:13:28,732 --> 00:13:30,453
(how many lifetimes of
pain you have to endure)

279
00:13:31,212 --> 00:13:33,893
(to pay for the evil
you've done in this life.)

280
00:13:46,612 --> 00:13:47,053
Madam.

281
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,390
Young Master asked everyone
to go to Jingqiu Courtyard at once.

282
00:13:51,573 --> 00:13:52,133
At once?

283
00:13:52,573 --> 00:13:53,532
Yes, at once.

284
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:55,772
It's late.

285
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,130
It must be related to the assassin
at Lianwei House.

286
00:14:02,292 --> 00:14:02,933
Where is Li Tang?

287
00:14:03,212 --> 00:14:04,412
Why hasn't he come back with news?

288
00:14:06,172 --> 00:14:06,573
Madam.

289
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:08,813
How is it?

290
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:11,813
Madam.

291
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,460
Those at Lianwei House
were very cautious.

292
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:16,053
They remained tight-lipped.

293
00:14:16,612 --> 00:14:17,852
I've spent quite some money

294
00:14:17,852 --> 00:14:19,532
to learn that the assassin is a girl.

295
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:20,670
I've also learnt of her name.

296
00:14:21,092 --> 00:14:21,813
What is her name?

297
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:24,053
Zhao Qingyun.

298
00:14:26,013 --> 00:14:27,013
Zhao Qingyun?

299
00:14:31,732 --> 00:14:32,612
Zhao Qingze.

300
00:14:35,693 --> 00:14:36,852
Is the assassin

301
00:14:38,453 --> 00:14:39,852
related to Zhao Qingze?

302
00:15:17,013 --> 00:15:18,013
I'm late.

303
00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:19,732
Please forgive me.

304
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:23,172
Rise.

305
00:15:27,612 --> 00:15:29,253
We received the news at the same time.

306
00:15:29,813 --> 00:15:31,772
Why did you come late?

307
00:15:33,172 --> 00:15:34,333
I should've arrived early,

308
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:35,852
but Yun'er was coughing

309
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,030
when I was about to leave the house.

310
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:39,693
I was worried
and stayed with him for a while.

311
00:15:42,453 --> 00:15:43,133
You also know

312
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:44,333
Yun'er was born with asthma.

313
00:15:45,013 --> 00:15:46,412
I didn't dare to take it lightly.

314
00:15:52,532 --> 00:15:54,013
I summoned everyone at this hour tonight

315
00:15:54,732 --> 00:15:55,972
because of something

316
00:15:55,972 --> 00:15:57,493
that can't be known by outsiders.

317
00:15:58,253 --> 00:15:59,092
Someone claimed

318
00:15:59,373 --> 00:16:02,133
that a little master in the mansion

319
00:16:02,772 --> 00:16:04,412
is not master's son by birth.

320
00:16:09,253 --> 00:16:10,493
His mother

321
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,133
had the child with another man.

322
00:16:14,212 --> 00:16:15,292
There is no smoke without fire.

323
00:16:17,172 --> 00:16:17,813
Zhen.

324
00:16:19,772 --> 00:16:20,972
What do you have to say?

325
00:16:24,813 --> 00:16:26,573
I don't know how this rumour started,

326
00:16:26,972 --> 00:16:27,693
but I did not

327
00:16:27,693 --> 00:16:28,652
wrong Young Master.

328
00:16:28,652 --> 00:16:29,612
Please understand that.

329
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:31,172
Since you didn't do that,

330
00:16:31,893 --> 00:16:33,532
why are you anxiously
pleading to Young Master?

331
00:16:34,972 --> 00:16:37,732
Don't you know an innocent person can
naturally prove her innocence?

332
00:16:41,493 --> 00:16:42,933
That is all you know.

333
00:16:43,852 --> 00:16:45,370
Do you know a rumour
is fiercer than a tiger?

334
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:47,412
I have a reason to be afraid.

335
00:16:54,612 --> 00:16:56,373
It's not difficult

336
00:16:56,652 --> 00:16:57,412
to tell your innocence.

337
00:16:58,092 --> 00:16:59,652
A blood test will do.

338
00:17:00,212 --> 00:17:00,772
Not bad.

339
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:03,933
It's also the only way at present.

340
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:07,493
What do you think?

341
00:17:12,892 --> 00:17:13,412
Young Master.

342
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:15,892
I know I have a low status.

343
00:17:16,372 --> 00:17:17,213
You didn't mind

344
00:17:17,213 --> 00:17:18,492
and you took me in.

345
00:17:19,132 --> 00:17:20,252
You granted me

346
00:17:20,252 --> 00:17:21,333
everything I have now.

347
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,573
I won't make a single complaint

348
00:17:22,573 --> 00:17:24,132
if you ask for everything back.

349
00:17:30,492 --> 00:17:31,853
However, Yun'er is different.

350
00:17:34,172 --> 00:17:36,613
He is your son,

351
00:17:37,652 --> 00:17:38,492
just like Shi'er

352
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:39,532
and Zhao'er.

353
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:42,573
How should he live

354
00:17:44,973 --> 00:17:46,053
when he grows up

355
00:17:46,053 --> 00:17:47,093
if you suspect him now?

356
00:18:01,853 --> 00:18:02,733
Yun'er won't know.

357
00:18:04,093 --> 00:18:04,453
Test.

358
00:18:18,772 --> 00:18:19,813
In this case,

359
00:18:21,532 --> 00:18:23,892
Qimei, fetch a bowl of water.

360
00:18:24,172 --> 00:18:24,652
Noted.

361
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:25,292
Wait.

362
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:27,853
I'm afraid

363
00:18:27,853 --> 00:18:30,733
everyone can fetch the water except you.

364
00:18:33,853 --> 00:18:34,933
What do you mean?

365
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:36,252
If potash alum

366
00:18:36,252 --> 00:18:37,613
is added in the water,

367
00:18:38,213 --> 00:18:39,532
the blood of two people can blend

368
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,960
even if they aren't related by blood.

369
00:18:42,213 --> 00:18:43,652
Since you're innocent,

370
00:18:44,252 --> 00:18:45,733
you shouldn't be doing this

371
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:46,733
to arouse suspicion.

372
00:18:55,613 --> 00:18:56,652
Thank you for reminding me.

373
00:19:00,693 --> 00:19:01,813
Bring Yun'er.

374
00:19:02,372 --> 00:19:02,892
Noted.

375
00:19:19,213 --> 00:19:19,693
Qimei.

376
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,333
All our lives

377
00:19:23,053 --> 00:19:23,933
depend on it.

378
00:19:27,772 --> 00:19:28,372
Don't worry.

379
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,412
Don't worry, Ms. Zhen.

380
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:55,492
The needle won't hurt.

381
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,670
It won't hurt
because it's not you who gets pricked.

382
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,492
Yun'er has been ill

383
00:20:08,213 --> 00:20:09,172
since childbirth.

384
00:20:12,172 --> 00:20:13,652
After a few days of peace,

385
00:20:15,693 --> 00:20:16,853
people get suspicious of him.

386
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,412
They want to prick him.

387
00:20:24,093 --> 00:20:25,333
My poor child.

388
00:20:26,573 --> 00:20:27,813
You're a little master

389
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:30,372
just like others.

390
00:20:32,573 --> 00:20:34,292
Why is your life so miserable?

391
00:20:39,532 --> 00:20:41,012
I'm also like you.

392
00:20:41,213 --> 00:20:41,973
As a first-time mother,

393
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:43,453
I also would rather

394
00:20:43,453 --> 00:20:45,532
suffer a lot of pain myself

395
00:20:45,973 --> 00:20:47,933
than hurting my child,

396
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,652
but have you thought about this?

397
00:20:50,213 --> 00:20:51,532
If you don't pass the test,

398
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:54,372
even after Yun'er becomes an adult,

399
00:20:54,532 --> 00:20:56,012
he'll have to face the rumour forever

400
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,853
and be unable to lift his head high.

401
00:20:58,892 --> 00:21:00,172
Would you want that?

402
00:21:02,213 --> 00:21:03,132
Give me the child.

403
00:21:03,652 --> 00:21:04,733
As long as he is Young Master's

404
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:05,733
biological son,

405
00:21:06,973 --> 00:21:09,292
you and him will face no doubt

406
00:21:09,693 --> 00:21:11,132
and live with dignity from then onwards.

407
00:21:12,053 --> 00:21:13,252
No one

408
00:21:13,613 --> 00:21:14,693
in and out the mansion

409
00:21:15,132 --> 00:21:16,613
can talk about you.

410
00:21:33,613 --> 00:21:33,892
Come on.

411
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:34,372
Good Yun'er.

412
00:21:34,372 --> 00:21:35,252
Don't cry.

413
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:36,853
Good Yun'er.

414
00:21:37,093 --> 00:21:37,813
Don't cry.

415
00:21:39,012 --> 00:21:39,813
Don't cry.

416
00:21:39,813 --> 00:21:40,933
Don't cry, Yun'er.

417
00:21:41,772 --> 00:21:43,733
Good Yun'er, don't cry.

418
00:21:43,813 --> 00:21:44,372
Yun'er.

419
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:45,573
Don't cry.

420
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:46,573
Don't cry.

421
00:21:46,933 --> 00:21:48,093
Yun'er.

422
00:21:50,372 --> 00:21:50,853
Yun'er.

423
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:52,813
Yun'er.

424
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:53,853
Yun'er.

425
00:21:55,252 --> 00:21:55,813
Yun'er.

426
00:21:56,813 --> 00:21:57,292
Yun'er.

427
00:21:57,772 --> 00:21:58,770
Yun'er, what's wrong with you?

428
00:22:00,372 --> 00:22:00,892
Yun'er!

429
00:22:01,532 --> 00:22:02,053
Yun'er!

430
00:22:04,213 --> 00:22:05,172
Yun'er, what is happening?

431
00:22:05,652 --> 00:22:06,292
Asthma.

432
00:22:06,733 --> 00:22:07,693
Qimei, where is the sachet?

433
00:22:07,892 --> 00:22:08,933
It's with him.

434
00:22:11,892 --> 00:22:12,532
Call the physician.

435
00:22:13,412 --> 00:22:15,412
Yun'er, what's wrong with you?
Don't scare me.

436
00:22:17,573 --> 00:22:19,292
Don't scare me!

437
00:22:20,652 --> 00:22:21,252
Yun'er.

438
00:22:22,813 --> 00:22:23,613
I'm here.

439
00:22:30,733 --> 00:22:31,252
Yun'er.

440
00:22:39,853 --> 00:22:40,532
Yun'er.

441
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:43,053
Yun'er.

442
00:22:51,053 --> 00:22:51,652
Ruzhen.

443
00:22:54,412 --> 00:22:55,213
Yun'er...

444
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,333
Yun'er is dead.

445
00:23:21,772 --> 00:23:23,933
No! Yun'er.

446
00:23:25,213 --> 00:23:26,532
Yun'er!

447
00:23:27,892 --> 00:23:30,132
No.

448
00:23:32,813 --> 00:23:34,573
No, Yun'er!

449
00:23:36,532 --> 00:23:38,412
God!

450
00:23:38,772 --> 00:23:40,492
Open your eyes and see.

451
00:23:42,132 --> 00:23:43,892
He was only a few days old.

452
00:23:44,492 --> 00:23:45,412
How could you

453
00:23:45,412 --> 00:23:47,532
take him away?

454
00:23:48,733 --> 00:23:50,813
Why?

455
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,093
Yun'er!

456
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:57,813
Yun'er.

457
00:23:59,093 --> 00:24:01,172
Young Master.

458
00:24:01,813 --> 00:24:03,853
Young Master, I didn't lie to you.

459
00:24:04,213 --> 00:24:05,853
Yun'er is really your child.

460
00:24:05,853 --> 00:24:06,892
Look at him.

461
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:08,733
I didn't sleep with another man.

462
00:24:08,973 --> 00:24:09,733
I did not

463
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:11,412
let you down.

464
00:24:11,892 --> 00:24:13,892
I didn't sleep with another man.

465
00:24:16,093 --> 00:24:16,693
Ruzhen.

466
00:24:18,412 --> 00:24:19,132
Stay strong.

467
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:21,973
Yun'er is dead.

468
00:24:22,292 --> 00:24:23,213
No.

469
00:24:24,292 --> 00:24:25,172
No.

470
00:24:26,252 --> 00:24:27,412
Yun'er.

471
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:29,613
Yun'er.

472
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:31,492
Yun'er.

473
00:24:36,252 --> 00:24:36,853
It's you.

474
00:24:39,973 --> 00:24:40,772
It's you!

475
00:24:41,492 --> 00:24:41,933
Madam Lian.

476
00:24:41,933 --> 00:24:43,492
Yun'er's illness started
after you held him.

477
00:24:43,492 --> 00:24:44,853
What did you do to him?

478
00:24:44,973 --> 00:24:45,453
Let go!

479
00:24:45,453 --> 00:24:46,292
Luo Qinglian!

480
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:47,813
What did you do?

481
00:24:48,132 --> 00:24:49,252
I didn't mean to cause

482
00:24:49,252 --> 00:24:50,213
your miscarriage back then.

483
00:24:50,772 --> 00:24:51,333
I'd been praying

484
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:52,933
for him all these years.

485
00:24:53,252 --> 00:24:54,652
I didn't expect you to hold a grudge.

486
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,492
You wanted Yun'er dead.

487
00:24:56,492 --> 00:24:58,412
- You're so cruel!
- Miss.

488
00:24:59,252 --> 00:25:00,772
No!

489
00:25:02,573 --> 00:25:03,813
Yun'er!

490
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:09,772
Young Master, I didn't.

491
00:25:11,733 --> 00:25:12,613
Everything is over.

492
00:25:12,693 --> 00:25:13,453
No.

493
00:25:13,453 --> 00:25:14,613
Let Yun'er rest in peace.

494
00:25:14,853 --> 00:25:15,853
No. Young Master.

495
00:25:15,853 --> 00:25:16,492
Qimei!

496
00:25:18,012 --> 00:25:19,453
Take Little Master away.

497
00:25:19,453 --> 00:25:20,012
No!

498
00:25:20,093 --> 00:25:21,132
Bury him well.

499
00:25:21,532 --> 00:25:23,333
No, Young Master.

500
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:25,532
Take Little Master away!

501
00:25:26,172 --> 00:25:26,892
Miss.

502
00:25:31,693 --> 00:25:32,372
Miss.

503
00:25:37,172 --> 00:25:37,892
Yun'er.

504
00:25:39,012 --> 00:25:39,613
Young Master.

505
00:25:41,213 --> 00:25:42,693
The blood test...

506
00:25:47,933 --> 00:25:48,693
Yun'er.

507
00:25:50,613 --> 00:25:51,973
Yun'er is dead.

508
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:54,892
A blood test is no longer required.

509
00:26:08,892 --> 00:26:09,492
Young Master!

510
00:26:15,012 --> 00:26:16,813
Young Master, I have something to say.

511
00:26:25,772 --> 00:26:26,333
Li Tang.

512
00:26:27,372 --> 00:26:28,252
What do you want to say?

513
00:26:30,053 --> 00:26:30,573
Young Master.

514
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:32,892
I'm serving

515
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:33,892
Ms. Zhen right now.

516
00:26:34,532 --> 00:26:35,733
I should serve her with loyalty

517
00:26:35,973 --> 00:26:37,292
and never judge her,

518
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:38,532
but I really can't

519
00:26:39,172 --> 00:26:39,933
turn a blind eye

520
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:41,132
to this matter.

521
00:26:41,853 --> 00:26:43,453
Even if I'll be called disloyal
and unrighteous

522
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,870
and be condemned for
betraying my master,

523
00:26:46,213 --> 00:26:47,613
I have to tell the truth.

524
00:26:51,772 --> 00:26:53,573
Say what it is.

525
00:26:56,652 --> 00:26:57,652
Ms. Zhen knew it well.

526
00:26:58,093 --> 00:26:59,132
The most effective way

527
00:26:59,892 --> 00:27:00,733
to make a comeback

528
00:27:00,733 --> 00:27:01,933
was to conceive your child.

529
00:27:02,813 --> 00:27:03,733
When the day was getting far

530
00:27:03,733 --> 00:27:04,970
from the last time she slept with you,

531
00:27:05,453 --> 00:27:06,532
she took risk out of desperation

532
00:27:06,813 --> 00:27:08,053
and found a handsome

533
00:27:08,573 --> 00:27:09,853
and scholarly man.

534
00:27:10,733 --> 00:27:12,470
Ms. Zhen has another residence
out of the mansion.

535
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:13,660
What are you babbling about?

536
00:27:13,973 --> 00:27:14,733
Are you

537
00:27:15,132 --> 00:27:16,412
accusing me because I reprimanded you

538
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:18,292
earlier on?

539
00:27:19,372 --> 00:27:20,733
What I'm saying is the truth

540
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:22,613
disclosed by Qimei

541
00:27:22,652 --> 00:27:23,412
when she was drunk.

542
00:27:24,053 --> 00:27:25,412
She hired some guards to watch the door.

543
00:27:26,613 --> 00:27:28,053
She lured the man to her residence.

544
00:27:28,652 --> 00:27:30,213
She lit some incense in the room.

545
00:27:30,412 --> 00:27:31,372
All he knew

546
00:27:31,613 --> 00:27:33,132
was a nice scent around.

547
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:34,973
(The man didn't know)

548
00:27:34,973 --> 00:27:35,652
(he was intoxicated.)

549
00:27:36,693 --> 00:27:38,453
He slept with Ms. Zhen.

550
00:27:39,372 --> 00:27:40,292
To keep it a secret,

551
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:42,292
Ms. Zhen got an intention to kill him.

552
00:27:42,693 --> 00:27:44,172
(He thought that was the end of it.)

553
00:27:45,132 --> 00:27:46,973
Who would know the people were crazy?

554
00:27:47,252 --> 00:27:48,613
They wanted to kill him.

555
00:27:50,213 --> 00:27:51,573
He was Zhao Qingze.

556
00:27:52,772 --> 00:27:53,892
After killing Zhao Qingze,

557
00:27:55,372 --> 00:27:56,532
Ms. Zhen got pregnant successfully

558
00:27:57,772 --> 00:27:59,333
and gave birth to Little Master Yun'er.

559
00:28:00,172 --> 00:28:01,973
She thought that was over.

560
00:28:03,172 --> 00:28:04,453
Unexpectedly, you wanted

561
00:28:04,453 --> 00:28:05,292
a blood test today.

562
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:12,492
Get up, Li Tang.

563
00:28:14,453 --> 00:28:14,933
Noted.

564
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:20,573
Good.

565
00:28:22,973 --> 00:28:23,532
No.

566
00:28:24,252 --> 00:28:25,333
This isn't true, Young Master.

567
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:26,853
No.

568
00:28:26,853 --> 00:28:27,813
Don't touch me!

569
00:28:28,892 --> 00:28:29,693
Good.

570
00:28:30,372 --> 00:28:31,132
Wonderful.

571
00:28:32,772 --> 00:28:33,733
- Young Master.
- You...

572
00:28:34,292 --> 00:28:35,733
Don't listen to his nonsense.

573
00:28:36,012 --> 00:28:37,532
He is framing me on purpose.

574
00:28:38,892 --> 00:28:41,333
I couldn't even kill an ant.

575
00:28:43,252 --> 00:28:44,412
You couldn't even

576
00:28:44,412 --> 00:28:45,652
kill an ant.

577
00:28:46,492 --> 00:28:48,012
It sounds really familiar.

578
00:28:50,652 --> 00:28:51,772
What do you want to argue about?

579
00:29:02,892 --> 00:29:03,412
Young Master.

580
00:29:07,892 --> 00:29:09,813
Even if everything is fake about me,

581
00:29:10,573 --> 00:29:12,213
my feelings for you

582
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:14,613
are real.

583
00:29:16,292 --> 00:29:18,012
All you know is I'm evil.

584
00:29:19,652 --> 00:29:20,733
Do you know

585
00:29:20,733 --> 00:29:22,372
why I'm evil?

586
00:29:25,892 --> 00:29:27,892
I have nothing else in my mind.

587
00:29:28,853 --> 00:29:30,093
I just want to stay

588
00:29:30,093 --> 00:29:31,693
beside you whole-heartedly.

589
00:29:32,053 --> 00:29:34,813
I really can't lose you.

590
00:29:39,813 --> 00:29:41,053
I only meant

591
00:29:41,053 --> 00:29:42,292
to tell one lie,

592
00:29:43,933 --> 00:29:47,532
but lost control after that.

593
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:50,333
Step by step,

594
00:29:50,892 --> 00:29:51,933
I was forced

595
00:29:51,933 --> 00:29:53,053
to take on a road of no return.

596
00:29:53,613 --> 00:29:56,292
I have no choice, Young Master.

597
00:30:07,213 --> 00:30:07,973
Young Master.

598
00:30:08,853 --> 00:30:09,652
The sage says

599
00:30:10,813 --> 00:30:12,453
a fault confessed is half redressed.

600
00:30:14,252 --> 00:30:15,132
Are you not going

601
00:30:15,132 --> 00:30:16,412
to give me a chance

602
00:30:16,412 --> 00:30:17,613
to mend my ways?

603
00:30:18,132 --> 00:30:19,333
You claim

604
00:30:19,613 --> 00:30:21,813
to have committed
the most heinous of crimes

605
00:30:21,813 --> 00:30:23,292
for Young Master.

606
00:30:24,292 --> 00:30:24,973
In other words,

607
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,772
you're hoping for Young Master

608
00:30:27,012 --> 00:30:28,453
to take the blame for you.

609
00:30:29,132 --> 00:30:29,772
How

610
00:30:30,292 --> 00:30:31,933
could you say you loved him?

611
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,012
How

612
00:30:33,453 --> 00:30:35,532
could you say you repented?

613
00:30:35,613 --> 00:30:36,733
Madam Lian is right.

614
00:30:37,772 --> 00:30:39,292
You have no remorse at all.

615
00:30:39,733 --> 00:30:40,853
You're just speaking

616
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,613
against your heart to survive,

617
00:30:43,252 --> 00:30:44,470
so don't believe her, Young Master.

618
00:30:45,813 --> 00:30:48,053
Even if you truly repent,

619
00:30:48,772 --> 00:30:50,532
even a tiger would not eat its cubs.

620
00:30:51,093 --> 00:30:52,252
If Young Master

621
00:30:52,252 --> 00:30:53,213
let it slide today,

622
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:55,012
who would believe

623
00:30:55,012 --> 00:30:56,292
you won't make another mistake?

624
00:30:58,693 --> 00:30:59,853
Li Tang has just worked

625
00:31:00,132 --> 00:31:01,613
at Jingshu Pavilion for a short period,

626
00:31:02,573 --> 00:31:03,573
yet he knows so much evil

627
00:31:03,573 --> 00:31:04,772
Nan Ruzhen has done.

628
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:06,412
What about the old days?

629
00:31:07,892 --> 00:31:09,252
Interrogate Qimei.

630
00:31:10,573 --> 00:31:11,132
I'm afraid

631
00:31:11,492 --> 00:31:12,853
there are more

632
00:31:13,853 --> 00:31:14,693
shocking things.

633
00:31:48,892 --> 00:31:49,933
I confess!

634
00:31:50,693 --> 00:31:52,613
I confess to everything!

635
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,213
Madam Zhen forced me to do it.

636
00:32:07,573 --> 00:32:08,012
Young Master.

637
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:08,892
At this moment,

638
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:10,053
Young Master.

639
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,693
I really want to cut your heart open

640
00:32:12,693 --> 00:32:14,652
and see what colour it is.

641
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:21,892
Guards!

642
00:32:24,372 --> 00:32:26,372
Take this vicious woman out.

643
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,492
Flog her to death.

644
00:32:27,492 --> 00:32:28,012
Young Master.

645
00:32:29,733 --> 00:32:30,693
Please

646
00:32:31,573 --> 00:32:34,053
spare Nan Ruzhen's life.

647
00:32:37,652 --> 00:32:38,532
What did you say?

648
00:32:39,892 --> 00:32:40,573
She is unforgivable

649
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,453
for her sins,

650
00:32:43,053 --> 00:32:43,853
but she has been

651
00:32:45,652 --> 00:32:47,292
with you for so many years after all.

652
00:32:48,292 --> 00:32:50,132
If you personally
order the guard to kill her,

653
00:32:50,813 --> 00:32:52,573
the prince will think

654
00:32:53,213 --> 00:32:54,053
you're heartless

655
00:32:54,053 --> 00:32:55,333
when this gets to his ears.

656
00:32:56,213 --> 00:32:57,132
I think

657
00:32:57,733 --> 00:32:58,813
you can just spare her life

658
00:32:59,532 --> 00:33:01,132
and throw her out of the mansion.

659
00:33:19,853 --> 00:33:20,412
All right.

660
00:33:22,012 --> 00:33:22,573
Fine.

661
00:33:23,693 --> 00:33:24,892
Do as Madam Lian says.

662
00:33:25,613 --> 00:33:27,172
Demote Nan Ruzhen to a commoner

663
00:33:27,892 --> 00:33:29,252
and throw her out of
the mansion at once.

664
00:33:44,280 --> 00:34:01,740
(Lord Rui's Mansion)

665
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:07,973
Come on.

666
00:34:08,492 --> 00:34:09,532
What are you waiting for?

667
00:34:10,172 --> 00:34:11,892
Do you still think
you're a side consort?

668
00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:57,653
Why have you suddenly
turned soft-hearted?

669
00:34:58,333 --> 00:34:59,692
Nan Ruzhen is greedy and cruel.

670
00:35:00,012 --> 00:35:00,613
It may not be

671
00:35:00,613 --> 00:35:01,813
a wise move to set her free.

672
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:05,492
Even if you sacrificed the best chance

673
00:35:05,932 --> 00:35:06,532
to take revenge

674
00:35:06,532 --> 00:35:07,692
for Young Master's compliment,

675
00:35:08,653 --> 00:35:09,972
it's too much a price to pay.

676
00:35:21,613 --> 00:35:22,772
She has lost her child

677
00:35:23,573 --> 00:35:24,653
and status.

678
00:35:25,772 --> 00:35:27,732
She has lost everything she had.

679
00:35:29,012 --> 00:35:29,772
I only hope

680
00:35:30,893 --> 00:35:33,093
Nan Ruzhen would repent since then.

681
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:49,613
Young Master.

682
00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:52,252
Calm down.

683
00:36:03,212 --> 00:36:04,532
How can I calm down?

684
00:36:06,492 --> 00:36:07,772
Nan Ruzhen has always been

685
00:36:07,772 --> 00:36:08,613
procrastinating

686
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,653
and she has given birth to a son.

687
00:36:11,532 --> 00:36:12,492
She'll be

688
00:36:12,492 --> 00:36:13,813
less loyal to us.

689
00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:15,972
If anyone discovers

690
00:36:16,573 --> 00:36:17,732
the thing in the box,

691
00:36:17,732 --> 00:36:18,252
we...

692
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:22,813
Don't worry.

693
00:36:24,212 --> 00:36:25,692
Nan Ruzhen is snobbish,

694
00:36:26,012 --> 00:36:27,133
but she isn't stupid.

695
00:36:28,373 --> 00:36:30,053
To beat Luo Qinglian,

696
00:36:30,452 --> 00:36:32,212
she needs our help.

697
00:36:32,972 --> 00:36:34,492
That's also why she has
been procrastinating

698
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:35,853
without saying no.

699
00:36:36,692 --> 00:36:37,532
Wait patiently.

700
00:36:37,893 --> 00:36:39,292
She'll come round.

701
00:36:45,133 --> 00:36:46,452
Madam, Nan Ruzhen...

702
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,173
She has got it?

703
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,100
She was thrown out of
Young Master Xin's Mansion.

704
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,292
Slow down. Don't choke.

705
00:37:46,532 --> 00:37:47,292
Madam.

706
00:37:55,012 --> 00:37:55,772
Madam.

707
00:37:56,373 --> 00:37:57,053
I knew it.

708
00:37:57,053 --> 00:37:58,492
You wouldn't abandon me.

709
00:38:00,012 --> 00:38:00,772
I just knew it.

710
00:38:00,772 --> 00:38:03,373
You wouldn't abandon me, Madam.

711
00:38:05,932 --> 00:38:07,012
Madam.

712
00:38:09,292 --> 00:38:10,653
You served me after all.

713
00:38:11,212 --> 00:38:13,292
You wouldn't have ended up like this,

714
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,012
if I didn't send you
to Young Master Xin's Mansion.

715
00:38:18,732 --> 00:38:19,252
Madam.

716
00:38:20,373 --> 00:38:21,452
Take me back.

717
00:38:21,893 --> 00:38:24,813
I'll serve you for life.

718
00:38:25,653 --> 00:38:26,292
Yes.

719
00:38:27,893 --> 00:38:29,573
You've done so many things for me.

720
00:38:31,053 --> 00:38:32,252
I should treat you well.

721
00:38:34,133 --> 00:38:35,093
Thank you, Madam.

722
00:38:35,972 --> 00:38:37,373
Thank you, Madam.

723
00:38:39,173 --> 00:38:40,532
Have you got the liquor box?

724
00:38:42,932 --> 00:38:43,732
Liquor box?

725
00:38:46,853 --> 00:38:49,292
Luo Qinglian still has it.

726
00:38:52,452 --> 00:38:53,653
It's not in your hands?

727
00:38:59,813 --> 00:39:01,853
How can I take you back then?

728
00:39:04,613 --> 00:39:05,212
Madam.

729
00:39:05,893 --> 00:39:06,732
It's fine.

730
00:39:07,093 --> 00:39:08,133
No one knows Luo Qinglian

731
00:39:08,133 --> 00:39:09,093
better than me.

732
00:39:09,573 --> 00:39:10,893
With my advice,

733
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:13,053
you'll be able to tear
that lowly servant to shreds.

734
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:18,772
Madam.

735
00:39:19,492 --> 00:39:20,212
Although...

736
00:39:20,532 --> 00:39:22,173
Although Luo Qinglian has the liquor box,

737
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:24,613
I saw the map.

738
00:39:25,173 --> 00:39:26,452
I can draw it for you.

739
00:39:31,173 --> 00:39:32,413
You saw the map?

740
00:39:33,532 --> 00:39:34,133
Yes.

741
00:39:38,813 --> 00:39:39,373
Good.

742
00:39:40,492 --> 00:39:41,893
Eat up first. I'll take you back.

743
00:39:43,613 --> 00:39:44,093
All right.

744
00:39:44,813 --> 00:39:45,292
Eat.

745
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:46,813
Eat.

746
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:55,613
Madam.

747
00:39:56,333 --> 00:39:56,813
Madam.

748
00:40:11,373 --> 00:40:12,173
Madam!

749
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:14,053
Madam!

750
00:40:28,252 --> 00:40:29,532
Zhiyue, Ranyun.

751
00:40:31,252 --> 00:40:32,292
Why did you come back?

752
00:40:33,133 --> 00:40:34,373
I came back to see Madam.

753
00:40:34,692 --> 00:40:35,692
Who is your Madam?

754
00:40:37,012 --> 00:40:38,573
Isn't your Madam

755
00:40:38,813 --> 00:40:40,053
at Jingshu Pavilion?

756
00:40:40,853 --> 00:40:42,173
I've recalled.

757
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:44,893
Your Madam has been thrown out of
Young Master Xin's Mansion

758
00:40:44,893 --> 00:40:46,093
and demoted to a commoner.

759
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:48,053
Why? Have you recalled your old friend

760
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:49,373
and you want to comeback

761
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,640
after the new one fell from power?

762
00:40:50,772 --> 00:40:51,613
No, I...
