=Episode 6=

17
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,241
I thought I had done my duty.

18
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,801
But when I'm saving you today,

19
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,601
I was worried about you all the time.

20
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,841
I knew I cared about you.

21
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:04,601
I really want to recognize you

22
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,640
as my sisiter.

23
00:02:16,881 --> 00:02:17,801
The man on that day...

24
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,480
I...

25
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:21,681
Don't say that.

26
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:23,480
There's no evidence.

27
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:25,121
I won't be the only one

28
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:26,200
who died tonight.

29
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:27,761
I don't want to get you involved.

30
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,881
I see it clearly.

31
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,521
It's Lan'er'er.

32
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,200
Luo Qinglian is dead.

33
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:03,761
You want to run away?

34
00:03:05,121 --> 00:03:06,241
Do you think you can run?

35
00:03:09,241 --> 00:03:10,360
I know I can't.

36
00:03:14,241 --> 00:03:15,280
Please beg the Heir for me.

37
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,000
Can I use this

38
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,681
in exchange for my life?

39
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,401
Hui'er'er.

40
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,761
I couldn't catch the killer.

41
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,720
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,840
Madam.

44
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,920
Miss Lian found

45
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,161
the evidence.

46
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,241
Do you know how much I hate you?

47
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:14,521
Hui'er's death was an accident.

48
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,521
If I confess,

49
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,480
I don't think Young Master Xin
wouldn't forgive me.

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,801
But what about now?

51
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,080
If the truth comes out,

52
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:24,521
I'll die for sure.

53
00:04:24,961 --> 00:04:26,401
It's all because you encouraged me.

54
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,121
You traitor.

55
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,521
Why did you do this to me?

56
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,401
Am I a traitor?

57
00:04:33,561 --> 00:04:34,441
Over the years,

58
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,080
I am loyal to you.

59
00:04:36,801 --> 00:04:38,561
And you always beat and scolded me.

60
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,160
Never put me

61
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,080
as a person.

62
00:04:41,961 --> 00:04:43,281
I Hated you for so many years.

63
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:45,480
Finally one day,

64
00:04:46,681 --> 00:04:48,200
it's your turn to hate me.

65
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:57,880
Lan'er'er.

66
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,200
You're different from Ruhua.

67
00:05:02,841 --> 00:05:04,241
I didn't bring you from my family.

68
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,760
But you've been with me for years.

69
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:11,320
This matter

70
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:13,600
can be a deal or not.

71
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,480
Tell me the truth.

72
00:05:16,281 --> 00:05:17,040
What did you

73
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,841
give to the Heir?

74
00:05:18,841 --> 00:05:20,320
What does it have to do with my husband?

75
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:22,880
Beg me.

76
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,200
Beg me and I'll tell you.

77
00:05:38,121 --> 00:05:38,681
I'll do it.

78
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:40,121
For the sake of my husband.

79
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,480
I'll beg you.

80
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,320
About Lan'er's fornication,

81
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:13,920
you knows about it too, right?

82
00:06:16,561 --> 00:06:17,401
Fornication?

83
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:19,600
She's afraid that I

84
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,961
can't find her a good husband,

85
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:23,200
So she met a man secretly,

86
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,360
and I caught her in the act.

87
00:06:26,281 --> 00:06:27,480
I hit her a couple of times.

88
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,441
She got angry.

89
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:31,320
and killed herself.

90
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:53,961
Take Yi to Li's Village first.

91
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:54,640
I'll lure them away.

92
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,760
Miss.

93
00:07:09,841 --> 00:07:10,480
Your Highness.

94
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:26,121
He Lianxin is not an idle man.

95
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:27,121
The secret room is hidden

96
00:07:27,121 --> 00:07:28,200
a large number
of incriminating evidence of the heir.

97
00:07:39,841 --> 00:07:40,841
This jade cabbage

98
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:42,200
is for the purpose of withholding the gift.

99
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,040
And evidences of taking bribes

100
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,320
blackmailing and flogging officials,

101
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,360
keeping mistress

102
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:49,920
Your Highness.

103
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,480
Your Highness.

104
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,320
Shut up.

105
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:07,320
If these things are sent to Father,

106
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,600
can I still be his heir?

107
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:11,200
Lianxin, oh, my good brother.

108
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:17,841
You want my life.

109
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,360
If these things

110
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:21,080
are sent to Father,

111
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,920
I might be done.

112
00:08:24,281 --> 00:08:25,241
I might be done.

113
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:44,960
Pardon me.

114
00:08:45,881 --> 00:08:46,801
Miss Lian led us away

115
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,480
and let Dongli and Lv Beiyi run away.

116
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:15,960
You want to die, don't you?

117
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,720
I help you.

118
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,801
The prince's order.

119
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:36,561
The prince's order.

120
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,280
The prince's order.

121
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,641
Tomorrow is
the late princess consort's deathday,

122
00:09:56,001 --> 00:09:57,400
the prince ordered the heir,

123
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,201
Young Master Xin, together with Miss Lian

124
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,441
go to worship

125
00:10:00,681 --> 00:10:01,641
to show filial piety.

126
00:10:02,121 --> 00:10:03,840
To show filial piety.

127
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,641
I will obey my father's order.

128
00:10:15,561 --> 00:10:17,761
Yes, I take the order.

129
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,040
His Highness has one more message.

130
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
to Miss Lian.

131
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,040
Miss Lian.

132
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:35,761
I'm here.

133
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:36,920
His Highness ordered you

134
00:10:37,121 --> 00:10:39,201
to stay with Young Master Xin

135
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,400
to ease the pain of losing his son.

136
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:48,201
I've memorized it.

137
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:14,520
You think you can fool me?

138
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,801
Luo Qinglian.

139
00:11:17,561 --> 00:11:18,641
I must find

140
00:11:19,121 --> 00:11:20,280
the evidence of your murder of my son.

141
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,641
I'll bring you to justice.

142
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:22,360
Don't try to escape.

143
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,801
Even if you run to the ends of the earth,

144
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:26,881
I'll bring you back.

145
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,040
Greetings.

146
00:11:47,121 --> 00:11:47,840
Greetings.

147
00:11:49,641 --> 00:11:52,441
In the past, I visited my mother alone.

148
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:54,280
I didn't realize that this year

149
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,001
there are two more people with me.

150
00:11:57,441 --> 00:11:58,001
Sister-in-law.

151
00:11:59,641 --> 00:12:01,081
It's all thanks to you.

152
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:03,561
She's just a concubine.

153
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,121
She's not worthy of you

154
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:06,801
calling her sister-in-law.

155
00:12:08,121 --> 00:12:10,121
Let's go. Are you waiting for a reward?

156
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,720
I'm leaving.

157
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:15,600
Lianxin.

158
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,641
Have you ever been

159
00:12:17,641 --> 00:12:19,121
so rude for a woman?

160
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,360
I've heard

161
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,840
that you used a first-class horse

162
00:12:23,121 --> 00:12:24,001
to finagle Miss Lian

163
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,881
from Lianzuo.

164
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,480
They're in love with each other.

165
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,241
Lianchu, do you know

166
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,720
when is a woman's best time?

167
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,241
When?

168
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:39,040
When you don't have her.

169
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:41,801
You're the one who understands women best.

170
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:47,121
Of course you're known
to be the man of leisure.

171
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:06,040
Madam, you can't go.

172
00:13:06,241 --> 00:13:06,600
Go away.

173
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,840
Lan'er has told the heir everything.

174
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
The heir won't spare him.

175
00:13:10,201 --> 00:13:11,081
I'm going to inform Lianxin.

176
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:11,881
Madam.

177
00:13:12,201 --> 00:13:13,720
Even if the Young Master Xiu is in danger,

178
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,600
but how did you know that?

179
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,321
If you deliver the information,

180
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:18,761
you would be confessing yourself.

181
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:21,520
Then I'll say

182
00:13:22,121 --> 00:13:23,681
Lan'er collaborating with the heir

183
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:24,520
and I found out that.

184
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,360
I beat her to death.

185
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,600
There will be no evidence.

186
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:27,681
What can they do to me?

187
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:30,160
No one else can do anything to you.

188
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:32,360
But what about the Madam and Miss Lian?

189
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,801
If they know

190
00:13:33,801 --> 00:13:34,881
we're involved with the heir,

191
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:36,360
they will find out what's going on.

192
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,400
When that happens,

193
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,081
how can we hide the death of Hui'er?

194
00:13:40,681 --> 00:13:41,520
Madam.

195
00:13:41,881 --> 00:13:43,480
They hate you so much.

196
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,681
They're watching you closely.

197
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:44,920
Come on.

198
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:45,840
Wait a minute.

199
00:14:46,641 --> 00:14:48,241
I'm afraid it will hurt the heir
if we ifgnite the bomb.

200
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,520
Your Highness.

201
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,561
Is this the right place?

202
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,400
Yes.

203
00:15:10,561 --> 00:15:11,480
Stop.

204
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,360
Stop. I'm a little uncomfortable.

205
00:15:14,321 --> 00:15:15,681
Your Highness.

206
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,720
What is it?

207
00:15:17,881 --> 00:15:18,600
Your Highness.

208
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,321
Miss Lian is a little nausea.

209
00:15:20,641 --> 00:15:22,121
She want to take a break.

210
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,121
What a trouble woman.

211
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:27,241
Stop.

212
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,400
Miss, have a break.

213
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:01,321
I advise you

214
00:16:02,641 --> 00:16:03,480
don't try to escape.

215
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,400
If I escaped, it is my skill.

216
00:16:06,641 --> 00:16:08,480
If you can catch me, it's your skill.

217
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,360
Besides.

218
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,280
I'm not like Mr. Noboru

219
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,081
Love of theater.

220
00:16:13,321 --> 00:16:15,001
We hate each other so much

221
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,400
but you're just pretending to be in love with me.

222
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,480
Stabbing or pretending to be in love?

223
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,801
It's not up to you to decide.

224
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:28,360
Help Miss Lian to the sedan.

225
00:16:31,641 --> 00:16:32,201
Do it.

226
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,561
Mother, I'm hungry.

227
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,561
Hold on a little longer.

228
00:17:01,441 --> 00:17:02,280
Hui'er, come here.

229
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,241
Come to me.

230
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,280
Thank you, Your Excellency.

231
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,361
Kowtow to His Excellency.

232
00:17:25,361 --> 00:17:26,000
I want to kowtow too.

233
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,760
Thank you for saving us.

234
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,481
Me too, Your Excellency.

235
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,801
Thank you, Your Excellency  Thank you, Your Excellency

236
00:17:31,201 --> 00:17:31,801
It's mine

237
00:17:45,321 --> 00:17:45,961
The mountain is collapsing

238
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,400
Let's go

239
00:17:47,561 --> 00:17:49,361
Save my child.

240
00:17:49,481 --> 00:17:49,841
Mother.

241
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,880
My child

242
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,721
Mother

243
00:17:55,961 --> 00:17:56,481
Don't move

244
00:17:56,681 --> 00:17:57,160
Come here

245
00:18:00,801 --> 00:18:02,400
Mom, I'm scared.

246
00:18:02,601 --> 00:18:03,201
Come here.

247
00:18:03,201 --> 00:18:03,681
Come here

248
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,201
Run

249
00:18:13,961 --> 00:18:14,400
Run

250
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,000
Come on, this way

251
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,801
Come on  Come on  Come on

252
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:43,081
Come on, come on

253
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,841
Run this way

254
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,880
Come to me

255
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,961
Come on, come on, come on

256
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,760
Are you okay?

257
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,801
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

258
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,601
Quickly  Quickly

259
00:19:20,321 --> 00:19:21,240
Come for two people

260
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:21,801
Quickly

261
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:22,601
Go

262
00:19:23,081 --> 00:19:23,280
Quickly

263
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,201
My leg

264
00:19:32,081 --> 00:19:32,760
Mother

265
00:19:33,081 --> 00:19:34,280
I can't see

266
00:19:34,961 --> 00:19:36,000
Mother

267
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:39,681
Quick Xianggong

268
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,361
Mother

269
00:19:43,481 --> 00:19:44,160
mother

270
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,160
mother

271
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,400
Mother.

272
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:52,240
Mother.

273
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,760
Mother.

274
00:19:58,841 --> 00:19:59,441
Mother

275
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,561
Mother, wake up  Mother

276
00:20:03,081 --> 00:20:04,201
Give me your mother.

277
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:05,760
I want my mommy

278
00:20:07,561 --> 00:20:08,160
Mother

279
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,880
Your Honor.

280
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,361
Ma'am, ma'am.

281
00:20:35,441 --> 00:20:36,961
Madam, please don't go.

282
00:20:36,961 --> 00:20:37,681
Ma'am.

283
00:20:37,841 --> 00:20:38,760
Ma'am.

284
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,920
Ma'am.

285
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,040
Don't stop me

286
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,400
If you try to stop me from saving him.

287
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:43,760
I'll skin you

288
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,400
Sister, what are you doing here?

289
00:20:55,441 --> 00:20:56,040
Fang Huairui.

290
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,441
Are you taking advantage of his absence?

291
00:20:58,681 --> 00:20:59,841
You're here to do whatever you want?

292
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,081
News has just come from the royal court.

293
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,721
His Excellency was in danger on his way to the mausoleum.

294
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,160
His fate is unknown

295
00:21:10,441 --> 00:21:11,120
Mu Haiyao

296
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,201
You knew something would happen to him

297
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:13,801
Did you?

298
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,520
It's ridiculous

299
00:21:14,961 --> 00:21:15,760
I, Mu Haiyao

300
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,441
I can't let you pLan'ert evidence on me

301
00:21:18,841 --> 00:21:20,160
You just said

302
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,160
You wanted to save His Excellency

303
00:21:21,441 --> 00:21:22,280
Do you think I'm deaf?

304
00:21:23,601 --> 00:21:24,601
You're really cruel

305
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,601
You didn't just kill my son.

306
00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:29,000
You want to kill my husband too?

307
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:29,880
No, I didn't.

308
00:21:30,841 --> 00:21:32,081
How could I kill your son?

309
00:21:32,601 --> 00:21:34,040
He's my husband, too.

310
00:21:34,801 --> 00:21:35,920
Do you swear to God?

311
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,400
If Fai and the Prince

312
00:21:40,081 --> 00:21:41,321
Have anything to do with you.

313
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You'll be damned

314
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,321
The Heir has arrived.

315
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,841
That's impossible.

316
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,841
Young Master may be a bit ridiculous.

317
00:21:58,841 --> 00:22:00,361
But he wouldn't kill a human being at will.

318
00:22:02,361 --> 00:22:02,961
Third Madam.

319
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,280
Are you saying that

320
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,441
I'm accusing Lianxin?

321
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,000
People behind me.

322
00:22:10,441 --> 00:22:11,160
came back.

323
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:11,841
with me.

324
00:22:12,801 --> 00:22:13,961
Tell the Third Madam.

325
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:16,120
Who set an ambush at the top of the hill

326
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,201
to smash my carriage?

327
00:22:18,321 --> 00:22:19,681
It was Young Master Xin.

328
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,321
Who

329
00:22:21,481 --> 00:22:22,880
saw the refugees passing by,

330
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,400
but still wanted to kill me

331
00:22:24,721 --> 00:22:26,240
regardless of people's life or death?

332
00:22:26,561 --> 00:22:27,880
- It was Young Master Xin.
- It was Young Master Xin.

333
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,240
Third Madam.

334
00:22:31,561 --> 00:22:34,040
He Lianxin deliberately tried

335
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,201
to kill me.

336
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,000
I don't believe him.

337
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:44,721
Where's the evidence?

338
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,561
Evidence?

339
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,400
I'm the Heir,

340
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,681
I saw it with my own eyes.

341
00:22:49,681 --> 00:22:50,640
What evidence do you need?

342
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,640
If Young Master wanted to kill you,

343
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:54,640
why are you safe and sound?

344
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,280
But Young Master is missing.

345
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,920
Of course.

346
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:10,201
God has a way of rewarding good and evil.

347
00:23:17,081 --> 00:23:18,040
I want to see His Highness.

348
00:23:27,961 --> 00:23:28,640
Mu Haiyao,

349
00:23:29,961 --> 00:23:30,520
do you think

350
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,000
Mu family

351
00:23:33,081 --> 00:23:34,801
can compete with me?

352
00:23:35,361 --> 00:23:36,040
See His Highness?

353
00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:37,520
OK.

354
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,081
Let me tell you something.

355
00:23:39,801 --> 00:23:42,681
Father sent me here.

356
00:23:44,321 --> 00:23:45,400
What does His Highness do?

357
00:23:45,681 --> 00:23:47,081
To arrest He Lianxin

358
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:50,561
and bring him to justice.

359
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,681
I am not satisfied.

360
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,481
As long as Young Master doesn't come back for a day,

361
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,601
with your words,

362
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:58,000
no one can condemn him

363
00:23:58,361 --> 00:24:00,240
He committed such a heinous crime.

364
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,201
How dare he come back?

365
00:24:04,561 --> 00:24:05,801
He'll come back for sure.

366
00:24:26,601 --> 00:24:27,721
Greetings, Lianchu.

367
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,441
Lianyi.

368
00:24:31,081 --> 00:24:32,441
Who allowed you

369
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,280
to leave Xiqu Camp?

370
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,201
Something's happened to Lianxin.

371
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:36,601
Even if I'm ta the end of the earth,

372
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:37,120
I'll come back.

373
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,321
Don't worry, Lianchu.

374
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:40,081
I'll go to Mansion to apologize to Father

375
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,561
and ask for his orders

376
00:24:41,601 --> 00:24:42,760
to immediately

377
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,760
look for Lianxin.

378
00:24:43,961 --> 00:24:45,280
Let him to clear his name.

379
00:24:45,561 --> 00:24:46,160
Wait.

380
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,520
Lianyi

381
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:53,920
Doesn't what I said mean I'm not innocent?

382
00:24:54,321 --> 00:24:55,400
Let Father alone

383
00:24:55,801 --> 00:24:56,601
believe your innocence,

384
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:57,441
Lianchu.

385
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,000
He Lianyi.

386
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,681
Good.

387
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,760
Good, Lianyi.

388
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:24,280
Good.

389
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,520
Go.

390
00:25:59,841 --> 00:26:00,321
Your Highness.

391
00:26:00,801 --> 00:26:01,481
Did you find him?

392
00:26:01,481 --> 00:26:02,441
We can't find him anywhere.

393
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:03,361
Useless.

394
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,240
He Lianxin ran away,

395
00:26:06,361 --> 00:26:07,681
you even can't kill a woman.

396
00:26:08,961 --> 00:26:09,920
What's the point of finding

397
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,400
a hundred witnesses?

398
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,160
Don't be angry, Your Highness.

399
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,280
I'm going to look for them.

400
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,841
Listen carefully.

401
00:26:14,601 --> 00:26:15,721
Even if you have to go to heaven or earth,

402
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,920
you must find them for me.

403
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:18,601
Yes.

404
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,240
I don't need your help.

405
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,681
You can die. No one's stopping you.

406
00:27:17,361 --> 00:27:18,760
It doesn't matter if you have a clear conscience,

407
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,000
or you're just trying to be nice.

408
00:27:20,201 --> 00:27:21,880
Save it. I won't appreciate it.

409
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,400
You still know the pain.

410
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,361
I admire your courage.

411
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,801
Once you die,

412
00:27:38,321 --> 00:27:39,481
I'll do two things right away.

413
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:40,520
First,

414
00:27:40,801 --> 00:27:42,000
I'll meet Lv Beiyi.

415
00:27:42,081 --> 00:27:44,361
Second, I'll disfigure

416
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,000
and run away with him together.

417
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,760
We'll grow old together.

418
00:27:58,561 --> 00:27:59,601
So you'll never

419
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:00,640
have a way

420
00:28:00,961 --> 00:28:02,201
to avenge your son's death.

421
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:13,400
What's going on outside?

422
00:28:14,961 --> 00:28:15,561
Nothing.

423
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,481
Where is everyone?

424
00:28:19,961 --> 00:28:20,481
There's no one.

425
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,280
Why are you lying?

426
00:28:44,081 --> 00:28:45,081
It's such a big deal.

427
00:28:45,721 --> 00:28:47,201
There's no way Father wouldn't know.

428
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,880
Neither could he

429
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,760
send people to look for me.

430
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,441
It's impossible

431
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,160
for him to not collect the bodies of the people.

432
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,120
Besides, if there's no one there.

433
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,920
You'd have gone back to Mansion to report it.

434
00:28:58,841 --> 00:28:59,721
Why are you here

435
00:29:00,801 --> 00:29:02,240
to make this?

436
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,040
Who wants to kill me?

437
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,681
When you go back to see His Highness,

438
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,040
do you know what to say?

439
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,040
I know.

440
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,601
I'll make the arrangements.

441
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,400
Let's go back.

442
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,481
Your Highness.

443
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,361
If Young Master Xin

444
00:29:25,481 --> 00:29:26,160
is still alive...

445
00:29:32,361 --> 00:29:33,201
I understand.

446
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,880
I must find

447
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,880
Young Master Xin's body.

448
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:41,801
Your Highness.

449
00:29:48,201 --> 00:29:49,361
Why did you lie to me?

450
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,721
Because seeing

451
00:29:52,801 --> 00:29:54,760
I was chased by my own brother,

452
00:29:55,601 --> 00:29:56,400
sympathize with me?

453
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,681
Even if I used to

454
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:07,561
have sympathy for you,

455
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,640
it's also my fault.

456
00:30:08,801 --> 00:30:09,801
You can be so calm.

457
00:30:09,961 --> 00:30:10,561
It means that

458
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:11,681
even the same thing happened,

459
00:30:11,681 --> 00:30:12,920
you will make the same choice

460
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:13,640
You and them

461
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,721
are basically the same kind of people.

462
00:30:15,601 --> 00:30:16,160
Or

463
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,280
contenders for power

464
00:30:17,601 --> 00:30:18,400
are all the same kind of people.

465
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,801
Then why did you save me?

466
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,520
Because I'm not you.

467
00:30:24,721 --> 00:30:25,681
The shelf is almost ready,

468
00:30:26,321 --> 00:30:27,321
I'll carry you out later.

469
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:37,601
So

470
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:40,760
the Heir is trying to harm Young Master.

471
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,201
What are you doing?

472
00:30:51,201 --> 00:30:51,640
Get up.

473
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,040
Brother.

474
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,481
I'm the Young Master's concubine,

475
00:30:56,801 --> 00:30:57,880
also the daughter of the Mu family.

476
00:30:58,441 --> 00:30:59,361
This time the Heir

477
00:30:59,961 --> 00:31:01,201
has arranged everything.

478
00:31:01,681 --> 00:31:02,880
As soon as Young Master returns,

479
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
he will definitely be accused

480
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,280
by he crime of murdering the prince.

481
00:31:05,561 --> 00:31:06,201
At that time

482
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,321
Not only is the son's wife as soon as possible

483
00:31:08,841 --> 00:31:09,640
Will be implicated

484
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,120
Even family members can't escape the blame

485
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,160
I'm afraid within a few years

486
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:17,201
Brother and Father

487
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:19,481
Will not be reused by the sovereign

488
00:31:28,201 --> 00:31:29,601
My brother and father's achievements in recent years

489
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,681
It's not easy to come by.

490
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,760
Hoi Yiu knows it very well

491
00:31:33,721 --> 00:31:34,400
But Your Excellency

492
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,441
After all, he's my husband

493
00:31:40,961 --> 00:31:42,961
Brother, please, brother

494
00:31:42,961 --> 00:31:45,160
Save Haoyao  Save her

495
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,721
Madam

496
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,601
The Mu family is coming

497
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,081
Of course he's coming

498
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,920
Mu Haizhao

499
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,640
If you know that your son can't come back

500
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,640
Her life will be lost

501
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,520
Madame is saying

502
00:32:03,361 --> 00:32:05,240
Mrs. Yao didn't collude with the prince

503
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,081
Harmful childe

504
00:32:06,961 --> 00:32:07,721
So what

505
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,240
She didn't kill Hui Er

506
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,601
My lady's condolences

507
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,160
Madam is still young

508
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:14,640
Wait for Childe to come back

509
00:32:14,961 --> 00:32:16,361
We must have more sons.

510
00:32:16,361 --> 00:32:17,081
Little princesses.

511
00:32:18,961 --> 00:32:19,520
Come back.

512
00:32:20,721 --> 00:32:21,481
Do you really want

513
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,561
Your Excellency to come back?

514
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,240
What does Your Highness mean?

515
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:29,201
Madam, Master Erg is here.

516
00:32:30,721 --> 00:32:31,361
Ridiculous.

517
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,240
What do you take me for?

518
00:32:35,601 --> 00:32:36,801
And what do you think of the Mu family?

519
00:32:38,481 --> 00:32:41,280
I've been following you for years.

520
00:32:42,721 --> 00:32:43,321
How could I do that for the sake of

521
00:32:43,321 --> 00:32:45,000
For the sake of our own future.

522
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,040
I believe Mr. Xin

523
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,640
Would never do such a

524
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,201
I'm sure he'll never do such a heartless thing.

525
00:32:54,601 --> 00:32:55,880
I'm sure he'll clear his name.

526
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,520
I promise you.

527
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,801
I'm going to report this to Father

528
00:33:04,841 --> 00:33:06,240
Even if the Mu family digs up the ground

529
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,721
We must find Mr. Noboru.

530
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,920
It's bad news.

531
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:16,721
The Prince has found some old stories.

532
00:33:16,721 --> 00:33:17,561
He's trying to frame father.

533
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:18,880
And he threatened

534
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,681
He's going to report to the King for punishment.

535
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,841
What?

536
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,240
The Prince also said

537
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,640
Father's life and death

538
00:33:25,441 --> 00:33:26,520
The survival of the clan

539
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,481
It's up to you to decide.

540
00:33:31,361 --> 00:33:32,880
If we get Mr. Noboru back.

541
00:33:33,361 --> 00:33:34,240
Fang's family

542
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,321
will be in deep trouble.

543
00:33:42,801 --> 00:33:43,361
Go that way

544
00:33:47,961 --> 00:33:48,361
Get out of here

545
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:00,520
Get out of here

546
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,441
It's been a long time.

547
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,400
Stop

548
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,161
Let's go in.

549
00:34:18,161 --> 00:34:19,601
We have a lot of keys at home.

550
00:34:23,081 --> 00:34:23,641
Good. - Good.

551
00:34:23,841 --> 00:34:24,480
You're a good drinker.

552
00:34:24,641 --> 00:34:25,401
Have some, girl.

553
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:28,361
Let's have a look.

554
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:30,881
Stop right there.

555
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:31,960
What are you doing?

556
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,240
I'm sick.

557
00:34:33,561 --> 00:34:34,040
What's wrong?

558
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,040
Show me your face.

559
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,081
What's going on?

560
00:34:36,361 --> 00:34:37,000
It's leprosy.

561
00:34:38,081 --> 00:34:38,960
Go, go, go, go

562
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:42,801
What's the matter?

563
00:34:44,601 --> 00:34:46,121
Leprosy. What a mess.

564
00:34:46,641 --> 00:34:47,280
Do your duty properly.

565
00:34:47,601 --> 00:34:48,601
If the Prince blames you.

566
00:34:48,601 --> 00:34:49,401
No one can afford it.

567
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:49,881
Yes, sir.

568
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:55,641
Stop

569
00:34:56,921 --> 00:34:57,520
What are you doing?

570
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,280
I'm going to the clinic.

571
00:35:02,361 --> 00:35:03,641
This is the one who had leprosy just now.

572
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:04,760
Let's go, let's go.

573
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,680
Hurry up and come back.

574
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,081
Yes, sir.

575
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,520
Have you ever seen such a leper?

576
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,561
You've never seen a leper who can walk like this.

577
00:35:27,921 --> 00:35:30,000
This wound is already festering.

578
00:35:30,641 --> 00:35:31,601
We can only control it for now.

579
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,081
If you don't pay attention properly,

580
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,520
The wound will be infected again

581
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,921
That would be trouble

582
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,280
Thank you, Doctor

583
00:35:37,321 --> 00:35:38,161
Thank you, Doctor

584
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:49,960
What are you going to do

585
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:59,921
Doctor, I don't have any silver on me

586
00:36:00,881 --> 00:36:02,960
Let's take this as a medical fee

587
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,280
This is too expensive

588
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,641
Nothing is more valuable than life

589
00:36:07,841 --> 00:36:08,601
Just take it.

590
00:36:08,601 --> 00:36:09,000
Take it.

591
00:36:09,321 --> 00:36:10,321
You deserve it.

592
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:12,680
We're in a hurry.

593
00:36:12,841 --> 00:36:13,720
We'll leave now.

594
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,081
Thank you, Doctor.

595
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:15,480
Thank you, doctor.

596
00:36:17,841 --> 00:36:18,561
Take it easy.

597
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:21,121
Take it easy.

598
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,720
Let's go.

599
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,480
Do you really think I'm a murderer?

600
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,081
Even the person who saved my life.

601
00:36:38,081 --> 00:36:39,200
I'd kill even the people who saved my life?

602
00:36:40,401 --> 00:36:41,881
A cold-hearted man like you.

603
00:36:42,161 --> 00:36:42,921
In order to protect yourself.

604
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,680
What's wrong with returning a favor for a grudge?

605
00:36:45,921 --> 00:36:46,680
You're right.

606
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,561
First thing I'll do when I get back.

607
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,561
I'll tie you up.

608
00:36:49,561 --> 00:36:50,161
And put you in a dog cage.

609
00:36:50,161 --> 00:36:50,760
And then.

610
00:36:51,361 --> 00:36:53,401
I'll hang it over the pool.

611
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:55,161
Then I'll put a manhunt out for Lv Beiyi.

612
00:36:55,161 --> 00:36:56,280
Even if he runs away.

613
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,200
I'll bring him back.

614
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,280
Then I'll send you away.

615
00:37:01,561 --> 00:37:02,601
Mr. Xin, please.

616
00:37:02,601 --> 00:37:04,040
Next time, before you say something mean.

617
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,881
Take a good look at your own situation

618
00:37:07,361 --> 00:37:07,720
You

619
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,000
You, you, this

620
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:09,720
You

621
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,401
Hurry right here

622
00:37:13,841 --> 00:37:14,121
Quickly

623
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,641
Get up, get up

624
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,000
Go

625
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,121
Where are the people who see the doctor

626
00:37:30,321 --> 00:37:30,801
Go away

627
00:37:37,561 --> 00:37:38,440
Where the hell did you go

628
00:37:46,841 --> 00:37:48,240
Tell me where the hell they went

629
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,520
Don't be angry, Master Soldier. Don't be angry, Master Soldier.

630
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:51,240
I don't know them.

631
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:51,960
I really don't know them.

632
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,601
Don't talk nonsense.

633
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,601
I don't know them at all.

634
00:37:53,601 --> 00:37:54,401
I don't know who they are.

635
00:37:54,401 --> 00:37:55,601
Tell me or I'll kill you

636
00:37:56,561 --> 00:37:58,361
Forgive me, Master Soldier  Forgive me, Master Soldier

637
00:37:58,641 --> 00:37:59,601
Forgive me, Master Soldier.

638
00:37:59,841 --> 00:38:00,601
I see you don't want to see the coffin.

639
00:38:00,601 --> 00:38:01,280
No more tears.

640
00:38:03,561 --> 00:38:04,081
Come on, let's go.

641
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,121
What a weak woman.

642
00:38:40,801 --> 00:38:42,200
But she's not afraid to kill.

643
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:49,240
Who says all women are weak?

644
00:38:50,881 --> 00:38:51,440
Do you think

645
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,641
Like those women in your house?

646
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:01,280
And you?

647
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:04,440
When you killed Hui Er.

648
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,440
Were you as merciless?

649
00:39:08,921 --> 00:39:09,881
With this hand, too?

650
00:39:10,321 --> 00:39:11,520
I didn't do it.

651
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,680
You're still trying to argue.

652
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,440
You're not going to make me believe you.

653
00:39:16,881 --> 00:39:18,361
Why don't you believe me?

654
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,361
If I'm the murderer.

655
00:39:21,081 --> 00:39:22,200
Why didn't I run away?

656
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,760
Why did I come back to save you?

657
00:39:23,921 --> 00:39:25,240
Why did I have to die?

658
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,401
To find you a doctor.

659
00:39:26,841 --> 00:39:28,921
I've got a clear conscience, a clean slate.

660
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:30,121
Why can't I get back

661
00:39:30,121 --> 00:39:31,641
Why can't I get a single word of faith from you, Helenshine?

662
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,161
I saw it with my own eyes.

663
00:39:37,161 --> 00:39:38,641
You ran away with Lu Beiyi.

664
00:39:39,161 --> 00:39:40,801
I only believe in my eyes.

665
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,321
I saw it with my own eyes.

666
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,081
I saw it with my own eyes.

667
00:39:48,081 --> 00:39:49,401
Does it have to be everything?

668
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,561
I saw it with my own eyes.

669
00:39:51,561 --> 00:39:52,760
You're ruthless.

670
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,040
Aren't you the same?

671
00:39:54,361 --> 00:39:56,321
You'd save the people, save the doctor?

672
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:01,601
And you?

673
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,081
That's different.

674
00:40:09,081 --> 00:40:10,121
What's the difference?

675
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,881
The people are innocent.

676
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,280
I won't be a part of this with He Liandu.

677
00:40:15,601 --> 00:40:16,480
I won't be a part of this.

678
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,480
Come on

679
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,240
Here, have some more chicken.

680
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,361
Is it good?

681
00:40:41,121 --> 00:40:41,641
It's good.

682
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:44,321
It's perfect.

683
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,561
You're sweating like a pig.

684
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:48,960
Wipe it off.

685
00:40:51,321 --> 00:40:51,841
Mom.

686
00:40:54,081 --> 00:40:55,361
I missed you so much.

687
00:40:57,841 --> 00:40:59,440
I missed you so much, mom.

688
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,520
Mother, I miss you so much.

689
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:05,641
Mother.

690
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,081
You're badly hurt.

691
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,401
You can't go on like this.

692
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,520
When I was outside today.

693
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,641
I saw a lot of people looking for you.

694
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,361
Why don't you find someone you know?

695
00:41:33,361 --> 00:41:34,280
You can't trust anyone.

696
00:41:37,601 --> 00:41:38,881
We have to go to the royal residence.

697
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:40,680
To find my father

698
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,680
First Lady and Lady Yao

699
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,120
