Thirdly,

18
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,690
I do not know the ladies.

19
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,090
If I intend to hurt them,

20
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,290
my objective would be
the elimination of opponents.

21
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,410
There are more than a dozen
ladies in the selection process.

22
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,760
Eliminating three out
of all the candidates

23
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,160
doesn't make sense at all.

24
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,240
If you're not the murderer,

25
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,650
why is the poison

26
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,200
found in your basin?

27
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,480
Is somebody trying to frame you?

28
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,370
I'm not being framed.

29
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,960
Somebody is trying to kill me.

30
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,760
As long as you reveal
the identity of that person

31
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,650
and show us the evidence,

32
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,600
we

33
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,200
will not put you in a bad spot.

34
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,170
I do not know.

35
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,930
I almost believed you.

36
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,730
My lord, please kill this smooth-talking

37
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,320
sinner immediately.

38
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,840
Luo Qinglian.

39
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
This matter

40
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,760
involves several aristocrats,

41
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,960
Qu Liang,

42
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,840
and also the hearts and
minds of the officers.

43
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,010
If you can't identify the murderer,

44
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:01,890
then I...

45
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,680
I must punish you.

46
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:07,760
Do you understand?

47
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,370
Yes, I do.

48
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,680
In that case,

49
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,450
tell us.

50
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:15,890
My lord,

51
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,730
Even if I identify a person,

52
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,200
it is merely based on my suspicion.

53
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,760
Moreover, there is no evidence.

54
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,010
I have been a diligent
officer for many years,

55
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,290
but my innocent daughter was murdered.

56
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,040
If the murderer cannot
be punished severely,

57
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,120
I do not have the courage

58
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,840
to continue living in this world.

59
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,810
Please grant me an honourable death.

60
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,480
Please grant me an honourable death.

61
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:03,480
My lord.

62
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,090
These are all heroes of Qu Liang.

63
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,090
Please think twice, my lord.

64
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,960
Do not disappoint the people

65
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,040
for the sake of a woman.

66
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:26,880
You people

67
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,000
are a bunch of shallow-minded men.

68
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:31,480
Brother Yi.

69
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:31,970
Run.

70
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:04,850
Be careful, my lady.

71
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,090
Meanie.

72
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,530
I'm saving you.

73
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,370
Even if you can get out
of the Qingkang Hall,

74
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,810
can you get out of the lord's mansion?

75
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,570
Do you want to die
getting shot by arrows?

76
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,720
What a bold assassin!

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,160
Execute him immediately!

78
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,280
No!

79
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
Please don't kill him!

80
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,280
My lord.

81
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,370
My lord.

82
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,160
I plead guilty.

83
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,810
I poisoned the ladies. It's me.

84
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,090
I'm jealous.

85
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,880
It's me. It has nothing to do with him.

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,720
Please spare his life, my lord.

87
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,370
Lian.

88
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,850
My lord, I instigated it! It was me!

89
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,410
Who are you

90
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,410
to make a judgement in the Grand Hall?

91
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,160
My lord.

92
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,090
If the late consort

93
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,130
did not pass away

94
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,130
because of the first prince,

95
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:16,720
is the lord

96
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,370
still going to

97
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,930
sacrifice yourself for her?

98
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,690
What an imprudent woman!

99
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,130
Who are you to run your mouth here?

100
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,650
My lord. Death is terrifying.

101
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,480
However,

102
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,250
there is something
called a worthy death.

103
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,720
The late consort

104
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,250
is willing to die

105
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,130
in order to give birth
to the first prince.

106
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,370
That was her worthy death.

107
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,040
And now,

108
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,040
I am

109
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,440
also willing

110
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,410
to die for a person.

111
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:54,720
My lord.

112
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,970
If you think that I

113
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,650
have certain resemblance
to the late consort,

114
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,970
I beg you, my lord.

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,850
I beg my lord for mercy.

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,760
Please allow me to die a worthy death.

117
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,850
Please grant my wish.

118
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,850
Luo Qinglian.

119
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,090
Have you made up your mind?

120
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,000
Yes, I do.

121
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:52,930
Lian.

122
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,370
No.

123
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,200
Luo Qinglian

124
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,410
has murdered several ladies.

125
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,040
It is an unforgivable crime.

126
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:15,130
Therefore...

127
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,040
Please wait, my lord.

128
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,570
Aunt Jinfang.

129
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,330
Please allow me

130
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,890
to say something

131
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,160
to my lord and the ministers.

132
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,570
Aunt Jinfang.

133
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,960
I didn't expect

134
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,080
that you are still in the mansion.

135
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,640
What would you like to say?

136
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,570
Thank you for remembering me, my lord.

137
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,840
Back then,

138
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,640
I came to the mansion
along with the late consort.

139
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,480
Since then, I never left the mansion.

140
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,640
I spent all my life

141
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,250
in the lord's mansion.

142
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,160
I have long been used to the mansion.

143
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,130
And I can't leave the mansion.

144
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,480
But my biggest regret

145
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,450
is that the late consort died young

146
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,570
and I can't serve her for life.

147
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,720
You remember these things.

148
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,280
Very well.

149
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:45,960
Very well.

150
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,370
The late consort treated me well.

151
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,960
After so many years,

152
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,570
I never forgot her highness.

153
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:57,960
Dear ministers,

154
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,520
it is true that my lord
misses the late consort.

155
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,210
However, his highness will
never bend the rules

156
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,720
because of Miss Qinglian's face.

157
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,960
Although Miss Qinglian
personally confessed to the crime,

158
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,520
but as you can see,

159
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,450
she pleaded guilty out of duress.

160
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,720
The real culprit must be someone else.

161
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,280
Although I do not know Miss Qinglian

162
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,640
for a long time,

163
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,840
but I believe that

164
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,810
she is not a vicious person.

165
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,330
I know that

166
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,640
these are empty words.

167
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,040
No one can prove

168
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,130
Miss Qinglian's innocence.

169
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,690
If the anger of the ministers
cannot be appeased,

170
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,690
please allow me

171
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,960
to be punished on
behalf of Miss Qinglian.

172
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:23,520
No!

173
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:56,640
Deliver my order.

174
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:58,810
Yes.

175
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,960
Aunt Jinfang is a faithful
servant to her mistress.

176
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:07,130
Her faithfulness should
be praised and forgiven.

177
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,400
I hereby allow her

178
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,040
to be buried in the cemetery
of the late consort.

179
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,210
Let them meet in the afterworld.

180
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,080
Yes, my lord.

181
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,160
Somebody.

182
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,010
Everyone.

183
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,010
The people here are my colleagues

184
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,770
and my sons.

185
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,450
You all are my most trusted people.

186
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,040
It can be said

187
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:09,840
that we are a family.

188
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,690
Since we are a family,

189
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,130
let's talk about our family matter.

190
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,480
I am over 50 years old now.

191
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,080
The death of the late consort

192
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,010
has always been

193
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,080
a torment for me.

194
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,330
The late consort died young.

195
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:32,770
After so many years,

196
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,160
I can never forget her.

197
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,720
I wish to

198
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,960
meet her soon.

199
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,010
If Aunt Jinfang

200
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,600
did not die for her mistress today.

201
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:47,840
I won't

202
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,600
have the opportunity to say this.

203
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:52,930
I assure you

204
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,330
that I will find

205
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,210
the real culprit as soon as possible

206
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,480
to be answerable to you guys.

207
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,930
I hope that the truth can be
revealed as soon as possible.

208
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,450
I hope that the truth can be
revealed as soon as possible.

209
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,160
I can't accept that.

210
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,280
Did my innocent daughter

211
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,080
died in vain?

212
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,480
Why isn't there anyone

213
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,160
paying for the crime?

214
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:10,960
What's your name?

215
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,210
Lu Beiyi.

216
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,720
Lu Beiyi

217
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,130
has committed an unforgivable crime
of assassination in the Grand Hall.

218
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,210
You will be demoted to
the status of a slave

219
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:20,770
perpetually and hereditary.

220
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,810
I hope that the truth can be

221
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,960
revealed as soon as possible.

222
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:01,520
My lord.

223
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,810
Before the investigation is completed,

224
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,840
this woman must not
enter the lord's mansion.

225
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,930
Please determine how
we shall deal with her.

226
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:28,480
Luo Qinglian.

227
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:30,570
Yes, my lord.

228
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,810
Do you have anything else to say?

229
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,370
I'm innocent.

230
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,520
But I have no evidence

231
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,770
to clear the suspicion.

232
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,520
If there is any punishment,

233
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,770
I have no complaints.

234
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,880
Before the real culprit is caught,

235
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,040
Luo Qinglian

236
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,690
disqualified from the selection process

237
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,400
and demoted to the role of a servant.

238
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,280
You shall serve...

239
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,120
You shall serve...

240
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,120
You shall serve
the fifth prince, He Lianzuo

241
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,090
as a servant.

242
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:44,810
Father...

243
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:48,120
Thank you, father.

244
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:29,930
Let's go.

245
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:34,360
My lord.

246
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,330
Miss Lian

247
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,810
is going to serve as a servant
at Prince Zuo's residence.

248
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,090
She is going to suffer later.

249
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,690
Her life and death

250
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,610
has nothing to do with us.

251
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,520
Let's go.

252
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,970
My lord.

253
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,240
The fifth prince and Miss Qinglian

254
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,360
have left.

255
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,280
She has left for decades.

256
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,120
Let her rest in peace.

257
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:17,970
Yu Dechang.

258
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:18,760
Yes, my lord.

259
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:19,810
Deliver my order.

260
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,570
This selection of concubine

261
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:22,970
shall cease.

262
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,330
Those who were not selected,

263
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,810
send them home.

264
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,360
Those who are still in the mansion

265
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:32,240
may stay.

266
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:33,400
Yes, my lord.

267
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:09,850
My lady.

268
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,210
Dongli.

269
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,120
Did my family members
know about what happened?

270
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:24,160
Are they okay?

271
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
Such a big thing happened to you.

272
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,330
How can they be okay?

273
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,570
They miss you.

274
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,850
But they don't want you to miss home.

275
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,450
Master and madam remind you

276
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,490
not to get overwhelmed.

277
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,640
As long as you are alive,

278
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,760
there is nothing that
cannot be overcome.

279
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,570
The young master

280
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,690
changed his attitude too.

281
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,610
He started to study hard

282
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,570
for the imperial exam.

283
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,120
My lady.

284
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,490
What's wrong?

285
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,400
I'm mad at myself.

286
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,330
I made my family worried about me

287
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,730
and Brother Yi was demoted
to the status of a slave.

288
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,970
Brother Yi has always
been a prideful person.

289
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,520
Now, their family...

290
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,280
The men can only catch
frogs and sell soup

291
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:58,760
while the women can only
become slaves and prostitutes.

292
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,450
They can only marry among the same rank.

293
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,040
And the status is hereditary.

294
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,930
How can he accept that?

295
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:09,970
Dongli.

296
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,490
Go to Brother Yi

297
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,330
and send him my message.

298
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,520
Do not miss a single word.

299
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,210
I admire the poise and
dignity of a person,

300
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,880
and not the frugal trend and style.

301
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,570
What do you mean, my lady?

302
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:28,490
He knows.

303
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,880
Ask him to reply to my message.

304
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,040
Come in quickly.

305
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,640
We are waiting for you.

306
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,490
I need to go.

307
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,000
My lady.

308
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:44,400
From now on,

309
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,970
The Lu family is demoted
to the status of a slave.

310
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,120
They shall not be qualified
to be a government officer,

311
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,120
a scholar, an artisan or a merchant.

312
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,490
They are not allowed
to marry any commoners.

313
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,450
If a person marries a slave,

314
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,850
all his or her family members
shall be demoted to slavery.

315
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,640
The status shall be
hereditary and perpetual.

316
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,490
This is awful.

317
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,760
What happened?

318
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,280
Why is the Lu's Medical
Center being closed?

319
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,490
Yes. What happened?

320
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,240
What's wrong?

321
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,240
Why are they being demoted to slavery?

322
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:15,610
What happened to the medical centre?

323
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,240
I can't believe that their family

324
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,330
will commit such a huge crime

325
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,120
that leads to a demotion.

326
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,160
What's going on?

327
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,880
Yes.

328
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,090
This is awful.

329
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,330
What's wrong with the laws?

330
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,000
Why don't good people get rewarded?

331
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:19,520
Father.

332
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,400
The Lu family practised
medicine for generations.

333
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,880
I never thought we would face
such a misfortune today.

334
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:31,040
How am I going to face my ancestors?

335
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:33,880
It's all my fault.

336
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,240
I will definitely overturn
our status in the future...

337
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,930
Father.

338
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:41,280
Sir!

339
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,520
-Sir, what's wrong with you?
-Father!

340
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,120
Father!

341
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:45,520
Sir!

342
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:47,570
Sir!

343
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:49,730
Father!

344
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,120
Wake up, sir!

345
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,810
Sir!

346
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,040
Wake up!

347
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,760
Sir!

348
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,210
You're a lady after all.

349
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:10,880
If you're not a servant
bestowed by the lord,

350
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,690
you've already been beaten and scolded.

351
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,730
How can you wash a cabbage

352
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,240
without peeling the leaves?

353
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,090
If you can't do kitchen chores,

354
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,880
go somewhere else.

355
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:22,360
I can do this.

356
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,210
This is labour work.

357
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,850
A servant doesn't get
to choose his work.

358
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,400
Since I don't know anything,

359
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,360
I shall start learning from this.

360
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:44,970
What's going on?

361
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,240
Why are we having a
guest in our house now?

362
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,160
How are we going to deal with her?

363
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:48,640
We can't go easy on her.

364
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,490
But we can't make it
difficult for her too.

365
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,240
She is supposed to
be father's concubine.

366
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,400
We're going to be in trouble.

367
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,760
I don't want to.

368
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,160
Fine.

369
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:17,520
My lord.

370
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,690
Calm down, my lord.

371
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,360
I wasn't around when it
happened at the Lord's mansion.

372
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,850
But now that we're back home,

373
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,000
this is a family matter.

374
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,930
We can deal with it at will.

375
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:58,930
I admire the poise and
dignity of a person,

376
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,210
and not the frugal trend and style.

377
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:05,610
Stop drinking.

378
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:06,880
My lady is still waiting for you.

379
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,730
Would you like to write a letter

380
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:08,490
or send a message?

381
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:11,850
No.

382
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,880
I have no letter

383
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,330
or message for her.

384
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,730
I don't blame him.

385
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,610
The medical centre and all their
family assets were seized.

386
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,210
All his family members were
punished with great humiliation.

387
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,970
It's only natural for
him to be depressed.

388
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:38,850
My lady,

389
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,040
you also fell from
the sky to the ground.

390
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,520
Yet you still worry about him.

391
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,810
I have visited him several times.

392
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,210
But he didn't even express

393
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,570
any concern towards you, my lady.

394
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:48,330
It's not his fault.

395
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:49,690
I'm working as a servant now.

396
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,360
I can never compare
myself to his demotion

397
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,090
to slavery.

398
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,760
He won't have the heart and mind

399
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,330
to be concerned about me.

400
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,330
The firewood in the kitchen
is running low.

401
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,360
Go to the woodshed to get some.

402
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,490
Can't you do that on your own?

403
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:00,570
If you have time to walk here
to give the instruction,

404
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,570
can't you just pick up
the firewood on your own?

405
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:02,810
I'm giving her an instruction.

406
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:03,610
It has nothing to do with you.

407
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,160
You!

408
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:04,970
I'll go now.

409
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:05,970
Dongli.

410
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:06,690
My lady.

411
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:07,930
Go home.

412
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,160
Don't tell Brother Yi about this.

413
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,640
Tell him that

414
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,280
I am fine.

415
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:15,640
I shall get going.

416
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,640
Slow down, my lord.

417
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,160
My lord.

418
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,240
Be careful, my lord.

419
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,690
My lord.

420
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,610
What's going on?

421
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:33,360
My lord.

422
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,210
Be careful, my lord.

423
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:35,880
Be careful.

424
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,520
Brother Xin.

425
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:45,760
Brother Zuo.

426
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,160
How did you calm the horse down?

427
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,210
Horse lover.

428
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,490
You deserved to be called a horse lover.

429
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:59,160
This horse has been fine
throughout the journey.

430
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,640
How come

431
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,240
it went crazy

432
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,810
when it got to your house.

433
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,090
It tried to run into the house.

434
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:05,640
No way. When I get home,

435
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,450
I must punish the horse.

436
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:09,490
Let me take a look.

437
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,690
Brother Xin, this is a good horse.

438
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,090
Really?

439
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,760
Fine.

440
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:49,850
Brother Zuo.

441
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,850
You are the person who knows
horses best in the world.

442
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,690
Please help me to check on the horse.

443
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,090
Did I get cheated?

444
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,040
I got this horse

445
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,640
in exchange for half of the treasures

446
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,210
I collected over the years.

447
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,280
But it's just a crazy horse.

448
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:03,850
A crazy horse?

449
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,810
What are you talking about?

450
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,610
This is a priceless good horse.

451
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,040
A good horse has to be
able to carry people.

452
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:11,970
Never mind.

453
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:12,690
I'll go home

454
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:13,520
and sell it off at a low price.

455
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:14,330
Brother Xin.

456
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,850
Why are you in a hurry?

457
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:18,280
My wife.

458
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,610
Brother Xin rarely comes to our house.

459
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:21,930
Please prepare some food and drink.

460
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:25,810
Go.

461
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,450
This wine

462
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,850
is an old wine rewarded by
the emperor to our father.

463
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,040
Listen to me.

464
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,640
This wine should pair with...

465
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:36,970
It should pair with...

466
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,400
Bayberry!

467
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,490
Yes. Bayberry.

468
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,040
I know, right?

469
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:42,930
I also brew this wine in my house.

470
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,040
If you like it,

471
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,520
next time,

472
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,520
I'll bring you a few bottles.

473
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:48,160
My wine might even
taste better than yours.

474
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,570
Brother Xin.

475
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,040
Please try this dish.

476
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,490
This is a lost recipe.

477
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,520
It tastes authentic.

478
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,450
You won't be able to get this outside.

479
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:02,210
A lost recipe.

480
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:05,640
You're very dedicated.

481
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,490
Something is lacking.

482
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,240
Brother Zuo.

483
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:19,690
Speaking of my horse.

484
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,570
These dishes

485
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,210
is merely a casual treat, right?

486
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:27,570
You're not trying to ask
me for the horse, right?

487
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,000
No way.

488
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:33,360
I won't.

489
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,280
Don't worry.

490
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:35,930
Sure.

491
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,400
Dig in, my lord.

492
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:40,450
This is your

493
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,360
favourite braised pork belly.

494
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:05,970
This soup...

495
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:10,160
Something is lacking.

496
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,000
This soup

497
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,210
is made based on the secret
recipe of the Lord's kitchen.

498
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,570
I know the recipe comes from
the Lord's kitchen,

499
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:24,880
but something is not right.

500
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,210
No.

501
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:27,730
My kitchen

502
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:28,640
is using the same recipe.

503
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:29,520
But the taste

504
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,360
is lacking compared
to this bowl of soup.

505
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:33,280
Brother Zuo.

506
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,690
You have something good in your house.

507
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,360
None of these dishes

508
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:41,970
beats this soup.

509
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:42,570
Yes.

510
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,690
Brother Xin,

511
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,120
I spent a lot of money to recruit

512
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,040
the chef who made this soup.

513
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,330
If you like his soup,

514
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,490
you can have the chef.

515
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:58,400
Brother Xin.

516
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:00,690
We are brothers.

517
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,970
We should suit each
other's fancy, isn't it?

518
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,160
Suit each other's fancy.

519
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:05,810
Sure.

520
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:07,360
I...

521
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,280
Let's drink the soup. Cheers.

522
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:09,810
Cheers.

523
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,000
Cheers.

524
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,280
Thank you, Brother Zuo.

525
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:23,240
No. Something is wrong.

526
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,120
Something is wrong.

527
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,570
This has nothing to do with the chef.

528
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:30,850
It's the fire.

529
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,640
The person who handles
the stove is good.

530
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,360
The person who nd the stove?

531
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,570
It's Luo Qing...

532
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,360
Lian...

533
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,610
Take it easy.

534
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,520
You're amazing, Brother Xin.

535
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:49,000
There are many good cooks.

536
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,210
But only the experts know

537
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:55,000
that the handling of the firewood
stove is the key to good food.

538
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:02,640
Then...

539
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,400
Since I'm giving you the chef,

540
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,690
why don't you take the servant

541
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,640
who handles the stove as well?

542
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,240
Thank you, Brother Zuo.

543
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,240
Since you're so generous,

544
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,880
I don't think

545
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,850
I should bring that horse home.

546
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:23,570
Brother Xin.

547
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:25,640
What are you doing?

548
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,330
If you don't want that horse, then...

549
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:29,640
Thank you, Brother Xin.

550
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,640
This is for you, brother.

551
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,450
Please pour some wine for me too.

552
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,570
Here.

553
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,970
Zui Chun Gui.

554
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,120
Suit each other's fancy.

555
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,090
What? I'm leaving?

556
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:45,810
Yes.

557
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:46,360
I need to leave now?

558
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:47,570
Where am I going?

559
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,730
What are they trying to do?

560
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:49,690
Stop asking questions.

561
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:50,520
Madam ordered you

562
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,690
to wait in front of the door.

563
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,610
The servant who handled the stove,

564
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:07,640
follow me.

565
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:08,730
From now on,

566
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:11,640
you belong to me.

567
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:14,400
Why should I go with you?

568
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,560
Why am I your belonging?

569
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,290
If you're not coming with me,

570
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,360
why are you waiting for me here?

571
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:21,010
Lord Xin, please behave yourself.

572
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,210
I might be a servant,

573
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,250
but I was bestowed by the Lord.

574
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,450
The princes are not supposed

575
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:25,050
to send me off as you please.

576
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,930
Let me go!

577
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:30,530
Let go!

578
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
Do you hate me so much?

579
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,120
Would you rather be a servant

580
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,770
than my concubine?

581
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,290
Concubine?

582
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:08,840
Madam, you should eat something.

583
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,120
It's Luo Qinglian who didn't
live up to the expectations

584
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,050
and ended up becoming a servant.

585
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,600
Don't be too hard on yourself.

586
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,730
What a waste of my efforts.

587
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,050
Hurry up, guys.

588
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:22,050
Yes.

589
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:22,490
Yes.

590
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,450
Hang that lantern over there.

591
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,210
Yes.

592
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:27,320
What's going on outside?

593
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,290
Hang this up.

594
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,640
My lady.

595
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:30,770
Just now, Prince Xin

596
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:31,770
delivered some messages

597
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:32,530
to Madame.

598
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,930
Everyone is busy working now.

599
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,050
What are they busy with?

600
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,120
They are decorating
the Liuyun Residence.

601
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:37,970
The gate

602
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,050
even has firecrackers hung up.

603
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:39,800
I've cleaned it up.

604
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,050
Where's the prince?

605
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:42,560
He went to Prince Zuo's residence.

606
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,160
Luo Qinglian.

607
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,080
No wonder.

608
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,290
The prince always
disregard political affairs.

609
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:52,210
But this time, he is concerned
with the selection of concubines.

610
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,530
I thought he was concerned about me.

611
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,530
I never thought he is interested

612
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,360
with Luo Qinglian.

613
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:00,360
For that woman,

614
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,400
is he going to fight

615
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,450
with the lord?

616
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,400
A deception?

617
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,770
Brother Xin is trying
to deceive father's woman?

618
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:07,360
What for?

619
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,930
When we were at the Great Hall,

620
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,530
wasn't he hiding with us?

621
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:13,210
I'm afraid that we

622
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,560
only saw her flaws

623
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:16,730
but not the benefits she can bring.

624
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,320
Are you saying that

625
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:23,970
if we treat

626
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,080
Luo Qinglian well,

627
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,250
father may favour us

628
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,450
in many aspects as well?

629
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:31,120
That's impossible.

630
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,970
Brother Xin is known
to be an idle prince.

631
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,400
He doesn't have such shrewdness.

632
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:40,880
Although he usually

633
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,160
seems to be idle.

634
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,490
But he never fails

635
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:45,730
to do something because of that.

636
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,450
Still waters run deep.

637
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,080
Who knows

638
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,840
we all fell for his trick.

639
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:53,930
He's mean.

640
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:55,880
And you.

641
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,050
How can you send such
an important person away

642
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:58,640
in exchange for a horse?

643
00:36:59,490 --> 00:36:59,840
That...

644
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,490
Is that my fault?

645
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:02,930
Fine.

646
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:04,320
You're the one who
wanted to send her away.

647
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,450
And now you're saying that she's useful.

648
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:12,640
Brother Xiu.

649
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,050
I still don't understand.

650
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:15,490
What is the right way

651
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:16,640
to deal with her?

652
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,490
I'm afraid that by
the time we figure it out,

653
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:22,490
it's too late.

654
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:30,690
We might not be able to figure it out,

655
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,490
but we can ask somebody about it.

656
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,160
Who is it?

657
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,010
Father, please punish me.

658
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,160
I was careless.

659
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:45,770
I thought I was giving
away a kitchen maid.

660
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,640
I realised it was Miss Qinglian

661
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:49,560
after she left.

662
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:51,530
I believe that

663
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:53,970
Brother Xin did not mean it.

664
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,160
Maybe

665
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:00,050
he just wants to have some good soup.

666
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,250
Bring me the Third Prince.

667
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,530
Father, may I see you?

668
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:20,640
Father, please punish me.

669
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,450
What for?

670
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,530
For the sin of gluttony?

671
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:35,730
Although I'm gluttonous,

672
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:38,010
but that soup is bland.

673
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,800
It is not to my liking.

674
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,120
Please forgive me, father.

675
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,290
I went to Brother Zuo's residence

676
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:49,160
for Miss Qinglian.

677
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,120
Brother Xin, are you crazy?

678
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:52,690
How dare you fight over

679
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:53,290
a servant bestowed by father?

680
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:54,400
Father.

681
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,450
I don't want a servant.

682
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:57,160
I...

683
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:01,730
I want to marry her.

684
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:12,290
Father.

685
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,010
Before the selection of concubines,

686
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,490
I have already

687
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:16,450
met Miss Qinglian.

688
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,560
I think she is

689
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,210
elegant and refined.

690
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:21,320
She's glowing in my eyes.

691
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:24,970
However, she has not passed
the selection process at that time.

692
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,360
I would rather suffer alone

693
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,450
than courting her.

694
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,400
But now...

695
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,080
What about now?

696
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,290
So you're trying to court her now?

697
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,320
Now,

698
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,840
I saw Miss Qinglian

699
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:42,050
in Brother Zuo's residence.

700
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:44,120
She was carrying firewood
and handling the stove

701
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,490
while wearing trashy clothes.

702
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,600
She was doing labour work.

703
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,490
The firewood is dry and thorny.

704
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,840
When I saw her hands getting injured,

705
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,400
I...

706
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,120
Father.

707
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:57,880
You saved her

708
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,560
from the ministers.

709
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,800
I believe that you won't want

710
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,640
to see her suffer anymore.

711
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:02,840
Therefore, I came

712
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,840
to beg you

713
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:07,880
take pity on her once again.

714
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,690
Let her stay

715
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:12,490
with me.

716
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,360
Brother Xin, are you sure you
came to ask for forgiveness?

717
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:21,690
Father, please don't believe his words.

718
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,290
Brother Xin has the capability

719
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:23,840
to charm a woman

720
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,840
easily with his words.

721
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:25,930
I don't think he will

722
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:26,800
fall in love with a woman easily.

723
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,450
She has caused public outrage.

724
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,770
She cannot be a legal wife.

725
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,400
She can only be a concubine.

726
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:00,320
Thank you for your kindness, father.

727
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:07,010
Xin.

728
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:08,450
Yes.

729
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,690
Remember.

730
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,360
Make her a concubine.

731
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:20,560
But you must not treat
her as a concubine.
