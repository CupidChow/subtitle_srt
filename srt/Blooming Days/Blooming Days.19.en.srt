17
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:02,478
Nice gun.

18
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:05,997
Lianchu.

19
00:02:06,277 --> 00:02:07,198
There're many people.

20
00:02:07,637 --> 00:02:08,838
We should put it back.

21
00:02:09,518 --> 00:02:10,158
He Lianxin.

22
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,237
You should be named a wet blanket.

23
00:02:12,677 --> 00:02:14,317
You're trying to mess with me, right?

24
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:16,358
I want to save your life.

25
00:02:16,558 --> 00:02:17,677
I don't need you to save my life.

26
00:02:18,998 --> 00:02:20,157
If you could save any life,

27
00:02:20,957 --> 00:02:21,317
you

28
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:23,558
should've save your sons,
who died one after another.

29
00:02:30,558 --> 00:02:30,998
Lianxin.

30
00:02:31,797 --> 00:02:32,278
Isn't this gun

31
00:02:32,918 --> 00:02:34,358
as good as Lianxiu's?

32
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:42,558
Greetings, Your Highness.

33
00:02:43,558 --> 00:02:44,517
The prince wanted to see you.

34
00:02:47,998 --> 00:02:49,237
Bring the gun along.

35
00:02:58,957 --> 00:03:00,540
(He Yunshuo's Ninth Son, He Lianjian)
Nice gun.

36
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:06,077
It matches your honourable status.

37
00:03:08,198 --> 00:03:08,918
Forgive me, father.

38
00:03:09,437 --> 00:03:11,517
I was just foolish.

39
00:03:12,157 --> 00:03:12,797
Foolish?

40
00:03:15,358 --> 00:03:16,437
No.

41
00:03:17,838 --> 00:03:18,877
You weren't foolish.

42
00:03:19,638 --> 00:03:20,957
I am instead.

43
00:03:23,758 --> 00:03:24,677
I remember

44
00:03:26,358 --> 00:03:26,998
you asked

45
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,677
many times for the gun

46
00:03:29,118 --> 00:03:30,237
and I didn't give it to you.

47
00:03:30,998 --> 00:03:33,638
I gave it to Lianxiu as a reward today.

48
00:03:34,758 --> 00:03:35,877
You're the heir.

49
00:03:36,278 --> 00:03:37,358
You saw the gun

50
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:39,077
being taken by Lianxiu.

51
00:03:40,398 --> 00:03:42,157
Of course you feel upset about it.

52
00:03:43,797 --> 00:03:44,517
I wouldn't dare.

53
00:03:44,918 --> 00:03:45,558
You wouldn't dare?

54
00:03:48,157 --> 00:03:49,157
Speaking of this,

55
00:03:50,717 --> 00:03:53,638
I was foolish in another way.

56
00:03:54,157 --> 00:03:55,717
You're the heir since birth.

57
00:03:57,038 --> 00:03:57,797
I wanted

58
00:03:59,437 --> 00:04:00,358
to nurture the tolerance

59
00:04:00,358 --> 00:04:01,558
that a prince should have

60
00:04:01,558 --> 00:04:02,998
since you're little.

61
00:04:03,558 --> 00:04:05,437
I found you the best teacher

62
00:04:05,797 --> 00:04:07,237
and gave you the best.

63
00:04:07,717 --> 00:04:09,797
You even enjoyed

64
00:04:10,198 --> 00:04:11,638
the same treatment as I got.

65
00:04:12,157 --> 00:04:13,517
I did it so that you wouldn't

66
00:04:14,157 --> 00:04:15,358
say you wouldn't dare

67
00:04:16,838 --> 00:04:18,638
in anything.

68
00:04:19,558 --> 00:04:20,638
When you disappointed me,

69
00:04:21,157 --> 00:04:23,877
I blamed Yuan Baili,
your study companions

70
00:04:24,078 --> 00:04:25,997
and all servants around you,

71
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:27,557
but I forgot

72
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:30,958
I was the cause

73
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,557
of your arrogance.

74
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,078
I understand.

75
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:47,918
You're

76
00:04:49,157 --> 00:04:50,238
indeed

77
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:52,837
very

78
00:04:54,078 --> 00:04:55,478
disappointed in me.

79
00:05:04,157 --> 00:05:05,478
Of course.

80
00:05:07,358 --> 00:05:10,518
I was so pleased when you

81
00:05:14,157 --> 00:05:15,997
advised me to cancel the hunt,

82
00:05:17,557 --> 00:05:18,798
but you did this

83
00:05:19,358 --> 00:05:21,078
today unexpectedly.

84
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:29,117
Other than

85
00:05:29,117 --> 00:05:31,038
thinking about your petty matters
every day,

86
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:34,837
how many times

87
00:05:35,238 --> 00:05:36,437
did you practise riding and shooting?

88
00:05:43,157 --> 00:05:44,638
What could you hit if I give

89
00:05:45,117 --> 00:05:46,078
this gun to you?

90
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:49,117
A bird?

91
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:51,678
A pig?

92
00:05:53,877 --> 00:05:54,597
A mung bean?

93
00:05:56,238 --> 00:05:56,918
Father.

94
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:00,198
Why do you want to humiliate me?

95
00:06:02,157 --> 00:06:03,397
Have I wronged you?

96
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:06,397
Lianjian.

97
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:07,437
Yes.

98
00:06:09,397 --> 00:06:10,758
Aren't you practising shooting?

99
00:06:10,758 --> 00:06:11,238
Yes.

100
00:06:13,518 --> 00:06:14,518
Compete with Lianchu.

101
00:06:15,317 --> 00:06:15,798
Really?

102
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:18,958
Father.

103
00:06:23,198 --> 00:06:24,078
What do you want to shoot?

104
00:06:24,877 --> 00:06:25,478
I...

105
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:29,317
The cup.

106
00:06:30,277 --> 00:06:30,597
Do it.

107
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:54,358
Here you go.

108
00:06:58,478 --> 00:06:58,877
Step aside.

109
00:06:59,758 --> 00:07:00,277
Father.

110
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:05,437
Do you really want to humiliate me?

111
00:07:05,837 --> 00:07:09,038
If you don't take over the gun,
it's self-humiliation.

112
00:07:09,678 --> 00:07:10,478
Take it.

113
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:12,277
Shoot it.

114
00:07:13,758 --> 00:07:14,518
Your turn.

115
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:16,478
Aim and pull the trigger.

116
00:07:16,717 --> 00:07:17,277
It's simple.

117
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:21,157
Shoot with the gun.

118
00:07:21,437 --> 00:07:22,317
It's really simple.

119
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:23,918
Take it.

120
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:25,238
Shoot there.

121
00:07:25,997 --> 00:07:27,117
There.

122
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:31,877
Guards!

123
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:33,877
Physician!

124
00:07:35,758 --> 00:07:36,560
Call the physician.

125
00:07:36,997 --> 00:07:37,597
Call him!

126
00:07:37,597 --> 00:07:39,157
Don't be angry with Lianchu.

127
00:07:39,397 --> 00:07:41,157
Otherwise,

128
00:07:41,358 --> 00:07:44,038
he won't

129
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:45,958
play with me anymore.

130
00:07:53,078 --> 00:07:54,798
Guards!

131
00:07:56,437 --> 00:07:57,120
Young Master Xin.

132
00:07:57,397 --> 00:07:57,918
How is it?

133
00:07:58,678 --> 00:07:59,437
Just as you expected,

134
00:07:59,737 --> 00:08:00,597
The prince told outsiders

135
00:08:00,597 --> 00:08:02,320
that Young Master Jian
only had an acute disease.

136
00:08:02,437 --> 00:08:04,478
The physician was urgently
summoned to treat him.

137
00:08:06,638 --> 00:08:07,198
Since father

138
00:08:07,997 --> 00:08:09,320
still has the heart to defend Lianchu,

139
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,238
there is still a way out.

140
00:08:13,518 --> 00:08:14,078
Yes.

141
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:17,238
Yes.

142
00:08:18,557 --> 00:08:18,997
Beiyi.

143
00:08:19,758 --> 00:08:21,638
How certain are you
in treating a gunshot wound?

144
00:08:22,717 --> 00:08:24,678
A gunshot wound is rare.
I can only try my best.

145
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,840
Go back to prepare the medicine.
Do it as fast as you can.

146
00:08:28,358 --> 00:08:30,638
You must save Lianjian.

147
00:08:31,717 --> 00:08:32,157
Noted.

148
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:34,437
It seems that we still have to

149
00:08:35,157 --> 00:08:36,557
add fuel to the heir's fire.

150
00:08:38,277 --> 00:08:39,517
We have to think of a way

151
00:08:40,277 --> 00:08:41,597
to do it.

152
00:08:41,957 --> 00:08:42,717
I've

153
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,318
got it ready for you.

154
00:08:51,077 --> 00:08:51,757
Your Highness,

155
00:08:52,318 --> 00:08:53,438
I've talked to the physician.

156
00:08:53,438 --> 00:08:55,000
They're preparing
medicine for Young Master Jian.

157
00:08:57,717 --> 00:08:58,318
Leave now.

158
00:09:00,197 --> 00:09:01,637
Aren't you the heir's guard?

159
00:09:03,438 --> 00:09:04,038
Your Highness.

160
00:09:04,637 --> 00:09:06,757
I have to risk my life to report something.

161
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:09,238
Go ahead.

162
00:09:11,857 --> 00:09:12,800
Would my father believe it?

163
00:09:14,957 --> 00:09:16,277
He's in a high position.

164
00:09:16,478 --> 00:09:17,800
Of course he's afraid of assassination,

165
00:09:18,478 --> 00:09:20,038
especially by the heir
that he has appointed

166
00:09:20,038 --> 00:09:21,118
for over 30 years.

167
00:09:22,238 --> 00:09:23,717
The heir has reserved sufficient power.

168
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,717
The prince would believe it

169
00:09:26,597 --> 00:09:27,438
even if he's reluctant.

170
00:09:30,038 --> 00:09:30,837
Don't follow me.

171
00:09:31,478 --> 00:09:32,837
I want to walk alone.

172
00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:47,157
I served beside the heir just now.

173
00:09:47,478 --> 00:09:48,118
He said

174
00:09:48,837 --> 00:09:51,177
you must be bearing a grudge
against him because of Young Master Jian.

175
00:09:51,798 --> 00:09:53,478
Rather than of being deposed by you,

176
00:09:53,918 --> 00:09:54,680
it would be better...

177
00:09:54,998 --> 00:09:55,720
It would be better...

178
00:09:56,318 --> 00:09:56,998
What is it?

179
00:09:57,478 --> 00:09:58,397
He'd rather strike first.

180
00:10:07,517 --> 00:10:08,197
Make way.

181
00:10:08,397 --> 00:10:10,038
Why should I?

182
00:10:10,517 --> 00:10:12,397
Don't you see I'm working?

183
00:10:13,077 --> 00:10:14,837
Take a detour.

184
00:10:16,597 --> 00:10:17,438
Why don't you...

185
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:18,038
Mao Da.

186
00:10:22,798 --> 00:10:24,678
Greetings, Your Highness.

187
00:10:29,277 --> 00:10:30,397
I guessed

188
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,157
you could hold out.

189
00:10:32,837 --> 00:10:34,637
Surprisingly, you're living well.

190
00:10:35,957 --> 00:10:37,118
You're contented

191
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,878
with peace of mind.

192
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:39,918
Very well.

193
00:10:40,918 --> 00:10:42,318
Not really.

194
00:10:42,918 --> 00:10:44,277
I'm only able to endure loneliness.

195
00:10:44,717 --> 00:10:46,077
It's not difficult to endure loneliness.

196
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:49,438
It's difficult

197
00:10:50,878 --> 00:10:51,998
to endure injustice.

198
00:10:52,397 --> 00:10:53,358
With your words,

199
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:57,118
I could endure any injustice

200
00:10:57,597 --> 00:10:58,478
in the world.

201
00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:00,238
I believe in you

202
00:11:01,358 --> 00:11:02,358
but I can't save you.

203
00:11:02,717 --> 00:11:03,517
Do you hate me?

204
00:11:04,757 --> 00:11:06,478
You're the master of Quliang,

205
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,438
but there're still things you can't do.

206
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,040
No matter how great your power is,

207
00:11:11,918 --> 00:11:13,238
they're your family after all.

208
00:11:18,517 --> 00:11:19,318
Family?

209
00:11:22,318 --> 00:11:23,438
Can't Quliang

210
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:26,998
tolerate my family?

211
00:11:35,238 --> 00:11:36,157
The weather is getting cold.

212
00:11:36,878 --> 00:11:38,440
This place is colder
than the southern outskirts.

213
00:11:39,397 --> 00:11:40,597
I'll let Yu Dechang

214
00:11:40,597 --> 00:11:41,678
send you some tailors

215
00:11:42,238 --> 00:11:42,757
and...

216
00:11:50,118 --> 00:11:50,558
No.

217
00:11:51,157 --> 00:11:54,678
Maybe you could leave the courtyard soon.

218
00:11:55,837 --> 00:11:56,920
I hope your words will come true.

219
00:11:58,238 --> 00:12:00,118
I'm leaving. Go back.

220
00:12:01,918 --> 00:12:03,318
Have a safe trip, Your Highness.

221
00:12:14,238 --> 00:12:15,277
Luckily,

222
00:12:15,397 --> 00:12:16,558
today,

223
00:12:16,757 --> 00:12:18,517
you stopped me, Ms. Lian.

224
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:19,717
Otherwise,

225
00:12:19,957 --> 00:12:21,717
I would've ended up scolding the prince.

226
00:12:27,358 --> 00:12:28,678
Forget about staying in the courtyard.

227
00:12:30,318 --> 00:12:31,038
(Look, Your Highness.)

228
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:32,640
The bird has fallen to death.

229
00:12:33,277 --> 00:12:34,197
The birds

230
00:12:34,878 --> 00:12:36,238
saw only food.

231
00:12:36,238 --> 00:12:38,558
They fought one another.
Their hatred fed on envy.

232
00:12:39,238 --> 00:12:40,197
In this case,

233
00:12:40,717 --> 00:12:42,358
will the female bird feed

234
00:12:43,038 --> 00:12:44,878
as kindly as usual?

235
00:12:45,918 --> 00:12:46,757
I believe

236
00:12:47,717 --> 00:12:49,038
the female bird has the nature

237
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:50,438
of feeding its children.

238
00:12:50,818 --> 00:12:52,600
It's also the nature
that a bird is greedy about food.

239
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,318
It will be less greedy

240
00:12:54,517 --> 00:12:55,517
when it grows up.

241
00:12:58,558 --> 00:13:00,038
I'm afraid if it remains greedy,

242
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,517
it will cause a great calamity.

243
00:13:04,757 --> 00:13:06,318
Mao Da, bring the horse.

244
00:13:06,438 --> 00:13:07,038
Noted.

245
00:13:07,118 --> 00:13:08,397
Ms. Lian, where do you want to go?

246
00:13:09,277 --> 00:13:09,798
Deer Terrace.

247
00:13:10,558 --> 00:13:11,560
Young Master Xin is in danger.

248
00:13:16,918 --> 00:13:17,397
Oh no!

249
00:13:20,637 --> 00:13:22,918
How is it no prescribed yet?

250
00:13:24,878 --> 00:13:25,920
The gun's power was too strong.

251
00:13:26,918 --> 00:13:28,817
I couldn't feel the pulse
of Young Master Jian in person.

252
00:13:29,918 --> 00:13:30,517
So...

253
00:13:30,558 --> 00:13:31,238
Stop.

254
00:13:31,517 --> 00:13:32,517
Just tell me

255
00:13:33,277 --> 00:13:35,277
how long Lianjian can stay alive.

256
00:13:37,957 --> 00:13:38,517
Till daybreak.

257
00:13:42,998 --> 00:13:43,957
Daybreak?

258
00:13:46,038 --> 00:13:47,077
I can only

259
00:13:49,197 --> 00:13:50,878
be the heir until then.

260
00:13:52,318 --> 00:13:54,478
Are you still thinking about this
when we're losing Lianjian?

261
00:14:02,517 --> 00:14:03,277
Stay calm.

262
00:14:04,157 --> 00:14:06,798
The best physician is on his way.

263
00:14:07,918 --> 00:14:08,478
I'll

264
00:14:09,118 --> 00:14:09,837
meet father

265
00:14:10,077 --> 00:14:10,918
with you.

266
00:14:12,277 --> 00:14:13,517
You're guilty in this matter.

267
00:14:14,038 --> 00:14:14,957
You must admit your mistake.

268
00:14:17,998 --> 00:14:18,878
Do you hear me?

269
00:14:22,118 --> 00:14:22,637
All right.

270
00:14:23,478 --> 00:14:23,918
Good.

271
00:14:26,077 --> 00:14:26,678
Later...

272
00:14:27,957 --> 00:14:28,678
Later,

273
00:14:29,678 --> 00:14:30,358
we'll meet

274
00:14:30,358 --> 00:14:31,558
at father's tent later.

275
00:14:31,558 --> 00:14:32,038
Your Highness.

276
00:14:32,837 --> 00:14:33,397
Your cloak.

277
00:14:40,358 --> 00:14:43,558
sincerely repent
As long as you could before the prince,

278
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:46,157
he wouldn't punish the heir heavily.

279
00:15:00,438 --> 00:15:01,118
I'll go

280
00:15:01,878 --> 00:15:02,720
to see my father first.

281
00:15:08,197 --> 00:15:08,837
(The heir said)

282
00:15:09,277 --> 00:15:11,640
(he must act
before Young Master Jian dies)

283
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,957
(We should lose no time. It'll be tonight.)

284
00:15:26,678 --> 00:15:27,358
Where is Lianxin?

285
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:31,878
Who's there?

286
00:15:37,757 --> 00:15:38,637
Why are you here?

287
00:15:39,637 --> 00:15:40,197
Girl.

288
00:15:41,397 --> 00:15:42,238
It's been two years.

289
00:15:42,957 --> 00:15:43,478
I really...

290
00:15:43,637 --> 00:15:43,957
Actually,

291
00:15:43,957 --> 00:15:44,717
if I wasn't here,

292
00:15:45,358 --> 00:15:46,277
you could've become

293
00:15:46,277 --> 00:15:47,277
the fish in the net.

294
00:15:48,918 --> 00:15:49,397
The prince

295
00:15:49,878 --> 00:15:51,238
should've believed a slanderous charge

296
00:15:51,238 --> 00:15:52,480
and thought you wanted to kill him.

297
00:15:53,438 --> 00:15:54,277
How do you know?

298
00:15:55,318 --> 00:15:56,157
I met the prince.

299
00:15:57,118 --> 00:15:58,118
His eyes was full of tears

300
00:15:58,277 --> 00:16:00,038
when he saw a bird dying

301
00:16:00,558 --> 00:16:01,358
in the fight for food.

302
00:16:01,918 --> 00:16:02,438
He said

303
00:16:02,717 --> 00:16:04,277
endless greed would
cause a great calamity.

304
00:16:04,558 --> 00:16:05,957
He must have thought of his children.

305
00:16:06,678 --> 00:16:08,757
He also said I would leave
the southern courtyard.

306
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:10,878
I was banished by you.

307
00:16:10,998 --> 00:16:11,837
I can't leave

308
00:16:11,998 --> 00:16:12,998
without your pardon,

309
00:16:13,837 --> 00:16:14,678
unless...

310
00:16:19,238 --> 00:16:20,680
I can't leave unless
you lose your power

311
00:16:21,238 --> 00:16:22,318
and it isn't up to you anymore.

312
00:16:45,118 --> 00:16:45,837
The prince

313
00:16:45,837 --> 00:16:46,837
should've plotted an ambush.

314
00:16:47,678 --> 00:16:48,277
Leave now.

315
00:16:50,118 --> 00:16:51,637
No, I can't leave the heir.

316
00:16:52,397 --> 00:16:53,678
Are you still thinking about the heir?

317
00:16:53,957 --> 00:16:56,438
The heir has made a mistake,
but I can't let him be framed by others.

318
00:16:58,558 --> 00:16:59,118
He Lianxin.

319
00:17:00,397 --> 00:17:01,077
He Lianxin.

320
00:17:03,438 --> 00:17:04,720
The prince is already suspecting you.

321
00:17:04,998 --> 00:17:05,717
Have you considered

322
00:17:05,717 --> 00:17:06,637
how dangerous it is now?

323
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:08,918
He Lianxin.

324
00:17:09,477 --> 00:17:11,318
When will you finally believe me?

325
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:14,078
Seize him!

326
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:15,120
How dare you!

327
00:17:15,157 --> 00:17:15,838
I'm the heir!

328
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:16,598
What do you want to do?

329
00:17:19,157 --> 00:17:19,477
You...

330
00:17:20,237 --> 00:17:21,397
I'm the heir!

331
00:17:21,918 --> 00:17:22,757
What do you want to do?

332
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,157
Why do so many of you

333
00:17:25,718 --> 00:17:27,718
ambush at my father's tent?

334
00:17:27,718 --> 00:17:28,798
What is your intention?

335
00:17:29,997 --> 00:17:30,637
Let me go!

336
00:17:34,877 --> 00:17:35,397
Father.

337
00:17:36,237 --> 00:17:36,798
Father!

338
00:17:40,838 --> 00:17:41,357
Father.

339
00:17:42,757 --> 00:17:44,558
They all are my trusted aides.

340
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,117
They are loyal.

341
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:47,357
As for you,

342
00:17:48,157 --> 00:17:48,997
I want to ask

343
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:53,918
about your intention
of breaking into my tent at night.

344
00:17:58,798 --> 00:17:59,678
Forgive me.

345
00:18:01,578 --> 00:18:02,280
What are you doing?

346
00:18:16,718 --> 00:18:19,958
As long as Young Master Xin pled for you,

347
00:18:20,838 --> 00:18:23,918
you  would get through this safely.

348
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:29,477
Father!

349
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:30,598
That...

350
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,277
That isn't my dagger!

351
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:33,038
Father.

352
00:18:35,318 --> 00:18:36,718
(When He Yunshuo loses)

353
00:18:36,718 --> 00:18:38,477
(the last vestige of his expectation)

354
00:18:39,157 --> 00:18:41,918
(for his son whom he's loved for years,)

355
00:18:43,198 --> 00:18:44,877
(he won't entrust Quliang)

356
00:18:45,237 --> 00:18:47,517
(and his lifetime promise
made to the Emperor)

357
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,277
(to this son.)

358
00:19:01,838 --> 00:19:02,318
Thank you.

359
00:19:05,198 --> 00:19:05,558
Fine.

360
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:08,277
You still want to save me,

361
00:19:08,277 --> 00:19:09,260
even after how I treated you.

362
00:19:10,277 --> 00:19:10,718
Why?

363
00:19:14,117 --> 00:19:15,560
You still want to save me after I caused

364
00:19:16,757 --> 00:19:17,760
the death of our child.

365
00:19:19,397 --> 00:19:19,877
Why?

366
00:19:26,438 --> 00:19:27,718
I ruined your marriage

367
00:19:29,318 --> 00:19:30,997
and banished you
to the southern courtyard.

368
00:19:32,678 --> 00:19:33,517
You still saved me.

369
00:19:35,078 --> 00:19:35,558
Why?

370
00:19:37,757 --> 00:19:39,117
Do you really hate me

371
00:19:41,757 --> 00:19:42,640
as much as you say you do

372
00:19:43,757 --> 00:19:44,877
or are you lying to me?

373

♪Inner feelings like clouds♪

374
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,120
♪Would it be out of reach?♪

375
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:55,880
You're overthinking it.

376
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:58,757
I helped you

377
00:20:00,318 --> 00:20:01,678
only because of the outcast status thing.

378
00:20:07,678 --> 00:20:08,718
I can retreat

379
00:20:10,838 --> 00:20:11,958
as soon as you're safe.

380
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:12,918
Once.

381
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:14,838
Even if it's just once,

388

Young Master!

389
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,318
Young Master, where are you?

390
00:20:49,318 --> 00:20:50,277
He Lianxin, I hate you!

391
00:20:51,757 --> 00:20:52,237
Young Master!

392
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:57,397
Young Master.

393
00:20:58,357 --> 00:20:59,438
You're here.

394
00:20:59,838 --> 00:21:00,718
I'd been looking for you.

395
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:02,318
I heard something happened to the heir.

396
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:03,558
I'm very worried about you.

397
00:21:04,117 --> 00:21:04,958
Are you all right?

398
00:21:20,357 --> 00:21:22,838
(He Lianchu didn't abide
by the ancestor's conduct)

399
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:24,558
(and the prince's teaching.)

400
00:21:25,157 --> 00:21:27,517
(He has lost ability
to handle political affairs.)

401
00:21:28,117 --> 00:21:30,718
(He has lost conduct
that unites the officials.)

402
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,958
(The heir of Prince An)

403
00:21:34,237 --> 00:21:36,718
(mustn't be him.)

404
00:21:37,678 --> 00:21:41,357
(The Emperor grants He Yunshuo's appeal)

405
00:21:41,918 --> 00:21:45,558
(to depose He Lianchu
from the position of the heir)

406
00:21:45,918 --> 00:21:49,157
(and detains him in his mansion.)

407
00:21:58,318 --> 00:21:58,877
Lianxin.

408
00:22:00,397 --> 00:22:01,718
I've punished

409
00:22:01,718 --> 00:22:03,198
everyone who came to plead for him.

410
00:22:04,578 --> 00:22:05,760
Do you still want to plead for him?

411
00:22:10,718 --> 00:22:11,157
Father.

412
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:13,277
Deposing the heir is an important matter.

413
00:22:14,318 --> 00:22:15,517
Please think twice.

414
00:22:20,718 --> 00:22:22,318
You're close to Lianchu.

415
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:25,757
I guessed

416
00:22:27,078 --> 00:22:28,438
you would take part in it,

417
00:22:29,997 --> 00:22:30,757
but you didn't.

418
00:22:31,438 --> 00:22:36,718
So this is the only thing
I'm relieved about.

419
00:22:40,718 --> 00:22:41,237
Lianxin.

420
00:22:42,997 --> 00:22:44,798
Don't be another Yuan Baili.

421
00:23:04,277 --> 00:23:04,997
What brings you here?

422
00:23:06,397 --> 00:23:07,558
You told me

423
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:09,038
you're saved,

424
00:23:09,318 --> 00:23:10,397
thanks to Lian'er.

425
00:23:11,237 --> 00:23:12,438
I'm thankful.

426
00:23:12,918 --> 00:23:13,718
So I came for a visit.

427
00:23:14,877 --> 00:23:15,477
Yes.

428
00:23:16,318 --> 00:23:17,237
It's thanks to her.

429
00:23:18,277 --> 00:23:18,997
Unfortunately,

430
00:23:19,877 --> 00:23:21,277
that's not for saving me.

431
00:23:24,198 --> 00:23:24,838
I don't feel cold.

432
00:23:29,198 --> 00:23:30,637
Lingwei refused to eat just now

433
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:31,757
and spilled the food.

434
00:23:32,438 --> 00:23:34,157
I asked her whose fault it was.

435
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:35,637
She said it's Zhihui.

436
00:23:36,337 --> 00:23:38,460
(Shen Jingrong's Daughter, Lingwei (Childhood))
Such a young child

437
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,680
has learnt to speak against her heart

438
00:23:40,157 --> 00:23:41,198
and the heart of an adult

439
00:23:41,438 --> 00:23:42,517
is much more complicated.

440
00:23:42,997 --> 00:23:44,157
Who knows what is really

441
00:23:44,997 --> 00:23:46,078
on an adult's mind?

442
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:50,517
Forgive me.

443
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:53,237
Young Master.

444
00:23:54,318 --> 00:23:54,918
On the other day,

445
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:56,958
Zhiyue gave me something.

446
00:23:57,237 --> 00:23:58,558
She said she found it
at Lianwei House.

447
00:23:59,678 --> 00:24:00,838
It could make you sad.

448
00:24:00,838 --> 00:24:01,678
So

449
00:24:02,318 --> 00:24:03,318
I didn't dare to take it out.

450
00:24:13,117 --> 00:24:14,477
Ms. Lian sewed this handkerchief

451
00:24:15,198 --> 00:24:16,277
for you before she was banished.

452
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,160
(Xin)

453
00:24:22,598 --> 00:24:23,237
(Once.)

454
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:24,718
(Even if it's just once,)

455
00:24:25,838 --> 00:24:26,838
have you ever missed me?

456
00:24:31,877 --> 00:24:33,637
I recall

457
00:24:35,598 --> 00:24:36,517
the pain you give me

458
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:39,598
every day

459
00:24:41,318 --> 00:24:43,117
so that I can remind myself

460
00:24:44,198 --> 00:24:45,357
every time.

461
00:24:47,198 --> 00:24:48,198
I'll never forget.

462
00:24:53,237 --> 00:24:55,477
I hate you

463
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:57,918
every day.

464
00:25:09,918 --> 00:25:10,357
(Girl.)

465
00:25:12,757 --> 00:25:14,477
(Do you really speak
against your heart?)

466
00:25:15,877 --> 00:25:17,477
Since you keep something in your heart,

467
00:25:18,237 --> 00:25:19,958
rather than speculating alone over here,

468
00:25:20,397 --> 00:25:21,798
why don't you go to that person

469
00:25:22,477 --> 00:25:23,678
and ask her directly?

470
00:25:27,877 --> 00:25:29,000
Go to sleep when you're tired.

471
00:25:31,517 --> 00:25:32,198
Ms. Lian.

472
00:25:32,637 --> 00:25:33,757
It's dark.

473
00:25:34,078 --> 00:25:35,117
Rest early.

474
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:36,718
It's fine.

475
00:25:36,718 --> 00:25:38,277
Just few more stitches to completion.

476
00:25:41,678 --> 00:25:42,277
Who is it?

477
00:25:42,718 --> 00:25:44,997
Mao Da and Mao Er.

478
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:51,397
It smells great. Is it ready?

479
00:25:51,838 --> 00:25:52,958
It's just done.

480
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:54,798
It's freshly stewed to warm you up.

481
00:25:56,038 --> 00:25:57,120
Thank you for thinking about me.

482
00:25:57,908 --> 00:25:58,880
You've come at the right time.

483
00:26:01,297 --> 00:26:02,240
These are for the two of you.

484
00:26:02,438 --> 00:26:03,757
What are these?

485
00:26:04,718 --> 00:26:06,318
The mansion received new wool.

486
00:26:06,997 --> 00:26:07,838
The weather gets cold.

487
00:26:08,357 --> 00:26:09,438
You often travel outside.

488
00:26:10,198 --> 00:26:12,117
Wear it close to your body.
It can keep your knees warm.

489
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,040
I'll serve you with the soup.

490
00:26:21,838 --> 00:26:23,798
We...

491
00:26:24,438 --> 00:26:26,438
We lost our parents since we're little.

492
00:26:27,397 --> 00:26:29,157
No one ever treats me

493
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:30,078
as good

494
00:26:30,718 --> 00:26:31,277
as you.

495
00:26:32,318 --> 00:26:33,237
You're nice to me.

496
00:26:33,637 --> 00:26:35,157
I surely keep you in mind.

497
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:37,958
That is how people are.

498
00:26:38,318 --> 00:26:39,237
One's family

499
00:26:39,918 --> 00:26:41,517
may not be as close as friends.

500
00:26:42,198 --> 00:26:42,678
Ms. Lian.

501
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:44,397
Drink it while it's warm.

502
00:26:46,477 --> 00:26:47,558
It smells so great.

503
00:26:55,877 --> 00:26:56,397
Hot.

504
00:26:57,078 --> 00:26:58,038
Blow it before you drink.

505
00:27:00,277 --> 00:27:00,997
Go back.

506
00:27:01,318 --> 00:27:01,838
Go back to rest.

507
00:27:02,918 --> 00:27:03,517
Try it.

508
00:27:12,357 --> 00:27:13,958
Ms. Lian, it smells great.

509
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:24,997
Ms. Lian.

510
00:27:25,997 --> 00:27:28,838
We're forced to poison you to death.

511
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:30,357
You mustn't

512
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,757
blame us after you go to hell.

513
00:27:34,397 --> 00:27:35,078
My heart...

514
00:27:39,318 --> 00:27:40,277
She's not dead?

515
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:41,157
No.

516
00:27:45,117 --> 00:27:46,277
(It's hard not to get suspicious,)

517
00:27:46,718 --> 00:27:47,997
(with your actions just now.)

518
00:27:48,318 --> 00:27:48,798
Hot.

519
00:27:55,997 --> 00:27:57,798
You're so cruel.

520
00:27:58,997 --> 00:28:00,720
Ms. Lian treated you well
over the last two years.

521
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:02,198
She saved everything for you,

522
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,480
not to mention the monetary reward
during Spring Festival.

523
00:28:04,598 --> 00:28:06,320
She even remembered
to give you auspicious tassels.

524
00:28:06,397 --> 00:28:09,237
She didn't look at the things
sent over by Mr. Lv

525
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:11,277
and she sewed kneelets for you,

526
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:12,438
but what about you?

527
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:15,558
Ms. Lian

528
00:28:15,918 --> 00:28:17,038
shouldn't have been kind to you.

529
00:28:17,277 --> 00:28:17,798
Dongli!

530
00:28:20,877 --> 00:28:21,438
Stop talking.

531
00:28:23,838 --> 00:28:24,318
Ms. Lian.

532
00:28:25,718 --> 00:28:26,637
We know

533
00:28:26,637 --> 00:28:27,678
you're kind to us.

534
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:29,798
We swore before

535
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:30,920
that we wouldn't sell you out

536
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,117
no matter how much money was offered,
but this time, it's different.

537
00:28:33,117 --> 00:28:34,237
It has nothing to do with money.

538
00:28:34,637 --> 00:28:35,997
Our lives matter.

539
00:28:36,318 --> 00:28:36,918
Who was it?

540
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:38,718
Who threatened you?

541
00:28:44,397 --> 00:28:47,198
We swore

542
00:28:47,918 --> 00:28:49,438
we wouldn't sell you out anymore.

543
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:50,397
Today,

544
00:28:51,277 --> 00:28:53,038
I'll tell you who it is.

545
00:28:53,718 --> 00:28:54,198
He is...

546
00:28:56,237 --> 00:28:56,838
Ma Da!

547
00:28:57,637 --> 00:28:58,078
Ma Da!

548
00:28:58,157 --> 00:28:58,678
Ms. Lian!

549
00:28:59,157 --> 00:28:59,798
Ma Da!

550
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:01,877
Ma Da, wake up!

551
00:29:02,318 --> 00:29:02,757
Why?

552
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,670
Are you assaulting us
after you failed to poison me?

553
00:29:22,517 --> 00:29:22,997
Mao Er!

554
00:29:33,798 --> 00:29:34,277
Mr. Lv.

555
00:29:37,517 --> 00:29:38,517
Mao Er.

556
00:29:40,277 --> 00:29:43,237
Nan Ruzhen.

557
00:29:48,678 --> 00:29:49,117
Mao Er.

558
00:30:00,918 --> 00:30:01,718
Nan Ruzhen.

559
00:30:04,877 --> 00:30:06,038
Thank you.

560
00:30:07,517 --> 00:30:09,237
Thank you for reminding me.

561
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:11,397
Although you've escaped this time,

562
00:30:12,037 --> 00:30:13,840
it won't lucky for you
to survive the crisis everytime.

563
00:30:14,877 --> 00:30:15,798
If Nan Ruzhen knows

564
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:16,880
the assassination failed,

565
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,918
she'll go even further.

566
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:23,678
Dongli and Li Tang.

567
00:30:24,438 --> 00:30:25,038
Yes.

568
00:30:25,477 --> 00:30:26,798
It's time to go back.

569
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:34,038
Young Master!

570
00:30:34,757 --> 00:30:37,040
Young Master.
We've received an urgent report.

571
00:30:37,237 --> 00:30:39,357
The southern courtyard
was broken in last night.

572
00:30:40,237 --> 00:30:40,918
What about her?

573
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:41,517
How is she doing?

574
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:42,718
The details are unclear.

575
00:30:43,357 --> 00:30:44,078
I only heard...

576
00:30:44,997 --> 00:30:45,877
Yes?

577
00:30:46,117 --> 00:30:48,157
I only heard that the robbers
fought with the guards.

578
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:49,718
They all died.

579
00:30:57,757 --> 00:30:58,198
Girl!

580
00:31:21,318 --> 00:31:22,598
Madam, it's time for the meal.

581
00:31:23,517 --> 00:31:24,318
Not now.

582
00:31:26,157 --> 00:31:27,117
I want to wait for Lianxin.

583
00:31:29,198 --> 00:31:30,198
I want him to see

584
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:32,198
my best look as soon as he comes back.

585
00:31:34,678 --> 00:31:35,397
Where is my hairpin?

586
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:38,117
My jade hairpin.

587
00:31:38,117 --> 00:31:38,598
Where is it?

588
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:40,798
You're wearing it.

589
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:45,357
My poor memory.

590
00:31:46,397 --> 00:31:46,958
Do I look good?

591
00:31:47,357 --> 00:31:47,877
Yes.

592
00:31:48,078 --> 00:31:49,277
You're a great beauty.

593
00:31:49,277 --> 00:31:50,318
Anything is nice on you.

594
00:31:51,237 --> 00:31:51,718
You're clever.

595
00:31:57,598 --> 00:31:58,997
Ms. Lian has been confused for some time.

596
00:32:00,078 --> 00:32:01,360
She could recognise people at first,

597
00:32:01,718 --> 00:32:04,997
but not anymore
after she was frightened last night.

598
00:32:05,277 --> 00:32:06,237
Why did no one tell me

599
00:32:06,237 --> 00:32:07,718
about what happened?

600
00:32:10,237 --> 00:32:13,038
Ms. Lian was a servant-concubine
who is banished.

601
00:32:13,318 --> 00:32:13,958
No one else

602
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:15,038
would dare to disturb you.

603
00:32:16,078 --> 00:32:16,838
I'm, however,

604
00:32:16,838 --> 00:32:17,760
thankful to those robbers.

605
00:32:18,198 --> 00:32:19,598
Hadn't they killed anyone at the courtyard,

606
00:32:20,078 --> 00:32:21,517
you wouldn't have appeared.

607
00:32:24,078 --> 00:32:24,757
Ms. Lian.

608
00:32:25,357 --> 00:32:25,718
Ms. Lian.

609
00:32:25,718 --> 00:32:27,400
- Don't catch me.
- Stop running. Be careful.

610
00:32:32,157 --> 00:32:33,157
Su Nanchun?

611
00:32:34,397 --> 00:32:34,877
Let me do it.

612
00:32:36,517 --> 00:32:37,997
Su Nanchun knows how to comb one's hair?

613
00:32:38,237 --> 00:32:40,397
Ms. Lian, it's Young Master Xin.

614
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:43,237
Leave us.

615
00:32:43,237 --> 00:32:44,038
Not Young Master Xin.

616
00:32:45,517 --> 00:32:46,757
He is Su Nanchun.

617
00:32:49,397 --> 00:32:50,798
Young Master Xin doesn't want me anymore.

618
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:53,757
He doesn't want me and the child.

619
00:32:58,157 --> 00:32:58,997
Young Master Xin...

620
00:33:00,997 --> 00:33:02,157
Why wouldn't he want you?

621
00:33:03,078 --> 00:33:04,718
He sent Su Nanchun

622
00:33:05,318 --> 00:33:06,198
over to serve,

623
00:33:06,838 --> 00:33:07,718
accompany you,

624
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:10,877
wash your face

625
00:33:12,477 --> 00:33:13,277
and comb your hair.

626
00:33:16,997 --> 00:33:17,558
Really?

627
00:33:18,517 --> 00:33:19,517
He sent you over?

628
00:33:21,838 --> 00:33:22,397
It's true.

629
00:33:24,198 --> 00:33:24,798
Yes.

630
00:33:27,558 --> 00:33:28,838
He sent me over.

for not coming to see you.

00:33:39,598 --> 00:33:40,598
Sometimes,

636
00:33:42,357 --> 00:33:43,918
it's because of his pride.

637
00:33:45,078 --> 00:33:46,517
Sometimes it was jealousy.

638
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,357

he missed you very much.

How did you

651
00:34:26,717 --> 00:34:27,598
get hurt here?

652
00:34:27,717 --> 00:34:28,620
How did you hurt yourself?

653
00:34:29,798 --> 00:34:30,997
How? Let me see.

654
00:34:32,957 --> 00:34:35,158
It's this. Remove it.

No.

656
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:44,917
Girl.

657
00:34:46,477 --> 00:34:47,677
It's easy to get hurt now.

658
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:50,997
Stop wearing jewellery, okay?

659
00:34:51,638 --> 00:34:52,437
No.

660
00:34:52,638 --> 00:34:54,318
Young Master gave this to me.

661
00:35:01,197 --> 00:35:03,078
Please don't take it away,

662
00:35:03,078 --> 00:35:03,957
okay?

663
00:35:17,197 --> 00:35:17,957
Sorry.

664
00:35:28,118 --> 00:35:28,757
Sorry.

665
00:35:45,917 --> 00:35:46,437
Madam.

666
00:35:48,517 --> 00:35:49,558
Young Master Xin has left.

667
00:35:52,158 --> 00:35:52,917
Madam.

668
00:35:55,277 --> 00:35:56,318
He will come.

669
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:00,558
He still loves me.

670
00:36:05,757 --> 00:36:06,677
He wouldn't

671
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:09,358
let me wait for nothing.

672
00:36:11,798 --> 00:36:12,757
He also wouldn't

673
00:36:15,477 --> 00:36:17,358
hurt my heart again and again.

674
00:36:24,277 --> 00:36:24,717
Ruhua.

675
00:36:27,598 --> 00:36:28,358
Do you remember

676
00:36:30,237 --> 00:36:34,957
for whom he kept me waiting last time?

677
00:36:42,318 --> 00:36:44,038
Young Master, everything has been loaded.

678
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:46,917
Set off!

679
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,640
(General Xin's Mansion)

680
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,900
(Baoji Clinic)

681
00:37:45,158 --> 00:37:45,598
Ms. Lian.

682
00:37:46,734 --> 00:37:48,480
Young Master Xin sent Su Nanchun
to pass a message.

683
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,638
He would leave Quliang
on a business trip for a few days.

684
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:51,960
He might not make it here.

685
00:37:52,959 --> 00:37:54,279
Tell Su Nanchun

686
00:37:54,678 --> 00:37:55,560
I've run out of medicine,

687
00:37:56,198 --> 00:37:57,799
and Young Master may make another trip.

688
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:00,999
Ms. Lian.

689
00:38:01,759 --> 00:38:02,358
Young Master

690
00:38:02,678 --> 00:38:03,878
can't leave in this case.

691
00:38:04,598 --> 00:38:05,118
I know.

692
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:08,878
He hasn't been working

693
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:09,959
for the prince

694
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:11,239
because of your illness.

695
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:13,438
I know.

696
00:38:13,678 --> 00:38:14,559
Just do it.

697
00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:17,198
Noted.

698
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:30,079
After the heir is deposed,

699
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:34,039
the young masters

700
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:36,118
are busy working

701
00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:37,799
for the inheritance.

702
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:41,918
Lianxin and Lianxiu
had the highest hope at first,

703
00:38:42,678 --> 00:38:46,559
but Lianxin has been holding back for you.

704
00:38:47,198 --> 00:38:48,959
Sure. Let Young Master Xiu
have an advantage.

705
00:38:51,918 --> 00:38:53,198
What else could he do?

706
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:56,598
Lianxiu has won the favour
of half the population in Quliang.

707
00:38:57,198 --> 00:38:58,759
Even the prince and officials

708
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:00,279
compliment him.

709
00:39:01,198 --> 00:39:01,959
You're wrong.

710
00:39:02,598 --> 00:39:03,678
The prince and officials

711
00:39:04,198 --> 00:39:06,198
won't compliment him simultaneously.

712
00:39:06,438 --> 00:39:07,719
Yao, you...

713
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:09,598
Lianxin asked to resign again?

714
00:39:09,918 --> 00:39:10,358
Yes.

715
00:39:11,438 --> 00:39:12,880
He wanted to get medicine for Ms. Lian.

716
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,279
He refused to leave Quliang.

717
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:19,799
Good.

718
00:39:21,118 --> 00:39:21,678
Very well.

719
00:39:23,759 --> 00:39:25,358
I plan to appeal to my father.

720
00:39:27,279 --> 00:39:27,878
Surprisingly,

721
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:30,878
Lianxin receives the job
coveted by many people

722
00:39:30,878 --> 00:39:31,799
over half a year,

723
00:39:32,279 --> 00:39:33,878
but he let go of it.

724
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:37,039
Luo Qinglian

725
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:38,918
got crazy at the right time.

726
00:39:39,638 --> 00:39:40,678
Do you think

727
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:42,118
that's really great?

728
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:44,239
The death anniversary

729
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:45,840
of the late princess consort
is a few days away.

730
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:47,770
The prince wants
to pay his respects in person.

731
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:50,918
He'll be accompanied by Young Master Xin
if you aren't in Quliang.

732
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:53,719
Let it be.

733
00:39:54,638 --> 00:39:55,880
The heir has been deposed anyway.

734
00:39:56,118 --> 00:39:57,040
The late princess consort

735
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,279
isn't as important as before.

736
00:39:59,638 --> 00:40:00,719
Luo Qinglian.

737
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:03,239
I thought she was
a stumbling block last time.

738
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:06,198
Surprisingly, she is a ladder to me.

739
00:40:08,479 --> 00:40:08,838
Come on.

740
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,520
Get some fresh air
with me at the garden.

741
00:40:15,158 --> 00:40:16,600
(You've made Young Master Xin stay again.)

742
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:19,118
Since someone else wants to do it,

743
00:40:19,678 --> 00:40:20,759
I should let him.

744
00:40:20,959 --> 00:40:21,398
Lian'er.

745
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:24,079
The heir was deposed too soon.

746
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:26,398
He Lianxin is still fledging.

747
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,198
The foundation he built in hardships

748
00:40:28,878 --> 00:40:29,838
has left with almost nothing

749
00:40:30,118 --> 00:40:31,559
over half the year.

750
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:33,519
Why do you want to do this?

751
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:35,479
You'll find out soon.

752
00:40:35,999 --> 00:40:36,918
Success or failure

753
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:38,438
depends on this time.

754
00:40:42,158 --> 00:40:42,719
(Lian'er.)

755
00:40:43,759 --> 00:40:44,878
(What are you)

756
00:40:45,398 --> 00:40:46,279
(plotting?)

757
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,240
(Secondary Courtyard)

758
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,598
Come down, Ms. Lian!

759
00:40:54,279 --> 00:40:54,638
Ms. Lian!

760
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:56,719
It's no joke if you fall.

761
00:40:57,279 --> 00:40:57,959
What is she doing?

762
00:40:58,678 --> 00:40:59,198
Young Master.

763
00:40:59,398 --> 00:41:00,320
You're here just in time.

764
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:02,239
Ms. Lian called herself a bird

765
00:41:02,398 --> 00:41:03,838
since she got up in the morning.

766
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,920
She insisted that she should
fly up to the rooftop.

767
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,398
A bird?

768
00:41:07,438 --> 00:41:08,598
She does have many ideas.

769
00:41:08,678 --> 00:41:09,999
Hurry and think of a way.

770
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:12,279
Fine.

771
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:13,918
Girl.

772
00:41:14,959 --> 00:41:16,279
You mustn't jump down.

773
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:17,918
We're birds,

774
00:41:17,918 --> 00:41:19,638
but our wings

775
00:41:19,638 --> 00:41:20,559
aren't as useful

776
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:21,279
as before.

777
00:41:21,638 --> 00:41:22,559
You can't jump.

778
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:23,878
We?

779
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:27,158
