17
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:55,630
No wonder you're reluctant.

18
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,950
You have two additional family members.

19
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,469
Two chubby grandsons.

20
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:09,030
I really like them.

21
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:11,990
Did you capture my family?

22
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:16,629
How can a noble prince like you
use my family to pressure me?

23
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,850
I've already settled them down
in a new home.

24
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,180
The person who threatens you
will never find them.

25
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,950
I'll only give you one chance.

26
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,709
Do you want to die here

27
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,629
or reunite with your family?

28
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,509
Your choice.

29
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,509
Your Highness,

30
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:41,709
I think he wants to die here.

31
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,030
Let me send him, then.

32
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:49,190
Wait.

33
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:55,670
I'll confess.

34
00:02:56,789 --> 00:02:59,149
I want to reunite with my family.

35
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,709
Good.

36
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,629
We were just following

37
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,910
the chief shopkeeper's orders.

38
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:14,509
The chief shopkeeper forced us
to extort money ruthlessly.

39
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:15,670
We had no choice

40
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,550
but to impose heavy taxes.

41
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:19,429
Why did you let him coerce you?

42
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,910
We were briefly misguided
and made some mistakes.

43
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:27,190
Somehow, the chief shopkeeper
got hold of the evidence

44
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:29,229
and forced us to write confessions.

45
00:03:29,869 --> 00:03:31,830
We know we committed serious crimes

46
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,390
that could implicate our families.

47
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,709
So when things happen,

48
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,509
we would rather die

49
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,190
than betray the chief shopkeeper
for fear the evidence will get out.

50
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,180
Who's the chief shopkeeper?

51
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,910
It's...

52
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:55,950
What's wrong?

53
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,429
The food is poisoned.

54
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,470
Yan!

55
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:01,589
Yan!

56
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,030
Miss Yan, what's the matter?

57
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,060
Miss Yan, are you all right?

58
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:05,670
Yan, open your eyes.

59
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:07,830
- Wake up.
- Wake up, Miss Yan.

60
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:22,090
Your Highness,

61
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,509
I prepared this meal myself

62
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,830
and Yao delivered it.

63
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:27,189
But

64
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:28,670
we didn't poison the meal.

65
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:31,150
This meal has never passed
through other hands.

66
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,470
Even when I wanted to help out,
the maid refused.

67
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,189
Now that I think about it,

68
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,710
it was indeed suspicious.

69
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:38,670
I cooked the meal myself.

70
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,500
Won't it be foolish of me
to poison it myself?

71
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,590
Yao,

72
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,670
in particular was entrusted by me unexpectedly.

73
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,990
She didn't even have the chance.

74
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,430
Lack of preparation
doesn't mean it's impossible.

75
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,070
You can vouch for yourself,

76
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,390
but can you vouch for others?

77
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,670
You forcefully point the accusations

78
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,430
directly at me.

79
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,229
Let me ask you this.

80
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,560
I have no grudge against Official Zheng.

81
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,950
Why would I kill him?

82
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:06,870
Report!

83
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,270
Your Highness, there's someone outside requesting
an audience.

84
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,270
She claims to be Official Zheng's family.

85
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:18,390
Bring her in.

86
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,390
Yes.

87
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,509
Your Highness,

88
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,590
my husband

89
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:40,749
was harmed by traitors

90
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,229
and died unjustly.

91
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,029
Madam, rest assured.

92
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:47,509
I'll definitely uncover the truth

93
00:05:48,309 --> 00:05:49,270
and give you justice.

94
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,270
I know who did it.

95
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,710
Madam Yao,

96
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,270
my husband had served you faithfully
for a long time.

97
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:05,550
Why did you kill him?

98
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:08,110
You're so heartless,

99
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,110
the chief shopkeeper.

100
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:17,590
Who are you?

101
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:19,670
I've never seen you before.

102
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:21,550
Of course, you have.

103
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:23,870
That day, I accompanied my husband

104
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,710
to Langyue Hall

105
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:27,710
to deliver a confession letter to you.

106
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,590
Don't you remember?

107
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,870
What confession letter?

108
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:32,270
I've never received

109
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,309
a confession letter.

110
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:35,670
Your Highness,

111
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,150
don't listen
to this mad woman's nonsense.

112
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:39,909
You must not believe her.

113
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,550
I wasn't talking nonsense.

114
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:42,670
That day,

115
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:45,469
you met us in the bedroom.

116
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,990
The confession letter

117
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,749
was placed in a cabinet
next to the dressing table,

118
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,150
in a mahogany box.

119
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,390
I will never forget it even if I die.

120
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,749
There is indeed a cabinet next to
the dressing table at Langyue Hall.

121
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:00,229
If she hadn't been there,

122
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:01,670
how did she know so clearly?

123
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:08,830
Su Nanchun.

124
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,909
Yes, Your Highness.

125
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:10,749
Take a look.

126
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,189
Yes.

127
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,430
Eunuch Su.

128
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,229
- Eunuch Su.
- What are you...

129
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:14,830
Search.

130
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:15,309
Yes.

131
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,349
Eunuch Sun.

132
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:36,888
(Confession letter)

133
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:45,264
(Confession letter)

134
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,550
It's a confession letter.

135
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:13,189
Your Highness,

136
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,950
this isn't the truth.

137
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,150
Someone must be trying to frame me.

138
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:28,029
Your Highness, I've been fully supporting
the new policies.

139
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:30,950
How could my sister
be the chief shopkeeper?

140
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,670
Please judge wisely, Your Highness.

141
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,550
Your Highness,

142
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,150
I swear on my life

143
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,950
that Yao didn't do it.

144
00:08:36,989 --> 00:08:38,520
Haiyao
has been seriously ill recently.

145
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,270
If she suffers
such an unjust accusation,

146
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,930
her condition will worsen,
Your Highness.

147
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,989
Confine Mu Haiyao temporarily.

148
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:58,030
Investigate this case thoroughly.

149
00:09:16,109 --> 00:09:16,869
Yao.

150
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:21,509
Yao.

151
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,509
Your Highness, please help Yao.

152
00:09:39,869 --> 00:09:40,710
She's definitely

153
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,790
not Official Zheng's killer.

154
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,270
She is also not the chief shopkeeper.

155
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:44,590
Please believe Yao

156
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,590
and believe me.

157
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:50,189
When did I say I don't believe you?

158
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,509
Get up.

159
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:54,910
Do you believe Yao is not the killer?

160
00:09:55,109 --> 00:09:55,470
Sit.

161
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:02,549
Although Haiyao is arrogant,

162
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,350
she would never harm me.

163
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,650
But the mastermind had plotted

164
00:10:07,669 --> 00:10:08,710
this meticulously.

165
00:10:09,429 --> 00:10:12,830
With Official Zheng dead,
all the clues are cut off.

166
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,629
How can we investigate further?

167
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,870
No need to investigate.

168
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,109
I know who did it.

169
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,030
It's Fang Huairui.

170
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:24,030
It's not her.

171
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:25,710
Do you think

172
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,070
I said it out of personal vendetta?

173
00:10:27,749 --> 00:10:28,710
Or

174
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:30,660
do you still fear the Fang family?

175
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:33,270
It's not her.

176
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,230
Then who else could it be?

177
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,170
Who else was trying to gain advantage

178
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,390
when Official Zheng
first entered the mansion?

179
00:10:39,749 --> 00:10:41,150
Who else could bribe

180
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,390
Official Zheng's family to lie?

181
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,540
Who else could force
those officials to commit suicide?

182
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:45,109
Wealth.

183
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,470
Because of wealth.

184
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,770
When the officials committed suicide,

185
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,640
the first person I suspected
was Fang Huairui.

186
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,429
That night, I ordered
the investigation bureau

187
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:55,069
to discreetly look into
the entire Fang family.

188
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,109
But do you know

189
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,109
how much wealth remains
in the Fang family?

190
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:04,069
And do you have any idea
how much money those officials,

191
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,390
who committed suicide

192
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,950
had extorted and pillaged
over the years?

193
00:11:08,749 --> 00:11:09,150
Qinglian,

194
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,910
no one wants to uncover

195
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:14,869
the mastermind harming Quliang
more than I do.

196
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:16,350
But that person

197
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,350
is definitely not Fang Huairui.

198
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:39,950
Ruhua,

199
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,270
do I look beautiful?

200
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,109
You're the most beautiful.

201
00:11:56,109 --> 00:11:56,830
Yao.

202
00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:01,429
You're here.

203
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,509
Ruhua,

204
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:05,270
please leave us.

205
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:08,309
I wish to speak to Consort Lian.

206
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:09,509
Yes, Madam.

207
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,549
It was my oversight

208
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,270
that implicated you.

209
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:25,509
Please put your health first.

210
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,189
It's not your fault.

211
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:32,530
There's only one thing

212
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:35,830
to be blamed.

213
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:40,509
If it weren't for you,

214
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,270
I would have given up

215
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:45,790
on life long ago.

216
00:12:48,189 --> 00:12:48,989
You made me

217
00:12:48,989 --> 00:12:50,309
want to live again.

218
00:12:53,869 --> 00:12:55,390
"Bamboo chair adorned with green vines,

219
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:58,189
a delicate silk fan, and a cup of tea."

220
00:13:12,109 --> 00:13:12,950
Luo Qinglian,

221
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:17,590
I'm afraid I won't have the chance

222
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:20,390
to reminisce

223
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,710
about the old days together.

224
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,350
Of course, you can.

225
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,429
You'll recover.

226
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,150
You'll definitely recover.

227
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:43,230
I know

228
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:46,429
the condition of my health.

229
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:51,069
It's such

230
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,150
an exhausting life.

231
00:13:56,429 --> 00:13:57,230
Too exhausting.

232
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:04,629
I can't hang on any longer.

233
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:11,910
Yao.

234
00:14:22,869 --> 00:14:24,950
Madam, His Highness is here to see you.

235
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,189
No.

236
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:42,549
I don't want to see him.

237
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,109
Yes, Madam.

238
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,069
You've misunderstood His Highness.

239
00:14:55,869 --> 00:14:58,270
He has never suspected you.

240
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,869
Even if he punishes you,

241
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:03,470
he has no choice but to do it.

242
00:15:08,989 --> 00:15:10,549
Do you think I'm blaming him?

243
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,069
He's the man

244
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,520
I've loved the most in my life.

245
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,950
Even if I hate myself,

246
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:21,910
I still won't blame him.

247
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:26,030
Besides,

248
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,869
since that day

249
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,429
I accidentally killed Hui'er,

250
00:15:38,989 --> 00:15:40,390
what right do I have

251
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,509
to receive his kindness?

252
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,189
Was it an accident?

253
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,429
Yao, didn't you...

254
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,429
Didn't what?

255
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,590
Didn't I kill Hui'er on purpose

256
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,309
and frame you?

257
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,749
Of course, not.

258
00:15:59,109 --> 00:16:00,470
I love His Highness so much.

259
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,830
How could I

260
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,910
kill his son?

261
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:06,509
That day, I just...

262
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,830
I just gave a little push.

263
00:16:14,989 --> 00:16:16,429
I... I just gave a light push...

264
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,989
It's heaven's will.

265
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,390
Everything is heaven's will.

266
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:34,070
My instinct told me

267
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,869
you didn't seem like someone
who would harm a child.

268
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,270
For so many years,

269
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,109
His Highness has hated you
for so many years.

270
00:16:45,989 --> 00:16:47,710
I'll go and tell him now.

271
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,309
No need.

272
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,150
What difference does it make
if it was deliberately done or not?

273
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,150
Can everything go back to how it was?

274
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:04,950
His Highness

275
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,989
is the one you love all your life.

276
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,350
Are you

277
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:11,830
really not going to see him?

278
00:17:14,389 --> 00:17:15,350
I do want to see him.

279
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:20,950
I think about it day and night,

280
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:24,389
in the absence of the moon,

281
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,230
when the snow falls.

282
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,309
Even when I hate him,

283
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,630
I still want to see him.

284
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,950
But what I want to see the most

285
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,549
is who he was twenty years ago,

286
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:50,630
the one who only had eyes for me.

287
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:23,590
"A fine crimson silk-akin to the skin
that is as cold and sparkling as ice.

288
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,789
Snowy, smooth, and fragrant.

289
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:39,350
Smiling and talking to the charming man.

290
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:48,029
Tonight will be
a peaceful night's rest."

291
00:19:46,321 --> 00:19:54,366
(Langyue Hall)

292
00:20:54,391 --> 00:20:57,653
(Langyue Hall)

293
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:18,641
(Langyue Hall)

294
00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:50,549
Shen Jingyan really helped me this time.

295
00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:53,269
I need to reward her well.

296
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,189
Send that chest

297
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,269
of silver over tonight.

298
00:21:59,189 --> 00:21:59,789
Yes, Madam.

299
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:02,429
But what did she do to help?

300
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:05,069
Of course, it's about Mu Tianshu.

301
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,830
Mu Haiyao's death

302
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,110
is a blow to him.

303
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,309
He'll surely turn against His Highness

304
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:12,830
and try to stop the new policies.

305
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,269
You can say I've returned

306
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,110
Fang Huairui's favor
through this incident.

307
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,189
We shall see how things unfold.

308
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,789
Things in Quliang

309
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:28,990
are about to change.

310
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,940
(Prince An's Mansion)

311
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:44,350
(Prince An's Mansion)
Next time, don't cook so much.

312
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,750
It's wasteful when we can't finish.

313
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,899
You're working hard
in drafting the details

314
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,550
and are a great contributor
to the new policies.

315
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,510
Naturally, you deserve
some good rewards.

316
00:22:55,269 --> 00:22:56,389
Then, don't bring liquor.

317
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,909
If others saw it,

318
00:22:58,429 --> 00:22:59,789
they'd think I'm a heavy drinker.

319
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,389
If you were not a heavy drinker,

320
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,230
how would we be here today?

321
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,590
Back then, you fought like a fierce lion

322
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,950
just for a jar of liquor.

323
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,790
You were scarier than the people outside
who wanted to kill me.

324
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,669
Yuanxue,

325
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,309
I've never treated you well.

326
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:24,590
Only a silly girl like you

327
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:26,630
would give up everything

328
00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:28,149
to be with me.

329
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,110
Whether you treat me well or not,

330
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,830
I'm the only one in this world
who can judge.

331
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,630
Besides,

332
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:38,350
only willingness

333
00:23:39,189 --> 00:23:41,750
makes no sense at all in this world.

334
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,870
Even if I endure a lot of grievances,

335
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,650
I would not want to miss out on the person

336
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,750
who has left
a lasting impression on me.

337
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,750
I'm not talking
about you and Luo Qinglian.

338
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:00,510
I...

339
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:01,830
The lasting impression

340
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,789
is no match for being together
day and night.

341
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,350
Yuanxue,

342
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,149
you've been there to support me

343
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:17,950
and face hardships with me for years.

344
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:21,510
Do you really think

345
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,510
I have no feelings?

346
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:27,789
Wait for me.

347
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,389
Once the new policies are implemented

348
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,970
and my outcast status removed,

349
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:33,110
I, Lv Beiyi,

350
00:24:34,269 --> 00:24:35,710
will marry you with honor.

351
00:25:09,069 --> 00:25:10,510
"Married to be husband and wife,

352
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,450
devoted to each other
without suspicion,

353
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:14,389
joyful occasion in the evening,

354
00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:17,189
charming and elegant
at the opportune time."

355
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,970
When Yao first entered
Young Master's Mansion,

356
00:25:21,069 --> 00:25:22,189
she probably thought

357
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,149
it was the rest of her life.

358
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:26,389
She killed Hui'er by accident,

359
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,630
and I've given her years of pain.

360
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,110
Now everything is over.

361
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:37,309
Ruhua. Xu Liangchuan.

362
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,470
Issue my order.

363
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:41,309
Every furnishing

364
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,669
at Langyue Hall

365
00:25:43,389 --> 00:25:45,950
will remain the same and never change.

366
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:47,789
In the future,

367
00:25:48,669 --> 00:25:50,389
I'll come often

368
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:52,950
and spend more time with her.

369
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,120
Yes, Your Highness.

370
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:00,630
(Yao,)

371
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,750
(may you find true love
in your next life)

372
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:06,800
(and stay together until old age.)

373
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,189
If Madam in heaven knows

374
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,470
His Highness's devotion to her,

375
00:26:27,389 --> 00:26:28,669
she'll be pleased.

376
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:31,630
How about we...

377
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,350
No.

378
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,069
Was it good intention

379
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,750
or guilt?

380
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:45,950
Poor Yao for she carried injustice
until her last breath.

381
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:48,069
Rest assured.

382
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,360
I will thoroughly investigate
the cause of Official Zheng's death

383
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:52,990
and clear her name.

384
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:55,230
There's one thing

385
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,350
I've never understood.

386
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,970
It's understandable that the chief shopkeeper
wanted to kill Official Zheng.

387
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,789
But why go to such lengths

388
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,029
to lure me away

389
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:06,029
and then frame Yao?

390
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,120
What's the reason behind all this?

391
00:27:12,189 --> 00:27:13,069
Could it be...

392
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,029
Mu Tianshu?

393
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:18,230
Your Highness!

394
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,510
Your Highness, please come quickly.

395
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,990
Official Mu just led his soldiers
and barged into Qingkang Hall

396
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,149
to burn the new policies.

397
00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:35,549
Your Highness.
Something bad has happened.

398
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,990
Mu Tianshu is making a scene
at Qingkang Hall.

399
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,270
I'm afraid Lv Beiyi might be in danger.

400
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,470
Your Highness!

401
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,590
You can't do this.

402
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,830
These are the new policies.

403
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,669
If you burn them,
there would be none left.

404
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:50,389
Official Mu.

405
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,269
Official Lv, you're finally here.

406
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,069
Official Mu,

407
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,750
what are you doing?

408
00:28:00,189 --> 00:28:01,429
What do you think I'm doing?

409
00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:07,230
Official Mu,

410
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,750
I know you're grieving
about your younger sister.

411
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,980
But you can't drag state affairs

412
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,909
into family matters.

413
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,170
We both know the new policies
are beneficial.

414
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,170
How can you jeopardize
the future of Quliang

415
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:21,710
for personal grievances?

416
00:28:27,149 --> 00:28:28,710
Quliang belongs to the He family.

417
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:32,710
It has nothing to do with me!

418
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,710
Official Mu.

419
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:35,870
Speak no more!

420
00:28:36,189 --> 00:28:37,350
I, Mu Tianshu,

421
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,590
have followed His Highness
for many years.

422
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:42,160
I've been dedicated and loyal to him
without a single complaint.

423
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:43,590
To implement the new policies,

424
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:45,750
I went against the officials in Quliang.

425
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:47,630
I even cut ties

426
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,110
with my old subordinates.

427
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,270
But, my sister ended up being accused
as the chief shopkeeper.

428
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,189
Poor Haiyao

429
00:28:55,189 --> 00:28:56,590
for ending up in such a fate

430
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,400
despite her sincere devotion
to His Highness.

431
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:04,230
This is His Highness's repayment
to my Mu family.

432
00:29:06,669 --> 00:29:07,350
Burn them!

433
00:29:08,069 --> 00:29:08,630
Official Mu.

434
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:11,590
Lv Beiyi,

435
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,210
are you sure you want to get in my way?

436
00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:17,309
I have endured humiliation
for many years,

437
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:19,189
all for this day.

438
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,240
I swear to defend the new policies
to the death.

439
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,350
Fine.

440
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,470
Anyone who gets in my way

441
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,429
will die without mercy!

442
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,269
Beiyi!

443
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:28,710
Yuanxue!

444
00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:37,350
Hang in there.

445
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:38,750
Hang in there, Yuanxue.

446
00:30:39,069 --> 00:30:39,750
I can save you.

447
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:41,770
I can definitely save you.

448
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,470
Beiyi,

449
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:50,230
don't waste your effort.

450
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,189
I can't make it.

451
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:02,510
I don't want to go anywhere.

452
00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:05,590
Just let me...

453
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,789
Let me stay in your embrace.

454
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:11,830
Can I?

455
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,230
Yuanxue.

456
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,389
Your embrace is warm.

457
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,549
It's so warm.

458
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:32,909
It's been over a decade.

459
00:31:35,149 --> 00:31:36,189
I thought

460
00:31:38,189 --> 00:31:39,230
I would

461
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,189
never see this day.

462
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,909
I'm very happy.

463
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:53,710
I truly...

464
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,870
I truly am happy.

465
00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:05,389
Beiyi,

466
00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:08,549
would you marry me

467
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,189
if there's another life?

468
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,549
I, Lv Beiyi,

469
00:32:21,429 --> 00:32:23,830
will take Yuanxue as my wife
at this moment.

470
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,429
In this life

471
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:27,189
and the next,

472
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,080
we shall never let each other down.

473
00:32:30,309 --> 00:32:31,029
In the next life?

474
00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:36,510
If there is one.

475
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,669
Luo Qinglian once said,

476
00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:49,510
there will come a day

477
00:32:50,909 --> 00:32:52,389
when my patience will pay off.

478
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,189
But I never expected it

479
00:33:00,189 --> 00:33:01,590
to be not

480
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,230
what I had hoped

481
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:11,870
when that happened.

482
00:33:53,149 --> 00:33:54,110
Yuanxue.

483
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,590
(Can you)

484
00:33:57,549 --> 00:33:59,110
(please take me somewhere?)

485
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:01,669
To rise with the sun,

486
00:34:02,389 --> 00:34:03,510
to rest with the sunset,

487
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,269
simple meals,

488
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:06,950
(and mutual support.)

489
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,269
(Your pain today)

490
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,870
(is not from your circumstances.)

491
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,349
(But from losing your dignity.)

492
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,270
(Yet, the way you've chosen to live)

493
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,470
(is to discard the last trace
of your dignity)

494
00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:20,109
(yourself.)

495
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:23,429
(I only wanted to come
to this small courtyard of yours.)

496
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,869
(I truly wanted to be willful for once.)

497
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,310
(As long as you agree to marry me.)

498
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,149
(Even if it means enduring hardships)

499
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:32,270
and eating plain meals,

500
00:34:34,829 --> 00:34:36,470
I'm content

501
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,109
as long as I can be with you.

502
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:39,909
Whether you treat me well or not,

503
00:34:41,149 --> 00:34:43,950
I'm the only one in this world
who can judge.

504
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,829
(Even if I endure a lot of grievances,)

505
00:34:47,589 --> 00:34:48,909
(I would not want to miss out on)

506
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:51,270
(the person who has left
a lasting impression on me.)

507
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,070
(Register)
These officials are in Lianxiu's faction

508
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:17,510
(Register)

509
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,260
(Register)
while these are with Mu Tianshu.

510
00:35:19,669 --> 00:35:20,710
On top of those

511
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,790
who resent the new policies,

512
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:24,030
it's already more than half
of Quliang's officials.

513
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:25,510
With Yuanxue's death,

514
00:35:25,909 --> 00:35:26,909
everything is in place.

515
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:30,629
We only have to wait for Lianxin's order
to execute Mu Tianshu.

516
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,770
You've worked hard, Lianzhi.

517
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,570
It was Lianxin who wanted to implement
the new policy

518
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:36,869
and handed

519
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:38,470
the opportunity to us.

520
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:44,109
So, don't blame us.

521
00:35:48,149 --> 00:35:49,589
What's wrong with the new policies?

522
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:54,869
What's wrong

523
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,310
did Lianxin do?

524
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:05,669
Zhimei,

525
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:08,950
I've stood by Lianxiu's side
for many years.

526
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,030
Please forgive me

527
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,550
for I can't take part in this anymore.

528
00:36:20,629 --> 00:36:21,189
Lianzuo,

529
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,950
are you going to betray Lianxiu?

530
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:27,950
Lianzuo!

531
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,510
Do you think I know nothing?

532
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,870
On the day Father passed down the title,

533
00:36:33,629 --> 00:36:35,030
you released Lianxin.

534
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,230
On the day of Lingwei's wedding,

535
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,470
it was also you who saved her.

536
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,100
How can you do this to Lianxiu?

537
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,149
That's right.

538
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:44,869
It was my doing.

539
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:49,710
In my lifetime,

540
00:36:50,149 --> 00:36:53,230
the person I cherished
and respected the most was Lianxiu.

541
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,030
But

542
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:02,030
what does Lianxiu desire?

543
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:04,869
Do you think

544
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:06,710
his desire is the seat in Qingkang Hall?

545
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:15,950
The moment he instigated
the Cige'er battle,

546
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:18,470
he was no longer

547
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,710
that Lianxiu.

548
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:20,389
Shut up!

549
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,589
Lianxiu, what are you...

550
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,589
Lianxiu,

551
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,670
do you remember the vows
you made to seize the title?

552
00:37:49,389 --> 00:37:50,189
You told me

553
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,270
you wanted the title.

554
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:56,629
But you wanted

555
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,710
a prosperous Quliang even more

556
00:38:00,629 --> 00:38:02,270
where the people are happy.

557
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,270
A Quliang that can defend
against enemies

558
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,950
and provide a peaceful home.

559
00:38:18,149 --> 00:38:18,790
Lianxiu,

560
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,629
isn't Lianxin already working

561
00:38:24,589 --> 00:38:25,189
toward that?

562
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:33,389
Lianzuo.

563
00:38:33,389 --> 00:38:34,030
Lianxiu,

564
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:40,270
forgive me

565
00:38:43,149 --> 00:38:44,389
for I can't

566
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,070
be part of this anymore.

567
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,389
I hope you

568
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,770
can think about it carefully.

569
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:42,109
Young Master.

570
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,149
I heard everything.

571
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,870
You were behind all of these incidents.

572
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:50,629
You're the chief shopkeeper,

573
00:39:52,429 --> 00:39:53,629
the one who harmed the people

574
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:55,909
for the sake of wealth.

575
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,230
I may hide things

576
00:39:59,669 --> 00:40:00,669
from you.

577
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,310
But I have no regrets.

578
00:40:05,109 --> 00:40:06,389
I've said this before.

579
00:40:07,669 --> 00:40:09,070
Everything I've done

580
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:10,990
is for you.

581
00:40:11,669 --> 00:40:12,349
For me?

582
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:13,790
Isn't it?

583
00:40:16,429 --> 00:40:17,310
If not

584
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:21,270
for the embezzled silver over these years,

585
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,349
what has been sustaining

586
00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:24,589
your expenses?

587
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:25,790
What has made

588
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,750
those officials follow so loyally

589
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,950
and willing to die for you?

590
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,829
Is it truly their loyalty?

591
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:42,750
Everyone is unfortunate in this world.

592
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:46,230
How many are there like me

593
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:49,270
who would overcome obstacles
and make careful plans for you?

594
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,149
What about Yuanxue?

595
00:40:55,149 --> 00:40:57,030
Was killing Yuanxue also for my sake?

596
00:40:59,189 --> 00:40:59,550
She...

597
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,070
She's my younger sister.

598
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:05,870
Young Master, don't forget.

599
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:07,790
Many years ago,

600
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:09,230
the one who gave her Thunder God Vine

601
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,149
was you.

602
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:16,560
You're right.

603
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,750
What right do I have
to criticize you now?

604
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:25,589
I will go and meet His Highness

605
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,470
to strip my title as Prince Li

606
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,870
and no longer involve myself
in political matters.

607
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:30,909
Young Master!

608
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:32,659
Mu Tianshu killed Yuanxue.

609
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,010
So, he will definitely be executed.

610
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:35,149
His loyalists

611
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:37,070
will no longer be loyal to His Highness.

612
00:41:37,429 --> 00:41:40,109
Also, the new policies are causing officials
to resent and complain.

613
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,109
This is

614
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:43,829
a rare opportunity.

615
00:41:45,189 --> 00:41:46,550
If you take action,

616
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,710
it'll be possible
to replace His Highness's place.
