=Episode 36=

17
00:01:51,686 --> 00:01:53,165
(Chief Clerk of the Right, Mu Tianshu,)

18
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:54,686
(proud of his achievements,)

19
00:01:55,205 --> 00:01:56,245
(ignored the law,)

20
00:01:56,805 --> 00:01:58,326
(and murdered His Highness's sister.)

21
00:01:59,165 --> 00:02:00,165
(A crime beyond forgiveness.)

22
00:02:14,286 --> 00:02:17,326
The He family forsake me!

23
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,280
(Prince An's Mansion)

24
00:02:59,686 --> 00:03:02,406
You want me to abdicate?

25
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:03,245
That's right.

26
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:06,245
You've been implementing
new policies recklessly,

27
00:03:06,245 --> 00:03:07,966
disregarding our ancestral law
and the laws of Mu.

28
00:03:08,525 --> 00:03:09,966
You're not fit
to be the ruler of Quliang.

29
00:03:10,846 --> 00:03:11,645
Why don't you step down
from your position?

30
00:03:13,805 --> 00:03:14,686
Step down?

31
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:15,966
And give it to?

32
00:03:17,245 --> 00:03:18,046
Lord Li?

33
00:03:18,445 --> 00:03:19,165
Precisely.

34
00:03:20,486 --> 00:03:22,365
Seeing you so confident and fearless,

35
00:03:23,525 --> 00:03:24,686
I fear you already have a plan.

36
00:03:24,926 --> 00:03:26,326
I'm glad you're aware.

37
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:28,486
Why not take a look around you?

38
00:03:29,046 --> 00:03:30,085
Besides Lord Yi's troops,

39
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:32,005
who else will follow your orders

40
00:03:32,686 --> 00:03:34,365
in Quliang now?

41
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:40,206
Great.

42
00:03:41,406 --> 00:03:42,046
Just great.

43
00:03:43,686 --> 00:03:47,486
You pressure me to resign
by submitting a letter to His Majesty,

44
00:03:48,206 --> 00:03:50,005
making it doesn't seem like treason.

45
00:03:51,725 --> 00:03:53,286
I never expected to end up like this

46
00:03:53,885 --> 00:03:55,766
after Mu Tianshu's death.

47
00:03:56,645 --> 00:03:58,365
When you killed Mu Tianshu,

48
00:03:59,286 --> 00:04:01,005
you should have known
this day would come.

49
00:04:01,406 --> 00:04:02,805
Madam De was right.

50
00:04:03,165 --> 00:04:04,326
You lack the ability to lead

51
00:04:04,725 --> 00:04:06,245
and are unworthy
of being the ruler of Quliang.

52
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,005
I

53
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:14,365
feel guilty towards you.

54
00:04:19,046 --> 00:04:20,126
After I take over your position,

55
00:04:21,085 --> 00:04:22,686
you can continue to be Prince Rui.

56
00:04:23,726 --> 00:04:25,365
I'll ensure the safety of you

57
00:04:25,886 --> 00:04:26,805
and all the women in your household.

58
00:04:27,645 --> 00:04:28,966
Since you feel guilty,

59
00:04:29,045 --> 00:04:30,205
why did you do it?

60
00:04:32,245 --> 00:04:33,045
Some things

61
00:04:37,726 --> 00:04:38,925
are forced by circumstances.

62
00:04:41,205 --> 00:04:42,325
But perhaps willingly accepted.

63
00:04:45,406 --> 00:04:47,446
"Perhaps willingly accepted," huh?

64
00:04:50,006 --> 00:04:53,085
Seeing it was forced by circumstances,

65
00:04:54,406 --> 00:04:55,205
I

66
00:04:56,525 --> 00:04:57,566
shall spare your life.

67
00:05:03,126 --> 00:05:03,726
Your Highness!

68
00:05:11,805 --> 00:05:12,245
Your Highness!

69
00:05:12,406 --> 00:05:13,886
Forces have been deployed
throughout the mansion.

70
00:05:14,286 --> 00:05:15,205
With your command,

71
00:05:15,686 --> 00:05:17,205
we'll capture all the traitors!

72
00:05:20,485 --> 00:05:20,886
You're...

73
00:05:22,325 --> 00:05:24,166
Aren't you Mu Tianshu's men?

74
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:25,886
What are you doing?

75
00:05:26,485 --> 00:05:28,286
As officers under His Highness,

76
00:05:28,645 --> 00:05:30,525
it's our duty to protect him.

77
00:05:30,525 --> 00:05:31,446
Are you crazy?

78
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:33,566
He killed Mu Tianshu!

79
00:05:33,765 --> 00:05:35,566
You claimed
you would never stand with him.

80
00:05:35,846 --> 00:05:36,846
What we do

81
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:39,365
is in accordance
with late Official Mu's wishes.

82
00:05:40,886 --> 00:05:42,325
It was my fault to have implicated you.

83
00:05:42,846 --> 00:05:43,765
Why do you say so?

84
00:05:44,566 --> 00:05:45,406
This is a letter left

85
00:05:45,406 --> 00:05:46,325
by Madam Yao for you.

86
00:05:46,686 --> 00:05:47,726
Please read it.

87
00:05:48,245 --> 00:05:49,045
A letter from Haiyao?

88
00:05:56,406 --> 00:05:58,006
(Even though He Lianxiu failed me,)

89
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,606
(I never hated him for a single moment.)

90
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:05,205
(Three years of deep affection)

91
00:06:05,805 --> 00:06:07,006
(did not disappoint me.)

92
00:06:08,726 --> 00:06:09,846
(If you take pity on me,)

93
00:06:11,126 --> 00:06:13,365
(please protect and assist him.)

94
00:06:22,406 --> 00:06:23,205
Haiyao,

95
00:06:26,126 --> 00:06:27,525
he treated you like this,

96
00:06:29,726 --> 00:06:32,765
yet you still want me
to protect and assist him?

97
00:06:33,286 --> 00:06:34,446
I once asked Madam Yao

98
00:06:34,446 --> 00:06:35,365
the same question.

99
00:06:36,606 --> 00:06:37,645
She said...

100
00:06:38,645 --> 00:06:39,805
I want him

101
00:06:41,686 --> 00:06:42,446
to bear the burden of guilt

102
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:44,886
and shame for me.

103
00:06:45,726 --> 00:06:46,966
And every time he thinks of me,

104
00:06:48,966 --> 00:06:50,205
he would feel regret.

105
00:06:54,245 --> 00:06:55,446
This is my punishment

106
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,286
for him.

107
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,485
I hate His Highness for being heartless

108
00:07:02,485 --> 00:07:03,606
and causing Madam Yao's death.

109
00:07:04,205 --> 00:07:06,325
So, I never gave this letter to you.

110
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:09,126
But I don't want to implicate you
to bear a death sentence.

111
00:07:22,606 --> 00:07:24,325
(No, absolutely not.)

112
00:07:25,566 --> 00:07:26,446
This is the only way

113
00:07:26,686 --> 00:07:27,645
to make the chief shopkeeper think

114
00:07:27,645 --> 00:07:28,805
you're in a hopeless situation.

115
00:07:28,805 --> 00:07:29,566
And then he would make a move.

116
00:07:29,686 --> 00:07:30,846
This is your only chance

117
00:07:30,846 --> 00:07:32,686
to lure the chief shopkeeper!

118
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,485
My answer is still no!

119
00:07:34,485 --> 00:07:36,485
I've committed such a grave offense.

120
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,485
If I walk away unscathed,

121
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:40,485
how will you convince the masses
in the future?

122
00:07:41,205 --> 00:07:44,406
I've caused enough sorrow for Haiyao.

123
00:07:44,925 --> 00:07:46,566
I can't let you down again!

124
00:07:47,485 --> 00:07:48,805
You won't let me down.

125
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,126
Yet, you want to let Quliang down

126
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:53,726
because of me?

127
00:08:32,966 --> 00:08:33,566
Your Highness,

128
00:08:34,925 --> 00:08:36,245
could you please join me
for a couple of drinks?

129
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,286
Do you remember

130
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,125
when we first drank together?

131
00:09:07,366 --> 00:09:10,966
It was the night before Haiyao
entered my mansion.

132
00:09:11,565 --> 00:09:13,606
We talked about our ambitions,

133
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,325
regretting that we hadn't met sooner.

134
00:09:15,765 --> 00:09:16,645
Unknowingly,

135
00:09:16,885 --> 00:09:18,046
we drank all night,

136
00:09:20,286 --> 00:09:23,486
almost delaying the wedding
the next day.

137
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:25,005
That's right.

138
00:09:30,885 --> 00:09:31,846
After that,

139
00:09:32,246 --> 00:09:33,246
Haiyao blamed me for a long time

140
00:09:33,565 --> 00:09:34,486
because of that.

141
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:37,005
But that night,

142
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:39,645
I saw

143
00:09:40,966 --> 00:09:42,486
Your Highness's broad-mindedness
and talent.

144
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:44,565
I secretly swore

145
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,445
that even if I had to face danger,

146
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:49,645
I would follow you.

147
00:09:51,005 --> 00:09:51,885
Do you remember

148
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:54,325
the last time we drank together?

149
00:09:56,205 --> 00:10:00,166
It was when we were finalizing
the details of the new policies.

150
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,606
You, me, and Lv Beiyi

151
00:10:02,445 --> 00:10:03,406
burned the midnight oil,

152
00:10:05,565 --> 00:10:06,806
using alcohol to stay awake

153
00:10:07,806 --> 00:10:10,046
for two days and two nights.

154
00:10:11,366 --> 00:10:11,926
Yes.

155
00:10:20,726 --> 00:10:21,765
It was two days and two nights.

156
00:10:24,085 --> 00:10:26,005
But I was not tired one bit.

157
00:10:27,366 --> 00:10:28,565
Instead, my blood was boiling,

158
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:31,125
as if

159
00:10:34,205 --> 00:10:35,685
we were about to witness

160
00:10:37,685 --> 00:10:39,685
a prosperous Quliang.

161
00:10:48,085 --> 00:10:49,806
It was my foolishness

162
00:10:50,486 --> 00:10:51,966
that led to a grave mistake.

163
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,325
Now, death is inevitable.

164
00:11:15,685 --> 00:11:16,366
Your Highness,

165
00:11:19,085 --> 00:11:20,166
let me raise

166
00:11:22,366 --> 00:11:23,726
one last toast to you.

167
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:25,645
I beg you.

168
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:27,846
For the sake
of our long-standing friendship,

169
00:11:29,445 --> 00:11:30,765
give me one more chance.

170
00:11:32,765 --> 00:11:33,406
A chance

171
00:11:36,205 --> 00:11:37,726
to atone for my mistake.

172
00:11:47,806 --> 00:11:49,205
Please grant my request, Your Highness.

173
00:11:57,246 --> 00:11:58,445
If there is a next life,

174
00:12:01,046 --> 00:12:01,885
I'm willing

175
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,205
to continue serving by your side.

176
00:12:14,325 --> 00:12:15,885
Please grant me this favor!

177
00:13:05,645 --> 00:13:07,085
Thank you, Your Highness!

178
00:13:14,645 --> 00:13:15,606
I

179
00:13:17,846 --> 00:13:18,565
shall take my leave.

180
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:22,366
Your Highness,

181
00:14:24,726 --> 00:14:27,085
this is the last time
I express my loyalty.

182
00:14:27,486 --> 00:14:28,525
A plot?

183
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:32,046
A plot between His Highness

184
00:14:36,286 --> 00:14:37,046
and Mu Tianshu?

185
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:40,966
Yes.

186
00:14:41,726 --> 00:14:42,966
Right now, Lord Li and the others

187
00:14:43,205 --> 00:14:44,486
have been restrained by His Highness.

188
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,205
Their fate is uncertain.

189
00:14:50,486 --> 00:14:51,406
I see.

190
00:14:55,885 --> 00:14:57,125
That was a clever move.

191
00:14:57,966 --> 00:14:58,885
I've lost.

192
00:15:07,765 --> 00:15:09,286
I have defied and committed offenses
against you.

193
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:10,445
I deserve to die.

194
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:11,966
Please impose punishment, Your Highness.

195
00:15:13,525 --> 00:15:14,685
It is my intention to impose punishment.

196
00:15:15,366 --> 00:15:16,806
But the one I want to punish isn't you.

197
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:18,606
The person who deserves death

198
00:15:19,046 --> 00:15:19,846
isn't you either.

199
00:15:24,926 --> 00:15:26,445
Are you talking

200
00:15:27,046 --> 00:15:27,966
about the chief shopkeeper?

201
00:15:29,726 --> 00:15:30,645
That's me.

202
00:15:40,085 --> 00:15:41,046
Are you saying

203
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:42,966
that you're the chief shopkeeper?

204
00:15:43,645 --> 00:15:45,846
Both of us are descendants
of the late Prince An.

205
00:15:46,606 --> 00:15:48,205
But since childhood,
you've oppressed me at every turn,

206
00:15:48,685 --> 00:15:50,085
causing me to lose the title of the prince.

207
00:15:51,005 --> 00:15:52,486
So, I harbored a deep hatred for you.

208
00:15:53,205 --> 00:15:54,606
I secretly accumulating power.

209
00:15:55,005 --> 00:15:56,166
I was waiting for the right moment

210
00:15:56,486 --> 00:15:57,846
to replace you.

211
00:15:58,726 --> 00:15:59,806
Lord Li is lying!

212
00:16:06,486 --> 00:16:06,926
Your Highness.

213
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:11,205
Since the incident,

214
00:16:12,046 --> 00:16:14,246
Lord Li has been drinking
and reveling all day,

215
00:16:14,246 --> 00:16:15,085
neglecting his duties.

216
00:16:15,486 --> 00:16:17,046
Is this the doings
of the chief shopkeeper?

217
00:16:19,005 --> 00:16:20,406
It was just a cover-up.

218
00:16:21,205 --> 00:16:21,685
All right.

219
00:16:22,525 --> 00:16:23,565
If you're the chief shopkeeper,

220
00:16:24,406 --> 00:16:26,606
when did the extortion
and exploitation begin?

221
00:16:26,606 --> 00:16:27,565
It's been a long time.

222
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:29,525
I can't remember.

223
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,726
How much wealth
was unlawfully collected?

224
00:16:33,445 --> 00:16:34,286
I don't remember.

225
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:35,926
Lord Li,

226
00:16:36,486 --> 00:16:38,166
you have people you want to protect.

227
00:16:38,726 --> 00:16:40,606
Others have loved ones they've lost.

228
00:16:41,246 --> 00:16:42,565
How many officials committed suicide?

229
00:16:43,046 --> 00:16:44,406
How many citizens suffered?

230
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:47,286
Even Yao was accused

231
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:48,366
to be the chief shopkeeper

232
00:16:48,366 --> 00:16:49,325
and died of injustice.

233
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:50,885
Lord Li, if you hide the truth,

234
00:16:51,565 --> 00:16:52,806
how can you face the souls

235
00:16:52,806 --> 00:16:54,005
of those who died in vain?

236
00:17:08,046 --> 00:17:09,486
I am the chief shopkeeper.

237
00:17:10,006 --> 00:17:11,205
I beg Your Highness to pass judgment.

238
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:34,325
Mei'er.

239
00:17:37,165 --> 00:17:37,646
Mei'er?

240
00:17:41,886 --> 00:17:42,486
Mei'er.

241
00:17:43,726 --> 00:17:44,325
Mei'er!

242
00:17:45,726 --> 00:17:46,405
Liuyan!

243
00:17:47,246 --> 00:17:47,846
Liuyan!

244
00:17:49,405 --> 00:17:50,126
- Young Master.
- Where's Mei'er?

245
00:17:51,726 --> 00:17:52,366
I...

246
00:17:52,486 --> 00:17:53,726
I failed to stop Madam.

247
00:17:53,805 --> 00:17:54,246
Madam...

248
00:17:54,445 --> 00:17:55,886
She went to the prince's mansion.

249
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:14,606
I'm

250
00:18:15,486 --> 00:18:16,565
presenting all the evidence

251
00:18:17,925 --> 00:18:18,966
of my crime.

252
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:23,085
None of this has anything
to do with Lord Li.

253
00:18:25,085 --> 00:18:26,805
Please grant me death.

254
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,285
Scatter my ashes throughout the mansion.

255
00:18:30,685 --> 00:18:31,726
Let them disperse

256
00:18:32,165 --> 00:18:33,526
in the mansion

257
00:18:35,486 --> 00:18:36,726
with the wind

258
00:18:38,486 --> 00:18:39,646
and never disappear.

259
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:12,606
Your Highness,

260
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:15,006
grant your request.

261
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:26,486
Thank you, Your Highness.

262
00:19:57,285 --> 00:19:58,006
I've heard

263
00:19:58,246 --> 00:20:00,526
a person won't die in peace

264
00:20:01,526 --> 00:20:02,726
if they have unfulfilled wishes.

265
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,085
What are you doing here?

266
00:20:06,966 --> 00:20:09,205
I've come to understand many things
during this time.

267
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:12,886
Quliang is the Fang family's root.

268
00:20:14,925 --> 00:20:15,966
Regrettably, I was too confident.

269
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:17,445
I thought the Fang family's power
was gone

270
00:20:18,486 --> 00:20:19,886
and that everything depended on me.

271
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,526
I didn't expect you to retreat so early.

272
00:20:24,966 --> 00:20:26,325
Once the Grand Chancellor attacks,

273
00:20:26,846 --> 00:20:28,606
the Fang family
will have no chance to rise again.

274
00:20:28,606 --> 00:20:29,925
It will be too late.

275
00:20:32,846 --> 00:20:34,486
I believed your slanderous words

276
00:20:35,165 --> 00:20:36,366
and sacrificed Erge.

277
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:41,205
Tomorrow, I'll clarify the truth
to His Highness.

278
00:20:46,486 --> 00:20:47,886
I'll no longer be
the princess consort of Quliang

279
00:20:47,886 --> 00:20:49,325
and will spend my days repenting
for my mistakes.

280
00:21:57,646 --> 00:21:59,045
(I don't want to go anywhere.)

281
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:01,285
Just let me...

282
00:22:03,886 --> 00:22:05,285
Let me stay in your embrace.

283
00:22:06,606 --> 00:22:07,366
Can I?

284
00:22:10,445 --> 00:22:11,646
If there's another life,

285
00:22:15,366 --> 00:22:16,846
would you marry me?

286
00:22:18,085 --> 00:22:20,205
(I, Lv Beiyi, will take Yuanxue)

287
00:22:20,646 --> 00:22:21,766
(as my wife at this moment.)

288
00:22:22,565 --> 00:22:24,445
(In this life and the next,)

289
00:22:24,766 --> 00:22:25,726
(we shall never let each other down.)

290
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,280
(Orders from Prince An:
Appoint Lv Beiyi as Chief Clerk of the Left)

291
00:22:56,526 --> 00:22:57,366
You're resigning?

292
00:23:00,325 --> 00:23:02,246
Resigning implies
I've had an official position.

293
00:23:04,445 --> 00:23:05,285
I'm

294
00:23:06,766 --> 00:23:08,285
just refusing
Your Highness's appointment.

295
00:23:13,805 --> 00:23:15,126
You've worked hard all your life

296
00:23:16,006 --> 00:23:17,486
just to rise from your outcast status

297
00:23:17,486 --> 00:23:18,685
and make great accomplishments?

298
00:23:30,565 --> 00:23:31,126
Beiyi,

299
00:23:32,085 --> 00:23:33,006
Yuanxue's death

300
00:23:33,726 --> 00:23:34,766
is not your fault.

301
00:23:37,205 --> 00:23:38,085
If she knew,

302
00:23:38,966 --> 00:23:40,966
she would want you to have a purpose

303
00:23:41,445 --> 00:23:42,486
and achieve something significant
in your life.

304
00:23:43,085 --> 00:23:44,246
To have a purpose, eh?

305
00:23:49,126 --> 00:23:49,886
Before,

306
00:23:51,565 --> 00:23:52,966
I was always afraid that life was short

307
00:23:54,165 --> 00:23:55,486
and I wouldn't be able to accompany
the people I wanted to be with.

308
00:23:58,045 --> 00:23:59,325
Eventually, I found

309
00:24:00,685 --> 00:24:01,846
that I was already tired

310
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:05,405
before finishing these tasks.

311
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:13,165
I take my leave.

312
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,280
(Prince An's Mansion)

313
00:24:30,006 --> 00:24:31,445
Greetings, Your Highness.

314
00:24:33,045 --> 00:24:33,685
Why are you here?

315
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:37,526
I know you

316
00:24:37,526 --> 00:24:39,006
like the Snow Fungus with Pear
that I make.

317
00:24:40,085 --> 00:24:41,726
So I specially made it for you

318
00:24:42,445 --> 00:24:43,325
and brought it here

319
00:24:43,325 --> 00:24:44,285
for you to taste.

320
00:24:46,846 --> 00:24:47,405
No need.

321
00:24:47,565 --> 00:24:48,606
I don't want to drink it.

322
00:24:51,886 --> 00:24:54,606
Are you still blaming me, Your Highness?

323
00:24:55,966 --> 00:24:57,445
I was just foolish for a moment,

324
00:24:58,085 --> 00:24:59,486
falling into Fourth Madam's trap

325
00:24:59,925 --> 00:25:00,886
and making a big mistake.

326
00:25:02,886 --> 00:25:03,726
Let's not bring up

327
00:25:04,205 --> 00:25:05,045
the past.

328
00:25:06,486 --> 00:25:07,126
Your Highness,

329
00:25:08,246 --> 00:25:09,526
even though I was foolish,

330
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:10,766
I never intended

331
00:25:10,766 --> 00:25:11,805
to harm you.

332
00:25:12,165 --> 00:25:13,285
From the moment

333
00:25:13,685 --> 00:25:15,085
I realized Ruan Zhimei's ambitions,

334
00:25:15,405 --> 00:25:16,366
I reacted.

335
00:25:17,646 --> 00:25:18,366
Although

336
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:20,045
a great mistake was made,

337
00:25:21,685 --> 00:25:23,085
it's still not too late.

338
00:25:56,565 --> 00:25:57,606
I know

339
00:25:58,285 --> 00:25:59,405
I took the wrong path

340
00:26:01,045 --> 00:26:02,126
and I regret it so much.

341
00:26:03,486 --> 00:26:04,165
I've been

342
00:26:04,846 --> 00:26:06,805
without a husband for most of my life.

343
00:26:09,165 --> 00:26:10,526
Even if I spend
the latter half of my life

344
00:26:11,726 --> 00:26:12,846
growing old and alone,

345
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:16,405
I brought it upon myself.

346
00:26:22,925 --> 00:26:24,126
I request Your Highness

347
00:26:25,646 --> 00:26:27,285
to depose me from the position
of the princess consort.

348
00:26:34,085 --> 00:26:34,846
I made this dessert

349
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,246
for you every day

350
00:26:40,726 --> 00:26:42,366
since I entered the mansion.

351
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:45,565
You really enjoyed it.

352
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,606
Please enjoy

353
00:26:56,526 --> 00:26:57,925
the last dessert

354
00:26:59,766 --> 00:27:01,165
I make for you

355
00:27:03,285 --> 00:27:04,405
to show my sincerity

356
00:27:07,165 --> 00:27:08,246
in requesting my dismissal.

357
00:27:12,045 --> 00:27:12,606
Get up.

358
00:28:05,246 --> 00:28:06,165
Today

359
00:28:07,045 --> 00:28:08,445
is the big day for your appointment
as the princess consort.

360
00:28:09,085 --> 00:28:10,006
Ranyun told me

361
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:11,126
you've been sitting here alone

362
00:28:12,085 --> 00:28:13,405
since early morning.

363
00:28:18,045 --> 00:28:19,405
Your Highness,

364
00:28:20,085 --> 00:28:21,405
please withdraw the decree appointing me
as Princess Consort.

365
00:28:28,846 --> 00:28:29,526
Qinglian,

366
00:28:30,486 --> 00:28:32,085
I've wanted to give you this title

367
00:28:33,606 --> 00:28:35,085
for twenty years.

368
00:28:38,126 --> 00:28:39,006
I know.

369
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:43,085
But to me,

370
00:28:43,925 --> 00:28:45,085
the most valuable title

371
00:28:46,486 --> 00:28:48,726
is being the woman you love the most.

372
00:28:54,685 --> 00:28:55,685
You've promised me

373
00:28:56,606 --> 00:28:58,565
this title for a lifetime.

374
00:29:15,646 --> 00:29:16,366
Your Highness,

375
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:18,726
do you have any obsession?

376
00:29:19,165 --> 00:29:19,766
Obsession?

377
00:29:21,165 --> 00:29:22,445
Everyone I've met

378
00:29:22,565 --> 00:29:23,606
in my life

379
00:29:24,366 --> 00:29:25,246
had obsessions.

380
00:29:27,006 --> 00:29:28,925
Yao's obsession was love.

381
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,165
But what I want to see the most

382
00:29:35,846 --> 00:29:37,445
is who he was twenty years ago,

383
00:29:41,685 --> 00:29:44,526
the one who only had eyes for me.

384
00:29:45,445 --> 00:29:47,285
Ruan Zhimei's obsession was fame.

385
00:29:47,925 --> 00:29:48,606
(I)

386
00:29:49,366 --> 00:29:50,646
(couldn't fulfill my desires,)

387
00:29:51,805 --> 00:29:52,886
(making me feel empty in life.)

388
00:29:53,646 --> 00:29:55,205
Please

389
00:29:56,486 --> 00:29:57,886
grind my bones to dust.

390
00:29:58,325 --> 00:29:59,606
(Scatter my ashes)

391
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:01,325
(throughout prince's mansion.)

392
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,045
Let them disperse with the wind

393
00:30:04,925 --> 00:30:06,045
and never disappear.

394
00:30:06,685 --> 00:30:08,805
Princess Consort's obsession
was her clan.

395
00:30:09,126 --> 00:30:11,285
(How prestigious is our Fang family?)

396
00:30:11,846 --> 00:30:12,766
(I will not allow)

397
00:30:12,925 --> 00:30:15,006
(Quliang to be used by others.)

398
00:30:15,405 --> 00:30:16,646
And Yi's obsession

399
00:30:17,366 --> 00:30:18,085
was dignity.

400
00:30:19,445 --> 00:30:20,726
(The pain of a humble background)

401
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:22,565
(is heavier than life,)

402
00:30:23,006 --> 00:30:24,246
(death,)

403
00:30:24,966 --> 00:30:26,606
(friendship,)

404
00:30:27,486 --> 00:30:29,246
(and morality.)

405
00:30:33,445 --> 00:30:34,325
These obsessions

406
00:30:35,285 --> 00:30:36,366
tightly bind them

407
00:30:36,966 --> 00:30:38,486
like shackles.

408
00:30:39,246 --> 00:30:40,205
They can never break free

409
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:42,766
for a lifetime.

410
00:30:50,726 --> 00:30:51,366
What about you?

411
00:30:53,366 --> 00:30:54,445
What is your obsession?

412
00:30:59,205 --> 00:31:00,205
(From this moment on,)

413
00:31:00,606 --> 00:31:02,165
(you'll completely bid farewell
to the past.)

414
00:31:03,165 --> 00:31:04,285
In your future,

415
00:31:04,685 --> 00:31:05,766
(besides helping me gain power,)

416
00:31:06,445 --> 00:31:08,006
(there's something even more important,)

417
00:31:08,886 --> 00:31:10,045
(which is to live well.)

418
00:31:17,565 --> 00:31:19,646
You, Luo Qinglian,

419
00:31:20,325 --> 00:31:21,285
(will never deceive.)

420
00:31:22,085 --> 00:31:24,165
(I, He Lianxin,)

421
00:31:25,045 --> 00:31:25,966
(will never doubt.)

422
00:31:28,646 --> 00:31:29,726
The thing you fear the most

423
00:31:29,966 --> 00:31:30,726
is the same as what I fear the most.

424
00:31:31,886 --> 00:31:33,726
My biggest fear is a long life

425
00:31:34,766 --> 00:31:37,205
without being able to walk hand in hand

426
00:31:37,805 --> 00:31:38,766
with you until our hair turns grey.

427
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:40,685
Even if frost and snow cover our heads,

428
00:31:41,006 --> 00:31:42,045
it would still be grey hair.

429
00:31:43,766 --> 00:31:44,886
Whether in life or death,

430
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:46,766
as long as I'm by your side,

431
00:31:47,126 --> 00:31:48,766
I will have no regrets

432
00:31:49,165 --> 00:31:50,165
and no fears.

433
00:31:53,846 --> 00:31:54,846
I don't know.

434
00:31:56,766 --> 00:31:57,405
Perhaps

435
00:31:58,886 --> 00:32:00,325
this is my luck.

436
00:32:04,405 --> 00:32:06,405
But being a princess consort
is such an honor.

437
00:32:07,846 --> 00:32:09,966
Standing in such a high place,

438
00:32:10,565 --> 00:32:11,925
it's inevitable not to be myself.

439
00:32:12,846 --> 00:32:13,886
Over time,

440
00:32:15,565 --> 00:32:17,445
I might lose myself.

441
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:21,766
Obsession.

442
00:32:25,886 --> 00:32:26,886
Obsession.

443
00:32:27,526 --> 00:32:29,085
(For the sake
of our long-standing friendship,)

444
00:32:30,526 --> 00:32:32,006
give me the chance
to atone for my mistake.

Please grant my request, Your Highness.

(If there is a next life,)

447

you asked me

what my obsession is.

485
00:35:06,006 --> 00:35:08,046
The one before our eyes is my obsession.

486
00:35:08,445 --> 00:35:09,125
Quliang.

487
00:35:10,766 --> 00:35:11,286
That's right.

488
00:35:11,925 --> 00:35:12,566
It's Quliang.

489
00:35:13,326 --> 00:35:14,845
I've been in Quliang since birth,

490
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:16,605
hearing the Quliang accents,

491
00:35:16,605 --> 00:35:18,006
and singing the Quliang folk songs,

492
00:35:18,006 --> 00:35:20,165
and the word I heard
the most is also Quliang.

493
00:35:21,966 --> 00:35:24,365
Even the first few words
my father taught me

494
00:35:25,205 --> 00:35:25,966
to write

495
00:35:27,165 --> 00:35:28,046
are also Quliang.

496
00:35:32,405 --> 00:35:35,246
Quliang is my obsession.

497
00:35:36,286 --> 00:35:37,165
You once said

498
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:39,286
obsessions are like cages.

499
00:35:40,445 --> 00:35:41,766
But there was never a day

500
00:35:42,286 --> 00:35:43,246
that I wanted to break free from it.

501
00:35:43,685 --> 00:35:44,566
I can imagine

502
00:35:45,445 --> 00:35:46,286
losing my title,

503
00:35:47,006 --> 00:35:47,966
losing everything,

504
00:35:48,486 --> 00:35:49,165
even

505
00:35:51,006 --> 00:35:51,766
losing you.

506
00:35:52,806 --> 00:35:54,086
But I cannot imagine

507
00:35:54,845 --> 00:35:55,925
losing Quliang.

508
00:35:57,006 --> 00:35:57,766
The new policies

509
00:35:58,526 --> 00:35:59,445
have just been implemented.

510
00:36:00,645 --> 00:36:01,205
In the future,

511
00:36:01,966 --> 00:36:03,766
Quliang will surely be better
than it is now.

512
00:36:05,165 --> 00:36:06,046
But now,

513
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:08,486
if we surrender

514
00:36:10,246 --> 00:36:11,125
in this battle,

515
00:36:11,726 --> 00:36:13,086
it means submitting
to the Grand Chancellor

516
00:36:13,645 --> 00:36:14,645
and betraying trust.

517
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:16,526
If we fight,

518
00:36:17,445 --> 00:36:19,566
the Quliang my father built

519
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:21,405
brick by brick

520
00:36:21,766 --> 00:36:22,726
will be destroyed.

521
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:25,205
Decades of his hard work

522
00:36:25,605 --> 00:36:26,605
will be ruined in an instant.

523
00:36:33,806 --> 00:36:34,286
Qinglian,

524
00:36:35,766 --> 00:36:36,845
do you know how I plan

525
00:36:37,086 --> 00:36:37,966
to make this choice?

526
00:36:40,086 --> 00:36:40,645
The people.

527
00:36:44,006 --> 00:36:45,405
Quliang

528
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:46,326
is not just yours,

529
00:36:47,006 --> 00:36:48,925
it also belongs to the people.

530
00:36:49,445 --> 00:36:50,246
You want

531
00:36:50,645 --> 00:36:52,006
to know what the people think

532
00:36:52,445 --> 00:36:53,605
and let them make the choice.

533
00:36:54,286 --> 00:36:54,645
Yes.

534
00:36:58,645 --> 00:36:59,566
But do you know

535
00:37:01,326 --> 00:37:03,205
I swore before my father

536
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:05,486
that I won't...

537
00:37:05,486 --> 00:37:06,165
I know.

538
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,326
But at that time,

539
00:37:09,326 --> 00:37:10,885
he didn't know the Grand Chancellor
would deploy the troops.

540
00:37:11,966 --> 00:37:13,086
I also believe

541
00:37:13,726 --> 00:37:14,925
that what the late prince wanted to see

542
00:37:15,205 --> 00:37:16,006
was not a prince

543
00:37:16,006 --> 00:37:17,645
burdened by an oath

544
00:37:18,086 --> 00:37:18,845
but

545
00:37:19,925 --> 00:37:21,726
a united Quliang.

546
00:37:27,925 --> 00:37:28,685
Do you know

547
00:37:31,885 --> 00:37:33,445
once I break the oath,

548
00:37:36,806 --> 00:37:39,806
you'll be lonely
for the rest of your life?

549
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:48,566
Do you still remember

550
00:37:49,326 --> 00:37:50,286
when was the first time

551
00:37:50,925 --> 00:37:52,246
I came here?

552
00:38:03,246 --> 00:38:04,806
The day I was appointed
General of Illustrious Virtue

553
00:38:06,766 --> 00:38:08,365
was the same day you arrived
in my mansion.

554
00:38:09,766 --> 00:38:10,966
At that time,

555
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:15,966
I had just bid farewell
to everything I had.

556
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:17,966
I had nothing.

557
00:38:19,766 --> 00:38:21,205
But I wasn't afraid

558
00:38:23,165 --> 00:38:23,685
because

559
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:30,845
you were by my side.

560
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,165
I didn't feel lonely.

561
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:38,326
As long as we are together,

562
00:38:39,246 --> 00:38:40,165
we can overcome

563
00:38:40,566 --> 00:38:41,766
any obstacle.

564
00:38:52,405 --> 00:38:52,925
Come.

565
00:38:56,046 --> 00:38:57,486
(Calling for loyalists to fight
against the treacherous Grand Chancellor.)

566
00:38:57,845 --> 00:39:00,046
(There is an expected order
and routine in state affairs)

567
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,246
(like the unchanging laws of heaven
and the order of the earth.)

568
00:39:02,486 --> 00:39:04,445
(In ancient times,
a wise ruler would bring prosperity.)

569
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:05,605
(But alas, in our great Mu,)

570
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:06,845
(The Emperor is benevolent.)

571
00:39:07,006 --> 00:39:09,086
(Yet, laws and principles
have been neglected time and again.)

572
00:39:09,365 --> 00:39:10,246
(The Emperor is just.)

573
00:39:10,326 --> 00:39:12,046
(Yet, people are experiencing hardships
and disasters.)

574
00:39:12,405 --> 00:39:13,685
(All because of
a treacherous Grand Chancellor)

575
00:39:14,205 --> 00:39:16,526
(with clear ambitions
to control the court,)

576
00:39:16,726 --> 00:39:18,845
(deceitful and even acts
above the Emperor)

577
00:39:19,046 --> 00:39:21,365
(to the point the minister's influence
has grown so much)

578
00:39:21,365 --> 00:39:22,605
(that the Emperor is disregarded.)

579
00:39:22,766 --> 00:39:24,165
(This is a great shame for Mu,)

580
00:39:24,165 --> 00:39:25,445
(a disgrace for its people,)

581
00:39:25,766 --> 00:39:26,885
(The truth must be revealed.)

582
00:39:26,885 --> 00:39:28,925
(We must oppose
the treacherous Grand Chancellor.)

583
00:39:29,205 --> 00:39:30,605
(Even if it's like using eggs
to strike a rock,)

584
00:39:30,605 --> 00:39:31,766
(what's there to fear?)

585
00:39:32,006 --> 00:39:34,726
(Blood may spill,
and horses may charge ahead.)

586
00:39:34,845 --> 00:39:37,365
(Today, I vow to rid ourselves
of this treacherous plot.)

587
00:39:37,566 --> 00:39:39,925
(The unwavering loyalty
of the He family is in our veins,)

588
00:39:40,205 --> 00:39:41,685
(determined to eliminate traitors
and suppress rebellions.)

589
00:39:41,885 --> 00:39:43,205
(Proclaiming this fact)

590
00:39:43,365 --> 00:39:46,326
(to the world and let it known
far and wide by all.)

591
00:39:47,766 --> 00:39:48,326
(Your Majesty,)

592
00:39:48,685 --> 00:39:50,125
(the Grand Chancellor is sending troops.)

593
00:39:50,566 --> 00:39:52,365
(Quliang might be in for a tough time.)

594
00:39:53,246 --> 00:39:54,326
The sons of the He family

595
00:39:55,566 --> 00:39:57,046
will definitely overcome it.

596
00:39:57,685 --> 00:39:58,925
But after so many years,

597
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:00,326
they've...

598
00:40:00,685 --> 00:40:01,526
Not buts.

599
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:04,086
No matter how long,

600
00:40:05,806 --> 00:40:07,966
I've never doubted them.

601
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:15,726
The He family is loyal and righteous.

602
00:40:17,566 --> 00:40:19,445
They will ensure the well-being
of our people and the nation.

603
00:40:20,566 --> 00:40:21,885
We've worked tirelessly

604
00:40:21,885 --> 00:40:22,726
to implement new policies,

605
00:40:23,526 --> 00:40:24,405
hoping to bring peace and prosperity

606
00:40:24,405 --> 00:40:25,286
to the people.

607
00:40:25,726 --> 00:40:26,766
Why is this happening now?

608
00:40:28,326 --> 00:40:29,526
If I had known
our hard work would be in vain,

609
00:40:31,486 --> 00:40:32,165
I wouldn't have done it.

610
00:40:35,365 --> 00:40:36,445
It won't be in vain.

611
00:40:37,205 --> 00:40:38,486
It has won the hearts of the people.

612
00:40:40,006 --> 00:40:40,766
Grandfather used to say

613
00:40:41,726 --> 00:40:42,925
that Quliang doesn't belong
to the He family

614
00:40:43,645 --> 00:40:44,605
or Mu.

615
00:40:45,165 --> 00:40:46,326
It belongs to whoever

616
00:40:47,246 --> 00:40:48,165
is in the hearts of the people.

617
00:40:50,125 --> 00:40:51,326
We have the people in our hearts.

618
00:40:51,885 --> 00:40:52,766
Naturally,

619
00:40:54,205 --> 00:40:55,365
they have us in theirs.

620
00:41:00,246 --> 00:41:00,806
Let's go.

621
00:41:01,445 --> 00:41:02,885
The army is waiting for us outside.

622
00:41:03,925 --> 00:41:05,205
Let's join them,

623
00:41:05,726 --> 00:41:06,685
and fight side by side,

624
00:41:07,286 --> 00:41:09,205
and face the fate of Quliang together.

625
00:41:10,286 --> 00:41:11,046
Father, look.

626
00:41:19,365 --> 00:41:20,526
(With the enemy at the gates,)

627
00:41:21,326 --> 00:41:23,766
(The officials, soldiers, and civilians
of Quliang unite with a common purpose.)

628
00:41:25,006 --> 00:41:26,046
(The group gathers.)

629
00:41:26,845 --> 00:41:29,645
(They gather for the love of the people
shown by two generations of Prince An.)

630
00:41:30,885 --> 00:41:31,605
(They gather)

631
00:41:31,605 --> 00:41:34,605
(because they respect their leader
and love their country.)

632
00:41:35,885 --> 00:41:38,806
(They gather
because of righteous principles)

633
00:41:39,645 --> 00:41:41,526
(and a strong sense of integrity.)

634
00:41:53,445 --> 00:41:55,885
(He Lianxin joined forces
with the Cige'er Army)

635
00:41:56,165 --> 00:41:59,125
(and defeated the Grand Chancellor's
massive army of a hundred thousand.)

636
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:01,605
(This dealt a significant blow
to their morale,)

637
00:42:02,966 --> 00:42:05,286
(ultimately restoring
a wise ruler to Mu)

638
00:42:05,726 --> 00:42:08,365
(and bringing peace to Quliang.)
