17
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,199
But everything good that I did

18
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,360
was negated by that slap.

19
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,480
Is your leg still in pain?

20
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:09,239
I'm fine.

21
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,680
It's just water retention.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,599
Qinglian.

23
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,839
It's already so badly swollen.

24
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,160
How can you say that you are fine?

25
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,320
Lan.

26
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:39,080
Although I slapped your face,

27
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,639
my heart was the one that bled.

28
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:45,919
Can you forgive me

29
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,880
and forget about that slap forever?

30
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:49,440
Okay?

31
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:52,399
I heard

32
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,800
that you didn't have it easy

33
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,470
at the southern secondary courtyard.

34
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,479
I felt so bad for you.

35
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,240
I didn't have it easy.

36
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,639
But that was in the past now.

37
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,320
Let bygone

38
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,720
be bygone.

39
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,280
(Lianwei House)

40
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,279
Good day, Young Master.

41
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:17,520
Good day?

42
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,440
Who's having a good day?

43
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:20,039
You?

44
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:21,440
Or the four-month-old child

45
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,559
who I suddenly have?

46
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,119
You must be confused.

47
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:25,399
I'm four months pregnant.

48
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,679
Four months old means
after the child is born.

49
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,759
Come here now.

50
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,880
You are so cruel.

51
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,720
Four months. It has been four months.

52
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,800
How did you hide it
from everyone for four months?

53
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,320
It was not that hard.

54
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,559
I just wrapped my stomach
with a strip of cloth.

55
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,279
A strip of cloth?

56
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:56,279
Why did you

57
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:57,360
put such a thick blanket on her?

58
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,440
What if her body overheats?

59
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,520
The cloth that you hid
under the blanket.

60
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:09,520
You saw it?

61
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,479
You used it to wrap around your stomach?

62
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,800
Of course.

63
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,839
No wonder I didn't receive anything

64
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,240
despite waiting for so long.

65
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:19,600
What are you talking about?

66
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,600
Nothing.

67
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:32,679
You...

68
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,119
I'm terribly sorry.

69
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:35,720
How could you be so careless?

70
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,119
I'm terribly sorry.

71
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,640
I didn't see you, Miss Lan.

72
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,239
You didn't see me?

73
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:42,870
- You!
- Please calm down, Miss Lan.

74
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,040
Qinglian.

75
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:51,440
Miss Lan.

76
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,359
Li Tang didn't do it on purpose.

77
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,119
Please forgive him.

78
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,799
He didn't do it on purpose?

79
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,359
The courtyard is so big.

80
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,000
Why did he have
to sweep it onto my feet?

81
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,600
Forget it.

82
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,119
Even if he did it on purpose,

83
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:08,870
he wouldn't dare
to offend our Miss Shuilan.

84
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:11,000
Li Tang, get up.

85
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,920
Thank you, Madam.

86
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:18,470
What's wrong with you today?

87
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:20,559
Madam.

88
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:22,600
I'm indeed

89
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,160
a little bit distracted today.

90
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,359
I even broke a vase
in the garden just now.

91
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,440
Because...

92
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,040
Because when I went

93
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,119
to feed Blackie today,

94
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:33,040
I found it dead.

95
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:35,640
I raised it for more than half a year.

96
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:38,119
It was very gentle and obedient.

97
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,320
I can't accept

98
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,040
its sudden death.

99
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,519
I thought

100
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,600
something serious had happened.

101
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,720
It's just the death of a dog.

102
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,079
Why are you so distracted

103
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,839
until you can't do your job well?

104
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,440
If a rat or a cat dies tomorrow,

105
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,399
are you going

106
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,040
to cry the whole day

107
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,359
and do nothing else?

108
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,000
Blackie is nothing to you, Miss Lan.

109
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:01,770
But I raised it for such a long time,

110
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,440
I had bonded with it.

111
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:05,799
Can't I feel sad over its death?

112
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:07,320
You...

113
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,000
Qinglian, you saw that too.

114
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,600
I just lectured him for a bit.

115
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But he talked back to me.

116
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,799
And he implied

117
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,799
that I was cold and heartless.

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,679
As if I was beneath an animal.

119
00:06:22,119 --> 00:06:22,799
Qinglian.

120
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,959
I know that you always

121
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,040
treat your servants kindly.

122
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,559
Li Tang

123
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,160
did something wrong first.

124
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,239
But he talked back to me instead.

125
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:31,920
If he can treat me like this today,

126
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:34,839
he may treat you the same in the future.

127
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,200
Our parents

128
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,480
still think that you are
living a good life here.

129
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,959
If you don't punish him properly today,

130
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:42,720
others will follow his lead.

131
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,959
If that happens,

132
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,559
how can our parents

133
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:46,880
not worry about you?

134
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,519
It's not that serious, Miss Lan.

135
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,519
Old Master has always known

136
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,870
that Miss Lian treats servants kindly.

137
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:54,519
Moreover, Li Tang

138
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,799
has always been perfectly poised

139
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:56,519
and meticulous.

140
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:56,839
You...

141
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:57,440
Enough.

142
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,679
You heard what Miss Lan said.

143
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,160
Li Tang.

144
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,970
Kneel down and reflect on your mistakes.

145
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,559
Do not get up until I say so.

146
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:14,160
Be careful, Qinglian.

147
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,079
Eat more fruits.

148
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,679
Madam.

149
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:49,959
Li Tang has been kneeling
outside for hours.

150
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,079
It's so cold outside.

151
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,170
And he was injured before this.

152
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,559
Did he beg for forgiveness?

153
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,000
No.

154
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,440
Continue kneeling then.

155
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,279
Shuilan.

156
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,959
Eat this.

157
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,839
It's cold and raining.

158
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:31,079
You must be hungry.

159
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,839
Eat something first.

160
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,720
Did Madam send you here?

161
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,919
Madam and Miss Lan

162
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,440
have gone to bed.

163
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,660
She has gone to bed?

164
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:44,840
I know you feel that you were wronged.

165
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,679
But you can't

166
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,039
torture your body for it.

167
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,200
Madam has just

168
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,280
reconciled with Miss Lan.

169
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,440
You know

170
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,880
that she had a fallout with Miss Lan

171
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,679
for trying to help us...

172
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,080
Yes.

173
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,110
No matter how well she treats us,

174
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:58,479
we can't be compared
to her younger sister.

175
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,039
I'm being foolish

176
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:03,840
by staying loyal to her.

177
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,799
I've risked

178
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,880
my life

179
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,719
for her repeatedly.

180
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:13,559
Just because she treats us well

181
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,119
and sees us as a person.

182
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,270
But what do I get in the end?

183
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,479
I'm still just a servant.

184
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:23,870
Even a dog is better than me.

185
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:27,440
What are you talking about?

186
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:29,520
Are you going to forget everything

187
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,320
that she did for us

188
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,640
just because you've suffered once?

189
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,670
It's said that Madam Lian
cares for servants.

190
00:09:58,119 --> 00:09:59,400
But everything is just a lie.

191
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,359
How much can she care for them?

192
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,280
There's no such thing

193
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,200
as equality.

194
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,760
We

195
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:08,559
will always be beneath others.

196
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,239
Let's go.

197
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,440
(Jingshu Pavilion)

198
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,080
(Jingshu Pavilion)
Madam.

199
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:57,039
Madam Mei has sent someone over
to press you again.

200
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:58,400
She wants to know

201
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,799
the progress of the mission

202
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:00,880
that you've accepted from her.

203
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,520
Is she underestimating

204
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,400
the Young Master's Mansion?

205
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:06,400
It's not so easy
to take something away

206
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,239
from Luo Qinglian.

207
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,039
Yes.

208
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:09,280
But...

209
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,320
Just ignore her.

210
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,840
But it has to be done sooner or later.

211
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:14,960
How about I...

212
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,559
Qimei.

213
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:17,640
Are you trying

214
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,799
to order me around?

215
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:20,559
I wouldn't dare.

216
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,599
Madam.

217
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,270
The steward of the Greenhouse,
Song Daqi, is here.

218
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,400
Why is he here?

219
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,679
Let him in.

220
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:29,599
Yes, Madam.

221
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,359
Greetings, Madam.

222
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:41,280
Let me congratulate you first.

223
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,280
Congratulate me?

224
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,679
A few days ago, you asked me

225
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,400
to look out for suitable candidates

226
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,200
to hire as your servants, right?

227
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:50,840
Your request is my top priority.

228
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:52,119
And finally,

229
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,599
I found someone amazing.

230
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:57,359
I just want

231
00:11:57,359 --> 00:11:58,760
to hire someone capable.

232
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:00,960
What do you mean by amazing?

233
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:04,599
That person is Li Tang
from Lianwei House.

234
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,719
Nonsense.

235
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,960
Everyone here knows

236
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,080
that Li Tang is loyal.

237
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,400
He even risked his life

238
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,719
for Madam Lian.

239
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,599
And he's cool and collected.

240
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,400
He's one of the best servants.

241
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,679
That was before.

242
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,960
A few days ago,

243
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,400
Li Tang was punished

244
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,400
to kneel under the rain
for the whole night

245
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:23,679
just because he talked back
to Miss Shuilan.

246
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,359
I know about that.

247
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,840
After that incident,

248
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:29,719
I paid extra attention to them.

249
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,200
I realised that after this incident,

250
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,320
Li Tang had quarreled with Madam Lian

251
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,080
a few times over something minor.

252
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,470
What did they quarrel about?

253
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,159
They quarreled

254
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:40,359
over Miss Shuilan.

255
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:41,280
Li Tang

256
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,799
and Miss Shuilan

257
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:43,599
are like water and fire.

258
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,840
And Miss Lian

259
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,479
dotes on her sister so much lately.

260
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,000
I know about that too.

261
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,479
I'm sure you don't know

262
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,599
what happened next.

263
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,359
Last night,

264
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:56,559
I invited Li Tang to drink with me
at the Greenhouse.

265
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,479
And I got him drunk on purpose.

266
00:12:58,799 --> 00:12:59,599
At first, Li Tang

267
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:01,200
said many inappropriate things

268
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,080
without holding back.

269
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,520
Then, he berated himself for being blind

270
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,750
and being loyal to the wrong person.

271
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,960
He said many inappropriate things?

272
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:11,119
I won't go into details then.

273
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:13,320
He spoke ill of Madam Lian

274
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,119
and you as well.

275
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,599
Me as well?

276
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:21,719
That's strange.

277
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,239
Logically speaking,

278
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,520
he shouldn't speak ill of me.

279
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,919
Logically speaking?

280
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,320
What kind of logic?

281
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,280
This is

282
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,039
for your expenses last night.

283
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:51,640
Bring Li Tang to me

284
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,320
when the time is right.

285
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:55,320
Sure.

286
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,520
Roger that.

287
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,840
I'll take my leave now.

288
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,670
Logically speaking,
he shouldn't speak ill of me.

289
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:10,860
If it was just a ruse to gain pity,

290
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:13,919
he would've just spoken ill
about Luo Qinglian.

291
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:17,200
Madam.

292
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:19,080
Just now, I saw Li Tang...

293
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,880
I saw Li Tang heading

294
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,359
to the Jingshu Pavilion.

295
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,080
What's wrong with that?

296
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,679
It might be nothing.

297
00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:28,000
But Li Tang was heading there
with Song Daqi.

298
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,520
He is Madam Zhen's servant.

299
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
And lately,

300
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,250
he has been keeping in touch
with Li Tang frequently.

301
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,039
There's no need to worry.

302
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,960
Li Tang is loyal.

303
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:44,840
And I've sent Lan home.

304
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,119
Nothing bad will happen.

305
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:49,599
Madam Zhen.

306
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,400
Li Tang is arrogant and stubborn.

307
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,960
It took me a long time
to convince him to come here.

308
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:57,280
I only told him that you have
something important to say to him.

309
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,320
I didn't

310
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,960
tell him anything else.

311
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:01,440
You can leave now.

312
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,559
I'll take my leave now.

313
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,039
Mister Li.

314
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:15,599
Please don't call me that.

315
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,520
Although I work at the Lianwei House

316
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,440
and not under your employment,

317
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,119
your social status is higher than mine.

318
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,599
But one's social status can be changed.

319
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:26,640
If we go up the rank,

320
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,799
winner takes all.

321
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,280
If we go down the rank,

322
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,159
life is full of ups and downs

323
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,880
even for the commoners.

324
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:36,280
As a servant,

325
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,559
I'm not an ambitious person.

326
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:40,159
I just want to live in the now.

327
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,640
But Song Daqi keeps inviting me

328
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,840
to come to Jingshu Pavilion.

329
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:45,919
And it has gotten quite annoying.

330
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:47,400
I'm here today

331
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,520
to tell you someone.

332
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,479
Whatever you say to me today,

333
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,960
I'll repeat everything back
to Madam Lian

334
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,180
when I go back to the Lianwei House.

335
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:58,799
If you have nothing else to say,

336
00:15:58,799 --> 00:15:59,679
I'll take my leave now.

337
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:00,799
Wait.

338
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,159
You are indeed someone

339
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,760
who deserves
to be addressed as Mister Li.

340
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,919
With just a few words

341
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,719
after being here,

342
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:17,200
you've proven yourself

343
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,200
to be so much better
than all of my servants and maids.

344
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:23,159
With your capability and intelligence,

345
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,479
it's such a waste

346
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:27,559
for you to be a servant.

347
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:30,599
You must be joking with me.

348
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,060
What else can I be
other than being a servant?

349
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:34,280
As a man,

350
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,599
you can either wield a pen
or wield a sword.

351
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:39,960
You can either fight for ranks

352
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,540
or fight to make achievements.

353
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:56,919
Are you really willing

354
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,080
to be a servant forever?

355
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,119
Your poems

356
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,400
are different from what you are saying.

357
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,440
Your poems sound very aspiring

358
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,479
and ambitious.

359
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:12,439
I...

360
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,280
I just wrote them for fun

361
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,599
when I was alone.

362
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:18,599
It was just a foolish dream.

363
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:21,570
If you don't take the first step,

364
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,479
you will never how far

365
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:24,359
you can go.

366
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,610
I heard that the servants
in Young Master's Mansion

367
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,920
are often recommended to be an official.

368
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,800
Do you want to sink like a rock

369
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
or rise to distinction?

370
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,439
It's all up to you.

371
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,920
Are you saying that...

372
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,760
You will become successful.

373
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,560
And I just want to give you a hand.

374
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,520
If you pledge your loyalty to me,

375
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,660
I'll get you a position

376
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,319
in the court within half a year.

377
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,880
(Lianwei House)

378
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,920
Other than the red bean die

379
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,880
that's more unique,

380
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,119
there's nothing special about this.

381
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:44,040
I also think

382
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,560
that it's just an ordinary thing.

383
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,359
Is that why you agreed so readily?

384
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,800
Although there's nothing special,

385
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:58,359
you've brought me
the thing I asked for.

386
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,920
Now, I can have peace of mind.

387
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:06,599
Don't blame me for being paranoid.

388
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,079
Now, the battle between
me and Luo Qinglian

389
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:11,800
will be decided by our babies.

390
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:13,800
I'm in control of 30%.

391
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,040
But the rest of 70%
is out of my hands.

392
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,959
Although it's great

393
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:20,119
to have you on my side,

394
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:22,239
it's terrifying too.

395
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,239
Terrifying?

396
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,520
If you are so suspicious of me,

397
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,640
you don't have to hire me.

398
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:36,640
Just close the door tightly.

399
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,479
Looks like

400
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,000
you have a short temper.

401
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:43,719
I've made the wrong decision

402
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:45,260
to be used by you for nothing.

403
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,520
You can leave now.

404
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:01,800
Madam.

405
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:03,359
Madam, are you okay?

406
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:06,280
I'm fine.

407
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:09,640
I'm fine.

408
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:11,400
Since you are fine,

409
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,000
I'll get going now.

410
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:15,760
Wait.

411
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,770
If you were just playing the martry,

412
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:21,359
you just had to do your best

413
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,599
to get rid of my child.

414
00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:24,439
You wouldn't have saved me.

415
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:26,959
Was I

416
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,319
wrong about you?

417
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,280
(Jingshu Pavilion)

418
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,119
Madam.

419
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:02,880
I would like to ask you for a favour.

420
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,900
You have a new master now,

421
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,000
are you going to make things convenient

422
00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:13,599
for you to leave?

423
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,239
Before this, Zhiyue told me

424
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:19,370
that you went to Jingshu Pavilion,

425
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,959
I didn't ask you anything.

426
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:22,400
Because I believed

427
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,239
that you wouldn't betray me.

428
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:26,520
But now...

429
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:27,839
Madam.

430
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,520
Madam Zhen did try to convince me

431
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,000
to betray you.

432
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:32,040
But I...

433
00:21:37,439 --> 00:21:38,199
I think

434
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:39,560
that I can be honest with you

435
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,800
because I've been with you for so long.

436
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,160
Lately,

437
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,839
it's true that I've been harboring

438
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:46,239
some resentments.

439
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,230
But after going
to the Jingshu Pavilion twice,

440
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,959
I realise that I've been too naive.

441
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,520
No matter what,

442
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,880
I beg you to give me another chance.

443
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,160
Give you another chance?

444
00:21:58,479 --> 00:21:59,520
You've grown to hate me.

445
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:04,359
You think that I treat you
worse than a dog.

446
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,020
How can I give you another chance?

447
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:09,160
You gave my most precious thing

448
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,079
to my enemy.

449
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,199
How can I give you a chance?

450
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:22,560
You pledged

451
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,880
your loyalty to me.

452
00:22:26,719 --> 00:22:27,359
You said

453
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,560
that you only wanted
to stay in Lianwei House.

454
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,280
You said

455
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:35,239
that we would be a tight-knit team.

456
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:38,119
I trusted your words.

457
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,040
But unfortunately,

458
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:42,119
you can't control your legs.

459
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:43,400
You can't control

460
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,239
your legs from running to another place.

461
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,280
Okay then.

462
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,079
Now, I'll make sure

463
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,599
that your legs will stay put.

464
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,520
Madam.

465
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:52,719
Guards!

466
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,359
Madam.

467
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:55,410
- Madam.
- Beat him up!

468
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:57,319
Luo Qinglian,
you have no right to beat me up!

469
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,400
You reap what you sow.

470
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,760
You only treat me well

471
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,630
while I'm useful for you.

472
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,439
Li Tang!

473
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,040
Beat him up!

474
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,359
Wait.

475
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,839
You are pregnant.

476
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,280
But you want to break

477
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,719
your servant's legs indiscriminately.

478
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,560
Aren't you afraid of karma?

479
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,170
My right-hand man
has been used by others.

480
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,839
That's enough karma for me.

481
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:27,040
Since you are being so straight-forward,

482
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:30,040
I'll be frank with you then.

483
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:31,839
Li Tang belongs

484
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:33,680
to Jingshu Pavilion now.

485
00:23:35,719 --> 00:23:36,599
He belongs to you now?

486
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,370
What makes you do that?

487
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,560
Xu Liangchuan.

488
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:55,959
I'm here to return the thing

489
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,880
that Li Tang took from you.

490
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:03,319
Li Tang is really loyal to you.

491
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,920
He treats the herbal medicine

492
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:06,560
that you take very seriously.

493
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:08,199
He's afraid

494
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:09,370
that something may harm your child.

495
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,439
Since I'm doing prenatal care as well,

496
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,640
he came to me

497
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:14,359
to compare the herbal medicine

498
00:24:15,479 --> 00:24:16,760
to make sure that everything was fine.

499
00:24:18,439 --> 00:24:19,880
This is not what he took from me.

500
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,520
No?

501
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:25,359
What is it then?

502
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,880
It must be something
that you cherish a lot

503
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,560
for you to be so furious

504
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,920
to the point of wanting
to break Li Tang's legs.

505
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,599
Is it

506
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,760
a love token

507
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:49,000
between you and someone else?

508
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:06,880
(Madam.)

509
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,400
(Li Tang...)

510
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:09,479
(He...)

511
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:12,760
Forget it.

512
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,239
Let him go.

513
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,319
He's set on leaving.

514
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,719
I can't make him stay

515
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,479
(even if I want to.)

516
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,580
(Jingshu Pavilion)

517
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:45,070
We heard about this right
after coming back from the temple.

518
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:46,100
What's the situation now?

519
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:47,239
She's having an early labor.

520
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:48,439
The midwife is in there with her.

521
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,239
Why is this happening to her?

522
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,719
Dear God,

523
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,680
please don't let

524
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,920
history repeat itself.

525
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:05,079
Calm down, Young Master.

526
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:06,479
Qinglian's child

527
00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:07,479
is near to full term.

528
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:08,839
And we have Physician Wang here.

529
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,359
The child will be fine this time.

530
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,640
It has to be.

531
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:14,400
His Highness has arrived!

532
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,199
Greetings, Father.

533
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,680
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

534
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,839
Young Master, look.

535
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,030
Congratulations, Your Highness.

536
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,210
Congratulations, Young Master Xin.

537
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,359
Madam Lian has given birth
to a boy.

538
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,920
Both of them are safe.

539
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,870
Let me take a look at him.

540
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,959
Lianxin.

541
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,040
It's a boy.

542
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,800
Zhao'er.

543
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:23,319
Zhao'er.

544
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,599
He Nanzhao.

545
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:27,760
I love this name.

546
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:33,000
Thank you for naming him.

547
00:28:33,439 --> 00:28:35,800
Thank you on behalf of Zhao'er.

548
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,880
He's given a name as soon as he's born.

549
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:40,640
It had never happened before.

550
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,640
Not only I'm giving him a name,

551
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,439
I'm going to grant him a gift.

552
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,280
When he turns three,

553
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:47,599
send him to the Mansion.

554
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:49,199
I'm going to personally teach him

555
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:51,599
how to read, write,
ride a horse and hunt.

556
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:56,920
Thank you, Father.

557
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:58,760
You may rise.

558
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:04,880
I'm going back now.

559
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,040
Take good care of your son.

560
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,680
And take good care of Madam Lian.

561
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:19,719
I'll return to the Mansion now.
No need to see me out.

562
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,199
By the way,

563
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,800
I heard that the position
of the side consort

564
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,280
in the Young Master's Mansion
has been empty for a long time.

565
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:33,839
Now that she has survived,

566
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,719
I think it's time for her to rank up.

567
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,599
Yes, Father.

568
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:45,000
- Have a safe journey, Father.
- Have a safe journey, Your Highness.

569
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:29,680
Here.

570
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,599
This is our son.

571
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:38,959
This is our son.

572
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,880
This is our son.

573
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:47,479
To be able to hold you
like this right now,

574
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,119
I won't hesitate to do it again

575
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:52,760
no matter how much I'll suffer.

576
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,719
It's just a liquor bottle.

577
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:22,719
You've been looking at it for days.

578
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:25,239
But there's nothing.

579
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:29,680
What does Ruan Zhimei want?

580
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:34,800
Madam, look.

581
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,359
What is this?

582
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,040
No matter what it is,

583
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,640
I'm sure it's Madam Mei's weakness.

584
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:00,000
Just now, you said

585
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,230
that you haven't replied to her yet.

586
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:01,959
Yes.

587
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,800
Continue to delay.

588
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,780
Tell her that we didn't have a chance.

589
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:10,400
Ask her to remain calm.

590
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,280
Yes, Madam.

591
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
I want to see

592
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,760
how can she remain arrogant

593
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,520
when I have something

594
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,479
that she wants the most.

595
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:24,800
Madam.

596
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:26,920
This is delivered to each courtyard.

597
00:32:27,439 --> 00:32:28,160
It's a reward for all

598
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,380
in the Young Master's Mansion

599
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:32,270
to celebrate the birth
of Madam Lian's son.

600
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:34,880
Let her enjoy this attention for now.

601
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,119
She's the apple

602
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:38,239
of Young Master's eye now.

603
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,119
But it won't last.

604
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:42,070
In the end, he still cares

605
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,719
about the inheritance more.

606
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,920
(Lord Rui's Mansion)

607
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,119
Be good, Zhao'er. Stop crying.

608
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,839
I've prepared

609
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:54,920
a lot of rarities for you.

610
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:56,959
I'll give them all of you

611
00:32:57,439 --> 00:32:58,400
when you are one year old.

612
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:01,040
Stop crying.

613
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,400
How about I find you

614
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,839
a wife who's as beautiful

615
00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:07,280
as your mother

616
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:08,719
when you grow up?

617
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:10,280
But I don't think it's possible.

618
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,800
I don't think we can find someone

619
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,920
as beautiful as your mother.

620
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:15,000
Stop crying, Zhao'er.

621
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,470
If you are not satisfied with it,

622
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,760
how about I...

623
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,959
If you don't feed him now,

624
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:21,599
he'll only cry harder.

625
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,319
Fine.

626
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,479
Here you go.

627
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:36,000
Look.

628
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,599
He loves his nursemaid

629
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:39,359
more than he loves me.

630
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,079
Milk is all he can think about
right now.

631
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,839
But you've fathered

632
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,680
so many children already.

633
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:46,680
Why does it look like

634
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,880
it's your first time?

635
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,800
In my heart,

636
00:33:50,719 --> 00:33:51,760
this is my first time.

637
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,119
Here.

638
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:03,119
Zhao'er is two months old now.

639
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,520
When will I

640
00:34:05,719 --> 00:34:06,760
have another child?

641
00:34:09,959 --> 00:34:11,640
Someone else is about to give birth.

642
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:12,640
You are going

643
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,639
to be a father again.

644
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:17,199
You know what I'm talking about.

645
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:18,639
Here.

646
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:20,919
Young Master.

647
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,560
Young Master.

648
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:23,930
Madam Zhen has an abdominal pain.

649
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,800
She's about to give birth.

650
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,479
I was right.

651
00:34:28,959 --> 00:34:29,760
I'll go and take a look.

652
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,600
I'll go with you.

653
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:33,560
Stay here

654
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,560
and wait for me to return.

655
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,199
Then, finish this bowl
of nourishing porridge.

656
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,320
Let's go.

657
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,560
(Nan Ruzhen.)

658
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,639
(Finally, this day has arrived.)

659
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,399
(Just like you,)

660
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,959
(I've been waiting a long, long time)

661
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:53,879
(for this.)

662
00:34:57,879 --> 00:34:58,479
Young Master.

663
00:34:58,879 --> 00:35:00,600
Madam Nan is having
a severe abdominal pain.

664
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:02,280
What did the midwife say?

665
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,800
The midwife fainted somehow.

666
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:06,239
Zhihui.

667
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,840
Go and bring us another midwife.

668
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,399
Yes, Madam.

669
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,520
I think it'll be too late.

670
00:35:11,919 --> 00:35:13,000
We can only leave it to God.

671
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,600
Lian'er.

672
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,320
Young Master.

673
00:35:28,439 --> 00:35:29,159
Why are you here?

674
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,239
It's so windy.
Why did you come here?

675
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,679
You can't go in.

676
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:40,399
Stop me

677
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:41,399
if you want her dead.

678
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,600
Madam.

679
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,170
We have news
from Jingshu Pavilion.

680
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:26,590
Nan Ruzhen has a difficult labor.

681
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,770
And the midwife has fainted.

682
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,120
Looks like

683
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:30,959
the child won't survive.

684
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,159
Unfortunately, I can't be there

685
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,360
because I'm ill.

686
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,080
Otherwise,

687
00:36:36,399 --> 00:36:38,360
with how arrogant

688
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,159
she is usually,

689
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,360
I really want to see

690
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,120
how she looks right now.

691
00:36:44,919 --> 00:36:45,439
Madam.

692
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:48,439
I saw Madam Lian

693
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,159
rushing to Jingshu Pavilion just now.

694
00:37:35,479 --> 00:37:36,560
Congratulations, Young Master.

695
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,479
Madam Nan has given birth to a boy.

696
00:37:45,919 --> 00:37:46,719
I...

697
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:51,159
Qinglian.

698
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,840
(Lianwei House)

699
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,919
(Lianwei House)
Young Master didn't even visit Nan Ruzhen.

700
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,159
He stayed here and never left.

701
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:09,399
Those who don't know

702
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:11,639
will think that you are the one
who gave birth.

703
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:14,800
Lian'er.

704
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:19,040
I never thought that you would do that.

705
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,520
That child has to be born.

706
00:38:23,399 --> 00:38:24,919
And I have to do things that are

707
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,570
even more difficult than this.

708
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:29,399
You say that child.

709
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:30,919
What do you think?

710
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:33,439
I think our guess

711
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,239
is just about right.

712
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:38,080
That's great.

713
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,040
Nan Ruzhen has enjoyed herself
for too long.

714
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:44,840
It's so long to the point

715
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,800
that I thought

716
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:49,360
I would never be able to take her down.

717
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,000
But now,

718
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,159
it's different.

719
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:57,760
You.

720
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,919
Bring me a physician right now.

721
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:00,639
You.

722
00:39:00,919 --> 00:39:01,959
Go to the warehouse

723
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:03,159
to get more coals.

724
00:39:03,479 --> 00:39:04,280
Change her blankets too.

725
00:39:04,479 --> 00:39:05,399
Don't make her catch a cold.

726
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:07,239
You. Go to the kitchen

727
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,380
and ask them to cook and send
something nourishing.

728
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,080
- Yes, Young Master.
- Yes, Young Master.

729
00:39:10,399 --> 00:39:10,959
Yes?

730
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,800
You agreed so readily.

731
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,479
Why didn't you stop her

732
00:39:14,879 --> 00:39:16,399
when she did something foolish?

733
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,280
If anything happens to her,

734
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:19,280
I'll punish all of you.

735
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,770
Why are you still standing here?

736
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,040
Go.

737
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,360
- Yes, Young Master.
- Yes, Young Master.

738
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,320
Young Master, that's too tight.

739
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,719
I can't breathe.

740
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,159
Endure it.

741
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,800
Hopefully, you won't

742
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,479
run outside again when it's windy.

743
00:40:06,399 --> 00:40:07,879
I've already completed
my postnatal care.

744
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,520
It's fine to enjoy the breeze.

745
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,840
It was not just the breeze.

746
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,959
Who acted as the midwife

747
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:15,040
and got blood all over herself?

748
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:16,670
You couldn't even stand properly.

749
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,600
I was just a little bit tired.

750
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,439
It was not as serious...

751
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:20,840
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

752
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,239
They are looking at us.

753
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:24,800
If they dare look at us,

754
00:40:25,479 --> 00:40:26,959
I'll gouge their eyes out.

755
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,520
Do you really want me
to gouge your eyes out?

756
00:40:33,879 --> 00:40:34,840
- No, Young Master.
- No, Young Master.

757
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,280
Girl.

758
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,879
I've wronged you.

759
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:44,919
In the past two years,

760
00:40:45,439 --> 00:40:46,800
Ruzhen had indeed acted

761
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,239
like a tyrant in the mansion.

762
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,320
You had suffered a lot

763
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,280
at the secondary courtyard.

764
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,170
I thought that you would
harbor hatred toward her.

765
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,280
Looks like I had worried for nothing.

766
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,600
Lian'er

767
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,600
is the kindest

768
00:41:03,399 --> 00:41:05,080
and magnanimous woman in the world.

769
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,879
I...

770
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:29,879
What's wrong?

771
00:41:33,919 --> 00:41:34,719
I'm thinking that...

772
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:35,399
Young Master.

773
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:36,800
Young Master.

774
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:38,070
Someone from the Mansion

775
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:38,760
asks you to go there.

776
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,380
I'll go to deal with something.

777
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:44,199
It's cold. Go back and rest earlier.

778
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,320
Keep an eye on her.

779
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,239
Take her back earlier
so that she can rest, okay?

780
00:41:52,479 --> 00:41:53,070
Yes, Young Master.

781
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,530
- Let's go.
- Farewell, Young Master.
