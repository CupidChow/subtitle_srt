1
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:50,720
Remember that

2
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,400
you must let her be a concubine.

3
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,599
You mustn't let her be a concubine!

4
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:07,839
Yes, Father.

5
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,440
Son.

6
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:29,520
Did you agree to it?

7
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:32,919
Young Master,

8
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,160
either you are really smart.

9
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,839
Then let's go back

10
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,160
go back for the wedding.

11
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:39,119
No hurry. There's one step more.

12
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,759
One more step to go!

13
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,520
What do you mean?

14
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:43,839
I want to see someone.

15
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,320
When will the moon come?

16
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,279
Ask the sky with wine.

17
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,199
I brought it to you.

18
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,039
You're thinking about Luo Qinglian?

19
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:18,000
No.

20
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,880
You should say that you're missing

21
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,720
he Lianxin's concubine.

22
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,000
My concubine.

23
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,960
You're not as lucky

24
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,399
who are you to

25
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:34,440
to allow her to be your concubine?

26
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,479
How are you qualified

27
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,039
not to let her be my concubine?

28
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:57,639
The clinic and family properties were seized.

29
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,800
Our family became a slave.

30
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:03,759
She is not allowed to become an official.

31
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,720
Or purchase land.

32
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,440
That she is

33
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,839
as inferior as a beggar.

34
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:18,000
To live in humiliation since then.

35
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,479
Not only this life.

36
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,959
Having got through it,

37
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,600
and your descendants.

38
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,559
At this point,

39
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,399
even if it's a woman,

40
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,279
they could even

41
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:32,079
at the cost of their lives.

42
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,160
I guessed right.

43
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:43,959
No, I won't.

44
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,160
I guessed wrong.

45
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:49,679
You don't have a death wish?

46
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:50,640
If you wanted to die,

47
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,720
you wouldn't have stayed

48
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,000
and drag on here.

49
00:04:57,679 --> 00:04:58,559
I don't dare to die.

50
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,720
You don't dare to die.

51
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,320
And dare not break into the mansion.

52
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,359
She said she didn't dare to die.

53
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:06,399
I can't die.

54
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,640
I can't just leave the Lv family

55
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,720
to ignore the Lv family.

56
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:16,720
That's right.

57
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:19,200
I guessed it right!

58
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:23,359
(Lv Beiyi didn't want to die at all,)

59
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:24,760
Because death is the easiest thing to do.

60
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:27,480
Because of your mistakes,

61
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,559
because of your mistakes.

62
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,880
So you want to retrieve it?

63
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,079
Yes

64
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,239
I want to retrieve

65
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,880
Is the lowly status granted by the prince?

66
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,679
Who can retrieve it?

67
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,200
I...

68
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,000
You're married now, Miss Lian.

69
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,119
It's a shame that Mammy Jinfang taught you.

70
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,600
You
you have no sense of propriety.

71
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,959
They send out a litter

72
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,119
and lifted the veil.

73
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:50,040
And you're giving everyone

74
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,119
of everyone.

75
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:53,239
You're right.

76
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,519
She really regards herself as her wife.

77
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,079
Young Master made such a grand gesture.

78
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,640
I think

79
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,480
even if she is not the wife,

80
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,959
she should be at least

81
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:03,959
like I am.

82
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:07,440
I didn't expect her to be but a concubine.

83
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,040
Maids should have their own rules.

84
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:12,359
Please allow me

85
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,079
what are the punishments for breaking the rules?

86
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,679
Twenty times.

87
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:22,920
Come here.

88
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:25,640
Madam is here.

89
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:39,279
Please allow me to greet you.

90
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,799
No need to be so formal.

91
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,799
So you're Luo Qinglian?

92
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:52,440
Her spirit is really beautiful.

93
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,559
No wonder you like her.

94
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,160
No matter how much Young Master likes it,

95
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,679
rules are rules.

96
00:07:58,239 --> 00:07:59,679
Since this is your first offence,

97
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:01,160
I'll change it from 20 to

98
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,920
from 20 to 10.

99
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,760
What do you think, sister?

100
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,480
Greetings to Madam.

101
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,760
I broke the rules.

102
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:11,600
I haven't punished enough.

103
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:13,119
Please make the decision.

104
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:14,480
Please expel me

105
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,519
and continue to be Young Master Zuo's slave.

106
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,239
Miss Lian,

107
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,200
do you think

108
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
like playing house?

109
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,279
While you are tied,

110
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:27,760
of course I don't want to marry.

111
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,440
But no one

112
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,959
no one is willing to.

113
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,079
You are willing to share life and death with one person.

114
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,839
Now that you're married, you can adapt to circumstances.

115
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,280
In the future,

116
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,760
that are unreasonable

117
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,960
and useless words.

118
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:45,799
Although Miss Lian has violated the rules,

119
00:08:46,119 --> 00:08:46,919
that depends on

120
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,760
to punish you or not.

121
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:51,039
You both are not insensible.

122
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,559
How many times do I have to say it?

123
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,599
About my own duty.

124
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,919
I will follow your instructions.

125
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,479
Your Ladyship,

126
00:08:58,239 --> 00:08:58,919
may I know

127
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,479
you married your concubine

128
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:02,239
took in a concubine?

129
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,159
You've fulfilled your duty

130
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,479
a son?

131
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:09,559
What did you do?

132
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:10,880
His own reasons.

133
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,159
It's not our place to judge.

134
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,640
But I think

135
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,840
miss Lian is right.

136
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:17,640
Sister,

137
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:19,719
what are you trying to say?

138
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:23,119
Childe wanted to steal my father's woman.

139
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:24,799
Let's really not

140
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,080
let him do as he likes.

141
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,719
And wait for father to blame her?

142
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,719
I think

143
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:31,919
what Madam Yao said is right.

144
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:33,599
Please think twice.

145
00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:36,640
Please think twice.

146
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,080
Your Highness, here's my order.

147
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,760
The prince has ordered that

148
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,719
and bestow the marriage of Third Prince

149
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:11,359
to be Third Young Master He Lian's concubine.

150
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,919
And don't disobey

151
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,640
I didn't put up with your order.

152
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:01,640
Brother Yi.

153
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:02,919
Brother Yi.

154
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:08,440
Open the door!

155
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,960
He'll be right here.

156
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,719
Get ready to sleep with you, Miss Lian.

157
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,400
Today is the wedding day.

158
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:14,520
It's better not

159
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,799
thinking about other things.

160
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,919
Who wants to sleep with me?

161
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,400
Open the door!

162
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,719
Why do you lock me up?

163
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:26,039
If you get away

164
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,719
get away from me,

165
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:30,640
am I still He Lianxin?

166
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,520
Young Master Xin,

167
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,000
we are both sensible people.

168
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:37,200
Can you talk openly

169
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,159
you can tell me honestly.

170
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:39,559
Right?

171
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,799
Are you

172
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:50,359
looking for this?

173
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,640
I knew it.

174
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:57,320
That I would get married.

175
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:58,359
Little girl,

176
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:00,200
what else can I expect?

177
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:03,799
I only promised you to choose a servant girl.

178
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,080
But it wasn't my fault that I wasn't chosen.

179
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,799
What's the deal between us?

180
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,159
Can we close it now?

181
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:09,679
Done with?

182
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,039
Right now,

183
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,119
what else can't we get married?

184
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:13,960
However,

185
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,080
I haven't hired you yet.

186
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,000
You should

187
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:19,039
to compensate you with many gifts.

188
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,039
The first one?

189
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,320
Father said that

190
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,520
he couldn't treat you like a concubine.

191
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:25,359
We're husband and wife.

192
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,520
I'll reward you with this.

193
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,559
Sleep with me tonight.

194
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,119
I can't.

195
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,599
I have 100 ways

196
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:32,599
I have 100 ways

197
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:33,320
that can deal with you.

198
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,440
To deal with me?

199
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,440
Didn't you want the second gift

200
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:42,760
the second gift?

201
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:49,080
You make fun of me?

202
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:52,200
Please let me finish.

203
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,119
No one is as bad-tempered as a concubine.

204
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:57,599
We are husband and wife.

205
00:12:57,599 --> 00:12:58,719
I can't threaten you

206
00:12:58,719 --> 00:13:00,280
your family to threaten you,

207
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,000
right?

208
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,919
The second gift.

209
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:20,359
All right.

210
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,559
This time,

211
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:23,640
there's no barrier between us.

212
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,760
No need.

213
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:30,960
I can't change the marriage granted by the prince.

214
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,960
Then I can be rewarded

215
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,119
a repudiation paper is enough.

216
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,000
Evil inn. A bad inn that burns the bridge after crossing it.

217
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,559
My dear,

218
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,000
do you know what I

219
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,200
to get you?

220
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,479
More than that.

221
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,919
The first time

222
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,080
to play tricks

223
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,039
play tricks

224
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,760
he Lianxin,

225
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,000
you tried so hard to get me back.

226
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,119
All you want is

227
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:05,640
to put in a few good words

228
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,799
In front of His Highness.

229
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,400
Don't worry.

230
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,359
I won't say anything nice.

231
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,200
If you give me a chance,

232
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,159
I will tell you

233
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:16,000
the whole truth.

234
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:22,880
Thinking about Lv Beiyi?

235
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:26,359
When you see the third gift,

236
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,719
then tell me whether you want to leave or not.

237
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:57,200
What's wrong?

238
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,719
I asked you to clean the horse manure

239
00:14:58,719 --> 00:14:59,440
even if you can't do it well,

240
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,520
hold him up.

241
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:03,960
Yes

242
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:15,359
pick it up by hand.

243
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:30,159
Brother Yi,

244
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,159
don't pick it up!

245
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,880
Why did you do this to him?

246
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,000
Little human.

247
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,640
Son,

248
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,039
I just think he...

249
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,280
He doesn't look like anything.

250
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,719
That's why I wanted

251
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,359
to teach him a lesson.

252
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:51,880
Leave.

253
00:16:00,479 --> 00:16:01,200
Brother Yi,

254
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:04,000
what are you thinking?

255
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:07,760
So what?

256
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:09,280
He treated you like that,

257
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:11,599
how could you let him do that?

258
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,840
Lv Beiyi,

259
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,320
(Great ambition and great ability.)

260
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,960
Is filled with millions and millions

261
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,520
and challenges.

262
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:25,359
As long as I have the chance

263
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,599
to speak for you,

264
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,239
she will ask for forgiveness.

265
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:33,840
You

266
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,280
what do you want me to do?

267
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:44,599
You...

268
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:49,400
You want to hold Lian'er in check?

269
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:55,919
I have just

270
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:57,039
for the mistakes I made.

271
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,039
I deserve to be punished.

272
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:06,799
Brother Yi.

273
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:11,359
You

274
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,319
he Lianxin, what are you doing?

275
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,680
Let go of me!

276
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,680
What trick did you use?

277
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,160
The woman I He Lianxin

278
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:44,920
shed tears

279
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,839
for other men.

280
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:49,880
From today on,

281
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:52,479
you are free to not cooperate with me,

282
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,040
you can scold me or hurt me.

283
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,239
But I can guarantee that

284
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,280
lv Beiyi will not survive

285
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:06,920
(and won't survive till the next day.)

286
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:07,439
Please

287
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,439
just go.

288
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:32,319
Madam, please sleep.

289
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:37,920
My Lord, he won't come.

290
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,880
He will.

291
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:42,560
I went to get him.

292
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:44,479
Young Master said he was not in a good mood.

293
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,719
To go to bed early.

294
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,959
In bad mood

295
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:03,040
It's because you didn't sleep with her?

296
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,280
Here comes My Lord.

297
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,040
Second Brother.

298
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,479
Second Brother.

299
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:15,560
No.

300
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:16,520
From the guest.

301
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:18,520
Yanyi is here too.

302
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:19,599
Second brother is here.

303
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,640
If he doesn't get the title soon,

304
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:22,479
I came here

305
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,959
came early

306
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:25,839
to celebrate the investiture of Yinzhen

307
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:33,640
open it.

308
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:43,839
How could Yinzhen

309
00:20:46,439 --> 00:20:47,640
how can Yinzhen deserve this?

310
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,920
You will almost become a Marquis.

311
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:51,119
That you dare to accept this?

312
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,400
Just accept it.

313
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,839
Even if it's an expensive gift,

314
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,760
but father

315
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:02,760
he gifted me boxes after boxes.

316
00:21:03,239 --> 00:21:03,959
If I don't send them out,

317
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:05,680
she couldn't leave it at home.

318
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:07,400
That's right.

319
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:09,760
And conferring titles

320
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,199
are just rewards from father.

321
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,920
In father's heart,

322
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:13,920
no one

323
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,880
can compare with Second Brother.

324
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:19,680
Yinzhen,

325
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:22,640
what do you mean by that?

326
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:24,920
Why can't I understand?

327
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:28,959
Fifth Brother.

328
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,400
Second Brother.

329
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:31,959
Do you understand

330
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,479
second brother.

331
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,160
Second Brother wouldn't understand.

332
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,680
How dare Yanyi know that?

333
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,520
Have a seat.

334
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:42,800
Sit down and talk.

335
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:44,439
Second brother.

336
00:21:56,199 --> 00:21:56,520
Not bad.

337
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,199
Second Brother,

338
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,400
will I be part of the Noble Consort this time?

339
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,800
It's not you.

340
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:06,959
Who else could it be?

341
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,439
But I know that someone

342
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,160
someone read the knighted list secretly.

343
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,479
Really?

344
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,479
Who are those?

345
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,839
Three of them.

346
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,880
The boss is Commandery Prince of Julu.

347
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:30,439
As for the Guardian General,

348
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:31,880
Is Fifth Brother.

349
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,199
Father had never liked Eldest Brother.

350
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:37,760
Yanyi has military merits

351
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:39,560
the title of Town Guard General

352
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,640
be entitled to a title of Town Guard General.

353
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,280
Although it's a noble title,

354
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,319
whose rank is at the bottom,

355
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,439
however,

356
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:46,359
you are a general after all.

357
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,880
The most important thing

358
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,800
Is General Zhao De.

359
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,359
Second brother, it wasn't me.

360
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,439
It's impossible.

361
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,839
The third one

362
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,560
It's San.

363
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,640
It's San.

364
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,680
How could it be him?

365
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,520
This

366
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,119
Idle Young Master.

367
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,520
He didn't do anything wrong.

368
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:17,839
However,

369
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:19,479
but isn't that

370
00:23:19,719 --> 00:23:20,719
he didn't do anything.

371
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,079
That was the past.

372
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,119
And what happens in the future.

373
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:28,400
Maybe my father

374
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,959
to do more

375
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,520
yinzhen,

376
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,839
what you said is implicit.

377
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:46,760
Because Luo Qinglian

378
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,239
a lot like my mother.

379
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,000
Second brother, please have some tea.

380
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:12,079
How could it be Third Brother?

381
00:24:14,439 --> 00:24:15,920
He has never wanted to inherit the title.

382
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,680
I'm not even prepared for this.

383
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,439
My Lord,

384
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,479
It's not too late to prepare.

385
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,640
Go on.

386
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:28,280
I have a fellow townsman

387
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,280
when I was working as your maid.

388
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,319
A very unpleasant life.

389
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:35,280
What about you?

390
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,640
Where are you going, Miss Lian?

391
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,239
Where else could I go?

392
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,760
Now that I'm married to the Prince,

393
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,760
I must greet the legitimate wife

394
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,880
to greet the legitimate wife.

395
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,439
Miss Lian, so you've decided?

396
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,560
Great!

397
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,680
Madam told me that

398
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,560
you've figured it out?

399
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,119
We don't need to

400
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:53,000
to stay here.

401
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:14,000
Be careful

402
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,640
what a lousy cat!

403
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,479
I'll punish you for hurting her.

404
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,680
Dongli,

405
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,640
what brings you here?

406
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:29,319
My Lady.

407
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:31,439
Young Master Xin sent someone to see Master

408
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,040
and asked Master to assign a maidservant

409
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,079
to serve the lady next to him.

410
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,479
I didn't expect that

411
00:25:35,479 --> 00:25:36,599
mr. Xin treats her

412
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:37,400
Is nice to her.

413
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,479
My Lady, Young Master Lyu is missing.

414
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:45,839
I know.

415
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:46,599
I know.

416
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,959
Why aren't you worried at all?

417
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:59,000
She has had a change of heart.

418
00:26:00,479 --> 00:26:02,000
And become...

419
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,680
Marry me now.

420
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,400
You came at the right time.

421
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,760
Only you can help me.

422
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:12,000
Come on.

423
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,199
Madam, don't be afraid.

424
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:25,040
I was scared to death.

425
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,239
Hui'er's cat

426
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:27,280
Is always so violent.

427
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,319
Pompoms are naughty.

428
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,599
I even saw it

429
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,959
I even saw it hit a flowerpot

430
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,560
and almost hit Miss Lian.

431
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:36,079
It's Luo Qinglian.

432
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:37,079
Yes

433
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,319
greetings to my legitimate wife.

434
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:51,359
I pay respect to you, ladies and gentlemen,

435
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,400
good health to you.

436
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,839
You're really more obedient.

437
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,560
We'll all be sisters in the future.

438
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:02,359
We should be close.

439
00:27:03,479 --> 00:27:04,119
The Drunken Willow.

440
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,599
Let me introduce her to you.

441
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:06,640
Yes

442
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,119
according to the Prince's style,

443
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,959
has one legitimate wife, two daughters and four concubines.

444
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:14,119
A total of seven madams

445
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:15,359
as the legitimate wife,

446
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:16,560
miss Lian has met them.

447
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,959
The two ladies on the sidelines are

448
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:21,079
mrs. Yao and Mrs. Mo.

449
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:26,000
There are only three illegitimate daughters now.

450
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,719
This is Mrs. Song.

451
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,920
This is Mrs. Ye.

452
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,119
And Madam Rou.

453
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:36,359
That she hasn't been feeling well recently

454
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,479
she has not visited me for a few days.

455
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,400
Illegitimate daughter

456
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:41,359
Is subject to the rules

457
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,839
are they not counted?

458
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,800
Is the most

459
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,920
who ranked the last...

460
00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:46,119
Understood.

461
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,119
I have just joined you, Your Highness.

462
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,920
I still don't understand the rules.

463
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,719
I still need your advice

464
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:54,079
as much as I can.

465
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,719
Where's Yao?

466
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,599
I punished a maid on the way here.

467
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:03,479
That's why I was late.

468
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:08,839
Greetings, Madam.

469
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:13,199
Greetings to you, Madam.

470
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:14,119
Take a seat.

471
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,040
She gave a proper gift.

472
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,400
I'm sorry.

473
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,880
Peony is the king of flowers.

474
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,160
Only the legitimate wife can wear it.

475
00:28:57,239 --> 00:28:58,880
I am improper.

476
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:00,359
I hope you can punish me.

477
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,160
He made so much progress

478
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:04,839
overnight.

479
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,319
We're all sisters.

480
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:06,959
Stand up.

481
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:09,359
You don't need to be so polite anymore.

482
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,359
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

483
00:29:16,479 --> 00:29:17,359
You're broad-minded.

484
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,400
I contradicted you last night.

485
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,439
And you didn't fuss with me.

486
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,119
Thank you very much.

487
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,719
Though I shouldn't have offended you,

488
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,880
but it's better than feigned affection.

489
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,239
You said it was regret.

490
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:31,520
Is that true?

491
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,520
I thought about it the whole night.

492
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,000
I think what you said is right.

493
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,959
If we can't fight against it,

494
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,319
then make peace

495
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,160
that's a basic life.
It's...

496
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:42,920
That's good.

497
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,839
You have to remember that

498
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,400
the biggest responsibility here

499
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:46,640
Is to serve him.

500
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:49,160
I won't let anyone in the future.

501
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,920
For you anymore.

502
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:51,599
Just forget the things

503
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,479
just forget it.

504
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,680
I'll follow your instructions.

505
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,400
You too.

506
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:58,760
If you should forget it,

507
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:02,359
I will follow your instructions.

508
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:05,959
Pompoms died.

509
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:06,959
Hui, why are you crying?

510
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,680
Pompous is dead.

511
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,920
Someone killed my pompoms.

512
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,000
What are they?

513
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,040
Don't cry, dear.

514
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,800
Hui'er, don't cry.

515
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,079
Concubine Yao has just heard something.

516
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,640
There's no one to blame

517
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,280
your pompous ball ran about

518
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,640
and almost hit the flower pot.

519
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,920
And hit your Concubine Lian.

520
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:28,800
It's her first time visiting her.

521
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:29,880
I was just worried

522
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,359
bring a gift for our first meeting.

523
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:33,239
It's you.

524
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:36,119
Without evidence,

525
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,040
she will not admit it.

526
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:51,839
I'm sorry.

527
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,280
I've always been afraid of cats since I was a child.

528
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:56,880
I was really panicked.

529
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,079
And pushed it.

530
00:30:58,719 --> 00:30:59,640
I didn't expect that

531
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:01,560
pompoms have just died.

532
00:31:06,719 --> 00:31:07,719
I hope you can forgive her.

533
00:31:08,479 --> 00:31:10,079
You're the one who killed Pompoms.

534
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:11,280
You'll pay with your life!

535
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,599
You'll pay with your life!

536
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,719
You killed Pompoms,

537
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:17,000
you'll pay with your life.

538
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:17,839
Hui'er, stop it!

539
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,439
Come here.

540
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,680
Stop crying. Come.

541
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,760
The first time I saw Miss Lian

542
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,520
the first time I saw you.

543
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:31,199
At this point, I like the cat

544
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
for killing Hui'er's cat,

545
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,400
but my sincerity

546
00:31:35,439 --> 00:31:36,520
was very precious.

547
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:38,000
Stand up.

548
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:39,880
Thank you, Madam.

549
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:43,359
Your sister Yao is the one

550
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,160
who found her first?

551
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:46,920
Why are you so surprised?

552
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:50,239
Childe's cat died.

553
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,400
The murderer got away with it.

554
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,760
Please...

555
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,959
I was surprised of course.

556
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,079
Good Hui.

557
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,439
Welcome to Miss He Lian.

558
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,319
She's special

559
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,920
a pair of gold jade bracelets,

560
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:28,760
a pair of white jade inlaid with gold and Ruyi.

561
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:30,959
A necklace of jadeite jade.

562
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,040
Ten branches of silk flowers,

563
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:35,000
a pair of cloisonne vases,

564
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,560
four bolts of fine satin.

565
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:40,199
Thank you for your appreciation.

566
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,520
Both Su Nanchun

567
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,599
are both concubines.

568
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,000
These are gold, silver and jade beads.

569
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,160
Why are you so short of clothing

570
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,280
and clothes?

571
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,199
Zhiye.

572
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,280
These are not the funds that were granted.

573
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,319
This is the reward

574
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,800
from Childe Wen.

575
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:21,800
Everything is ready.

576
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,719
Everything is ready?

577
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,640
I still have a few old clothes.

578
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:41,839
What is your intention

579
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:42,520
for what?

580
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:44,959
So I came in such a hurry,

581
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:46,359
and I only brought one piece of clothing.

582
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:47,479
She couldn't even wash it for a change.

583
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,680
What about the satin?

584
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:54,400
I don't want to take these

585
00:33:54,719 --> 00:33:56,079
to feel sorry for you,

586
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,520
Instead,

587
00:33:58,479 --> 00:34:00,400
so I want to change these old clothes.

588
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,000
If it's new or not, some are old.

589
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,119
Just take them if you don't mind.

590
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,599
Thank you.

591
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,120
I won't bother you then.

592
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:17,239
Hold on.

593
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,080
Thank you for your kindness.

594
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,439
Take this back.

595
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,520
The fine satin is indeed precious,

596
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,560
but these old clothes of mine

597
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,760
are not shabby either.

598
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,239
All the houses

599
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,560
It's not a bad thing

600
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,159
It's not a bad thing.

601
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,879
Being difficult

602
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,040
means peace and quiet.

603
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,600
Thank you for your advice.

604
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,080
Be careful.

605
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,719
She is

606
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,959
gentle and demure. She is neither humble nor overbearing.

607
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:58,120
She is a good person.

608
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:01,639
Dongli.

609
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:07,479
Give this back to them.

610
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:08,239
That

611
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:09,360
my family

612
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,280
has arrived.

613
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,000
When did you send them?

614
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,199
I didn't want to involve them.

615
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:19,360
Yes

616
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,360
why return a few old clothes?

617
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:41,280
I told you to watch Dongli.

618
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,320
Have you found any?

619
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:44,120
First she was wandering

620
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:46,639
and stopped in the middle of it.

621
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,919
Then he went to the kitchen to ask for some food.

622
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:50,959
She was quite clever

623
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,360
I lost track of her for a long time

624
00:35:53,879 --> 00:35:55,040
after that,

625
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,600
I saw her chatting

626
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,600
with a servant.

627
00:35:58,679 --> 00:35:59,439
Why are there all of you

628
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:00,600
people who don't care about anything.

629
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,479
Which servant?

630
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,199
He looks like a servant who guards the gate.

631
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,320
A servant who guards the door.

632
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,239
Food and clothes.

633
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,280
Luo Qinglian wants to escape.

634
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,040
Dongli,

635
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,399
wait in the yard.

636
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,760
I have something to tell Miss Lian.

637
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:34,800
Are you still here?

638
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:37,320
Yes

639
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,719
childe.

640
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:42,800
It's so late.

641
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:44,080
He should have asked a servant to keep him company.

642
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:45,360
Listen to Mother,

643
00:36:45,439 --> 00:36:47,120
and stop me from avenging Pompball.

644
00:36:47,399 --> 00:36:48,280
It's good now.

645
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:48,800
Come on.

646
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:50,239
Let's go and ask father to reason.

647
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,600
Young Master,

648
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,919
concubine Lian is busy today,

649
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,840
I really can't.

650
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,639
I can't.

651
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,600
Pompoms can't be like this!

652
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,679
Pompoms died for nothing.

653
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,959
I want my father to make the decision.

654
00:36:57,959 --> 00:36:59,719
And ask him to punish you severely.

655
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,360
You shall not run away.

656
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,080
Do you really not remember me?

657
00:37:04,479 --> 00:37:06,040
The higher up you go, the more lonely you feel.

658
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,399
Those kids from ordinary families

659
00:37:07,919 --> 00:37:09,040
might be much happier than you are.

660
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,479
It's you.

661
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,479
I'm not even afraid of cats.

662
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:18,800
Even if I'm afraid of cats,

663
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:20,760
I'll never kill Pompoms.

664
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:23,840
I believe in you.

665
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,959
Who? Who killed Pompoms?

666
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,239
I know.

667
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,199
To know that

668
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:34,040
very sad now.

669
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,120
A person's life is life,

670
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,199
a cat's life is also a life.

671
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,080
Not to mention

672
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,919
I've been with you for so long.

673
00:37:42,479 --> 00:37:43,479
But don't worry.

674
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:45,360
What goes around comes around.

675
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,320
No matter who it is,

676
00:37:46,919 --> 00:37:48,239
when the truth comes out.

677
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:48,800
No.

678
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,719
I want to know who it is now.

679
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,800
Who is it?

680
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,239
It's her. It must be her.

681
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:03,959
Miss.

682
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:04,479
Hui'er.

683
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,120
Miss. Miss.

684
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:06,840
Stop chasing me!

685
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:07,639
No way!

686
00:38:07,879 --> 00:38:08,959
He is very emotional now.

687
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:09,760
I'm afraid something bad might happen.

688
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,679
We're ready.

689
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,360
I'm afraid it's too late if we don't leave now.

690
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:17,679
Your Ladyship.

691
00:38:18,479 --> 00:38:19,879
Both of them left Yunyun Building.

692
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,080
Come on.

693
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,280
We can't release Young Master's men.

694
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,040
It's you who killed Pompon!

695
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:31,000
You're wrong.

696
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,040
It was Luo Qinglian.

697
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,479
No... It's not her!

698
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:35,840
You evil woman, evil woman!

699
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:37,080
I'm going to tell my father.

700
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,080
You evil woman.

701
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,399
And ask him never to see you again!

702
00:38:39,399 --> 00:38:40,840
Are you crazy? Stop it!

703
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,800
Give it back to me!

704
00:38:47,439 --> 00:38:48,679
Are you out of your mind?

705
00:38:54,439 --> 00:38:55,360
Madam.

706
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:57,760
Is it you who killed Pompoms?

707
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:02,159
Right?

708
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:08,479
Hui'er.

709
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,679
Hui son.

710
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,120
He...

711
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:21,840
He...

712
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,639
He...

713
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:26,479
He's dead!

714
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:31,239
What...

715
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,199
What have I done?

716
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,040
What did I do?

717
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:35,719
Get rid of Luo Qinglian.

718
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:38,919
I... I was afraid that

719
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:40,040
and affect Her Ladyship.

720
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,239
Your Madam would treat you like that

721
00:39:46,439 --> 00:39:47,360
and loyal to her.

722
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,360
I'm going to surrender myself to Young Master.

723
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:56,479
Your Ladyship, wait!

724
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,879
Your Ladyship, you don't need to surrender yourself.

725
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:07,639
Instead of turning herself in.

726
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:11,719
What did you say

727
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,840
I just came out

728
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,080
he was leaving Miss Lian.

729
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:15,679
And Miss Lian was about to leave.

730
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,399
This is a perfect opportunity.

731
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:18,280
We only need to

732
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,520
send the body of the young master

733
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,439
to Yunyun Building.

734
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:24,479
Is that okay?

735
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,280
Your Ladyship.

736
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,360
I'd rather

737
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,399
It's better to let her run away.

738
00:40:27,399 --> 00:40:28,600
It's better to catch her and plead not guilty.

739
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,520
It'll only bring trouble.

740
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,159
Your Ladyship.

741
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,000
Young Master went in the direction of the horse barn.

742
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:38,399
Now they

743
00:40:38,399 --> 00:40:39,560
they can't run away now.

744
00:40:39,879 --> 00:40:40,479
Let's catch them.

745
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,639
To kill them.

746
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,080
Catch the ball before the bound

747
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,399
If we wait for her to expose her,

748
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,520
everything will be too late.

749
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,000
Wake up, Hui'er.

750
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:18,840
Mother is calling you.

751
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:21,399
Wake up.

752
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,439
Wake up.

753
00:41:35,479 --> 00:41:36,280
My son.

754
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,399
Our son died.

755
00:41:41,439 --> 00:41:42,760
Hui'er died.

756
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:45,560
Our only son died.

757
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,560
Hui'er died.

758
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:51,199
Hui'er is dead.
