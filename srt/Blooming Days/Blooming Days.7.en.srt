In the world,

18
00:01:52,565 --> 00:01:53,525
people will be nice to you

19
00:01:54,165 --> 00:01:55,205
if you have value.

20
00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:57,125
If not, you'll be abandoned.

21
00:01:59,685 --> 00:02:00,485
Does that include

22
00:02:01,285 --> 00:02:02,165
Madam De?

23
00:02:03,485 --> 00:02:04,045
What?

24
00:02:06,925 --> 00:02:07,845
You keep calling your mother

25
00:02:08,565 --> 00:02:09,405
while you were dreaming.

26
00:02:15,485 --> 00:02:16,405
It's not Madam De.

27
00:02:24,285 --> 00:02:25,725
You'd better forget

28
00:02:26,965 --> 00:02:28,045
everything that you heard.

29
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:32,320
I'm not interested in remembering it.

30
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:33,885
I just want to let you know

31
00:02:34,605 --> 00:02:36,560
that there are many people
who take relationships seriously.

32
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,045
People are not as cold as you think.

33
00:02:40,365 --> 00:02:41,565
Are you talking about Lv Beiyi?

34
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:53,685
Yes.

35
00:02:54,645 --> 00:02:55,845
He may be willing to die for you,

36
00:02:57,805 --> 00:02:58,925
but you may not be

37
00:02:58,925 --> 00:03:00,005
the most important to him.

38
00:03:01,245 --> 00:03:02,445
To Lv Beiyi,

39
00:03:05,005 --> 00:03:07,765
his life is only the third
most important thing to him.

40
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,805
You're not the most important
to him either.

41
00:03:10,325 --> 00:03:11,165
Fame and power is.

42
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:19,965
Girl,

43
00:03:21,085 --> 00:03:22,045
I'll make a bet with you.

44
00:03:22,765 --> 00:03:23,685
One day,

45
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,885
you'll know that I am right.

46
00:03:28,285 --> 00:03:29,805
Don't let me see you the day you end up

47
00:03:30,365 --> 00:03:31,205
crying alone.

48
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:34,765
Don't worry,

49
00:03:35,085 --> 00:03:36,125
there won't be such a day.

50
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:54,685
Lv Village is right ahead.

51
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:56,725
This is where you
agreed to meet Ms. Lian.

52
00:03:58,005 --> 00:03:59,485
My old house is in front.

53
00:04:00,485 --> 00:04:02,205
I think my family is living here

54
00:04:03,365 --> 00:04:04,525
after our place was seized.

55
00:04:05,365 --> 00:04:06,165
I wonder if Ms. Lian

56
00:04:06,165 --> 00:04:07,125
managed to escape.

57
00:04:07,645 --> 00:04:09,240
I wonder if she'll get here
in time tomorrow.

58
00:04:14,285 --> 00:04:14,885
Mr. Lv.

("The pain of being in the outcast status
is more important than life and death.)

61
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,205

63
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:52,405
You two, search over there!

64
00:05:03,965 --> 00:05:04,805
Come here! Over here!

65
00:05:14,205 --> 00:05:14,565
Sir,

66
00:05:15,005 --> 00:05:16,885
the soldiers tailing the leper were killed.

67
00:05:16,925 --> 00:05:18,045
It must be them. Let's go.

68
00:05:18,645 --> 00:05:19,365
Yes.

69
00:05:26,045 --> 00:05:26,525
What's wrong?

70
00:05:26,805 --> 00:05:28,440
I was told to pass on a message
from your brother.

71
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,040
that they've found traces of Young Master.

72
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,444
They should be able
to get hold of him soon.

73
00:05:31,445 --> 00:05:32,160
At the same time,

74
00:05:32,205 --> 00:05:33,045
he wants me

75
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:34,085
to ask you once again

76
00:05:34,205 --> 00:05:35,560
whether you have changed your mind.

77
00:05:35,565 --> 00:05:36,685
Should we go ahead as planned?

78
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:48,885
Tell him nothing has changed.

79
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:49,765
Go ahead.

80
00:05:50,165 --> 00:05:50,525
Yes.

81
00:06:00,365 --> 00:06:00,925
I

82
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:01,845
made a deal

83
00:06:01,845 --> 00:06:02,605
to meet them here.

84
00:06:02,605 --> 00:06:06,630
(Lv Village)

85
00:06:06,725 --> 00:06:08,000
Then we shall part ways here.

86
00:06:08,365 --> 00:06:09,245
When I go back,

87
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:09,845
I will tell them

88
00:06:09,845 --> 00:06:11,085
you died saving me.

89
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,165
My father will be sad for a while,

90
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,205
but he won't ask questions.

91
00:06:16,405 --> 00:06:17,085
Starting from today,

92
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:18,965
you two

93
00:06:19,405 --> 00:06:21,485
should travel around the world together.

94
00:06:22,765 --> 00:06:23,845
I'm thankful

95
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,285
that you're willing to change your mind
to fulfill our wishes.

96
00:06:30,965 --> 00:06:32,565
However, you are badly injured.

97
00:06:33,005 --> 00:06:34,205
Allow us to first

98
00:06:34,205 --> 00:06:35,365
send you back to your mansion.

99
00:06:37,245 --> 00:06:38,605
I'm not fulfilling your wishes.

100
00:06:39,205 --> 00:06:40,725
I'm just repaying you
for saving my life.

101
00:06:41,685 --> 00:06:42,365
I won't accept it

102
00:06:42,365 --> 00:06:43,245
no matter what you do.

103
00:06:43,245 --> 00:06:44,325
I'm even less interested

104
00:06:44,325 --> 00:06:46,160
to watch the two of you
displaying your affection.

105
00:06:59,245 --> 00:06:59,645
I'm leaving.

106
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:01,125
Ms. Lian!

107
00:07:02,205 --> 00:07:02,765
Dongli.

108
00:07:05,005 --> 00:07:06,805
Dongli, where is Yi?

109
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:09,405
Where's Yi?

110
00:07:10,245 --> 00:07:11,125
Mr. Lv.

111
00:07:26,285 --> 00:07:28,405
Ms. Lian, stop kneeling.

112
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:30,405
You've been here for a long time.

113
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:32,925
His whole family

114
00:07:35,165 --> 00:07:36,645
died because of their status.

115
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:41,765
It's all my fault.

116
00:07:44,045 --> 00:07:45,405
They died because of me.

117
00:07:46,405 --> 00:07:47,405
All because of me.

118
00:07:53,165 --> 00:07:53,645
Get up.

119
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:56,445
You won't be able to bring them back to life,
no matter how much you blame yourself.

120
00:07:56,445 --> 00:07:56,845
Dongli.

121
00:08:34,045 --> 00:08:35,645
Ms. Lian, stop doing it.

122
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:36,925
Your hands are bleeding.

123
00:08:49,365 --> 00:08:51,045
My woman is not allowed
to do work like this.

124
00:08:51,285 --> 00:08:52,125
I'm not your woman.

125
00:08:52,205 --> 00:08:53,005
You still are for now.

126
00:09:04,485 --> 00:09:05,245
No need to be upset.

127
00:09:05,965 --> 00:09:06,565
Soon,

128
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:08,925
you will get what you wish.

129
00:09:19,445 --> 00:09:21,245
Will Mr. Lv still come back?

130
00:09:22,005 --> 00:09:23,445
Will he hate Ms. Lian?

131
00:09:24,845 --> 00:09:25,605
If he returns,

132
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:28,160
I will be forever thankful

133
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:30,045
and repay him for the rest of my life.

134
00:09:32,925 --> 00:09:33,885
If he doesn't,

135
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,165
I won't blame him either.

136
00:09:37,365 --> 00:09:38,840
I will help him for the rest of my life.

137
00:09:50,845 --> 00:09:51,845
How do you plan to do that?

138
00:10:00,245 --> 00:10:00,965
I'll do anything,

139
00:10:02,325 --> 00:10:04,445
as long as he wants it
and it's within my power.

140
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:06,685
Outcast status?

141
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:10,080
So what if he's in the outcast status?

142
00:10:12,365 --> 00:10:13,005
If you...

143
00:10:16,605 --> 00:10:18,125
If you are willing to come back with me

144
00:10:20,405 --> 00:10:23,165
and I succeed one day,

145
00:10:25,205 --> 00:10:26,805
his outcast status will be altered.

146
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:37,885
Please protect us, Buddha.

147
00:10:54,365 --> 00:10:55,005
Be careful!

148
00:10:55,005 --> 00:10:55,565
Ms. Lian!

149
00:11:15,165 --> 00:11:15,605
Kill them!

150
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:32,845
Be careful!

151
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:46,645
Get them!

152
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:49,445
Kill them!

153
00:11:49,965 --> 00:11:53,925
Go!

154
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:04,085
Lianxin!

155
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:05,885
Lianxin!

156
00:12:07,805 --> 00:12:08,685
Brat.

157
00:12:09,085 --> 00:12:10,045
If you were any later,

158
00:12:10,485 --> 00:12:11,965
you'd have been collecting my body.

159
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,560
You wouldn't allow anything
to happen to yourself

160
00:12:13,685 --> 00:12:14,765
if you didn't see me.

161
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,245
Please forgive me

162
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:19,645
for coming late.

163
00:12:20,805 --> 00:12:21,685
Young Master Xin!

164
00:12:28,605 --> 00:12:29,405
Forgive me

165
00:12:30,045 --> 00:12:31,205
for coming late.

166
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:32,485
Brothers-in-law,

167
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:33,325
please rise.

168
00:12:34,805 --> 00:12:35,565
We're all family.

169
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:36,840
What's with the formalities?

170
00:12:41,365 --> 00:12:41,725
Speak!

171
00:12:42,525 --> 00:12:43,525
Who commanded you to do this?

172
00:12:43,925 --> 00:12:45,360
If you tell, your families
will be spared.

173
00:12:54,885 --> 00:12:55,285
Young Master Xin.

174
00:12:55,845 --> 00:12:57,240
They've all taken poison
to commit suicide.

175
00:13:02,405 --> 00:13:05,365
The heir would of course make sure
that none of this would trace back to him.

176
00:13:06,605 --> 00:13:07,005
Lianxin,

177
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:09,285
Ms. Lian

178
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:10,245
must be

179
00:13:10,245 --> 00:13:11,405
my famous sister-in-law.

180
00:13:14,565 --> 00:13:15,845
Whether or not she's your sister-in-law

181
00:13:17,045 --> 00:13:18,245
depends on the choice she makes.

182
00:13:19,885 --> 00:13:22,685
Since you're all safe and sound,

183
00:13:23,285 --> 00:13:25,285
I shall make a move first.

184
00:13:28,165 --> 00:13:28,845
Let her go.

185
00:13:29,045 --> 00:13:29,685
Lianxin!

186
00:13:33,845 --> 00:13:35,925
Do you know what the heir
is saying about you in front of father?

187
00:13:36,325 --> 00:13:37,565
He accused you of plotting to kill him

188
00:13:37,805 --> 00:13:38,805
and harming the people in the process.

189
00:13:39,165 --> 00:13:39,645
If she leaves,

190
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:41,845
no one can prove your innocence.

191
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:43,925
He Lianxin, are you
going back on your word?

192
00:13:43,925 --> 00:13:44,485
How dare you!

193
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:46,085
You're not going anywhere.

194
00:13:46,085 --> 00:13:47,485
You are coming back with us.

195
00:13:47,845 --> 00:13:49,285
Once the matter is settled

196
00:13:49,405 --> 00:13:50,525
and you prove Young Master Xin's innocence,

197
00:13:50,965 --> 00:13:52,525
how hard can it be for us to let you go?

198
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:53,765
How hard can it be?

199
00:13:54,845 --> 00:13:55,845
He is willing to let me go,

200
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,245
but will the prince let me go?

201
00:13:58,085 --> 00:13:58,965
Long delays cause complications.

202
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,765
There can be more trouble.

203
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,045
Then it's meant to be.

204
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:03,765
It is kind

205
00:14:04,005 --> 00:14:05,365
of Young Master Xin to fulfil your wishes.

206
00:14:05,765 --> 00:14:06,885
Do you really think

207
00:14:07,445 --> 00:14:08,405
that a servant-concubine like you

208
00:14:08,405 --> 00:14:10,045
can make your own decisions?

209
00:14:12,045 --> 00:14:12,605
Brother,

210
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:14,645
make a decision.

211
00:14:22,245 --> 00:14:23,245
How long will you be in misery

212
00:14:25,325 --> 00:14:26,445
if you don't marry Lv Beiyi?

213
00:14:29,325 --> 00:14:29,845
For a lifetime.

214
00:14:34,725 --> 00:14:35,365
Then, go.

215
00:14:36,725 --> 00:14:37,485
Lianyi.

216
00:14:37,725 --> 00:14:38,365
Lianxin!

217
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:41,045
What's wrong with you?
You life matters.

218
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,565
Young Master Yi,
you're exaggerating the thing.

219
00:14:44,365 --> 00:14:45,405
Even a tiger would not eat its cubs.

220
00:14:46,045 --> 00:14:48,125
No matter how mad the prince is,

221
00:14:48,605 --> 00:14:50,885
at most, he'll just disqualify him

222
00:14:51,245 --> 00:14:52,965
from succeeding him.

223
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,205
He wouldn't kill him.

224
00:14:54,725 --> 00:14:55,645
How can a royal family be compared

225
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:56,885
to the families of ordinary people?

226
00:14:57,205 --> 00:14:58,645
Losing father's trust would result

227
00:14:59,205 --> 00:15:00,325
in not being able

228
00:15:00,325 --> 00:15:01,645
to fulfil our lifelong goals.

229
00:15:02,765 --> 00:15:04,005
How is that different from dying?

230
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:07,205
I've always been arrogant

231
00:15:08,485 --> 00:15:09,325
and never begged anyone for anything,

232
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:10,285
but today...

233
00:15:15,245 --> 00:15:15,885
Lianyi!

234
00:15:16,245 --> 00:15:18,805
I beg you, Ms. Lian, to save my brother.

235
00:15:26,445 --> 00:15:29,925
Ms. Lian, we beg you
to return with Young Master Xin.

236
00:15:29,925 --> 00:15:30,965
What are you...

237
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:34,365
I dare not accept this.

238
00:15:43,685 --> 00:15:44,645
It's getting dark.

239
00:15:48,565 --> 00:15:49,485
I want to wait a while longer.

240
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:52,525
He will come.

241
00:16:26,645 --> 00:16:27,285
Listen to me.

242
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:28,925
No one is allowed to hurt you,

243
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,325
including yourself, okay?

244
00:16:55,965 --> 00:16:58,685
I will alter your outcast status.

245
00:17:28,365 --> 00:17:29,245
Everyone has his or her own destiny.

246
00:17:30,605 --> 00:17:31,205
I remember the first time

247
00:17:31,205 --> 00:17:32,525
I saw Madam Yao.

248
00:17:33,445 --> 00:17:34,325
She told me

249
00:17:36,245 --> 00:17:38,405
that a woman did everything for men.

250
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:41,565
It was a woman's destiny.

251
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,445
I answered her

252
00:17:45,725 --> 00:17:47,285
that I wanted to live my own life

253
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:50,565
and take control of my own life.

254
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:53,365
I couldn't do it before this.

255
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:55,925
Will I still have a chance?

256
00:18:00,645 --> 00:18:01,605
Young Master Xin,

257
00:18:03,645 --> 00:18:04,965
you once doubted the possibility

258
00:18:04,965 --> 00:18:07,005
of true love
that required nothing in return.

259
00:18:08,645 --> 00:18:09,445
I never do.

260
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,645
I'm willing to give up everything

261
00:18:14,285 --> 00:18:15,285
just to have one person

262
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:17,845
to grow old together with.

263
00:18:26,325 --> 00:18:27,045
I thought

264
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:29,965
that he would think the same.

The Title Granding Ceremony begins.

300
00:21:23,445 --> 00:21:26,965
In accordance to the heavens,
this is an order to you.

301
00:21:27,445 --> 00:21:29,925
As a response
to the request of He Yunshuo,

302
00:21:30,365 --> 00:21:33,085
Prince An of Quliang,

303
00:21:33,165 --> 00:21:36,125
Prince An's sons will be
given the titles as followed.

304
00:21:36,445 --> 00:21:38,720
His eldest son, He Lianbo,

305
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,200
(He Yunshuo's Eldest Son, He Lianbo)
will be given the title of a lord.

306
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,685
His fourth son, He Lianxiu,

307
00:21:43,685 --> 00:21:46,125
will be given the title
of General of Valiant.

308
00:21:47,725 --> 00:21:50,125
His fifth son, He Lianzuo,

309
00:21:50,445 --> 00:21:52,765
will be given the title
of General of Protection.

310
00:21:53,725 --> 00:21:57,045
Announce this to everyone
and let this be known to all.

311
00:22:07,645 --> 00:22:10,525
We thank His Majesty for his grace.

312
00:22:20,525 --> 00:22:21,245
You all may rise.

313
00:22:31,485 --> 00:22:33,685
His Majesty's acceptance of my request

314
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,325
is his trust in me,

315
00:22:37,845 --> 00:22:39,765
but there is one thing

316
00:22:40,245 --> 00:22:41,405
that I am ashamed of.

317
00:22:42,085 --> 00:22:43,165
I'm sure everyone

318
00:22:43,165 --> 00:22:44,285
has heard of what happened.

319
00:22:45,205 --> 00:22:46,125
A few days ago,

320
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:47,560
on the way to visit the ancestral tomb,

321
00:22:48,685 --> 00:22:49,965
many big stones

322
00:22:49,965 --> 00:22:51,205
fell off the mountain

323
00:22:51,485 --> 00:22:53,125
and killed some of our people.

324
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:54,605
I am heartbroken.

325
00:22:54,965 --> 00:22:56,365
They all say that Quliang

326
00:22:56,365 --> 00:22:57,485
is peaceful and prosperous now.

327
00:22:57,965 --> 00:22:59,125
Are those falling stones

328
00:23:00,285 --> 00:23:00,805
a sign of peace?

329
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:04,605
Can we claim to have prosperity
when the people have died?

330
00:23:07,245 --> 00:23:08,125
Some people say

331
00:23:09,285 --> 00:23:11,320
that this is nature's will
and that I am not the one to blame.

332
00:23:11,445 --> 00:23:13,645
According to this fortune teller,
if it is nature's will,

333
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:16,605
then I shall ask
for the heaven's protection.

334
00:23:17,485 --> 00:23:18,605
I have prayed.

335
00:23:18,845 --> 00:23:20,085
However, in the last few days,

336
00:23:20,085 --> 00:23:24,365
I can't eat well nor sleep well.

337
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,685
No matter how I think of it,

338
00:23:28,485 --> 00:23:30,085
it is not heaven's will.

339
00:23:31,165 --> 00:23:32,645
It is a man-made disaster!

340
00:23:40,805 --> 00:23:41,325
He Lianxin.

341
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:55,725
Yes.

342
00:23:56,605 --> 00:23:57,205
Kneel.

343
00:24:15,805 --> 00:24:17,325
You said those big stones

344
00:24:18,085 --> 00:24:19,485
were intended for Lianxin?

345
00:24:19,805 --> 00:24:20,325
Yes.

346
00:24:22,165 --> 00:24:23,045
He escaped?

347
00:24:24,245 --> 00:24:24,805
Yes, he did.

348
00:24:25,685 --> 00:24:26,965
How did he get hurt then?

349
00:24:29,765 --> 00:24:31,125
Is he faking it to deceive me?

350
00:24:31,925 --> 00:24:34,845
It's true that he escaped,
but his injury is real as well.

351
00:24:35,605 --> 00:24:37,525
He was injured while saving the people.

352
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:41,365
Are you saying that he risked his life

353
00:24:43,765 --> 00:24:44,885
to save the people?

354
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:46,605
I saw it with my own eyes.

355
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:49,085
How were you able to see clearly
in the midst of the chaos?

356
00:24:51,485 --> 00:24:54,245
I escaped quickly to a safe place.

357
00:24:55,485 --> 00:24:57,005
So many men were unable to escape.

358
00:24:57,085 --> 00:24:58,005
How did you, a weak woman,

359
00:24:58,005 --> 00:24:59,125
manage that?

360
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:03,445
It's because I was prepared.

361
00:25:07,845 --> 00:25:09,205
You're prepared?

362
00:25:09,805 --> 00:25:10,645
What does that mean?

363
00:25:13,605 --> 00:25:15,605
Were you already planning to escape?

364
00:25:16,925 --> 00:25:18,205
Is Lianxin not good to you?

365
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:21,125
Young Master Xin is great to me.

366
00:25:22,165 --> 00:25:23,525
It's exactly his kindness

367
00:25:25,365 --> 00:25:28,085
that made my sins unforgivable.

368
00:25:30,365 --> 00:25:31,845
Are you talking about Hui'er's death?

369
00:25:41,725 --> 00:25:42,205
Your Highness.

370
00:25:43,565 --> 00:25:45,885
My marriage was granted by you

371
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:48,605
and I am forever grateful to you.

372
00:25:49,245 --> 00:25:50,325
However, my life

373
00:25:50,805 --> 00:25:52,125
was also granted by you.

374
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,645
If my life was wasted away
in the Xin's Mansion,

375
00:25:57,005 --> 00:25:59,165
wouldn't I let you down?

376
00:26:01,205 --> 00:26:01,965
Do you know

377
00:26:03,485 --> 00:26:07,045
that your words
are the exact opposite of the heir's?

378
00:26:07,605 --> 00:26:09,525
Lianxin said he forgot everything.

379
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:11,605
You all have given me

380
00:26:12,085 --> 00:26:13,885
a difficult problem.

381
00:26:14,605 --> 00:26:15,205
I had no idea

382
00:26:15,205 --> 00:26:16,325
what Young Master Xin said.

383
00:26:16,645 --> 00:26:17,245
I also didn't know

384
00:26:17,245 --> 00:26:18,325
what the heir said.

385
00:26:18,325 --> 00:26:19,445
All I know is

386
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:21,605
what I'm telling you are all
I seen with my own eyes.

387
00:26:21,805 --> 00:26:22,805
There is not a single lie.

388
00:26:23,285 --> 00:26:25,205
You may not have seen
it with your own eyes,

389
00:26:25,525 --> 00:26:26,365
but I believe

390
00:26:27,525 --> 00:26:29,685
that you know what's going on.

391
00:26:34,645 --> 00:26:35,165
Your Highness,

392
00:26:35,365 --> 00:26:36,685
the people you sent
for investigation have returned.

393
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,460
(Secret Memorandum)

394
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,380
(Secret Memorandum
The Emperor's Letter)

395
00:27:00,405 --> 00:27:01,965
He Lianxin

396
00:27:02,965 --> 00:27:05,725
is benevolent and kind.
He loves the people as his own.

397
00:27:06,965 --> 00:27:09,085
He shall be given the title
of General of Illustrious Virtue.

398
00:27:22,005 --> 00:27:25,005
I thank His Majesty for his grace.

399
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:28,605
Thank you, father.

400
00:27:36,365 --> 00:27:37,805
I'm not the one you need to thank.

401
00:27:40,205 --> 00:27:41,005
Bring Luo Qinglian here.

402
00:28:10,485 --> 00:28:11,925
Greetings, Your Highness.

403
00:28:19,285 --> 00:28:22,765
Luo Qinglian's actions of protecting
Young Master Xin are meritorious.

404
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:25,285
Her righteousness, loyalty
and bravery are commendable.

405
00:28:25,605 --> 00:28:27,605
You are gifted with
the late princess consort's jade flute.

406
00:28:30,365 --> 00:28:31,805
It grants you death exemption for life.

407
00:28:51,045 --> 00:28:51,845
Luo Qinglian,

408
00:28:52,365 --> 00:28:53,005
from now on,

409
00:28:53,245 --> 00:28:55,525
you shall stay
at Young Master Xin's mansion in peace.

410
00:28:57,325 --> 00:28:59,405
Thank you, Your Highness,
for your kindness.

411
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:05,725
Rise.

412
00:29:11,205 --> 00:29:11,765
Lianchu.

413
00:29:17,445 --> 00:29:17,965
Father.

414
00:29:19,805 --> 00:29:20,365
Do you know

415
00:29:20,365 --> 00:29:22,005
why I asked for an imperial edict

416
00:29:22,765 --> 00:29:24,565
to grant your brothers titles?

417
00:29:35,965 --> 00:29:38,565
You wanted to inspire them

418
00:29:39,565 --> 00:29:40,600
to make great achievements.

419
00:29:55,645 --> 00:29:59,085
I wanted to inspire you!

420
00:30:06,165 --> 00:30:07,125
Father,

421
00:30:07,685 --> 00:30:08,045
I...

422
00:30:13,925 --> 00:30:15,445
It seems I was wrong.

423
00:30:18,325 --> 00:30:18,765
All right.

424
00:30:19,845 --> 00:30:21,445
You don't have to greet me
in the next few days.

425
00:30:22,485 --> 00:30:25,645
Take the time for self-reflection
in your mansion.

426
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:36,405
Why did you conceal the fact

427
00:31:37,445 --> 00:31:39,045
that the heir wanted to kill me?

428
00:31:39,885 --> 00:31:40,885
The heir was punished

429
00:31:41,205 --> 00:31:42,445
exactly because I concealed that fact.

430
00:31:43,245 --> 00:31:43,925
If I spoke the truth,

431
00:31:44,725 --> 00:31:45,925
you'd have been the one punished.

432
00:31:46,485 --> 00:31:47,725
Weren't you thinking of the same thing

433
00:31:47,725 --> 00:31:49,280
when you said you forgot
about what happened?

434
00:31:49,545 --> 00:31:51,560
Why would you question me,
your servant-concubine, about that?

435
00:31:56,885 --> 00:31:57,525
Servant-concubine?

436
00:31:59,605 --> 00:32:00,525
From now on,

437
00:32:02,885 --> 00:32:03,485
I, Luo Qinglian,

438
00:32:03,885 --> 00:32:05,085
am your servant-concubine.

439
00:32:07,005 --> 00:32:08,245
I'm afraid that we'll have to

440
00:32:08,405 --> 00:32:10,605
rely on each other in this lifetime.

441
00:32:17,205 --> 00:32:17,685
Who did it?

442
00:32:18,925 --> 00:32:19,405
What?

443
00:32:20,365 --> 00:32:22,605
You're not the one who killed Hui'er.

444
00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:23,845
Who did it?

445
00:32:26,285 --> 00:32:27,405
I don't have evidence,

446
00:32:27,885 --> 00:32:29,005
but I can swear upon my life

447
00:32:30,085 --> 00:32:31,045
it was Mu Haiyao.

448
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,165
From now on,

449
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,285
you will say goodbye
to the past completely.

450
00:32:43,205 --> 00:32:45,604
In addition to helping me to gain power,

451
00:32:45,605 --> 00:32:46,765
you have one more important task

452
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:49,205
in your life starting from now.

453
00:32:50,085 --> 00:32:52,125
Live well.

454
00:33:24,245 --> 00:33:26,045
Welcome back, Young Master Xin.

455
00:33:26,485 --> 00:33:29,285
Congratulations on receiving
the title of General of Illustrious Virtue.

456
00:33:35,885 --> 00:33:37,325
You're well-informed.

457
00:33:38,165 --> 00:33:38,725
You all may rise.

458
00:33:40,365 --> 00:33:41,725
Thank you, Young Master Xin.

459
00:33:54,405 --> 00:33:55,125
Paler.

460
00:33:56,885 --> 00:33:58,645
Madam, Young Master Xin is back.

461
00:34:01,045 --> 00:34:02,000
Why are you panicking?

462
00:34:02,605 --> 00:34:03,645
Young Master Xin has a show to watch.

463
00:34:03,645 --> 00:34:04,645
He won't return so quickly.

464
00:34:04,925 --> 00:34:05,725
A show?

465
00:34:06,285 --> 00:34:06,845
Yes.

466
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:09,605
The Madam Rui's show.

467
00:34:11,005 --> 00:34:13,325
Huairui, what are you doing?

468
00:34:17,565 --> 00:34:19,805
I ask for your forgiveness.

469
00:34:20,085 --> 00:34:21,005
You've kept the house

470
00:34:21,405 --> 00:34:22,605
in an orderly manner.

471
00:34:23,365 --> 00:34:24,520
Why should you seek forgiveness?

472
00:34:25,085 --> 00:34:25,765
Over the days,

473
00:34:26,165 --> 00:34:27,285
you had been suffering

474
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:28,525
and almost lost your life.

475
00:34:29,645 --> 00:34:31,205
As your wife,

476
00:34:31,685 --> 00:34:32,925
I wasn't there by your side.

477
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,405
Please punish me for that.

478
00:34:37,805 --> 00:34:39,205
How was that your fault?

479
00:34:39,605 --> 00:34:40,645
Besides, didn't you send

480
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:41,405
Fang Erge?

481
00:34:41,525 --> 00:34:42,245
I did,

482
00:34:43,405 --> 00:34:46,085
but Erge didn't do anything

483
00:34:46,965 --> 00:34:48,200
when he saw that you were in trouble.

484
00:34:51,205 --> 00:34:51,765
Really?

485
00:34:52,685 --> 00:34:54,725
Why didn't he act?

486
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:57,925
Was he scared
because there were too many people

487
00:34:57,925 --> 00:35:01,285
or was the ground too wet
that the horses slipped?

488
00:35:03,605 --> 00:35:04,285
Neither.

489
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:06,725
I told him to.

490
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:16,845
What a pity.

491
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:20,685
No matter how great and high

492
00:35:21,405 --> 00:35:22,685
the position of the primary consort is,

493
00:35:24,565 --> 00:35:25,805
it still doesn't come above

494
00:35:26,445 --> 00:35:28,445
the honour of the Fang family.

495
00:35:37,485 --> 00:35:38,845
I thought I was clever

496
00:35:39,405 --> 00:35:40,725
for wanting to get evidence

497
00:35:41,045 --> 00:35:42,925
of someone trying to harm you,

498
00:35:43,285 --> 00:35:44,205
but I didn't expect

499
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:46,085
that you'd almost lose your life.

500
00:35:48,565 --> 00:35:50,845
It was foolish of me.

501
00:35:52,365 --> 00:35:52,925
I am ashamed

502
00:35:52,925 --> 00:35:54,325
to be representing the household.

503
00:36:00,045 --> 00:36:03,685
Please oust me
from my position as the primary consort.

504
00:36:14,665 --> 00:36:15,960
Please reconsider it, Young Master Xin.

505
00:36:16,365 --> 00:36:18,165
Everyone knows
that the first lady is virtuous.

506
00:36:18,605 --> 00:36:19,845
Please show sympathy

507
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:20,765
for the loss of her son

508
00:36:21,005 --> 00:36:22,005
and don't blame her.

509
00:36:24,445 --> 00:36:26,565
Please show sympathy

510
00:36:26,565 --> 00:36:27,725
for the loss of her son

511
00:36:27,925 --> 00:36:28,805
and don't blame Madam Rui.

512
00:36:28,805 --> 00:36:29,405
Enough.

513
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:55,045
Huairui,

514
00:36:57,605 --> 00:36:59,125
the honour of the Fang family

515
00:36:59,965 --> 00:37:00,805
is so important.

516
00:37:02,165 --> 00:37:04,485
So I must return from the chaos.

517
00:37:05,405 --> 00:37:07,165
I was able to rise from the ashes.

518
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:12,005
Otherwise, how could I be worthy

519
00:37:12,485 --> 00:37:14,205
of being the Fang family's son-in-law?

520
00:37:16,005 --> 00:37:18,525
Am I right, Huairui?

521
00:37:22,725 --> 00:37:23,885
Thank you for your understanding.

522
00:37:24,845 --> 00:37:26,685
Why would I blame you?

523
00:37:30,765 --> 00:37:31,525
Stand up.

524
00:37:32,045 --> 00:37:33,125
Everyone, get up.

525
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:39,085
I heard of Ms. Lian's contributions

526
00:37:39,365 --> 00:37:40,245
to your safe return

527
00:37:41,565 --> 00:37:42,965
and the title you received.

528
00:37:45,445 --> 00:37:46,365
I'm flattered.

529
00:37:47,245 --> 00:37:48,885
I just did what I was supposed to do.

530
00:37:57,205 --> 00:37:58,205
Of course my woman

531
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:01,285
will go through life and death with me.

532
00:38:07,445 --> 00:38:08,085
Su Nanchun.

533
00:38:08,205 --> 00:38:08,805
Yes, Young Master Xin.

534
00:38:08,805 --> 00:38:10,245
Order people to tidy up

535
00:38:10,245 --> 00:38:11,045
Lianwei Mansion.

536
00:38:11,485 --> 00:38:12,405
Starting from today,

537
00:38:12,925 --> 00:38:15,845
Ms. Lian will no longer
live in Liuyun Cottage.

538
00:38:15,845 --> 00:38:16,645
Yes, Young Master Xin.

539
00:38:22,965 --> 00:38:24,685
Qinglian, just live there.

540
00:38:25,005 --> 00:38:26,045
At least it won't

541
00:38:26,045 --> 00:38:27,445
disappoint Yao.

542
00:38:34,725 --> 00:38:37,045
Oh right, why don't I see Haiyao?

543
00:38:41,045 --> 00:38:43,205
I've been trying to talk some
sense into her these days,

544
00:38:43,605 --> 00:38:44,365
but I didn't know

545
00:38:44,605 --> 00:38:46,005
she'd still be unwilling to see you.

546
00:38:47,045 --> 00:38:47,645
What happened?

547
00:38:50,325 --> 00:38:51,045
It's the heir.

548
00:38:52,325 --> 00:38:53,165
I heard that Yao

549
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:54,125
heard something

550
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:55,125
from the heir

551
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,085
before this happened,

552
00:38:57,725 --> 00:38:59,125
but I don't know why

553
00:38:59,765 --> 00:39:00,805
this was concealed.

554
00:39:09,685 --> 00:39:11,725
Madam, you were right.

555
00:39:12,045 --> 00:39:13,045
Young Master Xin and Ms. Lian

556
00:39:13,045 --> 00:39:13,845
are on their way here.

557
00:39:13,925 --> 00:39:14,485
Also,

558
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:15,965
as expected, the first lady
was not punished.

559
00:39:17,365 --> 00:39:18,405
To gain power,

560
00:39:18,885 --> 00:39:19,405
he still has to rely

561
00:39:19,405 --> 00:39:21,085
on the Fang family's support.

562
00:39:21,685 --> 00:39:23,245
How could he punish her so easily?

563
00:39:25,805 --> 00:39:26,845
Too bad I

564
00:39:27,245 --> 00:39:28,125
thought I was being smart

565
00:39:28,685 --> 00:39:29,965
and misjudged the person
who shared my bed

566
00:39:32,605 --> 00:39:33,765
and Luo Qinglian.

567
00:39:37,365 --> 00:39:38,365
Greetings, Young Master Xin.

568
00:39:39,245 --> 00:39:39,965
Where is Madam Yao?

569
00:39:40,205 --> 00:39:41,885
Madam is sick.

570
00:39:42,565 --> 00:39:43,165
What's the illness?

571
00:39:43,805 --> 00:39:45,085
Madam was worried

572
00:39:45,085 --> 00:39:46,565
for your safety these days.

573
00:39:46,805 --> 00:39:48,525
So she hadn't been
eating and sleeping well.

574
00:39:48,605 --> 00:39:50,205
We did our best, but it was of no help.

575
00:39:50,765 --> 00:39:52,285
When Madam heard that
you were returning today,

576
00:39:52,285 --> 00:39:53,645
she was so excited

577
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:54,765
that she woke up early today.

578
00:39:55,405 --> 00:39:56,125
Who knew

579
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:57,805
that she'd faint when she was

580
00:39:57,965 --> 00:39:59,005
about to come out to greet you.

581
00:40:01,085 --> 00:40:02,085
Have you asked for a physician?

582
00:40:02,365 --> 00:40:03,045
Yes.

583
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:04,925
Physician Zhang from
Wang Mansion is inside.

584
00:40:06,165 --> 00:40:07,765
We'd like to ask everyone

585
00:40:07,765 --> 00:40:08,645
to please wait outside.

586
00:40:08,645 --> 00:40:09,765
After the physician has checked on her,

587
00:40:09,765 --> 00:40:10,565
I will...

588
00:40:10,565 --> 00:40:11,005
No need for that.

589
00:40:11,965 --> 00:40:13,285
Since Yao is not feeling well,

590
00:40:13,445 --> 00:40:14,685
it's even more reason for us to see her.

591
00:40:17,205 --> 00:40:18,165
Greetings, Young Master Xin.

592
00:40:18,445 --> 00:40:20,245
Congratulations on receiving
the title of General of Illustrious Virtue.

593
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:22,845
All right. What's Madam Yao's sickness?

594
00:40:24,565 --> 00:40:25,485
Another piece of great news.

595
00:40:26,365 --> 00:40:28,085
Madam Yao is not sick.

596
00:40:28,525 --> 00:40:30,125
She's three months pregnant.

597
00:40:36,325 --> 00:40:37,005
Ruhua.

598
00:40:41,365 --> 00:40:43,645
Greetings, Young Master Xin.

599
00:40:44,405 --> 00:40:44,965
Get up.

600
00:40:45,765 --> 00:40:46,765
What if

601
00:40:46,765 --> 00:40:47,405
this affects the baby?

602
00:40:48,845 --> 00:40:50,045
I'm not that precious.

603
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:51,365
Who says you're not?

604
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:54,125
How can my woman

605
00:40:55,805 --> 00:40:56,805
and child

606
00:40:57,565 --> 00:40:58,845
not be precious?

607
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,365
Go in and have a seat.
Don't stand around.

608
00:41:05,245 --> 00:41:06,405
What if it affects the baby?

609
00:41:08,205 --> 00:41:08,885
Come on, have a seat.

610
00:41:15,885 --> 00:41:16,445
Ms. Lian,

611
00:41:17,325 --> 00:41:18,245
Lianwei Mansion

612
00:41:18,445 --> 00:41:19,685
is close to Weixi Pond.

613
00:41:19,925 --> 00:41:20,885
The scenery is quite nice.

614
00:41:21,885 --> 00:41:22,525
When Lady Mo

615
00:41:22,525 --> 00:41:23,645
was pregnant

616
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:25,005
and wanted to move out
of Tinglan Pavilion,

617
00:41:25,325 --> 00:41:26,605
Young Master Xin didn't pay her any attention.

618
00:41:28,165 --> 00:41:29,285
He has given it to you.

619
00:41:29,685 --> 00:41:30,445
It goes to show

620
00:41:30,805 --> 00:41:32,125
his love for you.

621
00:41:33,165 --> 00:41:34,805
Ms. Lian, this place is so pretty.

622
00:41:35,045 --> 00:41:36,205
It's so much better than Liuyun Cabin.
