00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,438
Why did you lie to me?

20
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:23,919
It's because

21
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:28,870
I was unwilling.

22
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:34,399
How about now?

23
00:02:36,998 --> 00:02:37,839
Are you willing now?

24
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:19,919
Go back, Lian'er.

00:03:42,718 --> 00:03:43,919
You can never

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,039

I've made you suffer a lot.

81
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:24,999
Do you hate me?

82
00:07:27,798 --> 00:07:30,719
There was a swing at the courtyard
when I was little.

83
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:34,798
My elder brother
liked swinging up high on it,

84
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,599
but I didn't dare.

85
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,439
He laughed at my timidity.

86
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:40,839
I was so angry.

87
00:07:41,238 --> 00:07:43,518
I practised one whole night.

88
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,198
Do you know what happened?

89
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:48,879
You swung higher than him?

90
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:52,238
I still didn't dare.

91
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,959
I wanted to practise martial arts
when I had grown up,

92
00:07:58,559 --> 00:07:59,879
but I couldn't master it no matter how.

93
00:08:00,358 --> 00:08:01,119
Also, music.

94
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,358
I went out of tune
whenever I tried to sing.

95
00:08:05,078 --> 00:08:05,879
I'm saying all this

96
00:08:07,078 --> 00:08:08,279
just so you know

97
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:10,638
there're many things

98
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,238
I want to do but I can't.

99
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:16,279
One of them

100
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:19,879
is hating you.

101
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:56,599
It's been so long

102
00:08:57,678 --> 00:08:58,558
since the last time I could

103
00:08:58,558 --> 00:08:59,518
dress you up properly.

104
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:01,678
You're as beautiful as ever.

105
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,518
You haven't changed at all.

106
00:09:07,118 --> 00:09:07,998
Haven't I?

107
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:10,919
I think I've changed.

108
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:13,839
I almost

109
00:09:16,198 --> 00:09:17,919
can't recognise this pair of eyes.

110
00:09:22,998 --> 00:09:23,638
Madam.

111
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:25,919
Ms. Lian is going to leave.

112
00:09:27,758 --> 00:09:28,438
I know.

113
00:09:29,518 --> 00:09:31,678
Aren't you going to bid her farewell?

114
00:09:34,678 --> 00:09:35,239
Why?

115
00:09:38,438 --> 00:09:40,758
Must I see her off

116
00:09:42,678 --> 00:09:43,878
when she is gaining power again?

117
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:46,318
Don't get me wrong.

118
00:09:46,558 --> 00:09:47,279
I wouldn't dare.

119
00:09:48,438 --> 00:09:49,678
I've told you many times.

120
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:53,318
No matter how cold and fickle

121
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,870
the world and the people are,

122
00:09:55,438 --> 00:09:56,198
I, Mu Haiyao,

123
00:09:57,758 --> 00:09:59,518
won't beg for pity.

124
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:01,558
Who says the world and people

125
00:10:01,558 --> 00:10:02,518
are cold and fickle?

126
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,839
I bid you farewell.

127
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:10,758
Just leave.

128
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,558
We aren't friends anyway.

129
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:14,198
Not only that,

130
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:15,919
we're enemies

131
00:10:16,518 --> 00:10:17,839
back at Young Master's mansion.

132
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,930
However, fate plays tricks on people.

133
00:10:21,518 --> 00:10:22,758
Regardless of evil intentions

134
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:24,998
or kindness at the southern courtyard,

135
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:27,399
I wouldn't have been

136
00:10:28,118 --> 00:10:29,479
where I am today without you.

137
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:44,998
Take care, Yao.

138
00:10:48,638 --> 00:10:49,318
Luo Qinglian.

139
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:57,078
I'll get back

140
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,399
to Young Master's mansion one day.

141
00:11:00,638 --> 00:11:01,558
I look forward to the day

142
00:11:01,558 --> 00:11:02,638
of meeting you again.

143
00:11:21,118 --> 00:11:21,878
Fish feed?

144
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:24,719
Why did she give this to you?

145
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,159
It's because she knows better

146
00:11:28,998 --> 00:11:29,839
than anyone else

147
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,678
the despair and silence
in the southern courtyard.

148
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,279
(She wants me to get recharged)

149
00:11:36,118 --> 00:11:38,998
(and free myself from desire like a fish.)

150
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,599
- Congratulations for coming back.
- Congratulations for coming back.

151
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:47,719
(However, you've forgotten one thing.)

152
00:11:48,558 --> 00:11:49,878
(I'm different from you after all.)

153
00:11:50,638 --> 00:11:51,438
(You have)

154
00:11:51,438 --> 00:11:53,239
(one thing I can never have.)

155
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:56,599
(Young Master's genuine love.)

156
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:28,279
Be gentle and careful.

157
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:34,078
Wipe carefully in and out the house.

158
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,399
Clean up.

159
00:12:36,518 --> 00:12:37,239
The greatest enemy

160
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:38,438
is coming back.

161
00:12:39,438 --> 00:12:40,638
She remains calm.

162
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,359
I'm afraid

163
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:44,279
she is confident.

164
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:49,799
Do you mean...

165
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,118
Young Master and Madam promised that.

166
00:12:54,678 --> 00:12:56,118
Will it go wrong?

167
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,198
It's going too smoothly.

168
00:12:59,438 --> 00:13:00,719
It's disturbing.

169
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,799
Hopefully, it's just
my groundless worries.

170
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:33,719
Madam De's verbal instruction.

171
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:58,479
The deposed Luo has been sick for long.

172
00:13:58,878 --> 00:14:00,558
She mustn't return to the mansion

173
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,279
and will be brought straight
to Zhaohui Courtyard.

174
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:17,599
(Mansion of Prince An)
Madam, Ms. Lian has been brought over.

175
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,479
Greetings, Madam De.

176
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:25,479
I'm Luo Qinglian.

177
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,239
You're married to
Lianxin for three years.

178
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:54,078
I have yet to take a good look at you.

179
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:55,198
I've come late.

180
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:56,959
I heard

181
00:14:57,719 --> 00:14:59,399
you went crazy some time ago.

182
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,998
As a person of bad luck,

183
00:15:06,678 --> 00:15:08,799
no matter how you're spoilt by Lianxin,

184
00:15:08,998 --> 00:15:11,878
I won't allow you
to enter the mansion anymore.

185
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:16,239
Since the late princess consort
passed away,

186
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,438
the prince hasn't come to visit me

187
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,998
for almost five years,

188
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:28,638
especially

189
00:15:31,558 --> 00:15:34,599
when your face looks so much like hers.

190
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:37,279
You'll be sought by countless forces.

191
00:15:40,878 --> 00:15:43,078
I won't let a demonic girl like you

192
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:44,239
to stir up trouble at the mansion.

193
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:46,660
One's look is
determined by the heaven.

194
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:48,318
I can't change it.

195
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,118
Why not?

196
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:01,599
Mother!

197
00:16:07,678 --> 00:16:08,878
You barged in just like this.

198
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:10,998
Are you still aware
that I'm your mother?

199
00:16:12,558 --> 00:16:14,839
I've lost my manners
in a moment of desperation.

200
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:17,599
Please punish me.

201
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,198
Your sins are all because of her.

202
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:21,638
Let her take responsibility for all.

203
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:23,239
Send my order.

204
00:16:24,638 --> 00:16:25,758
Luo Qinglian.

205
00:16:25,998 --> 00:16:27,678
Ms. Lian has made many mistakes,

206
00:16:27,678 --> 00:16:28,399
but she is

207
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,919
the servant-concubine
granted by Father to me.

208
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:32,919
Father may not be pleased

209
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:34,919
if you punish her in private.

210
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:37,118
Please think twice.

211
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,479
Are you threatening me with the prince?

212
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:44,518
I wouldn't dare.

213
00:16:48,558 --> 00:16:49,118
Fine.

214
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,959
As long as I live,

215
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:53,438
this woman

216
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:56,799
won't be allowed back at the mansion!

217
00:16:57,438 --> 00:16:57,919
Mother!

218
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:06,719
Girl.

219
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:10,359
You shall stay here

220
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:12,078
for the time being.

221
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:14,918
I'm afraid you can only

222
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:18,198
go back sometime later.

223
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,639
However, I promise

224
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:21,318
not too long.

225
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,999
It's beautiful here.

226
00:17:28,278 --> 00:17:29,239
It's also clean and quiet.

227
00:17:29,639 --> 00:17:30,959
It's not that bad to even stay here

228
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:31,918
for the rest of my life.

229
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:36,198
Oh no.

230
00:17:37,278 --> 00:17:38,198
You shouldn't

231
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:39,678
think of going out

232
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:41,398
before even going back.

233
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:44,798
Yu Dechang isn't here yet.

234
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:47,158
Father is looking for Ms. Lian.

235
00:18:03,158 --> 00:18:04,038
The prince is still busy.

236
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:05,158
One moment please, Ms. Lian.

237
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:06,438
Thank you.

238
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:27,318
Tea without flowers.

239
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:29,479
That will be less elegant.

240
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:32,479
Am I right, Madam Lian?

241
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:43,719
I couldn't recognise you, Your Highness.

242
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:44,918
Please punish me.

243
00:18:46,678 --> 00:18:47,479
Rise.

244
00:18:57,918 --> 00:18:59,678
Bright eyes and ruddy skin.

245
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:01,558
You've recovered indeed.

246
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:05,198
You're just a little thin.

247
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:07,558
I'll let Yu Dechang

248
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:09,038
bring some tonic back for you.

249
00:19:09,438 --> 00:19:11,959
Grow your flesh back.

250
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,558
Thank you, Your Highness.

251
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,398
Look.

252
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:22,078
It's delightful to have

253
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:23,839
a straightforward person like you.

254
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:26,558
You're a blessed one.

255
00:19:27,678 --> 00:19:29,318
I'm not only the blessed one.

256
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,030
And the spathiphyllum.

257
00:19:31,479 --> 00:19:33,318
It can be taken care of by you in person.

258
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,239
It shows how much you like it.

259
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:43,519
Sadly, it fails to live up
to my expectations.

260
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,398
It cannot bear the high temperature

261
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:47,678
and burning sun.

262
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:51,479
It withers before midsummer.

263
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:56,959
I'm afraid my painstaking efforts

264
00:19:58,278 --> 00:19:59,599
would end in vain.

265
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:05,510
(He's clearly not referring
to the spathiphyllum,)

266
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:06,918
(but the heir.)

267
00:20:15,278 --> 00:20:16,158
It seems

268
00:20:16,278 --> 00:20:18,158
the spathiphyllum isn't what
you like the most.

269
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:27,759
You're smart.

270
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:28,719
Do you know

271
00:20:28,719 --> 00:20:29,999
what I like the most?

272
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:33,639
Other than lotus that the late princess consort
liked the most,

273
00:20:34,278 --> 00:20:35,158
I guess

274
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:37,759
you like plum blossom the most.

275
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:39,398
Why?

276
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:42,119
Grown in snowy forest,

277
00:20:42,639 --> 00:20:44,398
it's unlike peach and prune
in the mortal world.

278
00:20:45,438 --> 00:20:47,398
There're too many flowers
fighting for beauty

279
00:20:47,398 --> 00:20:48,558
in this wonderful garden.

280
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:50,158
It'll make people admire

281
00:20:50,398 --> 00:20:51,519
the integrity of a plum blossom.

282
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:54,239
It doesn't aim to please
nor compete with others.

283
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:55,999
It grows in the wind and snow.

284
00:20:56,438 --> 00:20:57,558
Lofty and unsullied.

285
00:20:58,918 --> 00:21:01,318
Why? You don't like it?

286
00:21:03,398 --> 00:21:04,599
I like it.

287
00:21:04,918 --> 00:21:05,759
I'm only afraid

288
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:08,719
that winter plum can
endure grudges the most.

289
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:10,830
It's always taken as a flower
bloomed last year.

290
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,198
Do you know

291
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,999
what flower you are to me?

292
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:24,999
I don't.

293
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:29,678
An understanding flower.

294
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:33,038
Also an eloquent flower.

295
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:39,239
In my opinion,

296
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:43,359
only you can live up to it.

297
00:21:48,278 --> 00:21:50,119
Lianxin should treat you well

298
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:54,839
when he has you as his concubine.

299
00:21:56,438 --> 00:21:57,158
Yu Dechang.

300
00:21:58,038 --> 00:21:58,479
Yes.

301
00:22:00,239 --> 00:22:00,879
Take the tea away.

302
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:03,278
Bring liquor instead.

303
00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:06,198
Your Highness, you're coughing lately.

304
00:22:06,198 --> 00:22:06,798
I think...

305
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:07,438
Bring the liquor.

306
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:34,719
Here, Your Highness.

307
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:35,999
Another cup.

308
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:44,398
Madam, it's raining.

309
00:22:45,438 --> 00:22:47,558
Let's head back to Zhaohui Courtyard.

310
00:22:52,398 --> 00:22:53,198
Right.

311
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:55,398
Take shelter from the rain.

312
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:00,198
Zhaohui Courtyard is cold and cheerless.

313
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,278
No one, no sound

314
00:23:04,918 --> 00:23:05,879
nor rain.

315
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:10,479
Get sheltered.

316
00:23:43,318 --> 00:23:45,078
It's raining, Your Highness.

317
00:23:45,438 --> 00:23:47,558
You might catch a cold
if you don't leave now.

318
00:23:47,918 --> 00:23:48,398
Yes.

319
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:50,078
It's dark and slippery.

320
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:51,879
You should also go back early.

321
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:53,479
Otherwise, Lianxin

322
00:23:53,479 --> 00:23:54,719
would get anxious of waiting.

323
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,239
Your Highness.

324
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:03,839
I know a folk remedy

325
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:05,198
very effective in treating coughs.

326
00:24:05,198 --> 00:24:07,519
I'll make the decoction tomorrow

327
00:24:08,078 --> 00:24:08,918
and deliver it to you...

328
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:13,678
I'll give Head Yu the prescription later.

329
00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:19,198
Yu Dechang.

330
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:20,599
Send my order.

331
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:23,239
Ms. Lian

332
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:24,959
can have free access to
my mansion from now on.

333
00:24:25,918 --> 00:24:27,078
No one can stop her.

334
00:24:29,198 --> 00:24:30,278
Yes, Your Highness.

335
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:32,359
Ms. Lian.

336
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:34,158
It's the sole grace

337
00:24:34,158 --> 00:24:35,359
made by His Highness to you.

338
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,479
Thank you, Your Highness.

339
00:24:44,078 --> 00:24:44,918
I'll make a move first.

340
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:50,599
Your Highness.

341
00:24:51,719 --> 00:24:53,599
I don't know if I should say this.

342
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:55,359
Go ahead.

343
00:24:57,318 --> 00:24:58,239
Most of the people

344
00:24:58,719 --> 00:24:59,678
in the mansion are women

345
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,870
and it's women who suffer the most.

346
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:05,078
New clothes are the best.
However, old friends are better.

347
00:25:34,198 --> 00:25:37,278
Greetings, Your Highness.

348
00:25:46,318 --> 00:25:46,999
Rise.

349
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:56,119
I didn't know your arrival.

350
00:25:56,398 --> 00:25:57,438
I didn't manage to receive you.

351
00:25:57,879 --> 00:25:59,038
Please forgive me.

352
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:03,158
Qiushi, hurry and serve tea.

353
00:26:04,318 --> 00:26:06,398
I've kept Longjing
plucked before the rain.

354
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:07,359
Go.

355
00:26:07,879 --> 00:26:09,839
Right. Also, the sweat towel.

356
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,318
The sweat towel I embroidered.

357
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:12,558
Bring them altogether.

358
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:14,038
Go.

359
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:21,999
It's been a while since I came.

360
00:26:24,318 --> 00:26:25,078
If I didn't come now,

361
00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:29,438
I would've forgotten you as my wife.

362
00:26:37,879 --> 00:26:40,879
Greetings, Your Highness.

363
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:04,438
Young Master.

364
00:27:05,438 --> 00:27:06,239
You show up at last.

365
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:07,839
Why did Father summon you?

366
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:09,839
His Highness isn't feeling well.

367
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:11,278
You should visit him often

368
00:27:11,678 --> 00:27:12,798
when you have time.

369
00:27:16,918 --> 00:27:17,798
All in all,

370
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:19,759
we're sorry to my father.

371
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:28,359
I remember

372
00:27:28,918 --> 00:27:30,158
Madam Yi loved to hold me here

373
00:27:30,158 --> 00:27:31,278
while looking at Quliang.

374
00:27:31,879 --> 00:27:32,519
She said

375
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:34,719
she could have

376
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:38,318
peace of mind over here

377
00:27:38,879 --> 00:27:39,879
and forget all her troubles.

378
00:27:41,318 --> 00:27:42,038
Girl.

379
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:43,879
Remember.

380
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:45,239
My mansion

381
00:27:46,239 --> 00:27:47,639
can fit countless women,

382
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:49,398
but I...

383
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:51,959
My heart

384
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,318
can fit only one.

385
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:57,438
I'll remember this.

386
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:19,999
Young Master.

387
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:22,119
This madam has been waiting for long.

388
00:28:24,639 --> 00:28:25,918
Greetings, Young Master.

389
00:28:26,318 --> 00:28:27,359
Greetings, Ms. Lian.

390
00:28:28,038 --> 00:28:29,719
Madam De ordered me

391
00:28:30,078 --> 00:28:31,959
to bring a verbal instruction
to Ms. Lian.

392
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:37,759
I'm listening.

393
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:39,398
By Madam De's order,

394
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:42,918
Ms. Lian should move out at once

395
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:49,798
and go back to Lord Rui's Mansion.

396
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:51,479
Congratulations, Ms. Lian.

397
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:54,599
Madam also requested an order
from the prince on purpose

398
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:56,999
to promote Ms. Lian
as an ordinary consort.

399
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:01,398
Ms. Lian will stop being

400
00:29:01,678 --> 00:29:04,038
a servant-concubine from now on.

401
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:08,479
I thank Madam De.

402
00:29:54,438 --> 00:29:55,678
Is Young Master Xiu doing fine?

403
00:30:00,918 --> 00:30:02,318
I always find it strange

404
00:30:02,999 --> 00:30:04,158
about the heir's deposition.

405
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:06,198
Young Master mentioned later

406
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:07,959
that the heir was definite

407
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:09,359
that he didn't bring a dagger along.

408
00:30:10,879 --> 00:30:13,438
Young Master only thought
he remembered wrongly,

409
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:15,639
but they forgot

410
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:17,798
there was another person

411
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:19,839
with them.

412
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:22,630
What do you expect to hear?

413
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:25,119
I want you to refute me!

414
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:27,398
I want you to point at my nose and say

415
00:30:27,398 --> 00:30:28,759
I'm making an unfounded accusation!

416
00:30:31,918 --> 00:30:32,678
Yi.

417
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,318
Tell me

418
00:30:36,719 --> 00:30:37,839
that my guess is wrong.

419
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:40,158
You know me best in this world.

420
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:42,639
You won't get it wrong.

421
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:44,879
I know you?

422
00:30:47,719 --> 00:30:48,798
I don't.

423
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:50,558
Lv Beiyi whom I know

424
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:52,879
wouldn't betray his master

425
00:30:52,879 --> 00:30:54,119
for the sake of glory.

426
00:30:54,438 --> 00:30:56,038
He Lianxin is never the person I serve.

427
00:30:56,719 --> 00:30:58,318
There is always just one person I serve.

428
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:02,438
That is you.

429
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:07,198
However, you...

430
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:17,650
The person you serve in your heart

431
00:31:19,398 --> 00:31:20,278
has changed.

432
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,519
I serve no one.

433
00:31:25,078 --> 00:31:28,278
I only listen to my own heart.

434
00:31:31,719 --> 00:31:33,719
However, my heart is really too small.

435
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,519
It could fit only Lv Beiyi before.

436
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:45,119
From now on,

437
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:48,879
it can fit only He Lianxin.

438
00:31:57,479 --> 00:31:58,359
Good.

439
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:02,359
Very well.

440
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:06,038
An arrow through the heart

441
00:32:08,879 --> 00:32:10,479
is somehow better
than lingering feelings.

442
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:15,119
Lian'er.

443
00:32:18,278 --> 00:32:19,398
Thank you for your cruelty.

444
00:32:34,318 --> 00:32:35,759
I've betrayed your husband.

445
00:32:37,918 --> 00:32:38,639
Kill me.

446
00:32:41,678 --> 00:32:42,519
Kill me.

447
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:48,599
I'll have no regrets in life

448
00:32:51,558 --> 00:32:52,879
if I die at your hands.

449
00:33:18,438 --> 00:33:18,999
Lian'er.

450
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:22,570
There must still be He Lianxiu's men

451
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:23,918
at Young Master Xin's mansion.

452
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:26,038
I'll leave

453
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:28,479
Young Master Xin's mansion tomorrow.

454
00:33:33,438 --> 00:33:35,078
The future is uncertain without me

455
00:33:38,078 --> 00:33:39,078
around you.

456
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:43,359
You must be careful.

457
00:33:59,959 --> 00:34:01,239
Be careful.

458
00:34:01,918 --> 00:34:02,879
Today is the good day

459
00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:03,879
when Madam Lian returns.

460
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:05,318
Don't let anything go wrong

461
00:34:05,318 --> 00:34:07,558
and end up upsetting Young Master,
understand?

462
00:34:07,639 --> 00:34:08,639
- Yes.
- Yes.

463
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:34,519
She'll be here.

464
00:34:35,118 --> 00:34:37,039
Why isn't she here yet?

465
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,959
Right. We've been standing so long.

466
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,628
(Lord Rui's Mansion)

467
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,398
How long do we have to wait?

468
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,479
Wait a little longer.

469
00:34:51,638 --> 00:34:52,198
Here she is.

470
00:34:52,198 --> 00:34:52,799
Here she is!

471
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:53,598
They're here.

472
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:55,719
They're really here.

473
00:34:57,799 --> 00:34:58,398
They're here.

474
00:35:43,598 --> 00:35:44,598
I've been looking forward

475
00:35:44,878 --> 00:35:46,279
to your return.

476
00:35:47,878 --> 00:35:48,638
It must be hard on you.

477
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:50,759
Thank you for thinking about me.

478
00:35:53,638 --> 00:35:54,519
I'm really sorry

479
00:35:54,638 --> 00:35:55,959
to keep you waiting

480
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,398
under the hot summer sun.

481
00:36:00,279 --> 00:36:01,999
All right. Stop standing under the sun.

482
00:36:02,358 --> 00:36:02,838
We'll

483
00:36:03,158 --> 00:36:05,030
get a chance for an intimate
conversation in the future.

484
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:07,358
Your residence should be
changed after you've become

485
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:08,198
an ordinary consort.

486
00:36:09,198 --> 00:36:10,079
However, I think

487
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,519
you would prefer Lianwei Residence.

488
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,039
So I didn't let them move.

489
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:17,999
You certainly know me best.

490
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:34,279
Greetings, Master.

491
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:36,959
Young Master comes to see Madam Lian.

492
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:38,999
This is tonic from Young Master
to Madam Lian.

493
00:36:38,999 --> 00:36:39,810
Thank you, Young Master.

494
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,719
Young Master, Miss Lian is tired.

495
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:42,799
Please leave for now.

496
00:36:45,198 --> 00:36:45,598
No.

497
00:36:45,878 --> 00:36:46,358
Dongli.

498
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:48,759
Well... Tired?

499
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,158
I thought she had just woken up.

500
00:36:50,158 --> 00:36:50,999
Why is she tired already?

501
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:52,158
Tired?

502
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:53,438
I...

503
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:54,878
Could it be...

504
00:36:54,878 --> 00:36:55,719
She...

505
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:56,999
Has she left me out in the cold?

506
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:58,999
Young Master, I...

507
00:36:59,039 --> 00:36:59,678
Tell me.

508
00:37:00,279 --> 00:37:01,198
Did I upset her?

509
00:37:01,438 --> 00:37:03,039
I've apologised to her.

510
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:04,838
What is she trying to do?

511
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:05,479
Young Master, I...

512
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,398
I don't know either.

513
00:37:06,398 --> 00:37:07,438
Don't ask me everything.

514
00:37:07,438 --> 00:37:08,079
Young Master, I...

515
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:20,039
Zhiyue.

516
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,039
Clean all pots and bowls

517
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:23,959
to make the decoction.

518
00:37:24,438 --> 00:37:26,559
Ranyun, wrap the dregs of the decoction

519
00:37:27,319 --> 00:37:28,319
and bury it at the courtyard.

520
00:37:28,598 --> 00:37:29,999
You mustn't let anyone know

521
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:31,039
what decoction it is.

522
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:32,239
Yes, Madam.

523
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:36,398
What is your expression?
What is the matter?

524
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:40,279
You'd left for so long.

525
00:37:40,638 --> 00:37:42,719
Zhiyue and I missed you so much.

526
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:44,970
We'd been looking forward
to your return every day

527
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:46,598
and you're back at last.

528
00:37:46,999 --> 00:37:47,970
I can't wait to sound the gong

529
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,319
and make everyone in the mansion

530
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:50,999
know that you're pregnant.

531
00:37:51,118 --> 00:37:53,398
Why do you refuse to tell?

532
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:54,598
Even keep secret of the decoction...

533
00:37:54,598 --> 00:37:55,158
My goodness!

534
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,358
Lower your voice.

535
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:58,918
Madam, Ranyun speaks fast.

536
00:37:58,999 --> 00:38:00,598
However, she speaks my mind.

537
00:38:00,999 --> 00:38:02,079
Everyone sees how well

538
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,158
Young Master is treating you.

539
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:04,759
What is it that you lack?

540
00:38:05,398 --> 00:38:06,118
Feather.

541
00:38:09,158 --> 00:38:09,959
I miscarried back then.

542
00:38:10,838 --> 00:38:12,398
If I wasn't a servant-concubine,

543
00:38:13,678 --> 00:38:15,239
no one would've dared to block the door.

544
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:17,799
If it was

545
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,319
a side consort or the primary consort

546
00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:20,959
kneeling at Qiege Hall,

547
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:23,878
who else would have watched
the blood flowing

548
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:25,079
and not reporting it?

549
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:26,799
There was

550
00:38:27,598 --> 00:38:28,999
intervention of Nan Ruzhen,

551
00:38:30,438 --> 00:38:31,918
as well as my helplessness.

552
00:38:33,999 --> 00:38:35,198
A female eagle can protect its babies

553
00:38:35,198 --> 00:38:36,479
only when it's fully fledged.

554
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:37,158
So,

555
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:42,279
this is my second child.

556
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:44,118
I want to keep him safe

557
00:38:45,398 --> 00:38:46,638
even if it means risking my life.

558
00:38:49,918 --> 00:38:51,559
Fortunately, you're back at the mansion

559
00:38:52,799 --> 00:38:55,239
and Young Master spoils you so much.

560
00:38:56,678 --> 00:38:57,598
I reckon

561
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:59,039
Nan Ruzhen wouldn't act rashly anymore.

562
00:39:00,959 --> 00:39:01,918
She wouldn't,

563
00:39:02,918 --> 00:39:04,319
but what about that person behind?

564
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:10,559
Does this mean

565
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:12,598
she is serving Young Master Xiu?

566
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:17,158
When Yi told me

567
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:19,598
about Young Master Xiu's mole
at the mansion,

568
00:39:19,878 --> 00:39:20,719
I knew

569
00:39:21,479 --> 00:39:22,719
it would be Nan Ruzhen.

570
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:24,559
However, I had no evidence.

571
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:26,759
Any movement from Luo Qinglian?

572
00:39:26,918 --> 00:39:28,759
Xu Liangchuan has been keeping an eye.

573
00:39:29,118 --> 00:39:30,239
No movement at all.

574
00:39:30,999 --> 00:39:32,198
She is smart enough

575
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:34,959
to have guessed something,

576
00:39:36,319 --> 00:39:37,799
but she doesn't tell Young Master anything.

577
00:39:40,279 --> 00:39:41,838
What is she up to?

578
00:39:43,198 --> 00:39:43,959
Could she have

579
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:46,198
something on us

580
00:39:46,438 --> 00:39:47,438
and she wants to threaten us?

581
00:39:52,398 --> 00:39:53,519
We can never control

582
00:39:54,838 --> 00:39:56,319
what others want to do.

583
00:39:58,438 --> 00:39:59,759
The most brilliant way

584
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:02,039
is to invalidate

585
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:04,598
what she has on us.

586
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,398
Poor living condition

587
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:10,918
and others' taunting

588
00:40:10,918 --> 00:40:11,999
don't matter.

589
00:40:12,678 --> 00:40:14,079
Young Master matters the most.

590
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:18,799
I need this if I can't win

591
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:23,279
Young Master's heart.

592
00:40:23,678 --> 00:40:25,079
As long as I conceive a child,

593
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:31,358
I would like to see

594
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,559
who can stop me.

595
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:38,398
Lian'er.

596
00:40:39,118 --> 00:40:41,079
Why you don't tell Young Master everything?

597
00:40:54,878 --> 00:40:56,759
I haven't told Young Master about this.

598
00:40:57,479 --> 00:40:59,398
I didn't even mention

599
00:40:59,438 --> 00:41:00,759
Nan Ruzhen's act

600
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,239
of causing my miscarriage
and stopping him.

601
00:41:04,118 --> 00:41:05,559
Do you know why?

602
00:41:08,959 --> 00:41:10,118
Neither the miscarriage

603
00:41:10,118 --> 00:41:11,039
nor her identity as a mole

604
00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:13,759
can be proven with solid evidence.

605
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:15,398
Since Young Master

606
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:17,118
takes Nan Ruzhen as a bosom friend,

607
00:41:17,918 --> 00:41:19,438
he would forgive her

608
00:41:19,438 --> 00:41:20,519
a few more times

609
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:21,519
after once or twice.

610
00:41:22,198 --> 00:41:24,398
I have not much of a chance to try.

611
00:41:26,158 --> 00:41:28,118
The evidence must be enough conclusive
to defeat her.

612
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:31,638
However, if I say nothing,

613
00:41:33,279 --> 00:41:35,878
Nan Ruzhen will be uneasy, as if having

614
00:41:35,878 --> 00:41:36,959
a fish bone stuck in her throat.

615
00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:40,799
Even a worm will turn.

616
00:41:43,598 --> 00:41:44,519
I'm sure

617
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,470
she'll end up providing
me with a chance.
