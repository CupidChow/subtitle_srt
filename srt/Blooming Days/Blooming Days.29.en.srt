=Episode 29=

17
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,840
(Qingkang Hall)
Madam Lian.

18
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:07,781
Chief Steward Yu.

19
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,598
Did Zhao'er drop by
to visit His Highness just now?

20
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,670
The first thing His Highness said
in the morning when he woke up

21
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,499
was that he missed
junior Young Master Zhao.

22
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,499
He told me to bring him here.

23
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,340
His Highness also said

24
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,900
that this might be

25
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,779
their final meeting.

26
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,820
How sick is His Highness...

27
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:39,340
I've been serving
His Highness for decades

28
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,340
and never left his side.

29
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,579
If His Highness...

30
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,859
Then, my life will become meaningless.

31
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,460
Thanks to the grace of Your Highness,

32
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,699
for appointing an official
to remove Baode

33
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:04,720
and investigating the case of
the capsized ship that ended up on land.

34
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,059
Now, the truth has become clear

35
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:10,180
that Wang Sichen bribed the government,

36
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,859
planning to invite the court...

37
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,879
Did I wake you up, Grandfather?

38
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,820
No.

39
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,699
You read it really well.

40
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,059
From now on,

41
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,579
you should come here
and read them to me every day.

42
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,020
Yes, Grandfather.

43
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:48,299
They just delivered the medicine.

44
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:49,579
It's time you drink it.

45
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,020
I don't want to drink it.

46
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,799
I've been taking this medicine for many days,
but there's no improvement at all.

47
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,020
It's useless.

48
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,299
Leave it there.

49
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,039
Illness comes very quickly,

50
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,299
but recovery takes time.

51
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,679
You need to be patient
to recover from your illness.

52
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,659
You can't rush it.

53
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,620
Zhao'er.

54
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:11,340
I have a question for you.

55
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,380
What if I never recover from this illness?

56
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,820
What should we do?

57
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:22,620
Look at me.

58
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,419
Why aren't you saying anything?

59
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:30,479
Grandfather, you have overcome

60
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,460
so many challenges in life.

61
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:34,220
It's just a minor illness
and there's no way it can defeat you.

62
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,060
Grandfather, you will be fine.

63
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:38,180
I have basic needs.

64
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,940
Just like any other humans,

65
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:42,419
I will grow old and die.

66
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:47,819
You won't.

67
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,500
You'll be fine, Grandfather.

68
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,660
You are going to teach me how to read,

69
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:53,259
how to ride a horse, and how to shoot.

70
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,319
I want to go hunting

71
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,819
with you every year too.

72
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,340
Grandfather.

73
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,099
Just drink this

74
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:00,859
and you will recover from the illness.

75
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,500
Grandfather.

76
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,539
Feed me the medicine.

77
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:19,539
Sure.

78
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:21,979
Here.

79
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:34,539
Slowly.

80
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,639
Are you all right?

81
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,500
I'm fine.

82
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,299
How long have you been here?

83
00:05:58,799 --> 00:05:59,979
I've been here for quite some time.

84
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,838
I saw that you're bonding
with your grandson,

85
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,020
so I didn't want to interrupt.

86
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,099
Your Highness.

87
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,180
I wish you good health and a long life.

88
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,099
Get up.

89
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:14,660
Thank you, Your Highness.

90
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:15,780
Have a seat.

91
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,859
Silly boy.

92
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:24,579
Grandfather likes you.

93
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,200
You should spend more time
with your Grandfather in the future,

94
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,919
so that Grandfather

95
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,139
can have a speedy recovery.

96
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,319
I'm envious of you.

97
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,220
Look at you.

98
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,539
A mother and a son
with a good relationship.

99
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,220
Your Highness is blessed with many sons.

100
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:41,660
Why are you envious of us?

101
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:44,220
I'm envious of Zhao'er.

102
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,460
I lost my father

103
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,780
when I was eight,

104
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,020
and lost my mother when I was 12.

105
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:56,259
I was made the great general when I was 16

106
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,900
and I never lost a battle
during my decade-long service.

107
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,940
Then, I got installed
with the title of Prince An

108
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,419
and moved to Quliang.

109
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,900
More than 40 years have passed.

110
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,340
I'm still in my prime,

111
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,460
but so what?

112
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,660
I was never happy

113
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,940
under my parents' care.

114
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:23,220
Therefore,

115
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,859
Zhao'er...

116
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:30,460
I'm envious of you

117
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,419
because your parents love you so much.

118
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,859
I envy all of you.

119
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,780
Zhao'er.

120
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,599
Go out there

121
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,660
and help me

122
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:47,379
burn a joss stick and say my prayers.

123
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,139
I have something
to discuss with your mother.

124
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:50,740
Yes.

125
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:52,900
Mother.

126
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:04,780
Zhao'er is a good kid.

127
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,660
Luo Qinglian.

128
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,699
I'm right here.

129
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,259
I'm critically ill now.

130
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,979
Do you have any plans?

131
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,859
No.

132
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,539
Why not?

133
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,780
Don't you want Lianxin

134
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,900
to become the next Prince An?

135
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,619
I do,

136
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,120
but my bigger wish is
that Your Highness can stay healthy

137
00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:49,699
and live a long life.

138
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,819
I have

139
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,579
many descendants,

140
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,398
but not many of them want me

141
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:04,819
to be healthy and live a long life.

142
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:13,460
I know that you didn't lie.

143
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:16,780
You stayed away from the drama
during the past few days.

144
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:20,220
You spent all your time

145
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:21,939
copying scriptures

146
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,179
and saying your prayers.

147
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,059
I witnessed it myself.

148
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,619
I thought

149
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,179
that you didn't want
to fight for the title for Lianxin

150
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:35,900
because

151
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:38,699
of the fate between us.

152
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,139
Your Highness, you will get well very soon.

153
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,660
No one is fighting for the title.

154
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:02,758
You speak

155
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,059
just like Zhao'er.

156
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:13,220
I know my condition very well.

157
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:15,660
It's destined

158
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,139
that someone will inherit my title.

159
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,699
They're not stealing it away from me.

160
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,179
If you can find a good ruler

161
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,900
for Quliang,

162
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,100
you are doing me a great favor.

163
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,259
(Your Highness still worries about
the people of Quliang even now.)

164
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,240
(We have to ensure the people's safety
and the prosperity of the city.)

165
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,860
(We can't let him down.)

166
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,420
Lianxin.

167
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,159
I can't bear seeing you

168
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,340
leading the ancestral ritual.

169
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:28,600
Therefore, I can only
send my blessings from afar.

170
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,039
Eunuch.

171
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,139
Ranyun.

172
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,540
Madam De has some gifts for you.

173
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:57,939
Since Madam Lian is away,

174
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,900
can you please collect it?

175
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,739
Right now?

176
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,078
Do you want

177
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:05,660
to keep Madam De waiting?

178
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:09,078
Madam Lian said

179
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:11,518
that I should stay
with junior Young Master at all times.

180
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,100
This is the prince's mansion.

181
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:16,699
It's completely safe here.

182
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:24,100
I heard that Madam Lian is favored.

183
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,758
Sure enough,

184
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,100
even her servants are arrogant.

185
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,100
Fine.

186
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,540
I'll deliver the message to Madam De.

187
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:35,139
Wait a minute, Eunuch.

188
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:51,159
Help!

189
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,259
- Help!
- There's an assassin!

190
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,179
- There's an assassin!
- Go!

191
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,540
There... There's an assassin.

192
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,259
The assassin went that way.

193
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,599
Don't worry, Madam.

194
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,020
There will be no mistakes this time.

195
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,039
Hurry up!

196
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,179
Excuse me.

197
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,159
Zhiyue, hurry up.

198
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,259
Hurry up.

199
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,460
Excuse me.

200
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,800
Did anyone see you
when you were on your way here?

201
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:03,799
Don't worry, Madam.

202
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,119
I took the alleys

203
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,059
and didn't see anyone on my way here.

204
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,860
Liuyan.

205
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,819
What about Young Master Hua?

206
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:12,440
We just received the letter
from Young Master Xiu,

207
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,470
saying that Young Master Hua
has crossed the border of Quliang.

208
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,320
He will arrive tonight.

209
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:17,059
Send a message
to Young Master immediately.

210
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,379
Tell him that Zhao'er is dead.

211
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,240
His Highness will definitely
change his mind.

212
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:21,980
Once Young Master Hua is back,

213
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,939
everything will be finalized.

214
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,579
Zhao'er!

215
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,758
Under His Highness' order,
I, Gu Sinian, am here

216
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:37,460
to apprehend Fourth Madam.

217
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,579
Mother!

218
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,179
Junior Young Master?

219
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,359
Zhao'er!

220
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,139
Mother!

221
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,739
Mother!

222
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:04,300
Mother, I am here.

223
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,499
Don't worry.

224
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,878
His Highness had expected

225
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,699
that someone wanted to harm you.

226
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,980
Junior Young Master Zhao.

227
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,100
Under His Highness' order,
I, Gu Sinian, would like

228
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:17,739
to ask you to do me a favor.

229
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,860
To find out the perpetrator,

230
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,939
we did all the precautions.

231
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:28,540
Now, we have both witnesses
and evidence.

232
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:29,819
Fourth Madam.

233
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:31,499
Is there anything you want to say?

234
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,540
Official Gu is really smart.

235
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,520
However, I am the wife
of the Fourth Young Master.

236
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,220
I won't allow you
to accuse me like that.

237
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,239
I will talk to Madam De
before we can come to any conclusion.

238
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,379
His Highness ordered

239
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:46,359
Gu Sinian, the Chief Clerk of the Right,

240
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,198
to arrest Ruan Zhimei on the spot

241
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:49,619
and keep the latter at Qingkang Hall.

242
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,420
If she disobeys,
she shall be beheaded on the spot.

243
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,100
Don't cry, Mother.

244
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:02,020
Don't cry.

245
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:04,499
Don't cry, all right?

246
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,259
Junior Young Master.

247
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,078
His Highness said
that after you met Madam Lian

248
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:26,460
and assured her that you were safe,

249
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,540
you shouldn't go anywhere.

250
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,719
Chief Steward Yu.

251
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,799
Things have come to an end.

252
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,100
There will be no more danger.

253
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,220
I'll go and have some fun.

254
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,499
Junior Young Master.

255
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:37,619
You have to follow the orders too.

256
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,119
Be a good boy.

257
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,139
Can I...

258
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:44,078
Keep an eye on him.

259
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,939
There shall be no mistakes.

260
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:46,980
Yes.

261
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,139
Your Highness.

262
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:49,780
Zhimei is here

263
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,979
to greet Your Highness.

264
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:01,619
Zhimei...

265
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,060
For the past years,

266
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,979
Madam De and I

267
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,219
have always taken you
as our own daughter.

268
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,078
I really wished

269
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:22,020
that I made a mistake.

270
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,339
It's a pity

271
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,678
that you failed

272
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:37,219
to control yourselves.

273
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,339
- Your Highness.
- Father.

274
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,459
Father.

275
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:43,320
There must be
a secret agenda behind this.

276
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,958
Both of us are filial to you.

277
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:46,180
Please seek justice for us, Father!

278
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:47,219
What did you say?

279
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,558
I have been seriously ill for many days,

280
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,918
but you visited Gu Sinian

281
00:18:56,919 --> 00:18:58,979
more frequently than you visited me.

282
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,459
Do you really think you're filial to me?

283
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:03,540
Lianxiu.

284
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,099
Over the past few years,

285
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,700
you colluded with your peers,

286
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,900
trying to jeopardize your brothers.

287
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,219
All you want

288
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,300
is my title, right?

289
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,099
You really put a lot of effort into this.

290
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,479
I have warned you many times,

291
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,300
but to save your face,

292
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,459
I had not said it in your face before.

293
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:30,739
It seems like I made a mistake.

294
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,139
I didn't cut you out when I should.

295
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,020
I'm nourishing a viper in my bosom.

296
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:41,979
Gu Sinian.

297
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,820
Yes.

298
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,379
Lock He Lianxiu up
in the Correctional Institution first.

299
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,060
After we confirm
the authenticity of the evidence,

300
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,798
we will pick another date...

301
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:52,619
Your Highness.

302
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,838
Once you place your order,

303
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,099
there will be no turning back.

304
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,900
Please think twice, Your Highness.

305
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:11,820
Lianxiu tried to harm your son.

306
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:14,719
For Zhao'er,

307
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,660
you shouldn't be lenient to him anymore.

308
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,639
I hate the person
who tried to harm Zhao'er so much

309
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,379
that I want to skin him alive.

310
00:20:22,439 --> 00:20:24,300
I am not lenient at all.

311
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:26,979
Today,

312
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:28,900
I'm interceding for Young Master Xiu

313
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:31,900
precisely because of Zhao'er.

314
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,499
Get up before you continue.

315
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,900
Your Highness, you have been
guiding Zhao'er since he was a kid.

316
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,499
Hence, he is a very kind boy.

317
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,020
He truly believes

318
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:56,240
that the real way to subdue others
is by showing your virtue.

319
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,198
If Zhao'er finds out that his Grandfather,
whom he respects the most,

320
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:00,700
executes his own son,

321
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,180
how is he going to convince himself?

322
00:21:04,439 --> 00:21:05,339
Secondly,

323
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,180
I suffered the pain

324
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,259
of losing a child before.

325
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,180
When I thought Zhao'er was in danger,

326
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:12,900
I despaired.

327
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,099
It was already a torture even for me.

328
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:17,619
If you execute
the Young Master Xiu yourself,

329
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:22,499
how are you going
to sleep peacefully at night?

330
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,139
Your Highness.

331
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:27,119
The lives of Young Master Xiu
and Madam Mei

332
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,420
have nothing to do with me.

333
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:31,459
But I don't want to disappoint Zhao'er

334
00:21:31,939 --> 00:21:33,640
and I don't want Your Highness
to have any regrets.

335
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,359
Chief Steward Yu.

336
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,359
Where did you go?

337
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,219
I had an upset stomach.

338
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,139
I went

339
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,359
to relieve myself.

340
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,660
Be careful.

341
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:55,318
If I see you doing this again...

342
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,300
Yes.

343
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:02,339
Junior Young Master.

344
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,739
His Highness told me
to bring you some snacks.

345
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,099
Junior Young Master.

346
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,420
Junior Young Master!

347
00:22:16,959 --> 00:22:18,099
Luo Qinglian.

348
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,300
Stop being a hypocrite.

349
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,900
There is one thing you are wrong about.

350
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,519
His Highness regrets nothing.

351
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,339
Zhimei!

352
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,239
You're being rude!

353
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,619
Why can't I do this?

354
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,918
If His Highness is a wise man,

355
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:32,438
then I will respect him.

356
00:22:32,439 --> 00:22:34,158
However, if His Highness can't tell
right from wrong,

357
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,599
why can't I be rude to him?

358
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,780
How dare you.

359
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:39,300
Arrest Fourth Madam.

360
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,420
Wait a minute.

361
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,180
Go on.

362
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:49,820
I am guilty.

363
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:51,180
But is there anyone

364
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,540
who has never sinned?

365
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:58,219
Your Highness, are you completely innocent?

366
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,219
If you wish to execute Lianxiu,

367
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:04,180
then do it now!

368
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,619
Go on.

369
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,198
You keep talking
about how kind you are.

370
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:37,719
But in the name of love,

371
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,420
you have brought more pain to others.

372
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,279
Everyone knows

373
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,719
that Your Highness dotes on the heir.

374
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,759
However, you never think highly of the heir.

375
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,438
After enduring

376
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:48,279
your discouragement for years,

377
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,300
do you think the heir has ever been
truly happy?

378
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,700
Not forgetting Zhao'er.

379
00:23:56,919 --> 00:23:58,558
Your Highness, you wanted to prove

380
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,580
that you had everything under control,

381
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,719
you used Zhao'er as bait.

382
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,279
Weren't you afraid
that you would make a mistake

383
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,940
and put him in danger?

384
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,918
Everyone says that you still refuse
to appoint an heir until now

385
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:15,000
because all the Young Masters
are equally outstanding

386
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,279
and you can't pick the right candidate.

387
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,399
But they're wrong.

388
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,158
You simply think

389
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:20,859
that no one can surpass you

390
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,219
and inherit your title as the Prince An.

391
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:37,519
I did this all on my own.

392
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,020
This has nothing to do
with Young Master Xiu.

393
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,940
Please don't vent your anger on others

394
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:45,219
and sentence me to death.

395
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,479
Father...

396
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,719
Zhimei is making this up.

397
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,078
She only said that because she panicked.

398
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:01,180
Don't blame her, Father.

399
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,759
Please don't blame her, Father!

400
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,900
Father.

401
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:06,780
Father.

402
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,660
Get up.

403
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,900
Lianxiu.

404
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,999
If you shared

405
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,859
some of Zhimei's courage,

406
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,900
you wouldn't have needed
to do so much to help Lianhua.

407
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,979
I need to think.

408
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,180
Gu Sinian.

409
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,859
Yes.

410
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,099
Arrest Fourth Madam first.

411
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,339
We will decide

412
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,259
what to do with her later.

413
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,859
Yes.

414
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,139
Your Highness.

415
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,619
I'm so sorry.

416
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,619
What's the matter?

417
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,739
I couldn't find

418
00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:27,300
junior Young Master Zhao.

419
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:47,820
Zhao'er...

420
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:58,519
Your Highness!

421
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,364
- Father!
- Your Highness.

422
00:27:59,365 --> 00:28:01,665
(Tablets of Ancestors of He Family)

423
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,979
It's time.

424
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,580
Young Master!

425
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,020
Young Master. You should go home now.

426
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,999
Something happened.

427
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,459
Something happened, Young Master.

428
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,540
Mei'er!

429
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:34,099
Mei'er!

430
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:36,739
Young Master...

431
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,219
You should leave now.

432
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,540
Young Master...

433
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,739
As long as His Highness is still alive,

434
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:53,379
I will make sure
that your name is clear,

435
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:57,459
then we still have hope
to win the title of the prince.

436
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:08,219
Young Master.

437
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,300
You took all the blame

438
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,219
because of this, huh?

439
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,459
Blame?

440
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:19,300
Legitimacy belongs to the victor.

441
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,339
If you succeed,

442
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:22,739
the merit goes to me.

443
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:27,639
I will only be locked up
for a short period.

444
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,940
It doesn't matter.

445
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,900
What about Zhao'er?

446
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,979
Did you do that to Zhao'er?

447
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:36,700
Who else could it be?

448
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,580
Who would take such a risk?

449
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,078
Lianbo and Lianchu

450
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,438
have been imprisoned for years.

451
00:29:42,439 --> 00:29:44,499
Lianzuo and Lianzhi
have their own businesses to take care of.

452
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,219
Who else could it be?

453
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,438
Who hates Lianxin so much?

454
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:52,780
The person doesn't necessarily hate him

455
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,379
because of power.

456
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,619
Did you forget about him?

457
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,219
It's him...

458
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,180
Who are you?

459
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:14,420
Where am I?

460
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:23,940
You don't know me,

461
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,139
but I know you.

462
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,619
You are He Nanzhao.

463
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:28,859
12 years old.

464
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,219
Born on the 10th day of the 11th lunar month
at Young Master Xin's Mansion.

465
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:44,780
Are you

466
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:46,540
my parents' friends?

467
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:47,900
Luckily,

468
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,820
they didn't send you here to kill me.

469
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:51,580
Do you know who they are?

470
00:30:51,959 --> 00:30:53,918
Grandfather and Mother
refused to tell me the truth,

471
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,499
so I pretended
that I knew nothing about it.

472
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:58,660
In fact, I have already guessed it.

473
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,820
It's Uncle Xiu.

474
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,900
Despite your young age,

475
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:04,940
you are so smart.

476
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,820
But you're wrong about something.

477
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,979
Although I'm an old friend
of your parents,

478
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,739
I'm not here to save you.

479
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,580
I'm here to kill you.

480
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,859
Why did you lie to me?

481
00:31:19,199 --> 00:31:22,798
If you want to kill me, you could've done it
when we were in my grandfather's mansion.

482
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,259
I would have been dead by now.

483
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,240
You brought me with you,

484
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,420
yet you could travel in and out
of the mansion so effortlessly.

485
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,580
It'd be much easier for you
if you wished to escape alone.

486
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,499
Why did you take the risk
to bring me out here?

487
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,139
Did you do it

488
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,399
because you were worried
that someone else would get ahold of me?

489
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,099
Indeed, you're just like your mother.

490
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,420
Observant and smart.

491
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,900
If you call me smart,

492
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,540
I'm not even half as smart as my mother.

493
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,119
At least,

494
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,259
I couldn't figure out

495
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:50,979
why Uncle Xiu wanted to kill me

496
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,060
even though I always respected him.

497
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,459
Everyone works hard

498
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,180
only for fame and wealth.

499
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,580
Your mother

500
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,580
gave this comb to you, huh?

501
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,499
Yes.

502
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,900
Is there any meaning behind this?

503
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,078
Mother said

504
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:33,820
that this comb belonged
to an old friend of hers.

505
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,379
She wanted me to remember her advice

506
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,859
and always remember this word.

507
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:38,580
What word is that?

508
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:39,979
Loyalty.

509
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,900
It pains me a lot

510
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,719
that I misjudged him.

511
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,700
He was...

512
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,499
He was completely oblivious
about your life.

513
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,660
It's normal

514
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,420
for one

515
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:52,060
to value fame and power

516
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,259
over friendship.

517
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,780
It's been 11 years.

518
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,180
I didn't expect

519
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,300
that you still think of me
as a villain who betrayed you.

520
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,540
What happened?

521
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,300
Indeed, you're not as smart
as your mother.

522
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,840
When she was at the age of seven,
she was already very observant.

523
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,540
She was never naive like you.

524
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,700
Remember.

525
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,979
Those who treat you nice

526
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,660
might have an agenda too.

527
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,379
Are you changing your mind?

528
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,940
Beiyi.

529
00:33:30,439 --> 00:33:31,940
Can you get me some firewood?

530
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,700
Your Highness.

531
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,139
You're awake.

532
00:33:56,919 --> 00:33:58,459
Summon Madam Lian here.

533
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:00,219
Yes.

534
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,600
- I brought you the firewood.
- Let's eat.

535
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,100
Here.

536
00:34:22,439 --> 00:34:23,140
Let's eat.

537
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,240
Glutinous Rice Cake of Mugwort?

538
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,540
It's very cold today.

539
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,659
The mugwort can get rid
of the coolness in the body.

540
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,340
We have been together for so long.

541
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,300
I know quite a bit
about these medications too.

542
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,020
It's soft and chewy.

543
00:34:37,499 --> 00:34:38,620
Nicely stuffed, but not too much.

544
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,020
Who would have thought

545
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,419
that the daughter of the prince

546
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,620
could cook so well?

547
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:45,820
You even know the function

548
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:47,259
of the mugwort now.

549
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,540
Mugwort can cure all types of illnesses,

550
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,939
but I don't like it.

551
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,020
Why?

552
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,079
I heard

553
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,499
that to gain sufficient nutrients,

554
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,340
it releases toxins from its roots

555
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,020
so that the other plants around it

556
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,780
won't be able to survive.

557
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:10,060
For its own benefits,

558
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,899
it doesn't hesitate to harm other lives.

559
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,540
Isn't that too selfish?

560
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,020
You knew about it.

561
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,020
Lian'er.

562
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,020
I'm right here.

563
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:49,259
Zhimei was right.

564
00:35:50,879 --> 00:35:53,100
I thought it was a perfect plan,

565
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,340
but I was full of myself.

566
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:00,300
It was me...

567
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:05,820
It was me

568
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,499
who put Zhao'er in danger.

569
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,300
Don't worry, Your Highness.

570
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,659
Zhao'er will be fine.

571
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,780
This...

572
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,899
If it were Lianxiu and Zhimei

573
00:36:32,879 --> 00:36:33,860
who

574
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,340
planned that,

575
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,459
they wouldn't have fallen into my trap.

576
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,620
It wasn't them.

577
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:47,860
Who else...

578
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,939
Who else could it be?

579
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,300
I have no idea,

580
00:37:01,439 --> 00:37:03,459
but there's one thing I'm sure of.

581
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,060
Zhao'er is Your Highness' descendant.

582
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,580
He is a member of the He family.

583
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,559
It doesn't matter who took him,

584
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,780
I am sure

585
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,100
that he will be fine.

586
00:37:51,919 --> 00:37:53,179
He is Zhao'er.

587
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:56,118
He is the son
of Lianxin and Luo Qinglian.

588
00:37:56,119 --> 00:37:56,878
But I'm working

589
00:37:56,879 --> 00:37:58,140
for He Lianxiu right now.

590
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,499
When did you get so loyal to Liuxiu?

591
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:03,340
Both you and I know very well

592
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,499
that you're doing this for Luo Qinglian.

593
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:07,918
Have you ever thought it through?

594
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:09,878
Even if Lianxiu fulfills his promise

595
00:38:09,879 --> 00:38:11,358
and match you up with Luo Qinglian,

596
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,699
but you kill her son.

597
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,459
Won't you be ashamed to see her again?

598
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,620
You thought

599
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,939
I was going to kill him, huh?

600
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,680
Lianxin, you just completed
the ancestral ritual.

601
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,979
You must be very tired now.

602
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,580
Why don't you take a rest

603
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,160
at this beautiful and green place?

604
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:29,739
You can go back

605
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,100
tomorrow.

606
00:38:32,399 --> 00:38:33,219
Lianzuo.

607
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,540
Do you really want

608
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:38,300
to be my sworn enemy now?

609
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,419
I never want to make foes with you.

610
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,899
It just so happens

611
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,620
that I made friends with someone else.

612
00:38:58,599 --> 00:38:59,580
Beiyi!

613
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,060
Is your surname Lv?

614
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:06,140
Zhao'er, run now!

615
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,020
It's fine.

616
00:39:09,919 --> 00:39:11,419
If I knew who he was just now,

617
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,300
I would never have thought
of escaping at all.

618
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,340
What did you say?

619
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:18,380
My Mother has been telling me this

620
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:19,820
for as long as I can remember.

621
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,219
There're six people in this world who will
put their lives at stake to keep me safe.

622
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:24,659
And they are Father,

623
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,659
Mother, Grandfather,

624
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,419
Madam Rou, and Madam Rong.

625
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,060
I had not met the sixth person before,

626
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,659
but his name is Lv Beiyi.

627
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,340
She said that, other than Father,

628
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,840
no one cares for her more than you do
in the whole world.

629
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,219
Mother told me to bring this comb
everywhere I go,

630
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,759
because she wanted me

631
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,820
to be as loyal as you are.

632
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,820
Is this the advice

633
00:39:52,439 --> 00:39:53,820
you mentioned just now?

634
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,140
Yes.

635
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,540
You're indeed too naive.

636
00:40:53,879 --> 00:40:55,419
Zhao'er!

637
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,620
Zhao'er...

638
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:16,100
Lianxiu.

639
00:41:17,439 --> 00:41:18,918
Father is still trying to buy time.

640
00:41:18,919 --> 00:41:20,739
I suppose he is waiting
for Lianxin's return.

641
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,739
You're wrong.

642
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,300
He's waiting for another person.

643
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,739
Without Zhao'er,

644
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:38,739
no matter how capable Lianxin is,

645
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,979
he is, after all, in his forties.

646
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,659
In the long run,

647
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:46,340
he is far inferior to Lianhua

648
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,438
who is in his prime

649
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:48,940
and has been well-trained
by the battlefield.

650
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,380
Therefore,

651
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,020
we still stand a chance.

652
00:41:53,399 --> 00:41:54,419
Are you saying

653
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,580
that our lives

654
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,999
depend on this now?

655
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,780
Yes.

656
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,520
