=Episode 18=

17
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:02,531
This house is in such
a terrible condition.

18
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,290
Are you sure people can live here?

19
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,650
Even the roof is collapsing.

20
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,460
There's no difference between staying here
and staying on an empty land.

21
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,891
Mao Da, is it comfortable?

22
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:18,370
Yes.

23
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,691
Try this side.

24
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:20,451
All right.

25
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:21,691
What did she say?

26
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,560
(Guards of the Southern Courtyard)
You want to sleep on an empty land?

27
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,570
(Mao Da, Mao Er)
Go ahead. No one's stopping you.

28
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,171
You!

29
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:26,010
Misters,

30
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,650
although our mistress has a low rank,

31
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:29,650
she was lucky enough

32
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,891
to be favored by His Highness.

33
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,891
Now, Young Master Xin is enraged.

34
00:02:33,051 --> 00:02:34,130
Maybe he'll regret his decision

35
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:35,891
and bring us back one day.

36
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,370
Please be kinder to us

37
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,691
and find us somewhere better.

38
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,171
So, she's someone favored

39
00:02:44,171 --> 00:02:45,051
by His Highness, huh?

40
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:47,331
Sorry for being impolite.

41
00:02:47,531 --> 00:02:47,971
Mao Da,

42
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:49,251
let's get our horses ready.

43
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,600
Horses? But why?

44
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,411
We have to send her

45
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:54,000
to His Highness's residence,
don't you think?

46
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,051
You're right.

47
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,650
My foot!

48
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:02,930
You already

49
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,210
ended up here.

50
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:05,770
You still think

51
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,531
that you're someone noble?

52
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:08,850
Stop belittling us!

53
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,891
You two will regret it

54
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,650
when our mistress goes back.

55
00:03:12,811 --> 00:03:13,370
What?

56
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,531
You think you can go back?

57
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,770
Look at the mistress living beside you.

58
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,130
Both her rank

59
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,091
and temper

60
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,730
are worse than yours.

61
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,051
When she first came to this place,

62
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,130
she almost tore the roof off.

63
00:03:30,691 --> 00:03:31,490
But now?

64
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:32,811
It's been over a year.

65
00:03:33,411 --> 00:03:35,370
No matter how fierce she is,

66
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,251
she's become tame by now.

67
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,210
What gives them the right to...

68
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:41,930
Dongli,

69
00:03:43,051 --> 00:03:43,611
just stop.

70
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:44,971
But Ms. Lian...

71
00:03:46,251 --> 00:03:47,130
I'm a deserted wife.

72
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,240
I have nothing to complain about.

73
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,051
My goodness.

74
00:04:09,531 --> 00:04:11,600
This place is one
of Young Master Xin's properties, right?

75
00:04:12,091 --> 00:04:13,891
What's with its decrepit state?

76
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:15,290
You always thought

77
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,811
Liuyun Cottage sucked.

78
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:18,730
Now, your horizons have been broadened.

79
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:20,171
I don't believe it.

80
00:04:20,331 --> 00:04:22,200
A house is only nice
because of the people living inside.

81
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,370
Ms. Lian, you can sit here for now.

82
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,691
Ms. Lian, I've cleaned up the place.

83
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:35,971
This...

84
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,930
I know they look shabby,

85
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,770
but Madam Zhen is keeping
a close eye on us.

86
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,640
Those are all the cotton clothes we have

87
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,291
for the three of us.

88
00:05:46,731 --> 00:05:47,971
Did you prepare this blanket for me?

89
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,811
Mao Da and Mao Er are right.

90
00:05:55,411 --> 00:05:56,851
I'm a commoner now.

91
00:05:56,851 --> 00:05:58,520
You guys should
stop treating me like your mistress.

92
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:04,610
Li Tang,

93
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,210
you can have this.

94
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,291
But Ms. Lian...

95
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:08,770
Take it.

96
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,330
You haven't fully recovered yet.

97
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,460
You can't afford to catch a cold.

98
00:06:12,691 --> 00:06:14,890
Dongli, you'll have to go through the trouble

99
00:06:14,971 --> 00:06:16,050
of sleeping beside me.

100
00:06:16,531 --> 00:06:17,610
That won't do.

101
00:06:17,731 --> 00:06:18,811
This place is like an ice cellar.

102
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:19,890
You'll catch a cold here.

103
00:06:20,251 --> 00:06:21,691
So, you know it's cold too?

104
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,600
Aren't you afraid
that you'll freeze to death?

105
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:24,170
Ms. Lian,

106
00:06:24,571 --> 00:06:25,490
our lives are insignificant.

107
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:26,691
But Ms. Lian, you...

108
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,131
No lives are insignificant.

109
00:06:29,131 --> 00:06:29,691
You two

110
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,610
kept me company when we came back

111
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,450
from hell's gate.

112
00:06:34,591 --> 00:06:35,680
No matter how cold this place is,

113
00:06:37,151 --> 00:06:39,200
it's never colder than the hearts
of the people in the mansion.

114
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,930
The only thing that can warm me up

115
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:44,370
is the loyalty you two possess.

116
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:45,531
From now on,

117
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,170
the three of us will
depend on each other.

118
00:06:48,811 --> 00:06:51,011
I would have no idea what to do

119
00:06:51,371 --> 00:06:52,610
if you two were to freeze to death.

120
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,811
If so, Ms. Lian, please promise us this.

121
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,291
No matter if you're a noble lady
or a commoner,

122
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:00,971
you'll always be our mistress.

123
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:13,131
This is a token
of Young Master Xin's fondness for you.

124
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,050
I couldn't bear to discard it.

125
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,770
That's why I picked it up.

126
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:21,851
Er,

127
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,370
this is frustrating.

128
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:26,971
We encountered a group

129
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,440
that didn't even have enough blankets
for themselves.

130
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,571
Initially, I wanted

131
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,291
to pick up some profit from the side.

132
00:07:33,811 --> 00:07:34,291
You...

133
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,131
Profit? Just you wish.

134
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:37,971
Why the rush?

135
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,720
A cornered beast will
do something desperate, you know?

136
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,131
Listen,

137
00:07:42,731 --> 00:07:43,650
no matter how poor they are,

138
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,360
there's a way for us
to extract money from them.

139
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:47,971
I don't believe it.

140
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,811
I don't think she's another tough nut
like Mu Haiyao.

141
00:07:52,851 --> 00:07:53,571
Mao Da, Mao Er.

142
00:07:56,411 --> 00:07:57,131
Follow me.

143
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,330
Ms. Mu, I've brought them here.

144
00:08:07,531 --> 00:08:07,851
Ms. Mu.

145
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:08,330
Ms. Mu.

146
00:08:08,851 --> 00:08:09,291
Have a seat.

147
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,091
Get up.

148
00:08:15,091 --> 00:08:16,411
It's my seat.

149
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,210
Here, have a seat.

150
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,330
Have some tea.

151
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:31,971
Ms. Mu,

152
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,170
you never offered us anything
the entire year.

153
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:37,450
I guess the sun rose from
the opposite side today, huh?

154
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:39,051
You should check the cup first.

155
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,580
(250 Taels)

156
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:55,491
250 taels.

157
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,650
250 taels?

158
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,570
Yes.

159
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,130
Ms. Mu,

160
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,130
we've been

161
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,210
serving you wholeheartedly

162
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,810
for over a year.

163
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,450
Why are you

164
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,650
insulting us?

165
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,000
What are you saying?

166
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,051
It's money.

167
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:14,411
Here are 250 taels.

168
00:09:14,411 --> 00:09:15,130
It's money?

169
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,120
We have 500 taels in total.

170
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,091
Ms. Mu,

171
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,010
what orders do you have for us?

172
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:30,010
That's right.

173
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,291
I didn't treat you guys to tea

174
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,640
because you guys weren't worthy enough.

175
00:09:34,971 --> 00:09:36,130
I'm paying you guys

176
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:37,770
because I want you guys

177
00:09:38,171 --> 00:09:39,330
to do something for me.

178
00:09:41,091 --> 00:09:41,570
What...

179
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,291
What is it?

180
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,171
What do you need?

181
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:47,690
Torture her.

182
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,250
Lianxiu is such a scum!

183
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,411
He's so despicable!

184
00:10:24,971 --> 00:10:28,890
He framed me!

185
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:29,810
Don't worry.

186
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:31,371
Nothing out there

187
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,931
will be able to affect our brotherhood.

188
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:35,480
Get on the carriage.

189
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:36,450
Here.

190
00:10:37,931 --> 00:10:39,330
Help the heir out.

191
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:40,810
What a shame.

192
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:45,330
It's a shame that my great-uncle is gone.

193
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,690
If not...

194
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:49,810
Tend to his needs.

195
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,611
Great-uncle!

196
00:10:50,611 --> 00:10:51,440
I shall take my leave.

197
00:10:53,931 --> 00:10:54,810
Great-uncle.

198
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,531
Great-uncle!

199
00:10:57,531 --> 00:11:00,531
How could you just die like that?

200
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:05,890
Lianxin, I would definitely
rip the culprit to shreds

201
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,531
if I find out who killed your child.

202
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:12,051
No matter if it's the heir or Lianxiu,

203
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,330
it's no longer important.

204
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,291
The past is in the past.

205
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:19,250
We cannot bring the dead to life.

206
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,931
Anyway, we just need

207
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:25,010
to perform our duties.

208
00:11:25,731 --> 00:11:27,731
All right. If so, Lianxin,
let me ask you this.

209
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,130
Yuan Baili has fallen.

210
00:11:29,411 --> 00:11:30,570
And, the heir is in disarray.

211
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,371
I'm afraid Lianxiu
will make his move very soon.

212
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,160
Lianxin, what do you intend to do?

213
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,291
There's no need to be anxious.

214
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,970
Young Master Xiu
is calm and collected.

215
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,130
We mustn't act recklessly

216
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,250
until we can

217
00:11:48,931 --> 00:11:50,010
confirm our chances of winning.

218
00:11:52,931 --> 00:11:53,531
It's getting late.

219
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,890
I shall take my leave.

220
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:05,690
Lianxin,

221
00:12:06,531 --> 00:12:09,091
do you think Lv Beiyi
will stay loyal to you?

222
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,051
Loyalty

223
00:12:12,051 --> 00:12:14,531
is used to describe the bond
between a servant and his master.

224
00:12:14,971 --> 00:12:17,171
Lv Beiyi is a prideful man.

225
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,371
The word "loyalty"

226
00:12:20,371 --> 00:12:21,531
cannot be used on him.

227
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,770
There's someone loyal to you.

228
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,091
She just said something out of spite.

229
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:31,890
You just had to chase her out.

230
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:36,250
It's so cold out here.

231
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:38,960
I wonder if Qinglian has enough blankets
to cover herself with?

232
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:40,611
Poor girl.

233
00:12:48,091 --> 00:12:48,770
Mr. Lv.

234
00:12:51,531 --> 00:12:52,650
May we speak in private?

235
00:12:54,531 --> 00:12:55,371
This is truly unexpected.

236
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,291
Young Master Xiu,
you actually thought

237
00:12:57,591 --> 00:12:58,800
I was the opening you're looking for?

238
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:01,010
Mr. Lv, you knew
that I was going to look for you?

239
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,920
Young Master Xiu, if you wish
to take actions to the heir,

240
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:07,600
you have to familiarize yourself
with everything Young Master Xin does.

241
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:11,010
The next closest person
to Young Master Xin

242
00:13:11,371 --> 00:13:13,250
besides Young Master Yi should be me.

243
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:15,371
It's a shame that I'm a fool.

244
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:16,690
Young Master Xiu,

245
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,690
I'm afraid I'll ruin your grand plan.

246
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:21,040
I wouldn't dare to imagine this

247
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,890
if it was in the past.

248
00:13:23,851 --> 00:13:24,731
But now,

249
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,291
he's treating Luo Qinglian poorly.

250
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:28,770
Don't you hate him?

251
00:13:30,051 --> 00:13:32,010
I'm willing to discuss
my grand plans with you.

252
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,570
Once the deed is done,

253
00:13:34,491 --> 00:13:35,810
I will promise you two things.

254
00:13:36,611 --> 00:13:38,890
First, I will get rid
of your outcast status.

255
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,130
Second,

256
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,851
I will grant you a marriage

257
00:13:43,971 --> 00:13:45,171
with Luo Qinglian.

258
00:13:52,851 --> 00:13:53,560
No need for that.

259
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,470
Don't you wish to have Luo Qinglian?

260
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,600
Young Master Xiu,
I don't need you to grant her to me.

261
00:13:58,890 --> 00:13:59,650
Farewell.

262
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,010
Young Master Xin,

263
00:14:20,731 --> 00:14:21,770
why are you standing here

264
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:22,450
with the window open?

265
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,291
It's very cold. You will catch a cold.

266
00:14:25,051 --> 00:14:25,690
Later,

267
00:14:25,851 --> 00:14:28,531
I'll get you thicker blankets and sheets.

268
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,650
This way, you'll feel warmer.

269
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,491
Li Tang, where's Ms. Lian?

270
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,371
Miss Dongli, you woken up?

271
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,611
Stop being a smart aleck. Where's Ms. Lian?

272
00:15:07,931 --> 00:15:09,511
Dongli, you've slept for a long time.

273
00:15:09,511 --> 00:15:10,800
If so, why are your eyes still closed?

274
00:15:12,851 --> 00:15:14,650
Li Tang, how could you let Ms. Lian
climb on a ladder?

275
00:15:15,051 --> 00:15:16,130
It's not Li Tang's fault.

276
00:15:16,371 --> 00:15:17,330
I wanted to do this myself.

277
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:18,570
If we repair the roof,

278
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,371
we won't need to freeze
during nighttime.

279
00:15:22,411 --> 00:15:24,570
All right. I'll help out as well.

280
00:15:45,731 --> 00:15:47,491
The food has gone stale.

281
00:15:47,491 --> 00:15:48,330
How can we eat this?

282
00:15:48,851 --> 00:15:50,400
You should be lucky
that you have food to eat.

283
00:15:50,531 --> 00:15:51,731
You're still being so picky, huh?

284
00:15:52,091 --> 00:15:53,320
Do you really think you're a consort?

285
00:15:53,851 --> 00:15:54,931
I want to thank you two

286
00:15:54,931 --> 00:15:55,960
for being so "benevolent" then.

287
00:15:56,371 --> 00:15:57,810
I wonder who you guys are serving?

288
00:15:58,051 --> 00:16:00,091
Is it the Hell King? Or Judge Bao?

289
00:16:02,531 --> 00:16:03,210
Fine.

290
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:07,371
I'm glad that you know we're kind people.

291
00:16:07,931 --> 00:16:08,330
Mao Da,

292
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,450
she's insulting us.

293
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:13,491
She's insulting us?

294
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:18,491
Were you saying that we were
guards of the underworld?

295
00:16:19,171 --> 00:16:21,250
You can eat it if you like.

296
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:23,890
Take it or leave it.

297
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,880
Who said we're not eating?

298
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,210
We'll die from hunger if we don't eat.

299
00:16:30,931 --> 00:16:32,411
Or, is there someone

300
00:16:32,411 --> 00:16:33,690
who wants to starve us to death?

301
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,531
- Why are you...
- Stop.

302
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:37,690
Listen.

303
00:16:38,371 --> 00:16:39,440
This is the secondary courtyard.

304
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,880
This is the only food we have here.

305
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,091
Take it or leave it.

306
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,680
(Secondary Courtyard)

307
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:21,891
Young Master Xin,

308
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:23,570
why is this place so decrepit?

309
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,280
Is this even fit for people to stay?

310
00:17:25,771 --> 00:17:26,930
I don't think I can stay here

311
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:27,851
for even one day.

312
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:34,851
Mao Er,

313
00:17:35,371 --> 00:17:35,771
they...

314
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,771
They're actually eating.

315
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,091
Let them eat then.

316
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,731
Eat up. Eat more if you like it.

317
00:17:46,371 --> 00:17:48,071
Deliver the box back to me
once you guys are done.

318
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:58,170
Mao Da,

319
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,410
why do you look hungry now?

320
00:18:01,731 --> 00:18:02,170
Let's go.

321
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:02,491
This...

322
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,570
You make me worry every day.

323
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:04,371
Come on.

324
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,170
They actually...

325
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,290
But Ms. Lian...

326
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,480
There's nothing to be upset about.

327
00:18:18,771 --> 00:18:20,000
No matter how terrible the food is,

328
00:18:20,091 --> 00:18:21,360
at least it can fill our tummy.

329
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,290
We'll only have energy
if we have our fill.

330
00:18:25,131 --> 00:18:26,050
One day,

331
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:28,091
we'll return the pain

332
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,170
to those who land us in this sorry state.

333
00:18:34,611 --> 00:18:36,210
Young Master Xin, let's go inside.

334
00:18:37,891 --> 00:18:38,491
Look.

335
00:18:38,971 --> 00:18:39,971
We came all the way here

336
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:41,771
to see Ms. Lian, am I right?

337
00:18:49,771 --> 00:18:50,690
Let's go inside then.

338
00:19:01,491 --> 00:19:02,720
I think there's someone outside.

339
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:03,891
Is it a thief?

340
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,050
Li Tang, why don't you check it out?

341
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,160
No need for that.

342
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:10,651
Thieves won't show themselves
during daytime.

343
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:12,091
Maybe

344
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:13,011
it's just someone nosy.

345
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:14,450
Let's eat.

346
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:18,731
Ms. Mu,

347
00:19:19,611 --> 00:19:20,371
Luo Qinglian

348
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:22,131
actually finished the leftovers

349
00:19:22,131 --> 00:19:23,280
delivered by Mao Da and Mao Er.

350
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,011
To some people,

351
00:19:27,491 --> 00:19:28,771
stale rice

352
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,771
is better than fresh dishes.

353
00:19:36,371 --> 00:19:37,450
But since when

354
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:39,731
did Luo Qinglian

355
00:19:39,731 --> 00:19:41,131
resign herself to adversity?

356
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:45,520
Get on the carriage.

357
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:46,210
Yi?

358
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:47,611
This...

359
00:19:47,891 --> 00:19:49,491
There's a village 300 li to the East.

360
00:19:49,491 --> 00:19:50,651
It's remote and hard to locate.

361
00:19:50,651 --> 00:19:51,771
I've already checked the route.

362
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:52,611
Pack your stuff.

363
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,131
We can leave Quliang

364
00:19:54,131 --> 00:19:55,091
in three days the fastest.

365
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:56,570
No one

366
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,371
will be able to find us after that.

367
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:01,131
Let's go.

368
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,330
I cannot leave.

369
00:20:03,251 --> 00:20:04,170
I have to wait for Rou's

370
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,251
and Rong's news.

371
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:06,570
I haven't found out

372
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:07,651
the cause of my child's death.

373
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,330
I can't just let my child die for nothing.

374
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:12,371
What about you then?

375
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,611
Must I only sit idly by as you suffer

376
00:20:15,611 --> 00:20:16,810
and starve here?

377
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,131
Lian'er, I promise you.

378
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,810
I'll keep an eye
on the Xin's Mansion at all times.

379
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,251
Once I find evidence,

380
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,971
I'll join you in complaining to Prince An.

381
00:20:32,011 --> 00:20:32,690
Yi,

382
00:20:33,771 --> 00:20:35,290
you became an outcast because of me.

383
00:20:36,431 --> 00:20:38,160
I mustn't implicate you
for the rest of your life.

384
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,160
You should head back.

385
00:20:40,311 --> 00:20:41,491
Return to Young Master Xin's side,

386
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:44,011
help him to inherit the title,
and get rid of your outcast status.

387
00:20:46,251 --> 00:20:46,960
Just forget about me.

388
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,440
This is a sign of courtesy.

389
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,011
If you guys take it,

390
00:21:10,371 --> 00:21:12,570
I'll be your new mistress
from here on out.

391
00:21:25,011 --> 00:21:26,040
It's fine if you don't take it.

392
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,480
However, do not cause trouble
for me again.

393
00:21:32,611 --> 00:21:34,410
I've already died once.

394
00:21:35,131 --> 00:21:35,651
I don't mind

395
00:21:35,971 --> 00:21:37,680
bringing two more people
to the underworld with me.

396
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,530
Ms. Mu.

397
00:21:56,731 --> 00:21:57,851
She...

398
00:21:58,091 --> 00:21:59,930
Slow down. Don't panic.

399
00:22:01,091 --> 00:22:01,930
Greetings, Ms. Mu.

400
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,851
Regarding what you've done before,

401
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,960
I'm not necessarily ignorant about them.

402
00:22:09,091 --> 00:22:11,050
I'll let bygones be bygones.

403
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,611
Now, I've changed my mind.

404
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:15,170
If I wish to lead my life in peace
in the Southern Courtyard,

405
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:16,930
I know I have

406
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,611
to get along with you.

407
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,251
Since both of us are already commoners

408
00:22:21,611 --> 00:22:23,131
with no titles, husband,

409
00:22:23,251 --> 00:22:24,011
or families,

410
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,651
getting along is what we should do.

411
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,840
Yao, don't you think I'm right?

412
00:22:31,051 --> 00:22:33,000
I already instructed Mao Da and Mao Er
to make some porridge.

413
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,330
If you like to have some,

414
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,011
you may instruct Ruhua
to get a bowl of it.

415
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,120
It's only been a few days since we met,

416
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,360
yet she seems like
an entirely different person.

417
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,731
(All that was in the past
is as if dead yesterday;)

418
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:54,131
(all that is to come
is as if born today.)

419
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,611
(Nan Ruzhen, this is all your fault.)

420
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,851
(I will live on.)

421
00:23:01,651 --> 00:23:03,971
(It might take one month, one year,
or the rest of my life.)

422
00:23:04,891 --> 00:23:07,851
(There is ample time. I will make
a comeback eventually.)

423
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,450
(As long as I still have
to depend on He Lianxin,)

424
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:16,851
(Qinglian will still serve him)

425
00:23:16,851 --> 00:23:18,330
(out of guilt.)

426
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,591
(However, if Young Master Xiu
is the one who inherits the title,)

427
00:23:20,591 --> 00:23:22,251
(He Lianxin will cease to be an obstacle)

428
00:23:22,251 --> 00:23:23,330
(between us.)

429
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,380
(Secondary Courtyard)

430
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,480
(Lianwei House)

431
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,840
(Two Years Later)

432
00:24:08,511 --> 00:24:10,440
I heard that Nan Ruzhen
has been promoted to a side consort.

433
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:11,810
That's right.

434
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,720
I heard that she was promoted long ago.

435
00:24:13,891 --> 00:24:16,360
It's just that Young Master Xin
was busy with the heir's affair before this.

436
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,630
He finally has time to promote her now.

437
00:24:18,631 --> 00:24:20,580
Prince An has shown the heir
the cold shoulder for two years.

438
00:24:21,091 --> 00:24:22,530
He was watching idly by
as Young Master Xiu

439
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,620
expands his influence gradually.

440
00:24:23,731 --> 00:24:24,830
Of course he's frustrated by it.

441
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:26,851
Ms. Lian,

442
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,210
it's been two years since we moved

443
00:24:29,371 --> 00:24:30,530
to the Southern Courtyard.

444
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,160
There's no rush.

445
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,400
Ms. Lian knows what to do.

446
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,200
I'm in no hurry at all.

447
00:24:34,651 --> 00:24:37,170
So, except me, you guys
knew what would going on?

448
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,690
Ms. Lian, what are we waiting for?

449
00:24:41,891 --> 00:24:42,371
Ms. Lian.

450
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:43,810
Mr. and Mrs. Chen.

451
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,810
We wish to borrow your farming tools.

452
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,000
What's with the sudden request?

453
00:24:47,731 --> 00:24:48,450
We had no choice.

454
00:24:48,651 --> 00:24:49,771
Prince An will go on a hunt again.

455
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,800
We can't work in the fields
for the next few days.

456
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,450
We have to harvest the grains
as soon as possible.

457
00:24:53,971 --> 00:24:54,410
That's right.

458
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:55,450
Here.

459
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,091
Go ahead.

460
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,720
- Thank you, Ms. Lian.
- Don't mention it.

461
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:58,971
Let's go.

462
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,600
(The Heir's Residence)

463
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,410
Young Master Xin, Young Master Yi,

464
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:16,131
The heir is requesting you guys
to head back first.

465
00:25:16,131 --> 00:25:17,570
He said he's not seeing any guests

466
00:25:18,011 --> 00:25:19,050
as he's feeling unwell.

467
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:25,810
Come on.

468
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,651
It's solid and heavy.

469
00:25:38,611 --> 00:25:39,680
It has excellent quality indeed.

470
00:25:40,611 --> 00:25:41,851
You actually got it right.

471
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,871
Father didn't take him with him
for the fall hunt.

472
00:25:43,871 --> 00:25:44,771
Is he not worried at all?

473
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,330
Who said he's not worried?

474
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,290
The more worried he is,

475
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,720
the higher the chance
that he won't see us.

476
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,530
His mansion is huge.

477
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:53,971
It's filled with his dignity and pride.

478
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:57,091
But luckily, I won this treasure

479
00:25:57,851 --> 00:25:59,330
from our bet.

480
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,491
Come on. Don't be a sore loser.

481
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:04,371
Lianxin,

482
00:26:04,851 --> 00:26:05,570
Father wasn't willing

483
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,930
to see Lianchu for the past two years.

484
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,410
But Lianxiu is gaining influence.

485
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,180
Although Lianchu indulges himself
in worldly desires,

486
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,570
Lianxiu is wicked.

487
00:26:11,851 --> 00:26:13,280
We mustn't allow him to take over Quliang.

488
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:14,731
What should we do now?

489
00:26:15,771 --> 00:26:17,050
Father has his own plans.

490
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:18,971
We shall wait.

491
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:20,651
We shouldn't be too anxious.

492
00:26:23,731 --> 00:26:24,170
Lianxin,

493
00:26:24,851 --> 00:26:25,851
I do have an idea.

494
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,360
I'm just afraid
that you might disagree with it.

495
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,891
Since you knew that I was going
to disagree with it,

496
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:31,840
just keep it to yourself.

497
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:33,851
Lianxin,

498
00:26:33,851 --> 00:26:35,930
you knew Father
loves listening to Qinglian.

499
00:26:36,131 --> 00:26:37,280
It wouldn't end up like this

500
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,830
if you released her
from the Southern Courtyard

501
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,430
and told her to praise Lianchu
in front of Father.

502
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,000
Sixth time.

503
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:42,371
What?

504
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,660
This is the sixth time.

505
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,570
I'll see how many times
you'll get the cheese

506
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,930
before you learn your lesson.

507
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,290
It's not that I'm forgetful.

508
00:26:50,511 --> 00:26:51,920
But Lianxin,
you're being unreasonable here.

509
00:26:53,091 --> 00:26:53,931
I don't understand at all.

510
00:26:53,931 --> 00:26:56,050
You could get yourself a woman
with little to no effort.

511
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,611
You're the best at flirting with women.

512
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,491
Now you fall in love with this woman,

513
00:27:00,491 --> 00:27:01,611
but you act like a stone.

514
00:27:03,651 --> 00:27:04,091
Lianyi,

515
00:27:04,691 --> 00:27:05,771
do you have someone you fancy?

516
00:27:05,771 --> 00:27:06,330
No, I don't.

517
00:27:06,551 --> 00:27:08,240
Have you ever lost your appetite
because of someone?

518
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,011
No.

519
00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:10,680
Have you ever lost your sleep
because of someone?

520
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:11,491
No.

521
00:27:12,011 --> 00:27:13,530
Look at you. Who's the rock here?

522
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,570
You're full of nonsense.

523
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:17,520
We have no choice here.

524
00:27:17,651 --> 00:27:20,050
We can only let Lianchu
make preparations for the fall hunt.

525
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:22,371
Let's hope
that Father will change his mind

526
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:23,611
after seeing his effort.

527
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,400
Using that to make your father
to change his mind, huh?

528
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,360
That means we're declaring
that the heir is at his wits' end.

529
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:30,480
What do you think then?

530
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:31,880
He shouldn't go.

531
00:27:32,131 --> 00:27:32,771
What?

532
00:27:33,281 --> 00:27:34,480
Are you telling Lianchu to give up?

533
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:35,800
I wasn't referring to him.

534
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,280
I was referring to Prince An.

535
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:45,330
What did you say?

536
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:50,611
Say that again?

537
00:27:54,371 --> 00:27:56,450
Father, please cancel

538
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,410
the group hunt.

539
00:28:06,971 --> 00:28:07,891
Who was the one

540
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,851
who taught you mounted archery?

541
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,771
Father, I will never forget

542
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:16,011
what you've done for me.

543
00:28:16,731 --> 00:28:19,410
If so, do you still remember

544
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:20,131
what I said?

545
00:28:22,371 --> 00:28:23,011
Father, you said

546
00:28:23,611 --> 00:28:25,651
one can rule the world,
defend against outer threats,

547
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,600
and prevent internal conflict
with mounted archery.

548
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,731
That's why you hold a hunt
at the border regions every year.

549
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,011
You did so to make us
get better at mounted archery.

550
00:28:34,091 --> 00:28:34,780
It's been many years.

551
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,731
Father, although you were always busy
with official affairs,

552
00:28:36,731 --> 00:28:38,891
you still held it every year.

553
00:28:42,611 --> 00:28:43,690
Very good. Here.

554
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:47,891
Thank you, Father.

555
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,651
You did remember my words clearly.

556
00:28:53,651 --> 00:28:54,170
Very good.

557
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,330
Among all of my sons,

558
00:28:59,011 --> 00:29:01,891
you're the most intelligent of them all.

559
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:03,771
No one can rival you

560
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,210
when it comes to academic achievements.

561
00:29:09,251 --> 00:29:10,330
So what?

562
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:13,891
How much do you know about

563
00:29:13,891 --> 00:29:14,930
what it takes to rule the world?

564
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:20,290
None. You know nothing about it.

565
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,290
You only know how to form your own gang

566
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,800
and indulge yourself in worldly desires.

567
00:29:26,011 --> 00:29:27,091
You've never done something

568
00:29:27,091 --> 00:29:28,011
decent before.

569
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:29,930
You know very well

570
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,210
why I showed you the cold shoulders

571
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,611
for the past two years.

572
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,131
Not only did you

573
00:29:35,131 --> 00:29:36,120
not reflect upon your actions,

574
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,170
but you're also stopping me

575
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,640
from holding the hunt
due to your hate for me

576
00:29:38,731 --> 00:29:40,891
when I said that I wouldn't
be bringing you to the hunt.

577
00:29:41,491 --> 00:29:43,651
Father, I dare not do so.

578
00:29:44,251 --> 00:29:44,731
I'm just...

579
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:46,651
I...

580
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:47,930
What is it?

581
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:48,930
I...

582
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:50,410
What is it?

583
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,160
It's because of the people.

584
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:02,170
Father,

585
00:30:03,731 --> 00:30:04,530
during the hunt,

586
00:30:05,131 --> 00:30:06,851
over a hundred generals and soldiers

587
00:30:06,851 --> 00:30:07,851
will be dispatched.

588
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,491
It's a waste of manpower and resources.

589
00:30:10,971 --> 00:30:12,891
And, towns and roads
will be sealed too,

590
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,771
causing inconvenience for the public.

591
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,091
Moreover, people are not allowed

592
00:30:16,651 --> 00:30:17,570
to approach Deer Terrace.

593
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:20,450
That means they aren't
able to work in the fields.

594
00:30:22,131 --> 00:30:23,570
Right now, it's fall harvest season.

595
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,050
The people had worked hard
for an entire year.

596
00:30:26,251 --> 00:30:27,131
Their annual livelihood

597
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,320
depends on the harvest entirely.

598
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:30,810
Father, please practice wise judgment.

599
00:30:33,011 --> 00:30:34,330
You and your flattering words.

600
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:50,851
Father,

601
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:52,731
I understand now.

602
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:55,851
Father, you're holding the group hunt

603
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,651
to preserve the peace in Quliang.

604
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,971
Lianchu is persuading you
to cancel the hunt

605
00:31:01,371 --> 00:31:02,450
not for his own sake.

606
00:31:02,771 --> 00:31:04,330
It's because
he's concerned about the people.

607
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,290
Father, it's a blessing to both you

608
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:07,491
and Quliang.

609
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:09,011
What blessing?

610
00:31:09,771 --> 00:31:11,170
He's defying
the customs of our ancestors.

611
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:12,971
He's being unfilial!

612
00:31:28,251 --> 00:31:29,760
Say that you're willing
to receive punishment.

613
00:31:32,971 --> 00:31:33,410
Father,

614
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:38,450
although I'm your son,

615
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:39,651
I'm also

616
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:42,731
the heir of Quliang.

617
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:44,050
I...

618
00:31:45,651 --> 00:31:46,131
If I...

619
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:47,170
If I were to be...

620
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,491
punished because of this...

621
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:50,210
Father, if I were to be punished

622
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,450
because of this,

623
00:31:52,091 --> 00:31:52,530
I...

624
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:54,091
I'm willing

625
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,050
to accept my punishment.

626
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:11,011
Is that truly what you think?

627
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,050
That's what

628
00:32:14,491 --> 00:32:15,371
I think.

629
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:49,891
Really?

630
00:32:51,491 --> 00:32:52,570
Are you sure you're not lying?

631
00:32:53,851 --> 00:32:54,450
Yes, Father.

632
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:27,651
Good.

633
00:33:29,851 --> 00:33:32,131
Although you're inflexible,

634
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:35,450
you're thoughtful.

635
00:33:36,971 --> 00:33:39,210
Very good.

636
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,371
I'll tell the Rituals and Customs Bureau

637
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,771
that from next year onward...

638
00:33:46,371 --> 00:33:48,810
No. From this year onward,

639
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,210
all taboos will be rendered invalid.

640
00:33:51,971 --> 00:33:53,280
The people can proceed to work as usual.

641
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:56,651
Thank you, Father.

642
00:34:05,771 --> 00:34:06,251
Lianchu.

643
00:34:07,251 --> 00:34:07,731
Father.

644
00:34:12,771 --> 00:34:15,770
You're finally thinking
about the people now.

645
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:16,970
My effort

646
00:34:18,211 --> 00:34:20,490
was not in vain after all.

647
00:34:23,371 --> 00:34:24,131
Thank you, Father.

648
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:25,680
All right.

649
00:34:27,611 --> 00:34:28,131
You may rise.

650
00:34:29,891 --> 00:34:30,250
Get up.

651
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:46,010
Father,

652
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,730
you educated me since young.

653
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,470
I reflect upon my actions every day.

654
00:34:50,931 --> 00:34:52,120
I dare not forget about your words.

655
00:34:53,931 --> 00:34:55,851
Now that I've achieved my wish,

656
00:34:57,931 --> 00:34:58,730
I shall take my leave.

657
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:01,570
Yes.

658
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:03,970
You should go back early.

659
00:35:04,891 --> 00:35:06,570
You have to depart
tomorrow morning after all.

660
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,570
Head back and make some preparations.

661
00:35:45,851 --> 00:35:46,730
When did you come?

662
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:47,960
You didn't notify me at all.

663
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,660
I was looking at a scene
from a painting.

664
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,411
I couldn't bear to ruin it.

665
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,490
You look relaxed.

666
00:35:56,611 --> 00:35:57,400
Has the deed been done?

667
00:35:58,171 --> 00:35:58,931
Just as you predicted,

668
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:00,651
Prince An felt relieved.

669
00:36:00,731 --> 00:36:02,560
He's allowing the heir
to join him on the hunt.

670
00:36:03,451 --> 00:36:04,691
I was worried that Prince An

671
00:36:04,691 --> 00:36:06,320
might be furious
when you told me about your plan.

672
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,720
This is truly surprising.

673
00:36:08,171 --> 00:36:10,211
Although Ms. Jinfang
only taught you for a few days,

674
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,980
you actually managed to understand

675
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,280
Prince An's personality to this extent.

676
00:36:14,211 --> 00:36:15,611
It's all thanks
to Ms. Jinfang's teaching.

677
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,320
There's an affinity between
Prince An and I as well.

678
00:36:26,611 --> 00:36:27,250
What about him?

679
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,120
What about your affinity with him?

680
00:36:33,131 --> 00:36:34,440
We promised not to mention him.

681
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:35,290
We also promised

682
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,211
to let him know
that you're indispensable

683
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,680
and let him bring you back
to his residence.

684
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,131
It's not time yet.

685
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,451
What time?

686
00:36:44,891 --> 00:36:45,730
For the past two years,

687
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,440
you did all those things through me.

688
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,200
What exactly are you waiting for?

689
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,200
You do have a point.

690
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,770
Winning a person's heart

691
00:37:03,371 --> 00:37:04,931
is much harder than

692
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:06,411
growing plants.

693
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:08,371
Yi.

694
00:37:12,211 --> 00:37:14,050
I'll stop here. I broke the rule first.

695
00:37:37,931 --> 00:37:39,091
Father changed his mind.

696
00:37:40,171 --> 00:37:41,920
He's allowing Lianchu
to join him on the hunt again.

697
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,570
I assume Lianxin

698
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:46,010
knew about this as well.

699
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:48,240
Young Master Xiu,
you don't need to beat around the bush.

700
00:37:49,371 --> 00:37:50,211
It was my idea.

701
00:37:53,631 --> 00:37:55,171
Young Master Xiu,
there's no need to be furious.

702
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:56,570
Although I promised

703
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:57,651
that I would help you out,

704
00:37:58,171 --> 00:37:59,490
I also said this to you before.

705
00:38:00,651 --> 00:38:02,330
As long as there's a request
from Luo Qinglian,

706
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:03,970
I'll definitely fulfill it.

707
00:38:04,171 --> 00:38:04,810
Lv Beiyi.

708
00:38:05,651 --> 00:38:06,691
Young Master Xiu,

709
00:38:07,691 --> 00:38:09,720
do you truly think it's bad for you
that Prince An is bringing

710
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,851
the heir to the hunt?

711
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:15,770
Your Highness,

712
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,411
after our calculations,

713
00:38:17,931 --> 00:38:19,570
Young Master Xiu has the most prey.

714
00:38:19,851 --> 00:38:22,371
Young Master Xin
is right up there with him.

715
00:38:22,371 --> 00:38:23,810
He's a close second.

716
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,010
Good.

717
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,851
They're the descendants
of the He family indeed.

718
00:38:31,171 --> 00:38:31,570
Someone.

719
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:33,691
Bring me my gun.

720
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:38,010
Lianxiu.

721
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:39,451
Yes, Father.

722
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,080
I've kept this matchlock with me

723
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,211
for many years.

724
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:49,050
Today, I will reward you with it.

725
00:38:51,651 --> 00:38:52,730
Thank you, Father.

726
00:38:53,371 --> 00:38:54,691
I will definitely do my best

727
00:38:55,131 --> 00:38:56,320
to practice mounted archery.

728
00:39:20,131 --> 00:39:22,211
Lianxiu actually won the hunt.

729
00:39:24,371 --> 00:39:26,851
Father treasures that matchlock dearly.

730
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,260
He didn't give it to me even though
I requested it from him many times.

731
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:33,371
But he actually gave it to Lianxiu.

732
00:39:34,411 --> 00:39:35,530
It's just a gun.

733
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,680
Lianchu, if you like it that much,

734
00:39:37,931 --> 00:39:39,411
I'll acquire several of them for you

735
00:39:39,411 --> 00:39:40,050
in the future.

736
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:41,570
This is not about the gun.

737
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:43,371
It's about who Father favors.

738
00:39:45,611 --> 00:39:47,091
Father is treating me differently now.

739
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:50,010
In the past, Father

740
00:39:50,611 --> 00:39:51,851
only had eyes for me.

741
00:39:52,451 --> 00:39:54,691
One time, I couldn't
join the hunt as I was ill.

742
00:39:55,171 --> 00:39:57,091
Father got himself a wild hare
that was five-jin heavy.

743
00:39:57,091 --> 00:39:58,371
He even wrote to me on purpose,

744
00:39:58,371 --> 00:39:59,760
lamenting that I couldn't
see it for myself.

745
00:40:00,411 --> 00:40:01,010
But today?

746
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:07,611
He wasn't even looking at me.

747
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,570
Lianchu, you're too anxious.

748
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:13,770
Look. Father already

749
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:14,960
brought you to the group hunt.

750
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,091
You have plenty of chances

751
00:40:17,091 --> 00:40:18,371
to make a comeback in the future.

752
00:40:19,171 --> 00:40:20,411
There's ample time in the future.

753
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:22,691
Ample time in the future?

754
00:40:23,891 --> 00:40:26,451
A long delay may give rise
to many a hitch.

755
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:27,451
Reporting in!

756
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:29,570
Young Master Xin.

757
00:40:30,611 --> 00:40:31,131
What is this?

758
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:32,851
Show it to me.

759
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:36,131
Put it down first.

760
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:47,560
Where did you get this?

761
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,091
Your Highness,

762
00:40:50,931 --> 00:40:53,000
this is an offering contributed
by the tribal nobles.

763
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,290
It's quite similar

764
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:55,530
to the matchlock that Prince An

765
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:56,680
has rewarded Young Master Xiu with.

766
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,170
They were afraid
that they might mix them up.

767
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,480
That's why they told me to bring it here
and ask you for your opinion.

768
00:41:01,691 --> 00:41:03,050
It's perfectly fine. Bring it back.

769
00:41:03,351 --> 00:41:03,931
Yes.

770
00:41:10,411 --> 00:41:11,131
Lianchu,

771
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,050
it's an offering to Father.

772
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,530
That's precisely why I'm interested in it.

773
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,171
Lianchu, I'm afraid
this is inappropriate of you.

774
00:41:20,371 --> 00:41:21,050
Maybe you should...

775
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:21,611
Enough.

776
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,400
I'm the heir of the state, you know?

777
00:41:26,211 --> 00:41:28,411
There's nothing wrong with me
taking one of Father's guns.

778
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:40,490
You know what to do, right?

779
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,050
A matchlock has lost.

780
00:41:42,691 --> 00:41:44,160
I should cross it out
on the inventory list.

781
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:44,931
