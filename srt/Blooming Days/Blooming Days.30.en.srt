Your Highness!

18
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:00,980
Speak.

19
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,730
Madam Lian just sent someone over
to inform us

20
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,270
that junior Young Master Zhao

21
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:08,060
has

22
00:02:09,859 --> 00:02:10,859
passed away.

23
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,880
(Chief Clerk of the Right of Quliang
Qi Liangfu)

24
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:28,619
Your Highness.

25
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,060
Your Highness.

26
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,259
Just tell me.

27
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,659
Don't worry.

28
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:38,700
I can still cope with it.

29
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,220
Your Highness.

30
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:47,060
My condolences, Your Highness.

31
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,739
Junior Young Master Zhao has been thoughtful
from childhood.

32
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,459
If he knew that,

33
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:55,420
he wouldn't want Your Highness

34
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:56,739
to be sad.

35
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:00,259
I got it.

36
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:04,420
Summon Gu Sinian

37
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,819
and Qi Liangfu here.

38
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:11,300
Alright.

39
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,179
Lianxin.

40
00:03:21,179 --> 00:03:21,819
Let's battle.

41
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,179
Young Master Zuo!

42
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,770
The Mansion has asked for you.

43
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,099
His Highness learned
about junior Young Master Zhao's death.

44
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,350
Something bad might happen!

45
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:50,860
Lianzuo!

46
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,540
You're a father as well.

47
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,470
Don't you understand the pain
of losing a child?

48
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,099
You're also a son.

49
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:57,300
Our Father is dying.

50
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,379
Don't you want to see him

51
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:59,459
one last time?

52
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:42,190
His Highness summoned us here
at this time.

53
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,659
Could it be that...

54
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:45,219
Exactly.

55
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,379
Why now?

56
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,020
Stop guessing.

57
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,400
His Highness has an order.

58
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,140
Summon Young Master Xin.

59
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,620
Lianxin is yet to arrive.

60
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,499
Is he still unaware of the news?

61
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,900
Each Young Master

62
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,380
was personally escorted from his mansion

63
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:21,339
by someone from the Chief Clerk Bureau.

64
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,259
Who dares to delay

65
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,819
such an important matter?

66
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,680
Lianxin carried out
the ancestral ritual.

67
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,140
Of course he is different from us.

68
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:31,339
It's understandable to slack off

69
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,740
every once in a while.

70
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,270
Official Gu, please inform Father
about this,

71
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,819
so that he won't keep waiting,

72
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:40,180
making his condition worse.

73
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,740
Who dares to make
Father's condition worse?

74
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,180
Young Master Xin, please.

75
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:14,219
Father.

76
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:16,379
I'm here.

77
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,140
How's Father?

78
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,259
Lianxiu.

79
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,150
Zhao'er is already dead,

80
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,880
but Father still summoned
Lianxin alone to see him.

81
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,910
Could it be that he's passing
his title on to him?

82
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,339
There's no way

83
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:00,140
to avoid this war after all.

84
00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:03,099
Do you know

85
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:08,379
why I called you in alone?

86
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,700
No, I don't.

87
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:16,580
I'll give you a painting

88
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,499
with six words on it.

89
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,659
Take a look.

90
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:41,900
"Endure for a little while
to enjoy better days ahead."

91
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,300
Look at it whenever you have time.

92
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,460
Don't forget what I've said

93
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,819
to you today.

94
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,420
You can hang it

95
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,700
in your study in Qingkang Hall.

96
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,300
Qingkang Hall?

97
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,539
Father.

98
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,900
I've been in Quliang

99
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,420
for 40 years.

100
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,180
I had high hopes for Lianchu initially.

101
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,300
Unfortunately, the things
that he has achieved

102
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,139
as the heir in the past decades

103
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,940
did not meet my expectations.

104
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,099
Lianxiu is indeed talented as well,

105
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,779
but he's too scheming.

106
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,260
All he thinks about

107
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,740
is himself.

108
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,019
He's not trustworthy.

109
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:00,420
You're the only one, Lianxin.

110
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:01,940
Father.

111
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:06,620
I've been observing you for a long time.

112
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:08,699
You're affectionate,

113
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,579
capable,

114
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,300
clever,

115
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:15,180
and bold, too.

116
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,779
Hence,

117
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,380
you're the most suitable one

118
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,699
to inherit

119
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:25,180
the title of "Prince An."

120
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,579
And only you

121
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,300
can carry out my unfulfilled will.

122
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:32,060
Father.

123
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:35,500
Did you not choose me

124
00:09:37,219 --> 00:09:38,579
because of Zhao'er?

125
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:47,820
Do you think

126
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:53,539
I'd bet decades of my life's work

127
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:56,459
on this with you?

128
00:09:59,339 --> 00:09:59,820
Father.

129
00:10:06,099 --> 00:10:07,060
He Lianxin.

130
00:10:10,219 --> 00:10:11,019
Yes, Father.

131
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,740
I want you to swear to Heaven

132
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:17,420
that what I say

133
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:19,899
from now on

134
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:21,899
will not be divulged

135
00:10:23,099 --> 00:10:24,380
to anyone else.

136
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,740
May Heaven be my witness,

137
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,699
I, He Lianxin,

138
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:35,500
will keep this a secret.

139
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,820
If I break my oath...

140
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,980
Luo Qinglian.

141
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,779
Swear on Luo Qinglian.

142
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:46,820
If I break my oath,

143
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:49,420
I, He Lianxin,

144
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,060
and Luo Qinglian

145
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,360
shall not be together
for the rest of our lives,

146
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:56,459
and I shall die

147
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,180
a lonely death.

148
00:11:30,099 --> 00:11:30,659
Open it.

149
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:39,060
Father,

150
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,459
this is...

151
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:43,899
Father.

152
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,659
It's

153
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,380
my promise to His Majesty.

154
00:11:57,779 --> 00:11:58,420
Commander He,

155
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:00,260
after you arrive at Quliang,

156
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,099
make sure you don't get distracted.

157
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,270
You must do everything you can
to strengthen Quliang.

158
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,060
Your Majesty,

159
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:07,270
I'm not going anywhere.

160
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,459
The grand chancellor
oppressed Your Majesty

161
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,170
and transferred away
loyal subjects.

162
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,339
So, even if I have to risk my life,

163
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:16,180
I'll stay by your side to protect you,
Your Majesty.

164
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,219
Mu is now under
the grand chancellor's rule.

165
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,779
The only way to survive
is to stay away.

166
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,580
I'm fine with enduring the humiliation
for the time being.

167
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,219
One day, when you're rich

168
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,820
and powerful enough,

169
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,270
you'll surely be able to return
to the Capital

170
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,300
and root out the traitors.

171
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,620
Your Majesty.

172
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:37,900
Your Majesty,

173
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,180
the grand chancellor's men
are coming.

174
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,740
Hurry up and leave.

175
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,470
We mustn't let
the grand chancellor's men

176
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,880
know that we're meeting in private,

177
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:45,779
or else our plan will probably fail.

178
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,339
Remember this.

179
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,620
Quliang gaining power

180
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:51,380
means there's hope for Mu.

181
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:54,260
No matter it's 10, 20, or 30 years,

182
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:57,500
I'll be here everyday,
waiting for your return.

183
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,459
This is my personal effect.

184
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:02,659
I hope this jade pendant

185
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,820
can keep you company at all times.

186
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:06,860
Your Majesty!

187
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:12,579
We'll be found if we don't leave now.

188
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:17,779
Let's go.

189
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:18,740
Hurry up.

190
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:21,740
Your Majesty!

191
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,530
Please take good care of yourself.

192
00:13:25,699 --> 00:13:26,459
I'll fight for you

193
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:27,860
when I return.

194
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,630
(So Father, you've been working so hard)

195
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:35,740
(for the past decades)

196
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,820
(to build up Quliang,)

197
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:41,300
so that you can return to the capital

198
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,060
to save the Emperor?

199
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:51,180
It's a pity

200
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:54,980
that I'm doing so well in Quliang,

201
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,270
but the grand chancellor's power

202
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:01,539
is also growing rapidly

203
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:03,860
in the capital.

204
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,180
I don't have

205
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,579
what it takes to defeat him at all.

206
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,820
It has been 40 years.

207
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:19,420
40 years.

208
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:23,539
40 years have passed.

209
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,420
His Majesty

210
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:27,940
is over 50 years old now.

211
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:30,300
I wonder

212
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,260
how much longer he can wait.

213
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,180
His Majesty is weak in power.

214
00:14:40,219 --> 00:14:41,219
Back then,

215
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,060
he couldn't even keep
something as personal

216
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,539
as a jade pendant.

217
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,180
I wonder

218
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,860
how he managed

219
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,420
to suffer in silence all these years.

220
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,980
I know my own body.

221
00:15:02,219 --> 00:15:03,940
My time is almost up.

222
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:04,860
Father.

223
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,459
I

224
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,820
can no longer assist His Majesty.

225
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,539
I want you to inherit my title.

226
00:15:16,099 --> 00:15:16,620
Father.

227
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:19,339
I'm counting on you

228
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:22,219
to fulfill my aspiration.

229
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:38,940
Father.

230
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,420
Young Masters,

231
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,880
His Highness has summoned
you all inside.

232
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:25,060
- Father.
- Father.

233
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,699
My health

234
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:31,539
is failing.

235
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,459
I can no longer manage
government affairs.

236
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,300
However,

237
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:42,899
I've chosen a wise Prince

238
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,459
for you all.

239
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:47,300
From now on,

240
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:51,899
all of you must support him
wholeheartedly.

241
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,860
No second thoughts shall be allowed.

242
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,339
- We understood, Father.
- We understood, Father.

243
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,339
After I'm gone,

244
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:08,300
my third son, He Lianxin,

245
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,980
shall inherit the title of "Prince An."

246
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,020
We will definitely support
the new Prince with all we have.

247
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:51,860
Fu'er.

248
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:54,740
I've

249
00:17:56,099 --> 00:17:58,140
kept you waiting for too long.

250
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,660
It's time for me to come

251
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:02,579
and accompany you.

252
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,059
I

253
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:15,219
have no regrets.

254
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,179
However, Zhao'er...

255
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,260
Father.

256
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:20,939
Zhao'er.

257
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,459
(Your Highness!)

258
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,459
Zhao'er.

259
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,179
Your Highness.

260
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:09,939
Father.

261
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,020
Father!

262
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:49,740
Physician!

263
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,699
Father.

264
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:20,020
Father!

265
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:25,740
Prince An has passed away!

266
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,740
(Prince An of Quliang, He Yunshuo,
has passed away.)

267
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:52,930
(All his life,
he knew right from wrong,)

268
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,740
(and appointed the best candidates.)

269
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:57,020
(Under his rule,)

270
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,900
(Quliang's politics were in good order,)

271
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,680
(and its people were rich and populous.)

272
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,860
(A barren land was transformed
into a city of peace.)

273
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,380
(His deep devotion)

274
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,179
(to Quliang and Mu)

275
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,740
(will forever remain on this land,)

276
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,059
(and inspire the He family
to move forward.)

277
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,980
I don't even have anyone
to look forward to now.

278
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,380
Madam!

279
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,380
Madam!

280
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:20,179
(After the new Prince took over,
he controlled the inner city strictly.)

281
00:22:20,699 --> 00:22:21,500
(For seven days,)

282
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,500
(all officials are forbidden
to enter the city,)

283
00:22:23,939 --> 00:22:25,579
(unless they are ordered to do so.)

284
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:39,900
Madam!

285
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,579
Madam!

286
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,419
The late Prince An
passed on his title to Young Master.

287
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,179
Young Master is now the new Prince!

288
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,660
He has become the new Prince!

289
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,660
Is that true?

290
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:54,939
Absolutely!

291
00:22:55,299 --> 00:22:56,699
The news from the Mansion

292
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,780
couldn't have been false.

293
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,419
Young Master...

294
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,339
No!

295
00:22:59,699 --> 00:23:02,540
His Highness is on his way here.

296
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,140
His Highness has arrived!

297
00:24:14,459 --> 00:24:16,740
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

298
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,579
You all may rise.

299
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:19,459
Thank you, Your Highness.

300
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:22,120
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

301
00:24:24,459 --> 00:24:25,740
Why are you back, Your Highness?

302
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,579
Shouldn't you be in mourning?

303
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:30,339
We've taken care

304
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,980
of Father's casket.

305
00:24:33,219 --> 00:24:34,219
I just wanted to come back

306
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,740
and check

307
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,380
if all of you are doing well.

308
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,540
Don't worry, Your Highness.

309
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:45,020
We're all fine.

310
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,450
Heading back to the Mansion for the wake
is more essential.

311
00:24:48,339 --> 00:24:49,179
All of us

312
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,540
will mourn for Father

313
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,860
and pay our respects here

314
00:24:52,339 --> 00:24:53,819
at the Young Master's Mansion.

315
00:24:55,699 --> 00:24:56,339
Alright.

316
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,020
Zhao'er.

317
00:25:12,699 --> 00:25:13,540
Is he...

318
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,500
Greetings, Father.

319
00:25:34,579 --> 00:25:35,260
Zhao'er!

320
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,740
You're still too naive indeed.

321
00:26:20,939 --> 00:26:21,579
Mother.

322
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:28,980
Zhao'er!

323
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,500
Mother.

324
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:31,740
Mother.

325
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,070
(Did you think you can stop me
by coming here yourself?)

326
00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:36,500
(I'm not here to stop you.)

327
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,620
To each their own.

328
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,080
There's no need to force ourselves.

329
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:43,459
I'm here

330
00:26:43,459 --> 00:26:44,500
to ask you a favor.

331
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:48,299
If Young Master is defeated tonight,

332
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,459
I hope you can save Zhao'er.

333
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,880
What about you then?

334
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,930
Are you going to die together with him?

335
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,020
Are you really

336
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,380
so deeply in love with him

337
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,299
that you'd rather die with him?

338
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:06,059
If we can be together,

339
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,500
why should we care about life and death?

340
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,770
Why are you entrusting me with this?

341
00:27:15,939 --> 00:27:17,419
I'm a treacherous traitor.

342
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:19,980
Why do you trust me?

343
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,140
Yi, do you still remember

344
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,699
what I told Zhao'er?

345
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,830
Mother said, apart from Father,

346
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,770
you're the one who treats her the best
in this world.

347
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,650
Mother told me to carry
this comb with me,

348
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,880
so that I could be
as affectionate and loyal as you.

349
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,299
Yi,

350
00:27:41,219 --> 00:27:42,299
there's not only

351
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,020
one type of love in this world.

352
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:47,380
A bosom friend is also someone

353
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:49,980
whom we can trust with our life.

354
00:27:54,579 --> 00:27:55,500
I experienced

355
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,179
the pain of losing a son

356
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,339
on top of my Father's death
in one night.

357
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,419
Qinglian,

358
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,180
how could you be so cruel
and lie to me like that?

359
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,370
Of course I couldn't bear to do it,

360
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,819
but it was the only way

361
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,380
to ensure Zhao'er's safety.

362
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,080
Besides, what I can't bear more
is to see you become depressed

363
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,860
for the rest of your life
by thinking you gained the title

364
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,699
because of Zhao'er.

365
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,500
You've gone to great lengths

366
00:28:23,699 --> 00:28:25,740
to prove Father's sincerity
in passing on his title,

367
00:28:26,819 --> 00:28:28,260
and to resolve my deepest worries.

368
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:32,020
Qinglian.

369
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,620
Your deepest worries

370
00:28:37,579 --> 00:28:38,419
are also

371
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:39,740
my deepest worries.

372
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:46,260
However,

373
00:28:47,219 --> 00:28:48,219
if Father really

374
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,579
did pass me his title because of Zhao'er,

375
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:54,270
aren't you afraid that he'll change his mind
after learning about Zhao'er's death,

376
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,790
and all our efforts over ten years
will go down the drain?

377
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:58,020
I've never been afraid,

378
00:28:58,459 --> 00:29:00,020
because, like the late Prince,

379
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:02,819
I've never doubted that Your Highness

380
00:29:03,339 --> 00:29:05,059
is the person Quliang can rely on.

381
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:09,860
Qinglian,

382
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,380
Father...

383
00:29:16,219 --> 00:29:17,299
(May Heaven be my witness,)

384
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,620
I, He Lianxin,

385
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,620
will keep this a secret.

386
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,860
If I break my oath...

387
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:29,459
Swear on Luo Qinglian.

388
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,540
If I break my oath,

389
00:29:36,459 --> 00:29:37,260
I, He Lianxin,

390
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,500
and Luo Qinglian shall not be together
for the rest of our lives,

391
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,020
and I shall die

392
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,740
a lonely death.

393
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,339
Your Highness.

394
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,099
What were you trying to say?

395
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:56,819
I wanted to say

396
00:29:57,819 --> 00:29:58,620
that it's a shame

397
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,260
Father didn't know the truth.

398
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:04,059
He thought Zhao'er died because of him,

399
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,939
so he must've died with a grudge.

400
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,660
Actually...

401
00:30:13,459 --> 00:30:14,059
Your Highness,

402
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,419
junior Young Master Zhao has been found.

403
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:28,500
So, Yu Dechang told Father

404
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:31,579
that Zhao'er wasn't dead?

405
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:37,900
The late Prince has been extremely kind

406
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,020
to Zhao'er and me.

407
00:30:39,219 --> 00:30:40,540
How could I let him

408
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,939
die in regrets?

409
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,579
Qinglian.

410
00:30:54,579 --> 00:30:55,140
Qinglian.

411
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,200
There's one more person

412
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,699
I don't know what to do with.

413
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,939
Do you mean Fourth Madam?

414
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,059
What do you have on your mind?

415
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,480
She should be beheaded
as her punishment.

416
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,939
But if I do so,

417
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,670
Lianxiu will definitely
rebel against me.

418
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,870
I just took over not long ago.

419
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:21,500
Firstly, I can't afford
to go through such turmoil.

420
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,540
Secondly,

421
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,980
I'll fail Father's dying wish.

422
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,459
Qinglian.

423
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,980
I'm not saying this
because of my history

424
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,579
with Fourth Madam previously.

425
00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:35,260
It's fine, Your Highness.

426
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,980
It's all in the past now.

427
00:31:38,819 --> 00:31:39,939
I don't have a good memory.

428
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,339
I only remember what's in front of me

429
00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:44,419
and see who's in front of me.

430
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:48,860
Qinglian,

431
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,579
Father has passed away,

432
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,970
and we have to be in mourning
for three years.

433
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:53,819
During this period,

434
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,299
you and all the consorts

435
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,140
in our mansion can only stay

436
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,980
at Lord Rui's Mansion.

437
00:32:01,459 --> 00:32:02,140
I...

438
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,900
I understand.

439
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:07,860
I'll be waiting for Your Highness

440
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,660
at Lianwei House.

441
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,500
Wait for me here.

442
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,939
Are you afraid

443
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,740
that He Lianxiu will despise you

444
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,780
if you betray him?

445
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,219
I've never wanted

446
00:32:52,219 --> 00:32:53,380
to be a loyal person.

447
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,660
Just let him hate me all he wants.

448
00:32:57,299 --> 00:32:58,260
What's on your mind then?

449
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:01,860
I remembered

450
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:03,579
something Lian'er once said.

451
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:06,860
I once tried to win Lian'er back

452
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:08,860
by telling her,

453
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,059
"Young Master Xin is just trying
to be the Prince

454
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:11,910
by any means necessary."

455
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,540
However, she said,

456
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,140
"He's indeed trying to be the Prince

457
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:16,860
by any means,

458
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:19,500
but not just for the sake of power.

459
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:20,939
It's because

460
00:33:21,219 --> 00:33:22,500
he knows he'll be a good Prince.

461
00:33:23,699 --> 00:33:25,020
He wants Quliang to be strong,

462
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,980
while its people live in peace.

463
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,740
He believes he can do it,

464
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,059
and not anyone else."

465
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,179
With a wife like her,

466
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,430
what more could a man ask for?

467
00:33:43,459 --> 00:33:44,660
It's not hard to find

468
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,620
a talented and beautiful woman.

469
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,260
What's hard

470
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,580
is to find one who can read
and understand a man's mind.

471
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,380
I've never regretted

472
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,419
betraying Your Highness,

473
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,660
because

474
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,419
I had the chance to win her back.

475
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,699
Then, why did you change your mind?

476
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,339
I've figured out some things.

477
00:34:11,059 --> 00:34:11,579
Moreover,

478
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,419
Quliang needs a wise Prince.

479
00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:29,459
(It's not just about that anymore.)

480
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,379
(Quliang needs a wise Prince.)

481
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:32,500
(Our country needs)

482
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,100
(an unencumbered Emperor.)

483
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,270
I have one more important thing
to tell you.

484
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,980
I knew Lianxiu

485
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,859
would summon Lianhua back to Quliang,

486
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,219
so I sent a message

487
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:06,020
to Mu Tianshu,

488
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:07,780
asking him to help

489
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,419
stop Lianhua's army.

490
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,419
The day before the ancestral ritual,
he wrote back,

491
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:16,100
offering his help on one condition.

492
00:35:18,939 --> 00:35:19,580
What was it?

493
00:35:22,139 --> 00:35:23,260
Release Mu Haiyao.

494
00:36:26,459 --> 00:36:28,459
Prince is rewarding us today.

495
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,780
Now that we're all here,

496
00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:34,619
whose palanquin is that?

497
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:36,820
This mansion is huge enough

498
00:36:37,899 --> 00:36:38,899
to accommodate us,

499
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,240
of course there's room
for an old friend.

500
00:36:45,859 --> 00:36:47,780
Orders from the Prince!

501
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,939
Orders from the Prince.

502
00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:10,060
"I've stayed at the Young Master's
Mansion for a very long time.

503
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,820
My consorts are virtuous

504
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:14,340
and principled.

505
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,080
Their contributions cannot go unnoticed,

506
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,980
so they deserve a great reward."

507
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,060
- Thank you for your grace, Your Highness.
- Thank you for your grace, Your Highness.

508
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,139
Side consort, Madam Lian.

509
00:37:44,379 --> 00:37:45,219
Yes.

510
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,740
You've been granted one
Colorful-Lacquered Lotus Leaf Tray,

511
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,300
a pair of Sapphire-Encrusted

512
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,419
Plum-Blossom-Shaped Golden Hairpins,

513
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,659
one Ruyi-Beaded Curtain,

514
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,459
and one Jadeite Cabbage
Flower Arrangement.

515
00:38:00,379 --> 00:38:02,100
Thank you, Your Highness.

516
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:21,219
His Highness does care for you, Madam.

517
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,379
These gifts are much more valuable
than the ones just now.

518
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,820
Madam,

519
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,300
these rewards are not meant for you.

520
00:38:29,939 --> 00:38:31,820
Eunuch, you must be mistaken.

521
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:32,820
Besides Madam,

522
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,100
who else deserves

523
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:34,939
such great rewards?

524
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,939
Mu Haiyao, please accept your rewards.

525
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,820
(Yes.)

526
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,060
You've been granted

527
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,580
one Carved-Jade Screen,

528
00:39:40,659 --> 00:39:43,540
one Carved-Red Sandalwood
Patterned Lidded Box,

529
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:47,100
a pair of Eight Steeds
Ivory-Carved Ornaments,

530
00:39:47,459 --> 00:39:50,859
one Pagodite-Carved Grape Ornament,

531
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:54,020
and a pair of Purple-Glazed
Kiln-Formed Fishtail Vases.

532
00:39:54,179 --> 00:39:55,939
Thank you, Your Highness.

533
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,619
Sisters,

534
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,139
I haven't seen everyone in years.
How have you all been?

535
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,980
After years of living alone
in the secondary courtyard,

536
00:40:22,179 --> 00:40:22,780
I'm reunited

537
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,939
with you again now.

538
00:40:27,899 --> 00:40:29,459
Thank Heavens for that.

539
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,139
Madam Rui,

540
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,699
please take care of me from now on,

541
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,859
and forget my past mistakes.

542
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,830
It seems that years of meditation

543
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,659
have really changed you.

544
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,139
You were being too modest though.

545
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,500
Official Mu is a great warrior.

546
00:40:52,379 --> 00:40:54,100
Nowadays, everyone in Quliang

547
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,699
is relying on the Mu Family
to take care of them.

548
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,500
All these years, whether it was for
the Young Master's Mansion,

549
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,899
or for His Highness,

550
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:05,060
we've all been indebted to Qinglian
for her great assistance.

551
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,300
If you need someone's care,

552
00:41:09,659 --> 00:41:10,980
you should ask her instead.

553
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:14,740
Madam said that

554
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,340
to make Mu Haiyao

555
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,179
hate on Lian'er, no?

556
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:19,170
Madam is trying to make
Mu Haiyao understand

557
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,270
that as long as Lian'er is on our side,

558
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,659
she'll never be able

559
00:41:23,459 --> 00:41:24,820
to call the shots again.

560
00:41:27,459 --> 00:41:28,060
Is that so?

561

Qinglian, I wonder if you still remember
the gift you gave me

when you left
the secondary courtyard that day.

00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,859
It's worth all those years
we've spent together.
