Impossible. Impossible!

18

Father.

19
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,679
Lian'er.

20
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:30,159
Lian'er.

21
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:34,840
Lian'er,

22
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,959
how have you been recently?

23
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,560
Has His Highness
vented his anger on you?

24
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,000
Clearly, it's you who are suffering,

25
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,840
yet you still care about me.

26
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,239
I am the one being unfilial.

27
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,159
It's not that you're unfilial.

28
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,000
It's that I am incapable.

29
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,560
I

30
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,519
get what I deserve,
and my death is not to be regretted.

31
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,599
I'm afraid

32
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,760
I might drag you down.

33
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,159
You get what you deserve?

34
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,640
Is your statement true?

35
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:16,840
I'm afraid it's true.

36
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:20,799
I don't believe it.

37
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:26,519
You have been the deputy
at the Testaments and Treasures Bureau

38
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,760
for two years.

39
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:30,760
Being diligent and flawless.

40
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,519
Handling military supplies
is a huge responsibility.

41
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,679
How could you

42
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,159
make such a big mistake?

43
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,200
How is that possible?

44
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,599
I've asked myself

45
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,599
this question

46
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,120
hundreds and thousands of times.

47
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:44,239
I clearly watched

48
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,758
as the military supplies

49
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,079
were packed into the boxes.

50
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,439
I wrote a seal and affixed it.

51
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,478
But now,

52
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:52,799
this seal is still securely attached.

53
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,439
If it weren't for
my negligence and oversight,

54
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,439
how could it have been mixed with bran?

55
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,760
Father.

56
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,439
Father, you are only responsible

57
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,200
for preparing food supplies.

58
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,280
There are others in charge of

59
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:10,439
escorting military supplies

60
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,799
and handling this case.

61
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,480
Are you saying

62
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,879
that someone framed me?

63
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,640
It's not possible.

64
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,879
Dozen carts of military supplies

65
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,680
passed through many hands.

66
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,480
Trying to make a switch on the way

67
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,839
without detection is impossible.

68
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,599
Think about it,

69
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,838
how could

70
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,680
all the relevant people

71
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,080
be in unanimous agreement?

72
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,999
No matter how many people
it went through,

73
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,319
they are only obedient

74
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:51,200
to two individuals.

75
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,238
I didn't expect Fang Huairui

76
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:58,200
and Ruan Zhimei to join forces.

77
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,279
I'm afraid that today's events

78
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,119
are just the beginning.

79
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,319
Your Highness.

80
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:16,080
I guarantee with my life

81
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,559
that my Father
never replaced the military supplies.

82
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,960
I ask you to investigate thoroughly.

83
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,040
Your Highness.

84
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,398
Father is devoted to Quliang

85
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,599
and serves you.

86
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,399
It's impossible for him
to commit treason.

87
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:32,439
He is old

88
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,279
and physically frail.

89
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,398
He cannot endure the suffering of jail.

90
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,360
Your Highness.

91
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,680
Your Highness.

92
00:05:48,065 --> 00:05:52,385
(Free Pardon)

93
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,399
Too old for prolonged imprisonment.

94
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,680
Temporarily released from prison.

95
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:19,599
Disposal will be made after
further investigation.

96
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,599
Madam.

97
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,719
His Highness knew

98
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,159
that you would be very anxious,

99
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,080
so he deliberately issued this pardon.

100
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:28,958
Surprisingly, Madam

101
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,439
is more anxious than he expected.

102
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,640
Su Nanchun.

103
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,520
Yes.

104
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,439
Release him.

105
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,439
Yes, Your Highness.

106
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:37,119
Madam.

107
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,599
Who asked you to get up?

108
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,360
Your Highness.

109
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,760
Why?

110
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,879
Do you only know these two words?

111
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,719
Do you know why you're punished?

112
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,680
I didn't believe you.

113
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,879
Now you understand.

114
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:24,119
If you repeat your mistakes,

115
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,760
I'll punish you until the evening.

116
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,719
Alright.

117
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,439
But what if

118
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,278
the person who willfully framed him

119
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,639
won't let it go?

120
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,119
They won't let it go, so what?

121
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,719
They want to convict him based on

122
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,839
these few seals alone?

123
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,599
Don't worry.

124
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,520
I can still withstand

125
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,119
the current accusations.

126
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,680
The box containing military supplies.

127
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:10,319
Is this the evidence?

128
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:12,119
Lianxin.

129
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,439
Look closely.

130
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:21,609
(Seal)

131
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,479
There is a hidden mechanism.

132
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,319
Yes.

133
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:27,319
So even if the seals are not broken,

134
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:29,399
the food supplies
can still be replaced with bran.

135
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,078
While this box

136
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:37,638
can give Luo Rongyu

137
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,679
some relief,

138
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,039
it still can't catch

139
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,278
the real mastermind behind this.

140
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,680
This box is not easy to make.

141
00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:44,839
Such skilled craftsmen,

142
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,279
how many can there be
in the entire Quliang?

143
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,639
Lianxiu is meticulous in his actions.

144
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,559
He probably won't leave any survivors.

145
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,000
You guessed it right.

146
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:54,799
The other witnesses

147
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,159
have already been silenced.

148
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,838
But as luck would have it,

149
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,399
only this craftsman managed to escape.

150
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,959
I have found this person.

151
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,519
At the latest, by early tomorrow,

152
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,959
he can be brought to Quliang.

153
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:10,000
Great.

154
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,199
Tomorrow.

155
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,560
Qinglian.

156
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,000
I can finally fulfill the promise

157
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,199
I made to you.

158
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,279
(Mansion of Prince An)

159
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,360
Princess Consort, it's bad.

160
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,519
The criminal has already confessed.

161
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,958
Why are you panicking?

162
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:27,980
He's one of Lord Li's.

163
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,320
No, Princess Consort.

164
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,638
The criminal confessed

165
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,040
that it's Young Master Erge.

166
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,560
What?

167
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,759
It's Ruan Zhimei.

168
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,560
Fourth Madam has arrived

169
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:44,040
and is waiting at the door.

170
00:09:54,319 --> 00:09:55,360
What?

171
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,639
You had Erge confess?

172
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,000
Fourth Madam.

173
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,839
Are you joking?

174
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,159
Just because

175
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,320
you've trained a loyal guard

176
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,239
doesn't mean you can push all the blame

177
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,680
onto our Fang family.

178
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,838
Don't forget,

179
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:16,639
it was Lord Li who intervened.

180
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,398
It might not be enough
to frame and accuse

181
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,479
based solely on the words of one criminal.

182
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,040
You are right, Princess Consort.

183
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,519
Kindly request Official Fang

184
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,320
to confess the crime in person.

185
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,800
Fourth Madam, have you gone crazy?

186
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,800
You have time to go insane,

187
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,440
but I don't have time to play with you.

188
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Zuiliu, escort her out.

189
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,519
Princess Consort, wait.

190
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,240
I've heard some news

191
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,519
and I'd like to tell you about it.

192
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,359
(His Highness just took office.)

193
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,040
(He is bound to introduce new policies.)

194
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,560
(First, it's to weaken
the influence of the Fang family.)

195
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,719
(Even if considering the many years
of marriage with you,)

196
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,599
(this vast family fortune
is likely to have a significant impact.)

197
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,878
(Fang family clings on the prince.)

198
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:10,320
(Losing some money is not a big deal.)

199
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,758
(But with the fall of Quliang,)

200
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:13,120
(the Fang family is ruined.)

201
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,398
(His Highness,
for loyalty and righteousness,)

202
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:17,279
(will surely start a battle
to save the emperor.)

203
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,639
(When the court raises an army
to attack Quliang,)

204
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,599
(Fang family will also be gone.)

205
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,399
(Are you willing to take that?)

206
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,359
It's a life-and-death struggle,

207
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,000
to end in mutual destruction,

208
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,318
or join me

209
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:32,920
to try and turn the tide?

210
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,599
It's up to you.

211
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,999
(This time, you act with righteousness,)

212
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,398
(in line with His Highness's wishes.)

213
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,560
(Have Fang Erge accept the punishment,)

214
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,000
(gaining significant merit.)

215
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,479
(You'll secure your position of
Princess Consort)

216
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,880
(and preserve the Fang family.)

217
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:50,880
(Afterward, no matter what you do,)

218
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,480
(it will be smooth sailing.)

219
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,279
Why you did this?

220
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,920
I didn't have a choice, Huairui.

221
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,759
Ever since Luo Rongyu found out

222
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,480
about my embezzlement,

223
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,320
I've been restless day and night.

224
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:05,078
I have nightmares every night.

225
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:06,278
I dream that he goes to His Highness

226
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:06,999
to tell on me,

227
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,159
and rats on me.

228
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:10,278
I was truly desperate,

229
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,440
only then I mixed bran
into the military supplies.

230
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:14,599
So, you framed and harmed others.

231
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,880
All manner of evil!

232
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,438
Luo Rongyu's family is so innocent.

233
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:20,880
The people of Quliang are so innocent.

234
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,560
Save you.

235
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:24,759
How can I save you?

236
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,320
Huairui,

237
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,880
you are the Princess Consort.

238
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:31,560
Plead to His Highness,

239
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,479
he will surely show mercy, Huairui.

240
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,199
You know I am the Princess Consort too.

241
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,719
Princess Consort

242
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:39,318
should help with His Highness's concerns

243
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,920
and seek the well-being of Quliang.

244
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,559
Now, my own younger brother

245
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,438
has committed such harm

246
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:44,920
to the nation and the people.

247
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,240
How can I save you?

248
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,680
Huairui.

249
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,639
You wouldn't, would you?

250
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,839
Get up.

251
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,719
Get up.

252
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,199
I'll go with you

253
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,279
now to see His Highness.

254
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:16,599
Go... Go to see His Highness.

255
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,239
Go confess to His Highness.

256
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,679
Let's go.

257
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,359
No, no, I won't go, Huairui.

258
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,398
Huairui, you have to save me.

259
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,999
You have to save me, Huairui.

260
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,758
Get up!

261
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:25,519
Huairui!

262
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,800
We, members of the Fang family,
are loyal and courageous.

263
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,438
Even if I'm no longer Princess Consort,

264
00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:31,239
I won't spare

265
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,800
the heinous crime you committed.

266
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,958
Get up!

267
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,000
Huairui!

268
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,159
You don't need to.

269
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:46,399
Your Highness.

270
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,240
Huairui,

271
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:53,199
you truly understand the greater good.

272
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,519
Having you as the Princess Consort

273
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,279
is my fortune,

274
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,240
and it's Quliang's fortune.

275
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:03,440
Your Highness.

276
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,759
I, Fang Erge,

277
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,000
don't want to die.

278
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:10,759
Your Highness.

279
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,438
Please spare my life.

280
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:14,398
Your Highness!

281
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,719
Fang Erge.

282
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,000
Harming the loyal and innocent.

283
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,719
The crime is unforgivable.

284
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,440
Execution by beheading.

285
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,959
Your Highness, spare my life, please.

286
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,120
Your Highness.

287
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,800
Spare my life, Your Highness!

288
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,000
Your Highness!

289
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,560
Your...

290
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,599
Your Highness!

291
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,880
(Huairui,)

292
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:42,920
(don't be sad.)

293
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,320
(Only if you keep your
Princess Consort title,)

294
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:52,880
(there is a hope for our Fang family.)

295
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,159
(My death alone for)

296
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,159
(the Fang family to live.)

297
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,279
(I)

298
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,680
(die with no regrets.)

299
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,759
(I'm sorry.)

300
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,759
(I'm useless.)

301
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,519
(I let you bear everything alone.)

302
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:36,388
(Mansion of Prince An)

303
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:38,199
Sweet.

304
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,440
So sweet.

305
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,398
You're in such a good mood,

306
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,159
it's not just because

307
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,880
of the dessert soup I made, is it?

308
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,438
Could it be that there's progress
in the tax investigation?

309
00:16:48,439 --> 00:16:50,880
It's not just progress
in the tax investigation.

310
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,599
I've already uncovered

311
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,119
the widespread extortion

312
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,919
and unlawful levies throughout Quliang.

313
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,959
It's truly shocking.

314
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,398
So, I'm planning

315
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,398
to summon those officials today.

316
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,279
I want to thoroughly investigate the matter.

317
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,120
Although they

318
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,440
don't represent half of
all the officials involved,

319
00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:10,078
once they confess,

320
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,479
I'm going to announce something.

321
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,639
Something that can shake

322
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,639
Quliang to its core.

323
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,159
Your Highness.

324
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:19,840
Your Highness, something major
has happened.

325
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,280
The officials you were going to summon,

326
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,320
they have all...
they have all committed suicide.

327
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:25,159
What?

328
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,440
(Consumed poison, threw themselves
in a well, and hung themselves.)

329
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,640
(No matter how serious the crime,
they may get a light sentence.)

330
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,879
(Why would they
be in such a hurry to die?)

331
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,558
What kind of secrets

332
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,918
are hidden within

333
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,279
that made them willing to die

334
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,279
to conceal the truth?

335
00:17:56,919 --> 00:17:59,320
It will be extremely difficult

336
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,960
to uncover the truth in the future.

337
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,720
How difficult...

338
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,720
No matter how difficult, I must do it.

339
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:07,759
Both of you can leave.

340
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,200
Yes, Your Highness.

341
00:18:13,243 --> 00:18:14,663
(New Policy)

342
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,759
This is...

343
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,239
A new policy.

344
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,440
You want to distribute
the Mansion of Prince's land to the people

345
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,639
and exempt all people in the outcast status

346
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,159
to ensure that all have land to farm.

347
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,399
Is this the core-shaking event

348
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,680
you mentioned earlier?

349
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,198
The extortion,
the weakness of the soldiers,

350
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:44,399
the empty treasury,

351
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,519
and the unshakable power

352
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,720
of the Fang family.

353
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,519
All of these problems

354
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,279
stem from the old policies.

355
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,840
Qinglian,

356
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,840
do you remember I once said

357
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,239
that I wanted

358
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,279
a Quliang that is just and clear?

359
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,798
Just the extortion

360
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:01,279
has driven these officials

361
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:02,720
to sacrifice their lives.

362
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:05,040
If we implement these new policies,

363
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,359
I don't know how many

364
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,399
challenges and dangers lie ahead.

365
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:10,960
Your Highness,

366
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:12,558
you implement the new policies,

367
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,279
is to make Quliang stronger, right?

368
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,119
Yes.

369
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,840
Making Quliang stronger

370
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:18,879
would enable us to send troops

371
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:20,119
to rescue the emperor

372
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,440
and fulfill late Prince An's wishes.

373
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:26,279
So, you've already figured out

374
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,720
Father's secret.

375
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,960
Take a look at this.

376
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:50,238
(Letters to His Majesty)

377
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:51,800
Late Prince An

378
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:53,840
has been secretly communicating
with His Majesty.

379
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,078
They had the idea

380
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:00,440
of enforcing the new policies long ago.

381
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,999
I

382
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,879
always felt that the late Prince An

383
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,399
had a sincere heart,

384
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,840
but I never thought

385
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:10,320
that His Majesty

386
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,080
also possessed both talent

387
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,600
and compassion for the people.

388
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,960
If he could regain power,

389
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:18,119
perhaps...

390
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,159
Qinglian,

391
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,920
the concerns you have

392
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:23,279
are something I've pondered
countless times.

393
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,678
My loyalty

394
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:26,040
isn't to a title

395
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:29,040
but to a wise ruler
who can benefit the people.

396
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,759
Even if the new policy is hard,

397
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,639
I will stay strong on my own,

398
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,879
and I won't turn back.

399
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:44,359
Who said you are alone?

400
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,200
I've said that

401
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,440
even if it's a hard path,

402
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,119
I want to walk it with you.

403
00:20:54,244 --> 00:20:56,864
(Mansion of Prince An)

404
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:05,080
I'm sending my greetings to you,
Madam Yao.

405
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:12,320
I sincerely and wholeheartedly

406
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,960
wish to form an alliance with you.

407
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,080
Same purpose and virtue,
sharing fortunes and misfortunes.

408
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,359
Sincerity?

409
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,680
I don't see any sincerity from you.

410
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,080
You're quite shrewd, though.

411
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:27,440
You're overestimating me.

412
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,359
Now I have neither power

413
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,678
nor favor,

414
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:32,600
there's nothing I can help with.

415
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,680
You can go.

416
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,320
You can help.

417
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:38,519
You can request Official Mu to step in.

418
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,519
General Mu holds an influential post,

419
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,600
and no Quliang officials
would dare to defy him.

420
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,040
Are you out of your mind?

421
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,800
We've been arch-enemies for many years.

422
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:48,239
Do you expect me to
plead with my brother for you?

423
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,600
It's not helping me

424
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,440
but helping His Highness.

425
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,879
Young Master Xiu

426
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:57,920
has formed an alliance with
the Fang family.

427
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,958
If we don't stop it,

428
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:02,158
he'll certainly be
His Highness's greatest threat

429
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,879
and biggest hidden danger for Quliang.

430
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,800
So what?

431
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,560
Do you know what it's like
to miss someone?

432
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,479
For so many years,

433
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,840
you have been the apple of his eyes.

434
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,040
Of course, you wouldn't know.

435
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,759
While there are
so many admirers behind him,

436
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,279
there's only one person
that he never looked at.

437
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,840
If His Highness
is no longer His Highness,

438
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:31,159
it might not be a bad thing.

439
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,759
There would be fewer troubles,

440
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:34,999
and no annoying women

441
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,440
to contend with.

442
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:38,800
You weren't like this.

443
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:40,840
You used to

444
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,200
do your utmost to help

445
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,759
His Highness seize the title.

446
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:45,279
You spared no effort

447
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,320
to take me away from Lv Beiyi.

448
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:48,759
You didn't care how many women

449
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,958
were around him.

450
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:50,359
You never...

451
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,558
I never spent 16 years

452
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:52,840
in the secondary courtyard.

453
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,399
16 years.

454
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,759
A small tree
has already grown tall and lush.

455
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,200
Cats and dogs have long passed away.

456
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,119
Why can a human's lifespan be so long?

457
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:07,239
16 years.

458
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,680
His appearance and voice,

459
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,119
every expression and smile,
have all become blurred.

460
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,080
16 years.

461
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:18,080
It's long to the point
where it seems like

462
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:22,920
our previous affection never happened.

463
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:35,600
When I was in the secondary courtyard,

464
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,119
when he wasn't with me,

465
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,479
I would imagine him.

466
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,040
In the cold winter,

467
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,720
he would ask me how I felt.

468
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:48,200
In the quiet, long nights,

469
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:50,519
we'll have long conversations.

470
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,759
I would constantly reassure myself

471
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,159
that he had forgotten me because

472
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:56,560
I wasn't by his side.

473
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,279
But now that I've returned,

474
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:03,119
he hasn't seen me once.

475
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:08,840
It's over.

476
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:12,040
Everything is over.

477
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,320
The one I imagined,

478
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,440
and the one who became the prince,

479
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,879
are both gone.

480
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,639
What does it matter if Young Master Xiu
colludes with the Fang family?

481
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,600
What does it matter if
it becomes a major threat?

482
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:39,560
You can go. Don't come back anymore.

483
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,639
If I have an enemy,

484
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,840
it would be you.

485
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,040
Yao,

486
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,440
do you truly believe

487
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,879
that if I'm not here,

488
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,320
you can have His Highness?

489
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:11,359
His Highness knows
what Princess Consort did,

490
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,720
yet he still dines with her.

491
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:15,999
You are wrong.

492
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:18,519
In the heart of His Highness,

493
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,200
I'm no longer the most important,

494
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:24,680
but Quliang.

495
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,759
(Mansion of Prince An)

496
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,600
Your Highness.

497
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,519
(Qingkang Hall)
Implementing new policies isn't so simple.

498
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,838
Just with Your Highness's order?

499
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:36,399
We are,

500
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,798
after all, officials of Quliang.

501
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:39,320
We are being sidelined

502
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,800
without even a discussion.

503
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:41,999
Your Highness,

504
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,198
with your order,

505
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:44,479
you are formulating the regulations

506
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,960
and fully implementing them.

507
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,759
It's indeed quite hasty, very hasty.

508
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,399
It's not just hasty,

509
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,320
it's risking everything.

510
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,599
We need to see His Highness.

511
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,678
We need to see His Highness.

512
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:56,438
- His Highness.
- We need to see His Highness.

513
00:25:56,439 --> 00:25:57,399
We need to see His Highness.

514
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,298
- His Highness.
- We need to see His Highness.

515
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:03,539
(Qingkang Hall)

516
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:05,560
Consort Lian.

517
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,920
All officials, His Highness is ill.

518
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,840
Ill?

519
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,279
- This... What?
- His Highness is ill?

520
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,239
What illness?

521
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,438
He was perfectly fine yesterday,

522
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:16,078
and today he's ill.

523
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:17,759
It's quite a coincidence.

524
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:19,479
Who says it isn't?

525
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,999
Illness can strike suddenly.

526
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:23,119
Could the illness be very severe?

527
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:25,159
Yes.

528
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:28,600
I'm afraid it will take some time

529
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,680
before he can discuss matters
with all the officials.

530
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:33,720
That's strange.

531
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:35,440
What kind of illness could it be?

532
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:38,719
Consort Lian,

533
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,720
could His Highness pretend to be ill?

534
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:42,879
Your Highness.

535
00:26:42,959 --> 00:26:44,999
Even if the old policy
has its problems

536
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,759
leading to officials' extortion,

537
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,239
strengthening regulation
could have been the solution.

538
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:52,399
An ailment that
can be cured with topical remedy,

539
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:54,798
why resort to drastic measures
like amputation and dismemberment?

540
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:55,519
Your Highness.

541
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,399
Exactly, Your Highness.

542
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,359
Your Highness.

543
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,479
Fools, they are truly fools.

544
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:02,958
Those officials

545
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:05,119
committed suicide in protest
without even being questioned.

546
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,999
It's easy to imagine
how many secrets were hidden.

547
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
It's enough to prove
that the flaws in the old policy

548
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,999
can be exploited.

549
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,119
It's an endless disaster.

550
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,800
They might say

551
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,960
that this is just your speculation.

552
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,158
I've already sent Mu Tianshu

553
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:20,279
for investigation.

554
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,719
Once the truth
behind the suicides comes to light,

555
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,399
we'll be able to silence them.

556
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:28,800
It's a pity

557
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,040
that everyone is dead.

558
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,720
When will we find out?

559
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:35,879
Your Highness.

560
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,639
We just found another official involved.

561
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,399
He didn't commit suicide.
Instead, he fled.

562
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,600
We've just arrested him.

563
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:41,999
Really?

564
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,400
Going to get caught after
flirting with disaster for long.

565
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,040
It took so many years to stir waves.

566
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,560
It's quite an achievement.

567
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:51,519
Madam.

568
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,200
This Official Zheng has your...

569
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:55,198
He's now in His Highness's hands.

570
00:27:55,199 --> 00:27:56,440
It's extremely dangerous.

571
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,320
You need to think of a plan sooner.

572
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,159
Pass this on to Shen Jingyan.

573
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:03,840
Yes.

574
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:04,879
You, slow down.

575
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,558
Slow down.

576
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:06,038
Slow down.

577
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:06,920
Get away.

578
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:07,999
Watch your step.

579
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,399
Don't touch me.

580
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,320
Slow down.

581
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:11,999
Young Master.

582
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,200
I'm not drunk.

583
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:14,279
Let go of me.

584
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,678
Madam, if I may be so bold.

585
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:17,318
Let go of me.

586
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:18,680
You are in trouble now, Madam.

587
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,558
If you were to
tell Young Master everything

588
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,999
and get his help,

589
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,198
you may be able to turn around.

590
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:25,080
Don't mind it.

591
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,879
I'll brave this danger alone.

592
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,680
Don't get him involved anymore.

593
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:31,879
I've owed him for many years.

594
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,800
Let me repay him with a simple,

595
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,119
carefree life.

596
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,720
Still refusing to confess?

597
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,798
We implemented two cruel punishments.

598
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,080
He still won't say a word.

599
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,359
Your Highness.

600
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,080
He's the only survivor we have.

601
00:28:45,199 --> 00:28:46,318
Can't keep the torture.

602
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:48,399
Prepare some good liquor and food.

603
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,479
Tomorrow, I will personally
interrogate him.

604
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,479
Yes.

605
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,680
Hold on.

606
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,519
Send more manpower,
don't let him out of sight.

607
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,040
Yes.

608
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,440
Are you concerned that someone

609
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,960
might try to silence him?

610
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,920
A living person

611
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,200
may eventually speak,

612
00:29:10,439 --> 00:29:12,720
but a dead person is different.

613
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,958
Official Zheng's life

614
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:16,798
is closely monitored.

615
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,040
From today onward,

616
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,639
his food, drinks, and daily routine

617
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,279
must be extremely cautious,

618
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,680
to ensure nothing goes wrong.

619
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,080
Greetings, Your Highness.

620
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,040
Greetings, Princess Consort.

621
00:29:33,199 --> 00:29:34,399
Skip the formalities.

622
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,600
His Highness has been ill for days.

623
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,040
You have been taking care of him.

624
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,719
I made some nourishing soup

625
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,759
for Your Highness.

626
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:46,440
I'm not actually sick.

627
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,840
I just pretended
to be ill for a few days.

628
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:50,599
Since Your Highness is healthy,

629
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,239
even though I prepared the soup in vain,

630
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,479
I'm still happy.

631
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:02,239
I know

632
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,800
you are still angry at me,

633
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,838
and I indeed had many faults

634
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:07,279
in the past.

635
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,639
However, after Erge's execution,

636
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,759
I felt remorseful

637
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,879
and couldn't sleep.

638
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,999
I heard your concern

639
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:21,159
for Official Zheng's safety just now.

640
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,798
I am willing to personally prepare meals

641
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:25,040
and share your burdens.

642
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,599
Meals taken care of by female dependents

643
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,800
are quite secure.

644
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:34,759
You don't need to do it personally.

645
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,838
Consort Lian.

646
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:37,639
Your Highness.

647
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,279
You will be in charge of this matter.

648
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:41,279
Yes.

649
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:49,829
(Langyue Hall)

650
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,479
Why your illness is getting worse?

651
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,560
The medicine prescribed
is not effective at all.

652
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:57,119
The medicine is too bitter.
I don't want to drink it.

653
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,560
You can't just refuse the medicine,
can you?

654
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,759
Good medicine tastes bitter, Yao.

655
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:07,960
I never expected

656
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,239
that after a lifetime of rivalry,

657
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:11,879
you would be

658
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,440
the only one who cares about

659
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,040
whether I live or die.

660
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:21,798
If Official Mu hadn't

661
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:23,479
helped Young Master Yi
find the craftsman,

662
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:25,159
my father would have probably...

663
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,119
Now that you're ill,

664
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,920
of course I have to come and see you.

665
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,560
It's all in the past.
Let's not dwell on it.

666
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,720
Zhiyue.

667
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:45,840
This bamboo shoot soup is indeed tasty

668
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,639
and beneficial
for heart and lung conditions.

669
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:50,359
Come on.

670
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:52,639
Yao, drink it while it's still hot.

671
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,600
I have no appetite.

672
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,239
In the future,

673
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,119
you just deliver meals
to Official Zheng.

674
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:05,558
You don't need to

675
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:07,519
come here every day to bring me soup.

676
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:10,239
You refused the bitter

677
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,639
and lost appetite for the tasty.

678
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,119
Yao,

679
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:16,080
it's like you've given up on life.

680
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,159
Life.

681
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,119
This lifetime

682
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,359
has nothing worth cherishing.

683
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:31,080
Even if there were,

684
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,479
it's a flash in the pan.

685
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,960
What's the weight
of living a few more years?

686
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,320
What difference does it make
to live several more decades?

687
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,519
A flash in the pan.

688
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:47,879
Are you referring to His Highness?

689
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:49,680
The best time of my life

690
00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:52,200
was the first three years

691
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:56,159
at the Young Master's Mansion.

692
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,759
Depending on those three years,

693
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:03,239
I survived in the
secondary courtyard for 16 years.

694
00:33:06,439 --> 00:33:07,879
All the beauty

695
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,359
has faded,

696
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:15,320
so much that
I can't even remember it myself.

697
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:16,999
Faded...

698
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:20,519
Faded so much
that I can't even deceive myself.

699
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,840
Memories may have faded,

700
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:25,040
but new ones can still be created.

701
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,359
If you have leisure
and comfortable days,

702
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,800
you can meet your good friends.

703
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,119
Green vine, bamboo chair,
silk fan, and clear tea.

704
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:37,560
Isn't that the most lovely scene as well?

705
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,840
Consort Lian.

706
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:45,759
If you don't send food
to Official Zheng, it will get cold.

707
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,399
I'll deliver the food to Official Zheng.

708
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,558
When I'm free,

709
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:51,759
I'll come see you.

710
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,119
Hold on.

711
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:06,440
You've already given it to me.

712
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,119
It's not polite to take it back.

713
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,320
In the future,

714
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,640
I will drink the soup you bring,

715
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:25,800
and I will also take

716
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,360
the bitter medicines.

717
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,919
I wouldn't want

718
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,719
to keep coughing incessantly

719
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:34,479
in the scenes you mentioned.

720
00:34:46,729 --> 00:34:50,649
(Shen Jingrong's Younger Sister,
Shen Jingyan)

721
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:57,719
Yan...

722
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,640
Consort Lian.

723
00:35:12,399 --> 00:35:13,039
Miss Yan.

724
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,398
Yan.

725
00:35:13,399 --> 00:35:14,039
Miss Yan.

726
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,559
Miss Yan.

727
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,598
What's wrong? What's wrong?

728
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,719
Yan, wake up!

729
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,959
Wake up!

730
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,479
Zhiyue, go find the physician quickly.

731
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,239
Yes.

732
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,198
What should I do?

733
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:24,080
Miss. Miss.

734
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,719
Why is she so seriously ill?

735
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,479
Just now,

736
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,360
I went for a walk with Miss Yan.

737
00:35:31,399 --> 00:35:33,600
After a while,
she said she wasn't feeling well.

738
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,759
I was planning to come back
and get a physician,

739
00:35:35,879 --> 00:35:36,719
but suddenly,

740
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,600
she became so ill.

741
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,519
What if something

742
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,158
happens to Miss Yan?

743
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:44,079
Don't talk nonsense.

744
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,319
The physician is on the way.

745
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,279
It'll be fine.

746
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:49,198
I'm going to send food.

747
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:50,319
I'll be back shortly.

748
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,120
Please look after things in the meantime.

749
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,198
Just go, don't worry.

750
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:54,360
I'm here.

751
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,320
Sister. Sister.

752
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,358
Sister, don't go.

753
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,279
I'm here.

754
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:01,638
Miss Yan has been missing

755
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:03,279
her sister a lot these days.

756
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,360
She often says

757
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,239
that if she had sister's care,

758
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:09,199
she wouldn't feel so lonely
in the future.

759
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,959
Sister, don't go.

760
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,320
Ranyun.

761
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,800
Yes, I'm here.

762
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,120
You do this alone.

763
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,079
Remember,

764
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,719
do not entrust it to anyone.

765
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,439
Yes.

766
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,400
Madam.

767
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:38,279
Ranyun.

768
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,719
Greetings, Princess Consort.

769
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:45,918
Is this food

770
00:36:45,919 --> 00:36:47,239
for Official Zheng?

771
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,279
Princess Consort,

772
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,040
it's food for Official Zheng.

773
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,079
Why is it just you alone?

774
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,120
Where's Consort Lian?

775
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:54,679
Earlier,

776
00:36:54,919 --> 00:36:56,198
Miss Yan fainted.

777
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:57,198
Then Consort Lian

778
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:58,439
went to take care of her.

779
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,398
Consort Lian is too preoccupied
with sisterly love.

780
00:37:01,399 --> 00:37:02,880
She's really being careless.

781
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:03,839
How could she entrust

782
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,519
such an important task to a servant?

783
00:37:05,919 --> 00:37:06,800
Zuiliu.

784
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:08,439
Bring that box of food.

785
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,598
I'll deliver it myself.

786
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:10,360
Yes.

787
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,080
What's wrong?

788
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,040
Are you unwilling?

789
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,799
It's good that I met Princess Consort.

790
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,759
I suddenly remembered

791
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,918
that I had forgotten the soup.

792
00:37:26,919 --> 00:37:28,160
I'll go and get it now.

793
00:37:35,399 --> 00:37:36,320
How is it?

794
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,439
Miss Yan's illness

795
00:37:44,919 --> 00:37:46,120
is very strange.

796
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:48,679
It's urgent and chaotic,
conflicting with each other.

797
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,719
Why is this?

798
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,840
Let's take a prescription
and see if it helps.

799
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:52,959
It's hard to be sure.

800
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:00,519
Consort Lian.

801
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,079
I met Princess Consort earlier.

802
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,079
She said that a crucial matter

803
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,678
should not be

804
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:04,678
entrusted to a servant.

805
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:05,839
She wanted to send it.

806
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,719
I thought about it

807
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,679
and told a little lie to come back here.

808
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,160
What should we do next?

809
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,840
If that's the case,

810
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,319
I'll go deliver the food.

811
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,120
You stay here to take care of her.

812
00:38:26,439 --> 00:38:27,600
You're still unwell,

813
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:28,679
and you shouldn't overwork.

814
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:30,999
Just delivering a meal.

815
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,160
It won't cost me my life.

816
00:38:32,399 --> 00:38:33,679
Ruhua, let's go.

817
00:38:41,879 --> 00:38:42,640
Madam.

818
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:44,160
- Hurry, brew the medicine.
- Yes.

819
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,598
Zhiyue, get some hot water.

820
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:48,279
Yes.

821
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:15,320
Why are you here?

822
00:39:15,879 --> 00:39:16,719
Your Highness.

823
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,160
I come to send some food.

824
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,958
Why are you sending the food?

825
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,880
Where is Lian'er?
What happened to Lian'er?

826
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,400
Don't worry, Your Highness.

827
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,640
Consort Lian is fine.

828
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:38,719
It's just that...

829
00:39:40,919 --> 00:39:43,040
Miss Yan fainted just now,

830
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,079
and Consort Lian
went to take care of her,

831
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,199
so it got delayed.

832
00:39:49,879 --> 00:39:50,800
You've worked hard.

833
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,719
You're not feeling well.

834
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:56,479
Get plenty of rest.

835
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:58,759
Thank you, Your Highness. It's not hard.

836
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,640
I'm taking my leave.

837
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:13,400
Madam, are you alright?

838
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:30,960
- Official Zheng.
- Your Highness.

839
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,840
Your appetite is good.

840
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,398
Committing the same crime,

841
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:35,918
other officials jumped into the well

842
00:40:35,919 --> 00:40:37,079
and hung themselves,

843
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,479
but Official Zheng chose to escape.

844
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,840
So confident like this,

845
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:44,120
could it be that you have
some protective amulet?

846
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:50,479
It's not right.

847
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,519
If you have a protective amulet,

848
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:54,160
why wouldn't you confess?

849
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,519
Official Zheng.

850
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,880
Sit, sit, sit.

851
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,640
Thank you, Your Highness.

852
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,919
Official Zheng.

853
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,160
I've known you for many years,

854
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,880
and I understand you.

855
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:10,198
You're not usually

856
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:11,439
a steadfast person.

857
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:15,239
This time, you even endured
the cruel punishment.

858
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,598
What is it

859
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,160
that makes you so afraid?

860
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,640
Your family?

861
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,320
I guessed it right.

862
00:41:29,439 --> 00:41:30,400
It's your family.

863
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,439
So many people would rather die

864
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,439
than come to see me.

865
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:36,878
I suppose

866
00:41:36,879 --> 00:41:37,999
they know that the one behind

867
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,120
is ruthless and won't spare their families.
