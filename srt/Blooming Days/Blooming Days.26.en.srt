=Episode 26=

17
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,680
Your servant, Li Tang.

18
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:52,551
Greetings, Madam.

19
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:54,871
Whose servant are you?

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,751
He's not really a servant.

21
00:01:57,431 --> 00:01:58,600
(Once you go to Jingshu Pavillion,)

22
00:01:59,390 --> 00:01:59,950
everyone might

23
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,151
misunderstand you.

24
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:02,511
They might say

25
00:02:03,231 --> 00:02:04,191
you are seeking personal gain

26
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,440
by being disloyal to your master.

27
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,431
Do you

28
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,071
really want to do that?

29
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,151
As long as I can find the truth
for Madam and the late junior young master,

30
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:16,391
I'm willing to do anything.

31
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:21,791
Everything he's done

32
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,270
has made him my brother

33
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,791
and my family.

34
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,110
That's good.

35
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,550
You're back.

36
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,311
I'm sorry for causing you to worry.

37
00:02:41,031 --> 00:02:41,990
It's my fault

38
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,511
for making you suffer so much.

39
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,431
Come on.

40
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,560
Let's go inside first.

41
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,710
I thought...

42
00:02:52,431 --> 00:02:53,630
We had misunderstood you.

43
00:02:53,951 --> 00:02:55,110
You endured the scolding

44
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,149
and defended our master loyally.

45
00:02:56,431 --> 00:02:57,710
We just...

46
00:02:58,591 --> 00:02:59,560
Li Tang, you've done well.

47
00:03:00,031 --> 00:03:01,311
I always knew you were fiercely loyal

48
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,990
and would never betray Ms. Lian.

49
00:03:06,231 --> 00:03:06,671
Really?

50
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,480
Who held a broom
and kept hitting me earlier on?

51
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:12,470
Who was it?

52
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,031
Who?

53
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,871
It wasn't me.

54
00:03:26,431 --> 00:03:27,110
Later,

55
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:28,830
I'll report to Young Master

56
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,431
and officially request

57
00:03:32,071 --> 00:03:32,791
to bring Li Tang back.

58
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:37,550
After that, we can finally

59
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,311
be a family again.

60
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,391
I've been waiting eagerly

61
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,391
for this day.

62
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:46,720
For this occasion,

63
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:50,750
I've prepared
a special gift for you, Madam.

64
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,871
I'll close the door.

65
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:03,671
After arriving at Jingshu Pavillion,

66
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:05,671
even though Nan Ruzhen
treated me as a confidant,

67
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:07,710
she occasionally

68
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,871
had private discussions with Qimei.

69
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:24,630
Madam, you've been observing for a while.

70
00:04:24,711 --> 00:04:25,991
It's just a flask.

71
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:27,111
There's nothing else.

72
00:04:33,711 --> 00:04:34,551
Madam, look.

73
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:40,551
This is it, Madam.

74
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,080
(One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine)

75
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:46,271
This doesn't look like Quliang

76
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:47,711
nor any village.

77
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:50,430
Where is this place exactly?

78
00:04:51,231 --> 00:04:52,831
Did you say this was

79
00:04:52,831 --> 00:04:54,260
what Young Master Xiu
cared about the most?

80
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:55,071
Yes.

81
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:56,750
That's what I heard.

82
00:04:58,671 --> 00:04:59,551
Whatever it is,

83
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,711
it must be Forth Madam's weak spot.

84
00:05:08,271 --> 00:05:10,590
Is there anything peculiar about this map?

85
00:05:16,231 --> 00:05:16,831
Madam.

86
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:19,350
What brought you two here?

87
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,750
We've just received news

88
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,350
that Nan Ruzhen is dead.

89
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:27,825
(Lianwei House)

90
00:05:28,071 --> 00:05:29,071
The most tragic fate

91
00:05:30,111 --> 00:05:31,350
is to gain everything

92
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,551
and losing it all.

93
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,680
She was elevated
to the highest point by fate,

94
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,150
only to be thrown down

95
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,231
without respite.

96
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,671
This kind of blow

97
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:41,310
is undoubtedly

98
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:43,870
the most severe punishment
for Nan Ruzhen.

99
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,630
She's evil

100
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,791
and this is the retribution
she deserved.

101
00:05:54,111 --> 00:05:54,750
Lian'er.

102
00:05:59,231 --> 00:05:59,870
Yes,

103
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,870
she got what she deserved.

104
00:06:03,551 --> 00:06:04,440
What's wrong with you?

105
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,111
You seem

106
00:06:06,671 --> 00:06:07,791
unhappy.

107
00:06:10,711 --> 00:06:11,470
I don't know either.

108
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:14,951
It's been four years.

109
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:18,791
Ever since my child died,

110
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,030
I lived my life

111
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,750
for this day.

112
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:24,750
Right now,

113
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:27,030
I've finally achieved what I wanted,

114
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,630
but

115
00:06:30,271 --> 00:06:31,511
I just don't feel

116
00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:32,391
as happy as I imagined.

117
00:06:36,071 --> 00:06:37,271
Even if Nan Ruzhen

118
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,350
were to suffer a thousandfold

119
00:06:41,071 --> 00:06:41,920
or ten thousandfold,

120
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:43,150
it wouldn't

121
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,310
bring my child back.

122
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,350
(Nan Ruzhen's death)

123
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:49,831
(didn't take away the wealth and glory)

124
00:06:49,831 --> 00:06:50,750
(she once enjoyed.)

125
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,511
(Nor did it erase)

126
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:53,760
(the harsh realities of life.)

127
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,590
(Luo Qinglian isn't happy.)

128
00:06:57,511 --> 00:06:58,560
(It's like gaining something)

129
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,791
(but also losing something.)

130
00:07:00,551 --> 00:07:01,870
(On the table lies a map)

131
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,350
(that had been taken and fought for.)

132
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,231
(It's a symbol of countless sins,)

133
00:07:05,831 --> 00:07:07,750
(silently siphoning off
Quliang's resources,)

134
00:07:08,111 --> 00:07:09,590
(people's livelihood,)

135
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,951
(the efforts of He Yunshuo)

136
00:07:11,951 --> 00:07:13,111
(and many good officials)

137
00:07:13,111 --> 00:07:14,430
(governing Quliang,)

138
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,951
(all to satisfy its owner's)

139
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,711
(ambitious desires.)

140
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:21,350
Greetings, Young Master.

141
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,910
Has Lian gone to bed?

142
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,470
She is not at Lianwei House.

143
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,150
Did she go to Qiege Hall to look for me?

144
00:07:29,071 --> 00:07:30,910
However, I didn't see her on the way.

145
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,870
She isn't looking for you either.

146
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,350
Where is she?

147
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:16,231
Why are you here alone?

148
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,511
It's so cold.

149
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,310
Why don't you get some rest?

150
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:26,750
What are you doing here?

151
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,150
Today, I heard something

152
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:34,310
that reminded me of many past events.

153
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,391
Nan Ruzhen is dead.

154
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,471
Qinglian,

155
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,790
she treated you so badly,

156
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,480
yet you're still sad about her.

157
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,990
If she had even a fraction
of your kindness,

158
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,670
she wouldn't have ended up like this.

159
00:09:06,471 --> 00:09:08,031
You've praised my kindness

160
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,591
on more than one occasion.

161
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,230
I haven't grown tired of it yet,

162
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,230
but it seems you have.

163
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:20,550
I understand.

164
00:09:21,351 --> 00:09:23,310
I'll have to come up

165
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:25,310
with something new

166
00:09:25,911 --> 00:09:27,031
to praise you.

167
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:33,310
If you

168
00:09:34,271 --> 00:09:35,471
ever find out

169
00:09:36,591 --> 00:09:37,430
that I could be

170
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,511
as ruthless as Nan Ruzhen,

171
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:42,911
would you hate me?

172
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,831
As ruthless as her?

173
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:49,990
All right.

174
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,310
It seems I should

175
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,870
put a few scorpions

176
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,831
on your bed tomorrow.

177
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,391
I'll let them

178
00:09:56,911 --> 00:09:57,750
sting you a bit.

179
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:58,870
An eye for an eye.

180
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,670
We'll see if you're afraid.

181
00:10:03,831 --> 00:10:04,430
Afraid?

182
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,471
I haven't known fear

183
00:10:09,471 --> 00:10:10,790
for a long time.

184
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,230
The only thing that might make me afraid

185
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:18,230
are the words I'm about to say.

186
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,990
What's the matter with you today?

187
00:10:21,471 --> 00:10:23,151
You keep saying things
that don't make sense.

188
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,071
My actions

189
00:10:36,071 --> 00:10:37,110
are unforgivable.

190
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,790
Please punish me.

191
00:10:42,031 --> 00:10:42,790
What is the crime?

192
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,911
Deception,

193
00:10:51,711 --> 00:10:52,711
manipulation, incitement

194
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:56,480
and using others as tools
to commit murder.

195
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,031
So, Li Tang's betrayal

196
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,670
was something you orchestrated

197
00:11:25,031 --> 00:11:25,750
to provide

198
00:11:26,391 --> 00:11:27,351
irrefutable evidence

199
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:30,031
for exposure
of Nan Ruzhen's true nature?

200
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:32,750
Yes.

201
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,391
All right.

202
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:38,591
So,

203
00:11:40,391 --> 00:11:41,471
she's connected to Lianxiu?

204
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,750
When you fell into the water,

205
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,310
she intentionally framed you.

206
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,630
Was everything you'd done since then
carefully calculated

207
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,750
just to uncover the truth?

208
00:11:53,391 --> 00:11:53,951
Yes.

209
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,391
All right.

210
00:12:00,151 --> 00:12:02,020
So, the act of pretending
to be insane in the courtyard

211
00:12:03,351 --> 00:12:04,351
was just an act

212
00:12:07,591 --> 00:12:09,391
to make me feel guilty

213
00:12:09,391 --> 00:12:10,310
and bring you back?

214
00:12:19,951 --> 00:12:20,591
Yes.

215
00:12:24,271 --> 00:12:24,790
Good!

216
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,271
Very well.

217
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,990
Very well.

218
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,391
What about me?

219
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,151
When I was anxiously

220
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:37,951
running around,

221
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:40,990
did you find it

222
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:45,031
laughable

223
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,750
that I could be tricked like a fool?

224
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,271
Didn't you?

225
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:54,151
No, I didn't.

226
00:12:54,151 --> 00:12:54,990
What is it then?

227
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,430
Even if you had the slightest bit

228
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,550
of affection for me,

229
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,310
how could you trample

230
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:13,511
on my sincere feelings

231
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:14,951
and manipulate it?

232
00:13:15,951 --> 00:13:16,711
Don't cry!

233
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,911
Tears are useless to me.

234
00:13:19,271 --> 00:13:19,790
Tell me!

235
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,351
A small compromise

236
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,230
can lead to major disasters.

237
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,911
A good example indeed.

238
00:13:34,951 --> 00:13:36,151
Lianyi said

239
00:13:37,711 --> 00:13:39,031
you were like a female Zhuge Liang.

240
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,031
He was right,

241
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,750
but I never expected

242
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,031
the person who couldn't see through you

243
00:13:49,711 --> 00:13:50,870
would be me.

244
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:52,831
Lianxin.

245
00:13:54,471 --> 00:13:56,750
You'd indeed misjudged me.

246
00:14:03,951 --> 00:14:04,750

329
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,831
besides

330
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:11,910
discussing state affairs.

331
00:20:15,951 --> 00:20:17,071
What do you want to do?

332
00:20:18,871 --> 00:20:19,860
I'm seeking medical treatment.

What's your discomfort?

334
00:20:25,111 --> 00:20:26,790
Don't you need to sit down

335
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,910
and check my pulse?

336
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:28,591
Please sit down.

337
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,080

338
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:41,991

339
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:45,071
First,

340
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:47,670
my eyes have gone blind.

341
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,071
I can't see

342
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:51,390
the dearest person beside me clearly.

343
00:20:51,711 --> 00:20:52,510
Next,

344
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:54,430
my ears are deaf.

345
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,510
I don't know whether

346
00:20:55,951 --> 00:20:57,111
to believe what I heard.

347
00:20:57,751 --> 00:20:58,351
Anything else?

348
00:20:58,951 --> 00:20:59,670
There is

349
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,430
also my tongue.

350
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:05,790
I have tens of thousands
of words to ask and say,

351
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,190
but I can't get a single one out.

352
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,150
Nothing comes out clearly.

353
00:21:11,631 --> 00:21:13,631
It seems you're not here
for a medical check-up.

354
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:15,991
You're here for a remedy.

355
00:21:19,751 --> 00:21:20,631
If you discover

356
00:21:22,111 --> 00:21:23,951
that the person you love
has been lying to you,

357
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:24,951
even though

358
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,550
she's honest with you,

359
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,111
can you believe

360
00:21:28,111 --> 00:21:29,471
her sincerity again?

361
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:32,510
Is there a cure

362
00:21:33,231 --> 00:21:34,231
for this kind of ailment?

363
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:42,951
All right.

364
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,910
When I was learning
medicine from my father,

365
00:21:46,591 --> 00:21:47,510
I often made mistakes.

366
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:48,831
Once, my father

367
00:21:48,831 --> 00:21:49,670
couldn't take it anymore

368
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,111
and made me kneel in front of the door
for three days and nights,

369
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:53,871
not allowing me to eat.

370
00:21:55,351 --> 00:21:56,150
It was

371
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,000
thanks to Lian'er during those times.

372
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:00,670
Every day,

373
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:01,351
Lian'er would

374
00:22:01,351 --> 00:22:02,591
sneakily bring food from her house

375
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:03,310
to feed me.

376
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,510
Later, I noticed

377
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,360
that she had injuries on her.

378
00:22:07,711 --> 00:22:08,600
I asked her about it

379
00:22:09,951 --> 00:22:10,591
and she said

380
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,770
her mother wouldn't allow her
to bring food to me.

381
00:22:14,351 --> 00:22:15,790
So, every time she came out,

382
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,460
her mother would chase her
and give her a beating.

383
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:19,910
I know she'd been good to you.

384
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,310
Is there a need to flaunt it like this?

385
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,951
I looked at the wounds on her

386
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,310
and my heart ached deeply.

387
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,631
I told her,

388
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,631
"Why don't you

389
00:22:28,631 --> 00:22:29,430
just make excuses?

390
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,310
Why go through

391
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,071
such suffering for me?"

392
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:32,831
However, she said...

393
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,270
I must be crazy

394
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,150
to come here to listen

395
00:22:37,951 --> 00:22:40,430
to my love rival's taunts.

396
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,711
She said she didn't like lying

397
00:22:50,591 --> 00:22:51,871
and she hardly ever told lies

398
00:22:52,631 --> 00:22:54,190
because she dared to do
what she needed to do

399
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,440
and wasn't afraid of the consequences.

400
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:57,150
She's lied to you.

401
00:22:58,471 --> 00:22:59,390
Do you know why?

402
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,910
It's because she's afraid.

403
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,150
She's afraid of losing you.

404
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:10,310
In your mansion,

405
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,631
she constantly reminds
herself to change.

406
00:23:13,951 --> 00:23:14,790
If she were still the same

407
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,790
innocent Luo Qinglian,

408
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,150
she probably wouldn't have survived.

409
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,711
Even so,

410
00:23:20,471 --> 00:23:22,790
she has to worry about
how to hide it from you

411
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,430
and not to make you hate her,

412
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,071
the person

413
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:26,951
hated by even herself.

414
00:23:27,591 --> 00:23:28,231
Doesn't this

415
00:23:28,231 --> 00:23:29,071
prove her sincerity?

416
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,711
Lies are usually exposed by others,

417
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,550
but she confessed to you.

418
00:23:34,231 --> 00:23:34,951
She longs for you

419
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,591
to love the real her.

420
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,270
She can't even tolerate

421
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,071
her beautified self.

422
00:23:42,071 --> 00:23:43,550
Can't this prove her sincerity?

423
00:23:56,951 --> 00:23:57,790
Indeed,

424
00:23:59,111 --> 00:24:00,030
good medicine is bitter.

425
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,390
This prescription of yours
is truly right on spot.

426
00:24:05,471 --> 00:24:06,510
It hits the bullseye.

427
00:24:06,871 --> 00:24:07,351
No,

428
00:24:08,471 --> 00:24:09,910
your illness hasn't been cured.

429
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,430
Your illness is a guilty conscience.

430
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,150
I don't have a remedy for that.

431
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:14,871
What are you doing?

432
00:24:15,231 --> 00:24:16,071
- You...
- Please go back.

433
00:24:16,071 --> 00:24:17,520
- You're so rude.
- Please go back.

434
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,951
Why are you dismissing a patient?

435
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,831
Your heart had already softened.

436
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:23,951
All you wanted

437
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:25,790
was a good scolding from me.

438
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,111
Lv Beiyi,

439
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:33,991
why don't you

440
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:36,351
leave Lianxiu and come back to help me?

441
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:37,231
You should go back!

442
00:24:43,711 --> 00:24:46,831
Lv Beiyi.

443
00:25:10,591 --> 00:25:11,310
Ms. Lian,

444
00:25:12,071 --> 00:25:13,751
you haven't eaten anything all day.

445
00:25:14,351 --> 00:25:15,310
Please have a little.

446
00:25:16,111 --> 00:25:16,631
I won't eat.

447
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:17,711
You can eat later.

448
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:19,631
Madam.

449
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,910
Madam, Su Nanchun is here.

450
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:22,991
Young Master

451
00:25:23,111 --> 00:25:24,390
wants you to go somewhere with him.

452
00:26:09,631 --> 00:26:10,631
What is all this?

453
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,030
Do you know

454
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,871
who this lantern represents?

455
00:26:23,871 --> 00:26:26,150
Isn't a lotus lantern lit
to mourn the deceased?

456
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,711
Did anyone you know pass away?

457
00:26:30,231 --> 00:26:30,831
It's me.

458
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:40,550
Do you know

459
00:26:41,631 --> 00:26:42,711
who this one represents?

460
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,310
Is it...

461
00:26:50,951 --> 00:26:51,670
Me?

462
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:53,951
That's right.

463
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,420
It's you, who pretended
to be crazy in the southern courtyard.

464
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:02,471
That one is you,

465
00:27:03,351 --> 00:27:04,711
the one who was so calculating.

466
00:27:07,871 --> 00:27:08,591
This one is me,

467
00:27:08,951 --> 00:27:11,320
who watched you entering father's mansion
to be chosen as a concubine.

468
00:27:13,871 --> 00:27:14,631
This one is you,

469
00:27:16,991 --> 00:27:18,430

I

538
00:31:36,591 --> 00:31:37,550
have one more request.

539
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,200
I don't know if you will agree to it.

540
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,351
Is it about Li Tang?

541
00:31:43,831 --> 00:31:45,310
You've already thought of it.

542
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,711
Since Li Tang returned
to Lianwei House,

543
00:31:49,231 --> 00:31:51,190
the people in the mansion
don't know the truth.

544
00:31:51,471 --> 00:31:52,440
They have been ostracizing him

545
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,751
and calling him
the second Xu Liangchuan.

546
00:31:56,111 --> 00:31:57,071
I think

547
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:59,150
that instead of trying
to silence the rumours,

548
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,190
why not have Li Tang

549
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,430
leave this place of strifes?

550
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,871
Li Tang is both brave and astute.

551
00:32:05,871 --> 00:32:07,631
He has the rare ability
to read and write.

552
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,150
Fortunately,

553
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,910
there's a vacancy in Quyin County.

554
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,670
If you're willing to part with him,

555
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:13,751
I can ask father

556
00:32:13,951 --> 00:32:15,400
to let him accompany me
and leave Quliang.

557
00:32:16,111 --> 00:32:17,430
You're leaving Quliang?

558
00:32:18,991 --> 00:32:20,871
Is it for other official duties?

559
00:32:21,591 --> 00:32:22,751
You might have heard about it.

560
00:32:22,951 --> 00:32:23,831
It's the recent

561
00:32:23,831 --> 00:32:25,510
sensational death-penalty case.

562
00:32:27,711 --> 00:32:29,080
I have heard some people
talking about it.

563
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:30,831
It's said

564
00:32:32,071 --> 00:32:33,111
that some death-row inmates

565
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,591
are paying hefty sums

566
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,591
to make commoners stand
in for their punishment.

567
00:32:36,951 --> 00:32:37,670
Yes,

568
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,510
rich people are willing
to spend any amount

569
00:32:40,071 --> 00:32:41,510
to save their lives.

570
00:32:42,471 --> 00:32:43,431
What's strange is

571
00:32:43,431 --> 00:32:45,711
that the prison of the Trial Department
has been penetrated by someone

572
00:32:45,711 --> 00:32:46,631
and all levels of officials

573
00:32:46,751 --> 00:32:48,111
can't find the mastermind.

574
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,231
Today,

575
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,071
my father was furious

576
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,351
as he heard

577
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,520
that the illicit money had all been
transferred to Huanzhou.

578
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:55,960
So he assigned me to investigate it.

579
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:56,910
Huanzhou?

580
00:32:58,111 --> 00:32:58,711
It's so far.

581
00:32:59,951 --> 00:33:01,471
People are colluding there.

582
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:02,910
The person behind this

583
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,231
must be formidable.

584
00:33:04,231 --> 00:33:07,014
(Lianwei House)

585
00:33:08,584 --> 00:33:10,720
(One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine)

586
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,320
(One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine)

587
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,560
Young Master and Madam, please wait.

588
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:39,310
Madam,

589
00:34:39,591 --> 00:34:40,431
I don't know

590
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,831
when I'll see you again after this trip.

591
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:44,831
Madam, you've been so kind to me,

592
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,510
but I can't even serve by your side.

593
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,871
I feel so bad about it.

594
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,591
The position Young Master has given you
is the envy of all.

595
00:34:55,431 --> 00:34:56,510
You must seize it

596
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:57,631
and make something of it.

597
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,790
That would be the best way

598
00:35:00,191 --> 00:35:01,360
to repay me and Young Master.

599
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:08,510
The weather in Huanzhou...

600
00:35:10,831 --> 00:35:11,351
Li Tang,

601
00:35:11,831 --> 00:35:13,391
the weather in Huanzhou
is particularly damp

602
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,631
and you have old wounds.

603
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:15,871
You must take care

604
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,270
and avoid catching a cold.

605
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,230
Yes, Madam.

606
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:20,990
As you remember,

607
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,191
this clothes of mine were your...

608
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:25,270
Clothes.

609
00:35:25,631 --> 00:35:27,151
Zhiyue has prepared
some clothes for you.

610
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:28,470
Remember to wear them.

611
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:29,871
In winter,

612
00:35:29,871 --> 00:35:31,950
we will prepare
some cotton clothes for you.

613
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:33,431
Yes.

614
00:35:37,871 --> 00:35:38,631
Young Master and Madam,

615
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:42,230
this time,

616
00:35:42,591 --> 00:35:43,831
I'll surely achieve success

617
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:45,230
and

618
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:48,040
repay you and Young Master
for giving me a new lease of life.

619
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:57,351
Go on.

620
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,750
After all these words you said to him,

621
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,351
don't you have any words for me?

622
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,510
On this journey,

623
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,510
you'll be busy with official matters

624
00:36:33,871 --> 00:36:34,911
all the time.

625
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,151
So don't get distracted.

626
00:36:38,591 --> 00:36:39,710
When I'm home,

627
00:36:40,911 --> 00:36:42,191
I won't miss you.

628
00:36:48,351 --> 00:36:49,071
Why are you laughing?

629
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,310
What's so funny?

630
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,030
All right.

631
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:54,230
All right.

632
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,310
I've got it.

633
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,030
I've got it.

634
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,071
I'll go then.

635
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,071
Young Master.

636
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,750
You're still laughing?

637
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:13,391
Remember, as you said,

638
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,871
don't miss me.

639
00:37:14,871 --> 00:37:15,750
I remember that.

640
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,310
See you, sister-in-law.

641
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,071
Let's go.

642
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:36,111
Ms. Lian, you said you wouldn't miss him.

643
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,631
Why was he so happy?

644
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,351
Did he figure out something?

645
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:41,071
I told him

646
00:37:41,071 --> 00:37:43,071
not to be distracted

647
00:37:43,071 --> 00:37:44,030
because I knew

648
00:37:44,351 --> 00:37:46,030
he'd think of me all the time.

649
00:37:46,671 --> 00:37:47,470
I told him

650
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,710
I wouldn't miss him

651
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:50,750
because I knew

652
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,591
he'd return to me swiftly.

653
00:37:53,431 --> 00:37:54,151
This...

654
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:55,750
this is sweet talk.

655
00:37:58,391 --> 00:37:58,911
Ms. Lian!

656
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,151
Young Master!

657
00:38:37,871 --> 00:38:39,270
Madam Lian...

658
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,071
What happened to her?

659
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:44,671
Did you kidnap Luo Qinglian?

660
00:38:45,431 --> 00:38:46,270
Calm down, Young Master.

661
00:38:46,431 --> 00:38:47,710
We searched
Lianwei House thoroughly,

662
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:48,470
but didn't find it.

663
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:50,191
She must be hiding it somewhere.

664
00:38:51,151 --> 00:38:52,230
It's just a woman.

665
00:38:52,591 --> 00:38:53,671
If we capture and scare her,

666
00:38:54,151 --> 00:38:55,270
she'll tell us everything.

667
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,431
What did she say?

668
00:38:59,071 --> 00:39:00,030
This...

669
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,071
You're foolish! So foolish!

670
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,671
Who is Luo Qinglian?

671
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,240
What makes you think you can scare her?

672
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,351
She must have taken you for a ride.

673
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:13,871
Madam.

674
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,111
Dear, what brings you here?

675
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,671
Did you capture Luo Qinglian?

676
00:39:19,671 --> 00:39:21,151
I just asked him to steal the map.

677
00:39:21,831 --> 00:39:22,990
Lianxiu, you're foolish.

678
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,351
I would find a solution for the map issue.

679
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,071
Why are you so impatient?

680
00:39:27,071 --> 00:39:28,030
Why did you take risk?

681
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,950
How could I be patient?

682
00:39:30,671 --> 00:39:32,310
Father has already sent
Lianxin to Huanzhou.

683
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,191
You're aware of Lianxin's power.

684
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:35,671
When Lv Beiyi

685
00:39:35,671 --> 00:39:37,230
briefly led Investigations Division,

686
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,911
he helped us to succeed in Huanzhou.

687
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:40,470
With Lianxin personally going,

688
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:41,631
it won't be long

689
00:39:41,631 --> 00:39:43,270
before Huanzhou is turned upside down.

690
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:44,230
If Luo Qinglian

691
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,111
hands the map to him,

692
00:39:46,671 --> 00:39:48,750
it will be a matter of life
and death for us, dear.

693
00:39:49,111 --> 00:39:50,230
Who is Luo Qinglian?

694
00:39:50,911 --> 00:39:51,750
If she's captured,

695
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,391
Lianxin will spare no effort
to rescue her.

696
00:39:53,871 --> 00:39:55,030
If we get caught,

697
00:39:55,191 --> 00:39:56,671
won't it be a matter of life and death?

698
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:01,911
What can we do now, dear?

699
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,030
What else?

700
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:06,831
This person is the biggest
threat to the both of us.

701
00:40:08,871 --> 00:40:09,671
Kill her immediately

702
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,050
to prevent further complications.

703
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,030
Yes.

704
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:24,270
I only hope that Lianxin

705
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,230
won't discover the map.

706
00:40:26,111 --> 00:40:26,990
Then,

707
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:28,671
everything shall pass.

708
00:40:30,071 --> 00:40:31,790
I hope for that, too,

709
00:40:33,671 --> 00:40:34,990
but things

710
00:40:36,111 --> 00:40:37,391
don't often go as planned.

711
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,111
For the sake of this map,

712
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,990
I sacrificed my own sister

713
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,831
and sent away Nan Ruzhen
who had been planted for many years,

714
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,710
but in the end, I still can't escape.

715
00:40:57,191 --> 00:40:59,071
Since the situation is beyond repair,

716
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,270
there are only two paths

717
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,111
for me and Lianxin.

718
00:41:05,871 --> 00:41:06,831
Either he dies

719
00:41:08,071 --> 00:41:09,111
or I do.

720
00:41:09,431 --> 00:41:10,600
Young Master Xiu, you're mistaken.

721
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,310
There is a third path.

722
00:41:15,191 --> 00:41:15,671
Serve tea.

723
00:41:17,591 --> 00:41:18,470
Use another's hand to kill

724
00:41:20,071 --> 00:41:20,990
and fight to the death.

725
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,030
No.

726
00:41:26,071 --> 00:41:27,470
The armoury is my lifeline,

727
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,030
my last hope.

728
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:30,871
I cannot let it slip from my grasp.

729
00:41:31,351 --> 00:41:33,990
Mr. Lv, your foresight is convincing.

730
00:41:36,831 --> 00:41:38,431
A hero must make a difficult choice.

731
00:41:39,911 --> 00:41:40,950
The situation is beyond repair.

732
00:41:42,431 --> 00:41:43,750
Rather than suffering a complete loss,

733
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,720
it's better to make your enemy
suffer with you.
