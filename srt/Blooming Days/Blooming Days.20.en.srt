00:01:49,757 --> 00:01:50,237
We…

18
00:01:52,197 --> 00:01:53,517
Is Su Nanchun also a bird?

19
00:01:57,957 --> 00:01:58,877
Hurry and come up.

20
00:01:59,157 --> 00:01:59,717
We can…

21
00:01:59,797 --> 00:02:00,997
We can live together on the rooftop.

22
00:02:02,277 --> 00:02:03,757
Only low-ranking birds

23
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:04,797
live on rooftops.

24
00:02:04,797 --> 00:02:05,677
We are high-ranking birds.

25
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,837
So we don't live on rooftops.

26
00:02:06,837 --> 00:02:07,757
We live in houses.

27
00:02:08,477 --> 00:02:09,317
How do you prove…

28
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:11,437
How do you prove that you're a bird?

29
00:02:14,077 --> 00:02:15,797
How does one prove that?

30
00:02:18,517 --> 00:02:19,077
Fly.

31
00:02:20,197 --> 00:02:21,277
How to fly?

32
00:02:23,837 --> 00:02:24,357
Just…

33
00:02:25,157 --> 00:02:27,197
From here, fly!

34
00:02:30,037 --> 00:02:30,637
I…

35
00:02:32,837 --> 00:02:34,837
Su Nanchun, you can't fly.

36
00:02:34,997 --> 00:02:35,837
You're a liar.

37
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:37,357
I can.

38
00:02:37,797 --> 00:02:39,037
I can fly.

39
00:02:39,677 --> 00:02:41,077
Then come up quickly.

40
00:02:42,157 --> 00:02:42,757
Hurry up.

41
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:44,570
Let's fly together.

42
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:51,597
I'm General Zhaode after all.

43
00:02:51,877 --> 00:02:52,437
Hurry up!

44
00:02:52,437 --> 00:02:53,870
However, play crazy games
with this girl.

45
00:03:06,237 --> 00:03:07,077
(Who cares)

46
00:03:07,077 --> 00:03:08,077
(if I am able to)

47
00:03:08,717 --> 00:03:10,197
(see you smiling so happily.)

48
00:03:10,837 --> 00:03:11,357
Fly.

49
00:03:12,277 --> 00:03:13,117
Let's fly together.

50
00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:18,597
Su Nanchun, hurry up.

51
00:03:18,957 --> 00:03:19,517
I'm coming.

52
00:03:19,917 --> 00:03:20,277
Come on.

53
00:03:26,397 --> 00:03:26,997
Sit here.

54
00:03:32,997 --> 00:03:33,597
See?

55
00:03:34,277 --> 00:03:35,877
How great is it to be a bird?

56
00:03:36,157 --> 00:03:38,237
You can enjoy the beautiful scenery
in the sky.

57
00:03:39,277 --> 00:03:40,077
Su Nanchun, look.

58
00:03:45,717 --> 00:03:47,197
So beautiful.

59
00:03:54,197 --> 00:03:54,597
Oh no.

60
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,397
I heard that Young Master
has a fear of heights.

61
00:04:00,357 --> 00:04:00,837
Don't move.

62
00:04:02,237 --> 00:04:02,997
Let me help you down.

63
00:04:06,597 --> 00:04:07,037
Be careful!

64
00:04:13,397 --> 00:04:14,117
Young Master!

65
00:04:35,077 --> 00:04:35,877
(He Lianxin,)

66
00:04:36,637 --> 00:04:37,717
(I know I made a mistake.)

67
00:04:38,397 --> 00:04:40,477
(My heart breaks
having to lie to you every day.)

68
00:04:40,877 --> 00:04:42,877
(I am suffering just as you are,)

69
00:04:43,637 --> 00:04:45,237
(but for the truth and for you,)

70
00:04:46,477 --> 00:04:47,677
(it is my only choice.)

71
00:04:56,197 --> 00:04:57,397
Fly.

72
00:04:58,557 --> 00:05:00,837
I'm flying.

73
00:05:01,517 --> 00:05:02,757
I'm flying.

74
00:05:04,077 --> 00:05:05,397
I'm flying.

75
00:05:09,357 --> 00:05:09,877
Qinglian.

76
00:05:12,917 --> 00:05:13,437
Girl.

77
00:05:18,837 --> 00:05:19,957
It's been four years.

78
00:05:21,597 --> 00:05:22,437
Four years ago,

79
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,517
you were going around looking for ways

80
00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:29,797
to save me from the hands of the heir.

81
00:05:32,437 --> 00:05:35,117
It felt just like yesterday.

82
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:37,677
In the blink of an eye,

83
00:05:38,397 --> 00:05:39,637
four years have already passed.

84
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:45,477
Tomorrow is the late princess consort's
death anniversary again.

85
00:05:47,437 --> 00:05:48,597
However, everything has changed.

86
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:54,637
You've become like this.

87
00:05:57,117 --> 00:05:57,957
I really hope

88
00:05:58,517 --> 00:05:59,597
that you can recover.

89
00:06:01,357 --> 00:06:02,357
However, I also wish

90
00:06:02,357 --> 00:06:03,917
that you would remain like this,

91
00:06:05,997 --> 00:06:07,437
because if you recover,

92
00:06:10,157 --> 00:06:11,517
you no longer belong to me.

93
00:06:34,277 --> 00:06:35,117
I came to look for you

94
00:06:35,397 --> 00:06:36,597
to ask you for a favour.

95
00:06:45,357 --> 00:06:45,837
Official Mu.

96
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:50,597
We must take strict precautions
to ensure the safety of the prince.

97
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:51,717
Yes.

98
00:06:57,197 --> 00:06:58,597
I heard some noise over there.

99
00:06:58,957 --> 00:06:59,717
I will keep watch.

100
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:00,597
Go to check it out.

101
00:07:01,237 --> 00:07:01,677
Yes.

102
00:07:02,317 --> 00:07:02,837
Follow me!

103
00:07:17,597 --> 00:07:18,237
Ms. Lian.

104
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:19,357
Come out.

105
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:23,037
The guards will be
switching shifts soon.

106
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:24,877
Please be careful.

107
00:07:25,357 --> 00:07:26,077
Or you'll get hurt.

108
00:07:26,477 --> 00:07:27,237
Where is Young Master?

109
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:28,580
Where is Young Master?

110
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,037
Young Master.

111
00:07:31,357 --> 00:07:31,837
Ms. Lian,

112
00:07:32,437 --> 00:07:33,517
don't get discovered.

113
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:43,597
The night is cool and the liquor is cold.

114
00:07:44,557 --> 00:07:45,077
Father,

115
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:46,770
you shouldn't drink too much.

116
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,037
I don't know why

117
00:07:56,837 --> 00:07:58,940
the liquor is so cold

118
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,740
when I drink it in the tent

119
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,797
every time after I visit Fu'er.

120
00:08:04,877 --> 00:08:05,957
It's also really bitter.

121
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:10,717
That's because

122
00:08:11,397 --> 00:08:12,437
you are thinking of someone.

123
00:08:13,197 --> 00:08:13,957
So the bitter feeling

124
00:08:15,677 --> 00:08:16,450
is your longing for her

125
00:08:16,837 --> 00:08:17,917
and not the liquor.

126
00:08:19,717 --> 00:08:22,477
How can one relieve this longing?

127
00:08:24,997 --> 00:08:26,197
I don't know either.

128
00:08:27,797 --> 00:08:28,957
All I know is that

129
00:08:30,837 --> 00:08:32,077
it's not the liquor

130
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,270
that can relieve the longing,

131
00:08:36,877 --> 00:08:37,597
but the person.

132
00:08:45,037 --> 00:08:45,517
Father,

133
00:08:47,957 --> 00:08:49,277
I am thinking

134
00:08:49,277 --> 00:08:50,917
that if Lianchu was here today,

135
00:08:50,957 --> 00:08:51,477
maybe…

136
00:08:56,757 --> 00:08:58,157
You still want to plead for him?

137
00:09:04,757 --> 00:09:05,997
I tried it,

138
00:09:06,997 --> 00:09:07,837
but he didn't accept.

139
00:09:09,837 --> 00:09:10,317
Lianxin,

140
00:09:12,597 --> 00:09:13,957
do not let me

141
00:09:14,157 --> 00:09:14,997
hear these words again.

142
00:09:20,157 --> 00:09:23,357
We hadn't chatted like this in a while.

143
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,037
Tonight,

144
00:09:26,197 --> 00:09:27,437
let's use this liquor

145
00:09:28,637 --> 00:09:31,957
to numb our pain and longing.

146
00:09:34,237 --> 00:09:34,917
Here, eat.

147
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:35,557
Catch the assassin!

148
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:36,597
Don't let her escape!

149
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:38,517
Over there, quick!

150
00:09:38,757 --> 00:09:39,597
Don't let her escape!

151
00:09:47,357 --> 00:09:48,957
Girl, why are you here?

152
00:09:50,037 --> 00:09:50,637
Leave.

153
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:51,357
You all can leave.

154
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:52,670
- Yes, Yong Master.
- Yes, Yong Master.

155
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:54,757
Did they hurt you?

156
00:09:55,037 --> 00:09:56,677
They were all stopping me

157
00:09:56,877 --> 00:09:58,037
from looking for you.

158
00:09:58,317 --> 00:09:59,397
My child is sick.

159
00:09:59,397 --> 00:10:01,237
Su Nanchun, where is Young Master?

160
00:10:02,997 --> 00:10:03,830
Young Master isn't here.

161
00:10:04,197 --> 00:10:04,957
Head back first.

162
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,670
I'll tell Young Master to look for you later, okay?

163
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:07,677
You're lying to me.

164
00:10:09,277 --> 00:10:10,797
You're all lying to me.

165
00:10:11,397 --> 00:10:11,917
Lianxin.

166
00:10:13,837 --> 00:10:14,477
What's wrong?

167
00:10:15,997 --> 00:10:16,477
She

168
00:10:17,037 --> 00:10:17,917
misses the child

169
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:19,717
that died in infancy.

170
00:10:19,717 --> 00:10:20,277
So…

171
00:10:20,757 --> 00:10:21,357
You'll be fine.

172
00:10:24,677 --> 00:10:27,037
(Treat our child well.)

173
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:28,677
Don't worry.

174
00:10:30,517 --> 00:10:32,477
I will name him heir right now.

175
00:10:33,237 --> 00:10:34,997
I will have him by my side every day.

176
00:10:35,637 --> 00:10:36,157
In the future,

177
00:10:37,077 --> 00:10:38,317
I will hand him

178
00:10:39,157 --> 00:10:40,157
the entire Quliang.

179
00:10:41,677 --> 00:10:43,317
My child is sick.

180
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:44,677
Young Master promised

181
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,117
to take care of us.

182
00:10:46,117 --> 00:10:46,957
He promised

183
00:10:47,557 --> 00:10:49,157
to take care of my child.

184
00:10:49,637 --> 00:10:51,677
Since he made you a promise,

185
00:10:51,677 --> 00:10:53,517
then he will uphold it.

186
00:10:53,637 --> 00:10:55,197
He won't lie to you. Don't worry.

187
00:10:55,637 --> 00:10:56,197
Really?

188
00:10:56,597 --> 00:10:57,917
Why do people always tell me

189
00:10:58,317 --> 00:11:00,477
that men's words are not trustworthy?

190
00:11:00,957 --> 00:11:01,837
Why?

191
00:11:02,517 --> 00:11:03,077
Father.

192
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:05,037
Take her back.

193
00:11:06,237 --> 00:11:06,877
Thank you, Father.

194
00:11:07,277 --> 00:11:08,717
Wake Mu Tianshu and others up.

195
00:11:08,717 --> 00:11:09,197
My child.

196
00:11:09,517 --> 00:11:10,197
Right now?

197
00:11:10,877 --> 00:11:11,810
Where are you going, Father?

198
00:11:14,317 --> 00:11:14,917
Back to the city.

199
00:11:15,517 --> 00:11:16,397
Ms. Lian,

200
00:11:16,957 --> 00:11:18,157
you're really something.

201
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:19,957
Even though this place

202
00:11:19,957 --> 00:11:20,970
is not far from where you live,

203
00:11:21,277 --> 00:11:22,837
it's still a distance away.

204
00:11:23,597 --> 00:11:24,797
You were

205
00:11:25,397 --> 00:11:25,797
crazy...

206
00:11:26,237 --> 00:11:27,437
You came alone

207
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,477
all the way here.

208
00:11:28,837 --> 00:11:29,670
You are really something.

209
00:11:30,477 --> 00:11:32,010
Do you really think
that she came by herself?

210
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:33,237
If no one had guided her,

211
00:11:33,757 --> 00:11:34,877
why would she have chosen

212
00:11:35,157 --> 00:11:36,677
to come at the very moment

213
00:11:36,837 --> 00:11:38,037
when Father's heart was the softest

214
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,730
after paying homage to
the late princess consort?

215
00:11:39,997 --> 00:11:41,157
The camp is heavily guarded.

216
00:11:41,837 --> 00:11:43,397
If Mu Tianshu didn't let her in,

217
00:11:43,957 --> 00:11:44,970
how could a weak woman like her

218
00:11:45,317 --> 00:11:46,357
have got close

219
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:47,277
to my father's tent?

220
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:49,797
Young Master, do you mean...

221
00:11:50,597 --> 00:11:51,357
Mu Haiyao.

222
00:11:53,837 --> 00:11:54,597
Madam Yao!

223
00:11:54,997 --> 00:11:56,477
Young Master is back with Ms. Lian.

224
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:05,797
It's been a while.

225
00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:07,237
Why hasn't Young Master come?

226
00:12:07,717 --> 00:12:09,317
Could he have not thought
it was Madam who...

227
00:12:10,437 --> 00:12:10,957
He won't.

228
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:12,757
He definitely won't believe

229
00:12:12,757 --> 00:12:13,957
that a crazy woman could do that.

230
00:12:23,197 --> 00:12:23,597
No.

231
00:12:26,517 --> 00:12:27,157
Don't go.

232
00:12:29,557 --> 00:12:30,677
Don't go, Young Master.

233
00:12:31,037 --> 00:12:31,557
Girl,

234
00:12:33,637 --> 00:12:34,357
I won't leave,

235
00:12:34,877 --> 00:12:35,397
okay?

236
00:12:37,477 --> 00:12:38,397
Just sleep.

237
00:12:41,197 --> 00:12:41,917
I won't leave.

238
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:13,597
(Mu Haiyao may be calculative,)

239
00:13:13,997 --> 00:13:15,797
(but she has Young Master's
best interests at heart.)

240
00:13:16,357 --> 00:13:18,037
(I hope she'll get what she wishes.)

241
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:20,437
It's late.

242
00:13:21,277 --> 00:13:22,117
Haven't you slept yet?

243
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:23,397
Young Master is here.

244
00:13:24,397 --> 00:13:25,357
I shall make a move first.

245
00:13:30,037 --> 00:13:30,957
No need for formalities.

246
00:13:33,557 --> 00:13:34,037
Young Master,

247
00:13:35,517 --> 00:13:37,517
how have you been over the years?

248
00:13:38,877 --> 00:13:39,317
Not bad.

249
00:13:40,477 --> 00:13:41,597
You haven't changed at all.

250
00:13:41,957 --> 00:13:43,957
You're still as handsome as before,

251
00:13:46,317 --> 00:13:47,077
not like me.

252
00:13:51,237 --> 00:13:51,957
I've grown old

253
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:54,877
over these years.

254
00:13:56,277 --> 00:13:57,210
You haven't changed either.

255
00:13:57,997 --> 00:13:58,557
Really?

256
00:13:59,597 --> 00:14:01,037
You're still calculative

257
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,260
and achieve your goal by all means.

258
00:14:08,277 --> 00:14:09,197
All that I did

259
00:14:09,637 --> 00:14:10,757
was for you.

260
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,470
Did it include taking advantage
of a crazy woman?

261
00:14:13,517 --> 00:14:14,037
Of course.

262
00:14:14,877 --> 00:14:16,797
Would you care about whether or not

263
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:18,877
a person lives or dies

264
00:14:19,677 --> 00:14:20,757
if you are able to go back?

265
00:14:21,557 --> 00:14:21,997
Am I right?

266
00:14:45,197 --> 00:14:46,757
Since you hate
to part with Young Master,

267
00:14:47,397 --> 00:14:49,037
why did you push him
towards someone else?

268
00:14:49,397 --> 00:14:51,037
They're having a good time together,

269
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:53,117
while you're suffering alone.

270
00:14:53,637 --> 00:14:54,670
Why did you do this to yourself?

271
00:14:58,677 --> 00:15:00,077
What they are doing
is none of my concern.

272
00:15:02,557 --> 00:15:03,917
I just want to go back.

273
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:08,077
You're just lying to yourself.

274
00:15:09,277 --> 00:15:10,080
Ms. Lian, have you slept?

275
00:15:10,717 --> 00:15:11,197
Come in.

276
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:14,997
Ms. Lian.

277
00:15:15,597 --> 00:15:17,317
Young Master and Madam Yao
appear to be arguing.

278
00:15:20,157 --> 00:15:20,637
Young Master,

279
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:23,077
can you really be so heartless towards me?

280
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:25,197
Everything I did was all for you.

281
00:15:35,157 --> 00:15:35,757
Haiyao,

282
00:15:36,597 --> 00:15:37,637
why don't you think about

283
00:15:38,197 --> 00:15:39,997
how heartless you are
towards other people?

284
00:15:40,637 --> 00:15:41,157
Young Master,

285
00:15:43,197 --> 00:15:44,237
is Luo Qinglian

286
00:15:45,637 --> 00:15:47,237
the only person in your heart?

287
00:15:49,237 --> 00:15:50,390
You still want to bring her back

288
00:15:52,517 --> 00:15:53,717
and live happily with her

289
00:15:54,597 --> 00:15:56,717
even if she's lost her mind?

290
00:15:57,277 --> 00:15:58,477
I won't bring her back.

291
00:15:59,757 --> 00:16:00,677
The entire mansion

292
00:16:01,117 --> 00:16:02,477
makes her fill with her tears.

293
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:04,597
Even though I do want to

294
00:16:04,717 --> 00:16:05,997
become the heir
and gain his trust,

295
00:16:07,357 --> 00:16:08,277
but what I want even more

296
00:16:09,317 --> 00:16:10,757
is that she can live freely

297
00:16:11,997 --> 00:16:12,957
with no worries.

298
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:47,717
(You are the heir.)

299
00:16:48,557 --> 00:16:49,877
(You must read more books)

300
00:16:51,597 --> 00:16:52,237
(so that you can )

301
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:54,957
(become a loving leader in the future.)

302
00:16:57,677 --> 00:16:58,917
It's become water now.

303
00:17:01,197 --> 00:17:01,717
Your Highness.

304
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:03,917
Your Highness.

305
00:17:05,797 --> 00:17:06,317
Your Highness.

306
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:12,837
Official Feng, who's recommended
by Young Master Xiu,

307
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:14,557
made many great decisions

308
00:17:14,757 --> 00:17:15,757
after taking office.

309
00:17:16,357 --> 00:17:17,477
He's done many great things.

310
00:17:23,757 --> 00:17:24,277
Your Highness,

311
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:27,197
Young Master Xiu has recommended
many talented people.

312
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,517
He does have an eye for talents.

313
00:17:30,637 --> 00:17:31,130
Your Highness,

314
00:17:31,397 --> 00:17:33,117
ever since the heir has been deposed,

315
00:17:34,077 --> 00:17:35,077
many people in Quliang

316
00:17:35,277 --> 00:17:36,477
have been talking about

317
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,070
the candidates for the next heir.

318
00:17:38,997 --> 00:17:41,037
It has created quite a buzz at times.

319
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:44,757
If we are without an heir,

320
00:17:45,237 --> 00:17:47,117
the people would not
be able to be at ease.

321
00:17:47,957 --> 00:17:49,997
Your Highness, we implore that you

322
00:17:50,757 --> 00:17:52,317
appoint a new heir soon.

323
00:17:52,757 --> 00:17:53,637
If there is no heir,

324
00:17:54,277 --> 00:17:55,397
the people won't be at ease?

325
00:17:59,797 --> 00:18:00,797
In your opinion,

326
00:18:02,077 --> 00:18:03,237
who is the most suitable?

327
00:18:14,437 --> 00:18:16,437
I was handling affairs yesterday

328
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:18,837
and saw a case.

329
00:18:20,037 --> 00:18:21,637
There was a man in Nanjiang County

330
00:18:21,637 --> 00:18:22,517
who killed someone.

331
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,270
However, his mother placed
righteousness before her family

332
00:18:25,557 --> 00:18:26,837
and personally took her only son

333
00:18:27,597 --> 00:18:28,517
to the county government.

334
00:18:30,117 --> 00:18:31,637
According to law,
he should be executed.

335
00:18:32,557 --> 00:18:33,540
However, the county government

336
00:18:34,077 --> 00:18:35,270
was touched by his mother's loyalty.

337
00:18:36,117 --> 00:18:37,797
They can't bear to let
her lose her only son.

338
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,677
So they wanted to deal with him lightly.

339
00:18:39,677 --> 00:18:41,077
However, the law does not allow that.

340
00:18:41,277 --> 00:18:43,957
So this case has been put on hold
for a long time.

341
00:18:44,317 --> 00:18:46,077
This case has fallen into my hands.

342
00:18:49,277 --> 00:18:51,597
It's really a difficult case.

343
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:54,757
What would you guys do

344
00:18:55,637 --> 00:18:56,997
if you were in this position?

345
00:18:58,357 --> 00:18:58,757
Well,

346
00:18:58,877 --> 00:19:00,317
how should this be judged?

347
00:19:00,317 --> 00:19:01,837
- Yes.
- Yes.

348
00:19:01,837 --> 00:19:04,877
He should be released in empathy,
but by law he should be punished.

349
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,790
- Yes, it's quite a difficult case.
- Yes, it's difficult.

350
00:19:06,797 --> 00:19:08,637
What should we do?

351
00:19:08,757 --> 00:19:09,797
In my opinion,

352
00:19:10,637 --> 00:19:11,957
her son must be punished.

353
00:19:16,157 --> 00:19:16,717
Your reason?

354
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:19,317
The law is the foundation of Quliang.

355
00:19:19,797 --> 00:19:21,197
If we let this slide,

356
00:19:21,597 --> 00:19:22,877
it'll shake our foundation.

357
00:19:23,277 --> 00:19:25,277
I do pity the mother
and respect her actions.

358
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:27,077
So I think

359
00:19:28,517 --> 00:19:30,237
after executing her son,

360
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:31,837
the mother

361
00:19:32,557 --> 00:19:34,397
should be provided for by our government.

362
00:19:34,677 --> 00:19:36,597
Her good deeds should be
promoted among the people.

363
00:19:36,797 --> 00:19:37,397
This way,

364
00:19:37,957 --> 00:19:39,197
the law will not lose it's authority.

365
00:19:39,557 --> 00:19:41,837
Our government will
not lose our empathy.

366
00:19:42,837 --> 00:19:43,637
Our people

367
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,510
will not lose their virtue.

368
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,597
Young Master Xiu's idea makes sense.

369
00:19:46,597 --> 00:19:48,237
Yes, Young Master Xiu is right.

370
00:19:48,237 --> 00:19:49,837
- Yes, it makes sense.
- Yes, it makes sense.

371
00:19:50,837 --> 00:19:52,557
Exactly.

372
00:19:55,597 --> 00:19:58,077
Not bad, this is a good idea.

373
00:19:59,437 --> 00:20:00,277
Young Master Xin,

374
00:20:00,837 --> 00:20:02,197
you have to say something.

375
00:20:04,157 --> 00:20:04,757
Lianxin,

376
00:20:07,237 --> 00:20:07,917
what do you think?

377
00:20:23,157 --> 00:20:24,277
I think that...

378
00:20:29,637 --> 00:20:32,117
I think that executing or setting him free
is not important.

379
00:20:34,477 --> 00:20:35,357
What is important?

380
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,430
This case has been delaying
for several months.

381
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:38,797
The longer it gets delayed,

382
00:20:38,997 --> 00:20:40,517
the more time the son

383
00:20:40,637 --> 00:20:42,557
is in fear in prison.

384
00:20:42,877 --> 00:20:43,637
His mother

385
00:20:43,877 --> 00:20:45,117
has to stay alone at home

386
00:20:45,357 --> 00:20:46,957
without anyone taking care of her.

387
00:20:47,277 --> 00:20:47,837
So,

388
00:20:48,037 --> 00:20:49,317
the most important thing

389
00:20:49,317 --> 00:20:50,157
is not how to settle it,

390
00:20:50,997 --> 00:20:52,197
because no matter how you do it,

391
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:53,917
it is better than to
leave it unresolved.

392
00:20:54,477 --> 00:20:56,237
It's the same as appointing an heir.

393
00:20:56,677 --> 00:20:57,637
No matter who you choose

394
00:20:58,157 --> 00:21:00,437
is better than not having one.

395
00:21:04,197 --> 00:21:04,997
In your opinion,

396
00:21:06,637 --> 00:21:07,597
who should I choose?

397
00:21:13,957 --> 00:21:14,717
May I be so bold

398
00:21:16,117 --> 00:21:17,237
to ask you

399
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:18,437
to go with me

400
00:21:19,117 --> 00:21:19,837
somewhere, Father?

401
00:21:22,883 --> 00:21:24,583
(The heir's Mansion)

402
00:21:27,357 --> 00:21:27,997
Lianxin!

403
00:21:32,317 --> 00:21:32,877
Father.

404
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,077
How dare you.

405
00:21:36,597 --> 00:21:38,837
Is this the candidate
that you recommend to be the heir?

406
00:21:42,997 --> 00:21:43,517
Father,

407
00:21:43,917 --> 00:21:45,077
the officials are concerned about

408
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:47,277
the relationship between
the killer and his mother.

409
00:21:47,317 --> 00:21:49,037
However, Lianchu is also your son.

410
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,837
He has been under house
arrest for half a year.

411
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:52,437
Don't you want to see

412
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:53,557
what he is like now?

413
00:22:13,757 --> 00:22:14,517
What is this smell?

414
00:22:15,197 --> 00:22:16,477
Why does it reek of liquor?

415
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,637
Could Young Master Chu be
drinking all day long

416
00:22:18,877 --> 00:22:20,437
after he's been deposed?

417
00:22:23,797 --> 00:22:25,477
Forgive me, Father,

418
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,470
for not coming to greet you
as I didn't know you were coming.

419
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:29,397
Where is Lianchu? Why didn't
he come to greet me?

420
00:22:29,997 --> 00:22:30,717
Father,

421
00:22:30,837 --> 00:22:32,317
he's sick.

422
00:22:34,997 --> 00:22:36,397
Is he drunk or sick?

423
00:22:41,397 --> 00:22:42,637
What are these for?

424
00:22:44,117 --> 00:22:45,357
What are these pots for?

425
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:47,117
(He Lianchu's wife)
The liquor is made

426
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:47,437
(He Lianchu's wife)

427
00:22:47,437 --> 00:22:49,037
(He Lianchu's wife)
by Young Master for you.

428
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:51,517
Open them.

429
00:22:52,197 --> 00:22:52,717
Yes.

430
00:23:03,877 --> 00:23:05,557
Lianchu made all this?

431
00:23:06,997 --> 00:23:09,157
He knew that you didn't like baijiu

432
00:23:09,237 --> 00:23:10,237
and preferred liquor.

433
00:23:11,397 --> 00:23:12,637
So he used some of his money

434
00:23:12,637 --> 00:23:13,557
to get grapes

435
00:23:13,557 --> 00:23:14,917
from the Bureau of Dining.

436
00:23:15,957 --> 00:23:18,117
He didn't allow anyone to help him

437
00:23:18,317 --> 00:23:19,930
in any of the steps of
the liquormaking process,

438
00:23:21,037 --> 00:23:22,637
including me.

439
00:23:23,197 --> 00:23:23,797
He said

440
00:23:24,317 --> 00:23:26,517
that he could no longer accompany you.

441
00:23:26,917 --> 00:23:29,197
So this was his only way to
be filial to you, Father.

442
00:23:29,517 --> 00:23:31,397
Why has he never given this to me?

443
00:23:33,397 --> 00:23:34,557
Young Master's house arrest

444
00:23:35,597 --> 00:23:37,157
was your punishment for him.

445
00:23:37,877 --> 00:23:39,477
He knew he's made unforgivable mistakes.

446
00:23:39,477 --> 00:23:40,597
So he's ashamed to see you.

447
00:23:42,517 --> 00:23:43,317
He didn't want you

448
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,157
to be mad upon hearing his name.

449
00:23:47,157 --> 00:23:48,197
It's enough for

450
00:23:48,717 --> 00:23:50,277
the heavens, the earth

451
00:23:50,677 --> 00:23:52,397
and himself to know his actions.

452
00:23:57,357 --> 00:23:58,677
They're wiped quite clean.

453
00:24:00,717 --> 00:24:02,037
Are these just moved here?

454
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:06,517
Come on.

455
00:24:12,877 --> 00:24:13,677
What is this?

456
00:24:16,437 --> 00:24:17,517
The liquor can be moved,

457
00:24:18,197 --> 00:24:19,437
but these hand-written scriptures

458
00:24:20,037 --> 00:24:21,197
can't be faked, right?

459
00:24:22,237 --> 00:24:23,677
Ever since Young Master was deposed,

460
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:26,717
he prays for you every day, Your Highness.

461
00:24:27,397 --> 00:24:28,397
Apart from reading,

462
00:24:29,197 --> 00:24:31,237
all he does is to copy scriptures.

463
00:24:31,677 --> 00:24:34,517
The late princess consort's
death anniversary was a couple of days ago.

464
00:24:35,477 --> 00:24:36,677
He stayed up all night

465
00:24:36,677 --> 00:24:38,077
just to copy a few extra scriptures

466
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,317
for his mother.

467
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:43,077
He was tired and caught a cold.

468
00:24:44,237 --> 00:24:45,157
He has been

469
00:24:46,437 --> 00:24:48,717
bedridden for several days.

470
00:25:00,237 --> 00:25:00,797
Father,

471
00:25:01,757 --> 00:25:04,077
people make mistakes.
The most important is that they repent.

472
00:25:04,317 --> 00:25:05,197
Lianchu was personally

473
00:25:05,317 --> 00:25:06,717
taught by you, Father,

474
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,110
to fit the standards
of Quliang's leader.

475
00:25:08,477 --> 00:25:10,517
No one is more suitable
for the position of the heir.

476
00:25:10,957 --> 00:25:11,877
I plead you, Father,

477
00:25:12,397 --> 00:25:13,277
to reinstate him.

478
00:25:16,437 --> 00:25:16,957
Lianxin,

479
00:25:17,277 --> 00:25:19,317
he was deposed by Father.

480
00:25:19,757 --> 00:25:20,557
This is not a game.

481
00:25:25,197 --> 00:25:25,797
Lianzuo!

482
00:25:26,197 --> 00:25:26,637
Father.

483
00:25:26,997 --> 00:25:27,917
When did you

484
00:25:29,157 --> 00:25:30,517
start to make my decisions for me?

485
00:25:35,997 --> 00:25:36,677
I wouldn't dare.

486
00:25:37,277 --> 00:25:38,277
I'm incompetent,

487
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,270
I would never dare to
think of becoming the heir.

488
00:25:40,797 --> 00:25:41,477
I was just

489
00:25:42,637 --> 00:25:43,557
discussing the matter.

490
00:25:44,037 --> 00:25:45,277
It's best that you weren't.

491
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:47,477
You're only

492
00:25:47,477 --> 00:25:49,157
wanting that position for Lianxiu.

493
00:25:52,357 --> 00:25:53,037
I wouldn't dare.

494
00:25:53,317 --> 00:25:54,237
I've never thought about

495
00:25:54,237 --> 00:25:54,917
becoming the heir.

496
00:25:55,237 --> 00:25:56,357
That's the best.

497
00:25:56,717 --> 00:25:59,117
I have a lot of sons
that can take my place.

498
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:00,557
Finally there is one less.

499
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,730
- Your Highness, please don't be mad.
- Your Highness, please don't be mad.

500
00:26:10,357 --> 00:26:10,917
Dongli,

501
00:26:12,317 --> 00:26:13,757
what are you cooking today?

502
00:26:14,957 --> 00:26:16,717
Did you catch anything this morning?

503
00:26:18,037 --> 00:26:19,077
I only caught a rabbit

504
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:21,077
this morning.

505
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:26,540
Why don't we take a look later?

506
00:26:26,557 --> 00:26:27,157
What?

507
00:26:28,357 --> 00:26:29,237
Cabbage.

508
00:26:32,037 --> 00:26:32,837
Master Lv.

509
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:37,957
Why are you looking at me like that?

510
00:26:40,077 --> 00:26:41,237
What happened today?

511
00:26:42,037 --> 00:26:42,917
It was really you.

512
00:26:47,437 --> 00:26:48,517
You plotted everything.

513
00:26:49,597 --> 00:26:50,730
I thought you pretended to be crazy

514
00:26:51,037 --> 00:26:52,597
just to win over He Lianxin.

515
00:26:53,317 --> 00:26:54,117
I didn't think

516
00:26:54,797 --> 00:26:56,557
that you were planning to reinstate the heir.

517
00:27:00,317 --> 00:27:01,637
Do you know this?

518
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:04,317
When the prince led a troop

519
00:27:05,517 --> 00:27:06,197
on an expedition,

520
00:27:06,437 --> 00:27:07,717
he wrote a letter to the heir,

521
00:27:07,957 --> 00:27:09,530
asking him for an old
piece of clothing of his.

522
00:27:10,397 --> 00:27:12,437
How could the prince's love

523
00:27:12,837 --> 00:27:14,397
for the heir be gone

524
00:27:15,277 --> 00:27:16,317
just because of some mistakes?

525
00:27:16,917 --> 00:27:17,957
So you figured out a way

526
00:27:17,957 --> 00:27:18,917
to stall Young Master Xin

527
00:27:19,717 --> 00:27:21,270
and push Young Master Xiu
to a higher place.

528
00:27:21,957 --> 00:27:22,877
It's because you knew

529
00:27:23,677 --> 00:27:24,557
that one day,

530
00:27:25,357 --> 00:27:27,117
the prince would want
to reinstate the heir.

531
00:27:27,517 --> 00:27:28,237
At that time,

532
00:27:28,517 --> 00:27:29,717
the better Young Master was,

533
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,637
the more the prince hated him.

534
00:27:33,877 --> 00:27:34,597
We should also thank

535
00:27:34,597 --> 00:27:35,837
Young Master Xiu for his cooperation.

536
00:27:36,277 --> 00:27:38,090
He plotted and schemed
so much during these six months.

537
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:39,637
That helped quite a lot.

538
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:40,637
What a pity

539
00:27:41,237 --> 00:27:42,317
that everything he did

540
00:27:42,477 --> 00:27:43,997
was accelerating his own demise.

541
00:27:45,037 --> 00:27:46,277
Oh my gosh.

542
00:27:46,637 --> 00:27:47,877
Miss, you are a genius.

543
00:27:48,277 --> 00:27:49,637
I admire you.

544
00:27:50,717 --> 00:27:51,717
I was unhappy

545
00:27:51,877 --> 00:27:52,917
because you kept on

546
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:53,930
misunderstanding Young Master.

547
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:55,837
Come to thinking about it, I was wrong.

548
00:27:57,077 --> 00:27:58,557
There is no immortal in the world,

549
00:27:59,317 --> 00:28:00,757
and no one is the smartest in the world.

550
00:28:01,637 --> 00:28:02,397
The more people want

551
00:28:02,397 --> 00:28:03,397
to focus on their own things,

552
00:28:03,717 --> 00:28:05,037
the more they will spoil the ship

553
00:28:05,037 --> 00:28:05,970
for a half pennyworth of tar.

554
00:28:06,877 --> 00:28:07,997
I'm not in the middle of it.

555
00:28:08,357 --> 00:28:09,877
Of course I can see things
a little clearer.

556
00:28:15,877 --> 00:28:17,357
His Majesty's edict

557
00:28:17,437 --> 00:28:20,117
as a response to
a request of He Yunshuo,

558
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:21,317
Prince An of Quliang.

559
00:28:21,677 --> 00:28:23,317
His second son, He Lianchu,

560
00:28:23,717 --> 00:28:25,357
will be reinstated as his heir.

561
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:28,037
His third son, He Lianxin,

562
00:28:28,157 --> 00:28:29,757
will be given a title of Lord,

563
00:28:30,077 --> 00:28:31,197
with the name Rui.

564
00:28:31,637 --> 00:28:33,197
That is all.

565
00:28:33,437 --> 00:28:35,837
I thank His Majesty.

566
00:29:00,957 --> 00:29:02,437
Lianxin had you copying scriptures

567
00:29:02,557 --> 00:29:03,717
and making liquor many months ago.

568
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:05,357
I didn't understand why back then,

569
00:29:05,637 --> 00:29:07,317
but I see his intention now.

570
00:29:08,317 --> 00:29:10,077
You're blessed.

571
00:29:10,477 --> 00:29:11,597
Yuan Baili is gone,

572
00:29:11,997 --> 00:29:13,157
but someone else helps you.

573
00:29:13,797 --> 00:29:14,997
He isn't Yuan Baili.

574
00:29:16,117 --> 00:29:18,157
He's just using me against Lianxiu.

575
00:29:21,117 --> 00:29:22,637
Such a pity that I lost my power.

576
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:24,757
There's nothing I could do about

577
00:29:26,117 --> 00:29:27,477
being taken advantage of.

578
00:29:50,397 --> 00:29:51,157
Lv Beiyi?

579
00:29:53,237 --> 00:29:54,077
Come on.

580
00:29:54,237 --> 00:29:54,837
Drink with me.

581
00:29:54,837 --> 00:29:55,557
Here.

582
00:29:59,997 --> 00:30:01,917
Congratulations on being appointed.

583
00:30:02,157 --> 00:30:02,957
A great victory.

584
00:30:04,557 --> 00:30:05,917
Come, sit.

585
00:30:11,317 --> 00:30:12,397
There's only one cup.

586
00:30:29,277 --> 00:30:29,877
Victory?

587
00:30:30,757 --> 00:30:31,557
What's the victory?

588
00:30:33,237 --> 00:30:34,277
A great victory?

589
00:30:36,757 --> 00:30:37,757
Come, let me tell you.

590
00:30:39,397 --> 00:30:40,957
I lost.

591
00:30:42,397 --> 00:30:43,717
The person I lost to

592
00:30:44,317 --> 00:30:45,197
is you.

593
00:30:47,237 --> 00:30:50,437
I don't care about
being a prince or an heir.

594
00:30:51,877 --> 00:30:52,877
In this whole entire world,

595
00:30:53,597 --> 00:30:55,077
the person I want to be the most

596
00:30:55,757 --> 00:30:57,717
is you, Lv Beiyi.

597
00:30:59,917 --> 00:31:01,397
Young Master, you're drunk.

598
00:31:05,557 --> 00:31:06,237
Lv Beiyi,

599
00:31:06,917 --> 00:31:07,877
do you believe

600
00:31:09,357 --> 00:31:10,077
in karma?

601
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:12,877
I often make others sad.

602
00:31:14,677 --> 00:31:15,917
There will definitely be a woman

603
00:31:17,357 --> 00:31:18,797
who will return all that sorrow

604
00:31:20,117 --> 00:31:21,197
back to me.

605
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:24,717
When she wakes up every day,

606
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:25,477
she's looking for you.

607
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:27,480
She depends on you for everything.

608
00:31:28,157 --> 00:31:28,957
Isn't that enough?

609
00:31:30,077 --> 00:31:30,797
No.

610
00:31:31,797 --> 00:31:33,437
It's because she lost her mind.

611
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:34,437
She lost her mind.

612
00:31:35,317 --> 00:31:36,237
She...

613
00:31:39,637 --> 00:31:40,597
She talks about me,

614
00:31:41,797 --> 00:31:42,677
misses me

615
00:31:45,037 --> 00:31:46,477
and wants to stick with me.

616
00:31:48,077 --> 00:31:49,397
However, when she's not crazy,

617
00:31:50,357 --> 00:31:51,877
she hates me, blames me

618
00:31:53,197 --> 00:31:54,677
and wants to push me away.

619
00:31:56,357 --> 00:31:57,157
She pushes...

620
00:31:58,277 --> 00:31:59,397
She pushes me away

621
00:32:00,237 --> 00:32:01,837
from her.

622
00:32:03,157 --> 00:32:04,597
Farther and farther away.

623
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:07,717
She pushes me away.

624
00:32:09,437 --> 00:32:10,157
Young Master, get up.

625
00:32:15,357 --> 00:32:16,077
Teach me.

626
00:32:18,357 --> 00:32:19,157
What should I teach you?

627
00:32:22,597 --> 00:32:23,477
Teach me

628
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:26,917
how to be you.

629
00:32:28,397 --> 00:32:29,197
Teach me

630
00:32:32,437 --> 00:32:33,357
how to make her

631
00:32:36,317 --> 00:32:37,157
love me.

632
00:33:10,677 --> 00:33:11,317
Ms. Lian,

633
00:33:11,997 --> 00:33:13,477
Young Master has a banquet tonight.

634
00:33:13,917 --> 00:33:15,077
He won't be coming.

635
00:33:17,477 --> 00:33:18,237
I know.

636
00:33:21,197 --> 00:33:22,397
Get some rest soon.

637
00:33:25,997 --> 00:33:27,157
I'll wait for a while.

638
00:33:38,037 --> 00:33:38,957
Did Young Master come?

639
00:33:46,997 --> 00:33:47,477
Dongli.

640
00:33:48,077 --> 00:33:48,477
Dongli.

641
00:33:49,597 --> 00:33:50,397
What are you thinking?

642
00:33:53,677 --> 00:33:54,477
Do you think that

643
00:33:55,237 --> 00:33:56,877
after pretending to be crazy
for a long time,

644
00:33:57,477 --> 00:33:58,317
will she really

645
00:33:59,197 --> 00:34:00,637
become a little abnormal?

646
00:34:03,437 --> 00:34:04,797
They have such a great victory,

647
00:34:05,517 --> 00:34:06,717
but Ms. Lian has been

648
00:34:06,717 --> 00:34:08,037
very down these days.

649
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:09,597
I asked her

650
00:34:09,597 --> 00:34:11,170
if she was going to stop
pretending to be crazy

651
00:34:11,277 --> 00:34:12,837
and have Young Master bring us back.

652
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:16,157
She just said that it's not time yet.

653
00:34:17,077 --> 00:34:18,237
Why is it not time yet?

654
00:34:18,397 --> 00:34:20,650
Isn't she just waiting for this moment
after planning for so long?

655
00:34:22,557 --> 00:34:23,677
You're a woman.

656
00:34:23,837 --> 00:34:25,157
Why don't you understand her?

657
00:34:26,517 --> 00:34:28,157
She's sad.

658
00:34:28,717 --> 00:34:29,517
Sad?

659
00:34:30,757 --> 00:34:32,357
Young Master is treating her so nicely.

660
00:34:33,357 --> 00:34:34,477
Why would she be sad?

661
00:34:35,797 --> 00:34:36,837
The nicer he is towards her,

662
00:34:36,997 --> 00:34:38,077
the worse she feels,

663
00:34:38,717 --> 00:34:39,757
because it's all fake.

664
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,870
He's nice to her because
he thinks she lost her mind.

665
00:34:42,597 --> 00:34:43,397
They are married,

666
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,077
but she's done so much just to

667
00:34:45,597 --> 00:34:46,717
make Young Master feel guilty.

668
00:34:47,277 --> 00:34:49,437
However, guilt is not love after all.

669
00:34:50,717 --> 00:34:52,277
She's afraid that when
she's back to normal,

670
00:34:52,477 --> 00:34:54,270
the two of them wouldn't know
how to face each other.

671
00:34:58,397 --> 00:34:59,637
No wonder Madam Yao says

672
00:34:59,637 --> 00:35:01,157
that Ms. Lian is not willing to go back.

673
00:35:03,677 --> 00:35:04,997
Poor Miss.

674
00:35:08,717 --> 00:35:09,277
Dongli,

675
00:35:09,877 --> 00:35:10,437
shut the door.

676
00:35:16,517 --> 00:35:17,357
Master Lv?

677
00:35:25,637 --> 00:35:26,237
Yi,

678
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:28,237
you've avoided me for the past year.

679
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:30,117
Why are you here at this hour?

680
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:33,277
I've got a bottle of good liquor

681
00:35:34,957 --> 00:35:36,077
and I want to drink with someone.

682
00:35:38,397 --> 00:35:39,237
You're already drunk.

683
00:35:40,957 --> 00:35:41,677
There're some words

684
00:35:43,557 --> 00:35:48,197
I wouldn't be able to say
if I weren't drunk.

685
00:35:52,597 --> 00:35:53,117
Dongli,

686
00:35:53,557 --> 00:35:54,717
prepare some food for the liquor.

687
00:36:06,437 --> 00:36:07,357
I've prepared

688
00:36:08,677 --> 00:36:09,237
some dishes.

689
00:36:17,237 --> 00:36:18,717
First, answer me a question.

690
00:36:19,837 --> 00:36:20,557
Have you ever felt

691
00:36:23,317 --> 00:36:25,077
sorry to me in the past few years?

692
00:36:28,997 --> 00:36:29,517
Yes.

693
00:36:34,837 --> 00:36:35,357
Why?

694
00:36:40,917 --> 00:36:42,370
Because you fell in
love with someone else.

695
00:36:44,597 --> 00:36:45,877
You fell in love with He Lianxin.

696
00:36:50,357 --> 00:36:51,597
Yi, you're drunk.

697
00:37:35,957 --> 00:37:37,517
You went to the forest.

698
00:37:42,837 --> 00:37:43,957
You were always there.

699
00:37:52,717 --> 00:37:54,117
This is the first dish.

700
00:37:56,437 --> 00:37:57,037
Lian'er,

701
00:37:59,797 --> 00:38:00,957
you didn't betray me.

702
00:38:03,117 --> 00:38:04,837
I was the one who betrayed you first

703
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:08,197
to get my status back.

704
00:38:09,117 --> 00:38:09,917
I don't believe.

705
00:38:13,237 --> 00:38:14,277
The first betrayal.

706
00:38:35,477 --> 00:38:36,317
The second dish.

707
00:38:41,917 --> 00:38:42,677
When Mu Haiyao

708
00:38:43,957 --> 00:38:45,397
pushed you out of the carriage

709
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:48,157
on the way to the southern courtyard,

710
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,197
I was not the one that saved you

711
00:38:52,557 --> 00:38:53,757
in that emergency situation.

712
00:38:56,557 --> 00:38:57,517
It was He Lianxin.

713
00:39:02,997 --> 00:39:03,717
At that time,

714
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,317
he gave me three chances

715
00:39:07,317 --> 00:39:08,237
to take you with me.

716
00:39:10,957 --> 00:39:12,237
I didn't have the courage to take you

717
00:39:15,117 --> 00:39:16,437
with me with my name tarnished.

718
00:39:26,037 --> 00:39:27,197
I chose to give up.

719
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:30,877
The second time I betrayed you.

720
00:39:56,197 --> 00:39:57,277
The third dish.

721
00:40:02,637 --> 00:40:03,997
The last time we eloped.

722
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:06,557
Why do you think...

723
00:40:09,317 --> 00:40:11,717
Why do you think He Lianxin
was able to find us so quickly?

724
00:40:13,797 --> 00:40:14,437
It was me.

725
00:40:17,997 --> 00:40:19,477
I purposely left clues,

726
00:40:23,317 --> 00:40:24,077
because I didn't want

727
00:40:24,077 --> 00:40:25,357
the person I loved the most

728
00:40:27,037 --> 00:40:28,917
to have someone else in her heart.

729
00:40:34,077 --> 00:40:35,077
That was the third betrayal.

730
00:41:02,557 --> 00:41:03,157
Lian'er.

731
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:05,397
You...

732
00:41:07,797 --> 00:41:09,317
You didn't in love with someone else first.

733
00:41:11,437 --> 00:41:12,277
It was my lies.

734
00:41:12,277 --> 00:41:13,797
I may have been able to deceive you,

735
00:41:14,037 --> 00:41:15,997
but I am not able to deceive

736
00:41:17,797 --> 00:41:18,517
my own heart.
