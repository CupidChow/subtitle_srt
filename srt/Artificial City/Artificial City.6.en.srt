Hello?

165
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,314
What about Jun-il's tailor?

166
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,809
Huh?

167
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,263
But Jun-hyeok has lots of suits.

168

Ouch, my ear.

Is there a business called
Minerva in this building?

172
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,866
Minerva?

173
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:45,417
Well, they sell alcohol and food.

174
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:48,291
It's like a wine bar, I think.

175

I'm sorry, but we don't have
an F&B division.

I don't know. It's not like
I stay home all day, you know.

If he does return, be careful
not to raise any suspicions.

- You're here.

00:19:15,177 --> 00:19:17,204
Who's that from?

191
00:19:17,205 --> 00:19:22,299
Madam Kwon Min-seon. Secretary Go said
we shouldn't leave it in the lobby.

192
00:19:28,165 --> 00:19:30,479
You're dismissed.

- Enjoy the food.
- Thank you.

194
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:53,883
Mrs. Yun doesn't have any parents.

195
00:19:53,896 --> 00:19:59,799
That's why she was very close
to Madam Kwon. They were like sisters.

196
00:20:00,871 --> 00:20:04,702
I don't know
why she acted like that just now.

197
00:20:11,486 --> 00:20:13,785
Madam Kwon was a regular here
for thirty years.

198

Now, I come here once in a while.

00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:22,897
Enjoy.

200
00:20:24,302 --> 00:20:27,289
I didn't think
you'd like this kind of food.

201
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:32,722
Have you talked to Mr. Cho?
Is he going to register the marriage?

202
00:20:34,586 --> 00:20:39,491
He should be happy that I'm willing
to marry an old man like him.

203
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:42,618
But he's changed completely.

204
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:45,765
He used to buy me
luxury handbags and shoes.

205
00:20:45,804 --> 00:20:47,911
But now, he checks my spending.

206
00:20:48,158 --> 00:20:51,701
I can't even go to the nail shop.

207
00:20:51,901 --> 00:20:55,502
I lost my Bluetooth earphones
so I have to buy new ones

208
00:20:55,695 --> 00:20:58,404
but I can only afford the cheapest ones.

209
00:20:58,484 --> 00:21:00,120
Don't you think it's unfair?

210
00:21:00,152 --> 00:21:03,207
You shouldn't have
sent me that potted plant.

211
00:21:03,617 --> 00:21:06,495
Gang-hyeon asked me to send it to you

212
00:21:06,768 --> 00:21:09,720
and Big Sis would have done it
if she were still alive.

213
00:21:10,868 --> 00:21:13,028
And I took the opportunity
to skim a little for myself.

214
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,594
Good.

215
00:21:18,998 --> 00:21:20,499
By the way,

216
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,908
have you ever seen No Yeong-ju?

217
00:21:23,506 --> 00:21:25,995
Yeah, once or twice.

218
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:28,110
Madam Kwon as well?

219
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,496
She didn't just see her.

220
00:21:31,595 --> 00:21:34,384
She did a lot more than just see her.

221
00:21:36,698 --> 00:21:41,182
You were on good terms with Sis
so you probably have no idea

222
00:21:43,364 --> 00:21:45,330
what a scary person she was.

223
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,411
Does Mr. Cho know?

224
00:21:47,436 --> 00:21:50,901
Of course he does.
He lived with her for over twenty years.

225
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:55,898
Do you know what he said to me
after I'd taken a walloping from her?

226
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,203
He told me to make sure
to not tell anyone.

227
00:22:06,082 --> 00:22:09,818
You've been through
quite a lot, I see.

228
00:22:14,186 --> 00:22:18,698
My mother always said that
you shouldn't cry while you eat.

229
00:22:20,085 --> 00:22:24,329
Why did you have to get me so emotional?

230
00:22:28,292 --> 00:22:32,220
Hold on! It's on me!

231
00:22:33,677 --> 00:22:36,837
It's only fair that
I pay for today's lunch.

232
00:22:37,175 --> 00:22:39,006
It's only decent.

233
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:42,793
The food was delicious.

234
00:22:46,971 --> 00:22:48,791
Thank you.

235
00:22:52,503 --> 00:22:54,903
You know the get-together of wives
Madam Kwon used to attend?

236
00:22:55,272 --> 00:22:58,523
You mean the Okryeonhoe Club?

237
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:01,303
What about it?

238
00:23:04,692 --> 00:23:05,480
Me?

239
00:23:05,587 --> 00:23:09,405
Yes, you should attend now
since you're with Mr. Cho.

240
00:23:11,373 --> 00:23:15,323
Oh my, Jae-hui!

241
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:19,004
But don't tell Mr. Cho
for the time being.

242
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:23,698
Of course.
There's no reason he should find out.

243
00:23:24,191 --> 00:23:26,002
Let's go, Jae-hui.

244
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,868
You're the best!

245
00:23:31,802 --> 00:23:34,006
I can't make it because
I have a prior engagement.

246
00:23:34,106 --> 00:23:37,530
Oh no. I don't want to
go there by myself.

247
00:23:37,686 --> 00:23:40,760
Mother knows they're all there
to make amends for their husbands.

248
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:43,297
So I'm sure she
won't be too hard on you.

249
00:23:44,503 --> 00:23:48,595
Jae-hui is really making it
tough for everyone.

250
00:23:49,167 --> 00:23:52,714
You'll be fine, Aunt.
Call me and tell me how it was.

251
00:23:57,482 --> 00:23:58,795
Did you eat dinner?

252
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,790
I ate with Father and Mother.

253
00:24:03,825 --> 00:24:06,186
Living under the same roof as Mother,

254
00:24:06,476 --> 00:24:10,379
it's been so long since we've cooked.

255
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:16,494
You'd cook us pasta once in a while
when Yu-ri was here.

256
00:24:19,784 --> 00:24:22,710
Isn't it uncomfortable
to eat with Father?

257
00:24:25,877 --> 00:24:27,976
I've never thought of it that way.

258
00:24:29,981 --> 00:24:31,803
Why don't we eat separately from now on?

259
00:24:32,316 --> 00:24:34,416
Mother would be hurt if we do.

260
00:24:43,704 --> 00:24:46,696
Don't you think you're
drinking too much these days?

261
00:24:46,981 --> 00:24:48,889
It's not wine, it's pomegranate juice.

262
00:24:50,786 --> 00:24:52,197
They say it's good for women.

263
00:25:09,503 --> 00:25:12,695
You practically made me beg
so we could have Yu-ri.

264
00:25:13,089 --> 00:25:15,117
Were you jealous of Jun-heok's son?

265
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:18,689
You never smiled
at Yu-ri like you did to him.

266
00:25:19,411 --> 00:25:23,321
Why do you want a son all of a sudden?

267
00:25:25,596 --> 00:25:26,936
It's not like that, Ju-yeon.

268
00:25:27,086 --> 00:25:29,504
Then? What is it like?

269
00:26:03,717 --> 00:26:05,010
Hello, Sister.

270
00:26:05,053 --> 00:26:06,517
Hello.

271
00:26:06,697 --> 00:26:09,685
You look much more relaxed
than I expected.

272
00:26:09,912 --> 00:26:13,390
I was worried that you'd all be tense.

273
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:19,429
It's been a long time
since we met a hotel.

274
00:26:19,571 --> 00:26:23,876
Nowadays, there's no reason to visit
hotels as there's lots to do elsewhere.

275
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:27,910
But when we were young,
hotels were the only option we had.

276
00:26:28,293 --> 00:26:30,675
Everyone we knew were from elite families

277
00:26:30,775 --> 00:26:34,521
so we had to meet where
there were no prying eyes.

278
00:26:34,707 --> 00:26:38,601
But nowadays, a woman could cause
a scandal by visiting a hotel.

279
00:26:38,881 --> 00:26:41,962
Yeah, even if you have
coffee in the hotel lounge,

280
00:26:41,992 --> 00:26:44,895
they'll start talking about you.

281
00:26:44,981 --> 00:26:47,532
This must bring you back
to the good old days.

282
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,443
I like it.

283
00:26:54,194 --> 00:26:55,512
Hello.

284
00:26:57,303 --> 00:26:58,604
Hello, Mother.

285
00:26:59,699 --> 00:27:02,134
Everyone has been praising
your choice of venue.

286
00:27:02,361 --> 00:27:06,317
They tell me that coming to a hotel
takes them back to old times.

287
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:10,883
I was worried what you might think.
I'm glad you like the hotel.

288
00:27:11,076 --> 00:27:13,491
Let me introduce myself formally.
I'm Yun Jae-hui.

289
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:23,792
I'm Oh Ye-rin and I'm with
the Prosecutor General.

290
00:27:27,086 --> 00:27:28,709
Take a seat.

291
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:57,193
I'm sorry, Sister, but I don't think
I can let this slide.

292
00:28:00,098 --> 00:28:01,476
Look, Jae-hui.

293
00:28:03,889 --> 00:28:06,002
You should answer when you are addressed.

294
00:28:06,027 --> 00:28:07,817
I am CEO now.
Please address me respectfully.

295
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:11,693
Who says so?

296
00:28:11,786 --> 00:28:15,015
That's not a position you can get
because you say so.

297
00:28:15,175 --> 00:28:17,634
Chairwoman Seo Han-suk has approved it.

298
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:32,705
OK, Madam Yun.

299
00:28:33,393 --> 00:28:34,393
Yes, Aunt?

300
00:28:34,678 --> 00:28:38,394
As you are well-aware,
I really don't like you.

301
00:28:38,574 --> 00:28:41,018
I think everyone here
shares my sentiments.

302
00:28:41,482 --> 00:28:44,779
But if Sister wants it,

303
00:28:45,273 --> 00:28:48,607
I can accept you into our club.

304
00:28:48,814 --> 00:28:52,481
But not that woman.

305
00:28:53,401 --> 00:28:55,805
She seduced a married man

306
00:28:55,978 --> 00:28:58,813
and even had his child out of wedlock.

307
00:28:58,979 --> 00:29:01,376
Now, she's moved into his house

308
00:29:01,586 --> 00:29:04,085
and pretends to be his wife.

309
00:29:04,318 --> 00:29:07,808
Do you really expect us
to consort with her?

310
00:29:08,385 --> 00:29:11,616
I'm sure you're offended.

311
00:29:12,386 --> 00:29:15,193
But Aunt and everyone here,

312
00:29:15,981 --> 00:29:19,113
have you forgotten why we've gathered?

313
00:29:19,566 --> 00:29:23,061
It's to make amends to Sister.

314
00:29:23,086 --> 00:29:27,496
That's right, because Cho instigated
your husbands to go after me.

315
00:29:28,095 --> 00:29:32,979
Cho is a man who had a bastard child
despite the fact he was married

316
00:29:33,412 --> 00:29:37,724
and even invited his mistress to
live with him in his dead wife's stead.

317
00:29:38,169 --> 00:29:41,818
Your husbands are all allied
with that kind of man.

318
00:29:42,702 --> 00:29:44,795
That's not the same thing.

But he's been
sexually harassing his aids.

but to live with such men?

Do you think your husband
is any different?

But you don't treat me as another woman.

Yes.

I had no idea. I really thought
you were looking out for me.

You trusted me?

You and I aren't close enough
to trust each other like that.

Don't cry in public.
They'll think you're weak.

It smelled funny and musty

I wanted to go to a top university

That's why I memorized how to paint
for the painting test.

There's a school that teaches you how
to paint for the college painting test.

Paraffin oil.

383

the unpleasant smell of paraffin.

But that smell excited me

00:36:15,186 --> 00:36:19,205
and I thought I could succeed
if I studied hard enough.

I was scared when we criticized
each other's art.

mediocre paintings

but I've never been angry at him.

539

I already told you that whether we have
children or not is our own business.

540

Now that you have Han-suk's backing,
you've become quite insolent!

541

If that's how you feel, Father,
that's because you fear Mother.

from the very beginning.

But that never
caused you to even blink.

married my precious son,

you'll stop with Hyeon-wu?

There will be no more children
and that's final.

Why did you have to cause
such a commotion today?

549
00:52:15,069 --> 00:52:17,709
This isn't the first time
your father-in-law has behaved like that.

550
00:52:20,199 --> 00:52:24,209
Let Hyeon-wu sleep here.

but he sees and hears everything.

552

I'll be careful in front of Hyeon-wu.

553

But I'd feel more comfortable
if Hyeon-wu slept at home.

554

you won't let him stay here?
