You promised you'd give him back!

You took him! How are you
any different from me?

What?

167
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,946
Hit me again?

168
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,317
Or push me off from here?

169
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:13,452
Fine.

170
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,387
Go ahead!

[Minori crying]

173
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,470
[Minori] I want to hit you!

174
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:38,911
Because you hurt me!
So I want to hurt you!

175
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:43,382
I knew taking revenge
wouldn't change anything, but...

176
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:50,823
But, then...

177
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:55,027
who's there to save me?

178
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,331
So...

179
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:03,569
I destroyed everything to get Yudai back!

180
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,740
But I couldn't trust him anymore.

181
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,776
I wanted to, but I couldn't.

182
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,680
I got what I deserved

183
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:19,652
for being selfish, for dragging
Tsubasa and Wataru into this...

184
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,088
and for hurting them.

185
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,095
You're the same.

186
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:36,435
So I won't feel sorry for you.

187
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:44,543
We both hurt the ones we care about
more than our own lives!

188
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,349
You want to be happy?

189
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,687
You want to be saved?

190
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,292
We no longer have the right
to even think about that.

191

Then...

00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,342
how am I supposed to go on?

193
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:47,873
[voice breaking] Wataru...

194
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,422
Mom...

195
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,358
I...

196
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,929
I promise I'll be happy.

197
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,635
So...

198
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:20,439
from now on...

199
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,378
let me walk my own path.

200
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,326
Mom.

201
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,864
Take care of yourself.

202
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:58,644
I'm sorry.

203
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,083
I'm really sorry.

204
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,854
Forgive me!

205
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:15,727
[wails] I'm sorry...

206
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,268
[wailing continues]

207
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,307
[birds chirping]

208
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,649
I'm back.

209
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,551
[Haruna's friend] There she is!

210
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,353
Minori!

211
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:44,623
Huh?

212
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:48,460
Hey, sorry about the other day.

213
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,164
We kind of avoided you.

214
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,401
We'd just seen that post.
It really shocked us.

215
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,606
No, I'm sorry it shocked you.

216
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:05,511
It's okay. Mr. Taguchi said
it was all a misunderstanding.

217
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,480
Mr. Taguchi did?

218
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,818
We figured, well, obviously...
you wouldn't do something like that.

219
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,489
I'll throw a high one!

220
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:18,590
There!

221
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:22,628
[Minori] I wanted to thank you
about the post.

222
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:25,430
I heard you explained it to them.

223
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:29,434
Don't mention it. I was worried
I might be overstepping.

224
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,303
But I just wanted to help.

225
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,172
You did. I appreciate it.

226
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,074
Then, I'm glad.

227
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,719
What are you going to do...

228
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:50,856
about Mr. Miyake?

229
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:58,764
To me...

230
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,900
it looks like

231
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,437
you're willingly punishing yourself.

232
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:08,907
So you're...

233
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,845
holding back your feelings
for Mr. Miyake...

234
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:17,849
even though...

235
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:23,589
there's nothing standing between you two.

236
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:26,725
Minori.

237
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:33,165
Isn't it time you let yourself
be forgiven?

238
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,502
Let myself...

239
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,638
be forgiven?

240
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,744
Your happiness means

241
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,380
Tsubasa's happiness, right?

242
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,187
[Emiri] Daddy! Can you join us?

243
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,689
Sure. Let's play.

244
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,059
Minori.

245
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,663
Let's make ourselves happier, okay?

246
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:08,734
[Taguchi] Want me to throw?

247
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:17,376
CLOSED

248
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,220
[door opens]

249
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:31,890
[door closes]

250
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,334
[Minori] Here you go.

251
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:44,269
Thanks.

252
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,071
I appreciate it.

253
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,411
I went to see my mom today.

254
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,814
Did you? How is she?

255
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,383
She's much calmer.

256
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:02,321
She and Reika will stay
at her parents' for a while.

257
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:04,690
I see.

258
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,394
So you wanted to talk about something?

259
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,399
[birds trilling]

260
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:22,941
[trilling continues]

261
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,487
Summer is almost over.

262
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:39,057
Yes?

263
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:43,095
It's been seven years...

264
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:54,339
You know, Wataru.

265
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,975
Yes?

266
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,484
I used to be...

267
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:08,687
ridiculously naive.

268
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,556
So completely trusting.

269
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:17,062
Pure and honest.

270
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:20,632
Just like you.

271
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,439
When I'm with you...

272
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,309
I feel like...

273
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:36,014
maybe I can be pure again.

274
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,085
Maybe I can be allowed...

275
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:43,722
to live like that.

276
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:48,593
Like in those days...

277
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,697
when I loved someone...

278
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,735
without fear or doubt.

279
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,008
But...

280
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:08,246
I know I shouldn't wish that.

281
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,925
Because my heart is black.

282
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,198
I don't want to hurt you again.

283
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,735
I don't want to taint you the way I am.

284
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:40,445
But...

285
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,320
if...

286
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,890
if I can be forgiven.

287
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:58,463
If I can be honest about my feelings...

288
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:05,437
I...

289
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,742
I love you.

00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:22,654
I love you.

No matter how black your heart is...

297
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:05,530
no matter how much
I get hurt or tainted...

298
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,502
I'm going to...

299
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:13,972
keep loving you.

I love you.

00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:32,958
And I...

304
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:37,262
love you.

305
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:41,866
I love you.

306
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:47,205
- I love you.
- I love you.

307
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,341
I love you!

308
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:04,623
So I need to ask.

309
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,826
- [music ends]
- Can you give me...

310
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,296
a little time?

311
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:15,266
What?

312
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,035
I...

313
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:20,171
I'm thinking about leaving here.

314
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:25,377
Why?

315
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:28,446
Right now, I'm not...

316
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,017
capable of protecting you.

317
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:34,719
I...

318
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:38,590
want to be stronger.

319
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:41,993
I want to build...

320
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,997
my own life.

321
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,768
I want to

322
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,504
make you truly happy.

323
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:00,378
So...

324
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,684
can you have faith in me...

325
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:09,587
and wait...

326
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,491
until I'm worthy of you?

327
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:31,476
[Minori] Okay.

328
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,616
[birds chirping]

329
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,591
[Minori] It's hot today, isn't it?

330
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,662
Mom, you know what happened?

331
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:53,498
Tsubasa said to me...

332
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,134
- See you later.
- Going out?

333
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,368
Where?

334
00:28:57,969 --> 00:28:59,003
Huh?

335
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:02,073
- To the aquarium.
- With who?

336
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:04,509
My friend.

337
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:05,944
Hmm...

338
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:08,313
Hey, wait!

339
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,982
- Your hair--
- What?

340
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,383
- Sticking up.
- Don't!

341
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:14,185
What's wrong?

342
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,221
Leave it! I did it myself.

343
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,656
You did? Why?

344
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:20,792
None of your business.

345
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,294
- Why? Just tell me!
- You're annoying.

346
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,463
Annoy...

347
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:27,899
Tsubasa! Recently, you--

348
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,168
Okay, I get it. I'm late. Gotta go.

349
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:34,439
Hey, Tsubasa!

350
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,409
Sorry I'm late.

351
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,511
[Emiri] Good morning!

352
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:42,647
Hey, your hair's sticking up!

353
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:45,884
- What?
- [Emiri] I'll fix it.

354
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,087
That's love.

355
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:51,322
Sara!

356
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:52,690
Long time no see.

357
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:55,593
You went solo?

358
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,029
Congratulations!

359
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:01,299
Thanks. If you're ever in trouble,
come to me.

360
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:02,534
[Minori chuckles]

361
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,336
You've already helped me enough.

362
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:06,704
That's true.

363
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:12,410
Oh, by the way,
what's Miyake up to these days?

364
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,180
Running a learning hub in Tokyo.

365
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,681
A leaning hub? Wow.

366
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,818
To offer a safe place for kids

367
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:22,353
who've stopped going to school
for various reasons.

368
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:24,789
Mm-hmm.

369
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:27,559
Do you ever see him?

370
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,394
No.

371
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:32,197
- Not since then.
- I see.

372
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,067
And Tsubasa's growing up fast.

373
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,236
- You okay?
- Huh?

374
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,305
Not lonely?

375
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:43,541
I'm not.

376
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,613
Because...

377
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:53,318
I'm glad to see everyone
taking steps, growing

378
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:56,521
and moving forward on their own.

379
00:30:57,755 --> 00:31:00,058
It makes me want to work hard, too.

380
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:03,061
Minori...

381
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:06,898
you've become strong.

382
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:13,504
Do you think...

383
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,942
I'm moving forward like them?

384
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,146
[man] Minori?

385
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,283
Dad.

386
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,119
- You came, too.
- Yeah.

387
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:50,041
Is she doing okay?

388
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,846
You mean Hiromi Kisaragi?

389
00:31:56,981 --> 00:32:01,119
Are you still concerned about that woman?

390
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:07,258
Because she was once family.

391
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:12,864
To be honest, I was surprised

392
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:15,133
when you didn't press charges

393
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,438
because, unfortunately,
some people never change.

394
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,710
She can change.

395
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,346
My mother-in-law...

396
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:32,183
You might be right.

397
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,155
I guess I'll try to be supportive.

398
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,857
Thank you.

399
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,160
[cell phone ringing]

400
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,095
Sorry.

401
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:48,700
Yes?

402
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:51,769
Okay. I'll be there.

403
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:54,806
- Do you have to go?
- Yes.

404
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,408
A meeting. It's important.

405
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:01,346
Let me take you out to dinner sometime.

406
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:04,282
[Minori] Okay.

407
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:13,858
Minori?

408
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:15,727
Hmm?

409
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:20,131
Your face has softened.

410
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,501
Huh?

411
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,473
The way your eyes look now...

412
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:32,810
they're just like Miyuki's.

413
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,584
[wistful music playing]

414
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:04,175
[Minori] We all do wrong.

415
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,945
Whether through betrayal

416
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,516
or vengeance...

417
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,587
we hurt those dearest to us

418
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:20,291
and in doing so, we hurt ourselves.

419
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,228
And the wounds we leave

420
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:28,833
never truly heal.

421
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,071
Damn it.

422
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,873
[Hiromi] I shouldn't be doing this.

423
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:39,110
- Hello.
- Hello! Come in.

424
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:43,214
[whispers] That's her.

425
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:46,284
She blackmailed the chairman's daughter?

426
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:48,786
- Yes.
- She sure looks like a criminal!

427
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,955
Keep it down. [chuckles]

428
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:52,757
Scary, isn't she?

429
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:55,927
Shut up!

430
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,296
You ugly bitches!

431
00:34:58,396 --> 00:34:59,697
[Minori] But...

432
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:03,301
we keep making mistakes

433
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,437
even though we know deep down.

434
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:11,175
[stylist] Riko! Can you give me a hand?

435
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,410
Sure.

436
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:19,283
GOING TO MAHIRO'S FOR A PLAYDATE.

437
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:21,686
[Minori] And yet...

438
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,923
life goes on.

439
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,926
[stylist] Riko, hurry up!

440
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:30,261
I'm sorry.

441
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:32,697
Excuse me.

442
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,870
[Minori] When we forgive the past
that wounded us...

443
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:42,406
[grunts]

444
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:48,613
[worker 1]
Ugh, she packed string beans again.

445
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:51,883
- She messing with me?
- Got caught cheating?

446
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,284
- [worker 2] Eat it!
- [worker 1] No, man.

447
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:55,586
- You like string beans.
- Can I have it?

448
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:57,088
[worker 1] Huh?

449
00:35:57,622 --> 00:36:00,458
If you're not going to eat it, can I?

450
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:02,760
Oh, sure.

451
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,629
Thank you.

452
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:15,006
It's good.

453
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:18,209
- It's good.
- [Minori] And someday

454
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:23,314
when we can forgive ourselves
for the pain we caused...

455
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:44,435
Minori.

456
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:51,275
...we might be able to find...

457
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,914
a sliver of happiness.

458
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:02,687
Welcome home.

459
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:11,229
[closing theme music playing]

460
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:26,904
[clatters]
