00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:10,010
SEVEN YEARS LATER

3
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:19,819
[Minori] I never got over the pain
of hurting others for my revenge.

4
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,056
But...

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,959
step by step

6
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:30,630
I've moved forward.

7
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:41,374
Time heals all wounds.

8
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:46,479
This peaceful everyday life

9
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:49,949
will someday

10
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,852
let me forget everything.

11
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,425
Tsubasa.

12
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,894
Mom.

13
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,798
Look.

14
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,369
[Minori] Nothing here.

15
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,039
My son and I will continue

16
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:16,376
to live quietly like this.

17
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,714
That's what I thought, but...

[wind howling]

19
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,593
I didn't think...

20
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,131
I'd see you again.

UNTIL I DESTROYED
MY HUSBAND'S OTHER FAMILY

23
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,093
- See you. Bye.
- [child] Bye.

24
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:43,029
Thank you very much.

25
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,370
[indistinct chatter]

26
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,438
- [customer 1] Come here for a minute.
- [customer 2] Ms. Minori.

27
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:55,074
- This is so delicious.
- Really?

28
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,376
It's delicious, isn't it?

29
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,044
- Isn't it?
- Take your time and enjoy.

30
00:02:58,144 --> 00:02:59,746
No, not yet.

31
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,614
[child 1] That's really good.

32
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,216
[child 2] Thank you.

33
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:04,551
Can I have some?

34
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:05,952
[child 1] Give me a little.

35
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:08,421
Thanks for waiting.

36
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:12,258
- You have a very nice café.
- Do you think so?

37
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,027
Wait.

38
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:15,662
Here.

39
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,932
Sorry, I'm a bit late,
but congratulations.

40
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,500
Thank you.

41
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,004
For a long time

42
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,774
I wanted to build a place

43
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:31,844
where parents and their kids
can feel safe and relax.

44
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:35,081
For me, it feels like
it's finally happened.

45
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,251
It was received so well,
you were featured in an article.

46
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,322
When I moved here to Suzuhara

47
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:45,124
there weren't any family-oriented cafés.

48
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,627
I was lucky to be the first.

49
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:51,064
Why did you decide on opening here?

50
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,236
I visited here with my mom
when I was little.

51
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,940
Then I visited several times
for a travel seminar at my university.

52
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:04,611
There's the ocean nearby,
lots of greenery...

53
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,313
So I always loved this area.

54
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:11,484
People here are helpful and nice, too.

55
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:16,589
You know

56
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:20,560
you've been working hard
for a long time on your own.

57
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,595
Maybe it's time

58
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,565
to take a step to find another partner.

59
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,435
Well...

60
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,405
But do I deserve to?

61
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,007
Don't worry.

62
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:38,645
If you find someone honest,
I'm sure love can be nurtured.

63
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,080
You ought to.

64
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,582

66
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:53,593
What? Did something happen already?

67
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:56,296
No, it's not like that. But...

70
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,405
[Minori] Good afternoon.

71
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,841
- [customer 1] Hello.
- [Minori] Please come in.

72
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,577
Hello.

73
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,414
Oh, Mr. Taguchi. You've come again.

74
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,482
- Hello.
- Hello.

75
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:17,884
- May we?
- Sure. Go ahead.

76
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,952
Just some tea
before picking up my daughter.

77
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,521
Mr. Taguchi?

78
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,424
Your collar...

79
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:26,793
What?

80
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,396
- Oh, no.
- Your shirt still has a tag on it.

81
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,764
- Well...
- [customers laugh]

82
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,701
I didn't want to look sloppy
in front of Ms. Kume

83
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,003
but now I look like
I'm trying too hard, don't I?

84
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,304
- Embarrassing...
- Excuse me.

85
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,273
Thank you for being considerate. Wait!

86
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:41,507
Wait. Don't.

87
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,644
Can you be still for a moment?

88
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:52,051
Thank you very much.

89
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,422
Why don't you ask her out?

90
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,558
You're both single. It's all good.

91
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,827
Hey, don't make things awkward
for Mr. Taguchi.

92
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,995
Well, it's not awkward for me.

93
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,199
Mr. Taguchi, you should ask
for her contact number.

94
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,567
Well...

95
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,769
If you don't mind...

96
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,504
Oh, I might have a business card.

97
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,346
So, did you exchange contacts with him?

98
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,715
Yeah, I kind of went with the flow.

99
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,951
- Just went with it.
- That's good.

100
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,153
Sounds like an honest man to me.

101
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:28,955
Is he a divorcee, too?

102
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,726
You should give him a chance.

103
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:39,132
But you know,
Tsubasa's at a sensitive age.

104
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,234
[Tsubasa] I don't mind.

105
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,104
[Minori] Hi, Tsubasa.

106
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:48,174
Hi, Mom. The old lady
who lives in the back gave me this.

107
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,477
Thank you. I should go thank her.

108
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,647
Tsubasa, you look like you've grown
taller since I saw you last time.

109
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,516
- Really?
- [Sara] Yeah.

110
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,317
Nice seeing you.

111
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,286
See you.

112
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:09,629
He's growing up watching you work hard.

113
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,397
You've raised a good boy.

114
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,870
[Minori] I've kept a lid on romance.

115
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,175
But...

116
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,412
maybe it's okay to consider it.

117
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,382
- Everybody did a great presentation.
- Yeah.

118
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,350
It surprised me.

119
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,821
- They were good.
- Weren't they?

120
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,793
- [student] Goodbye, sir.
- [teacher] Goodbye.

121
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,367
- Don't run in the hallway.
- [students giggling]

122
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,635
[teacher] Goodbye.

123
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,406
[student 1] You don't have self-training

124
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,641
but it's three hours a day?

125
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:59,579
Does that mean
you have a training regimen?

126
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,716
- It depends on that day, but...
- [student 1] Yes.

127
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,291
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

128
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,132

Minori.

131
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:47,660
Wataru.

132
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,598
Why are you here?

133
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,736
I've been...

134
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,706
teaching here since September.

135
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,115
- [music fades]
- [Tsubasa] Mom.

136
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,186
[gasps]

137
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,624
[woman] Mr. Miyake? Do you have a minute?

SUZUHARACHO SHIONE
PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

139
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,233
- [man] You're not coming?
- I'm going to walk home.

140
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,769
- Walking?
- Yeah.

141
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,238
- Then I'll bring your bag home.
- Okay.

142
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,639
Sorry for the wait.

143
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,976
Minori. Do you know Mr. Miyake?

144
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,380
Do you know him, Haruna?

145
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,184
He's my daughter's homeroom teacher
since after the summer break.

146
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,521
I see.

147
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:50,756
[student] Tsubasa.

148
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,560
I'll see you.

149
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,828
See you again.

150
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,396
- It's hot, isn't it?
- Yeah.

151
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,699
Hello, Emiri.

152
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,933
Hello.

153
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:04,403
Please be good to my father.

154
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,906
- What?
- Let's walk home together, Tsubasa.

155
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:08,574
[Tsubasa] What?

156
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:14,680
Excuse my daughter.
She's kind of mature for her age.

157
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,948
No.

158
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,583
It's quite all right.

159
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,752
- Goodbye, then.
- Goodbye.

160

[indistinct whispering]

162
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:37,903
[Minori] I can't believe it.

163
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,608
How can a coincidence like this happen?

164
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,014
[breathes heavily]

165
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,922
[cell phone buzzing]

166
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:12,038
I'm still at school.
I'll call you back when I get home.

167
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,107
[Riko] You always say that,
but you never do.

168
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:18,210
Anyway, I still have work to do.
I'm hanging up now.

169
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,614
[Riko] When will you be home next?

170
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,482
I'll be back for summer break.

171
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,918
That far away?

172
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,489
[child] I want to play with you!

173
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,226
Sorry, Mom. I'll try to come home
as soon as possible.

174
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,132
[Riko] All right. I'll be waiting.

175
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,379
[Minori breathes heavily]

176
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,449
[Minori] These seven years

177
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,518
I tried to not remember.

178
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,855
About Yudai...

179
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,625
or about Wataru's family.

180
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:10,730
They should be

leading a different life now.

182
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:22,174
[man 1] Okay, let's eat.

183
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,443
It's lunch time.

184
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,378
Yes, it is.

185
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,382
[man 1] What are you doing after lunch?

186
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,017
What?

187
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,652
- Outside work?
- Yeah.

188
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,521
[indistinct whispering]

189
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,727
I don't think you have to.

190
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,796
[man 1] I think I do.

191
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,666
You can have some if you want.

192
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,870
No. It's all right, thanks.

193
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:54,707
Hey.

194
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,243
You replaced the photo. Nice.

195
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:00,579
I thought I could work harder
if I see my kid's face.

196
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:04,717
I'm sorry.

197
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:06,952
It's fine.

198
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,124
My son is about that age now.

199
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:18,764
You know what?

200
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,735
My parents are divorced, too.

201
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,904
When I was about that age

202
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,240
they let me see my dad
when I told them that I missed him.

203
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:29,975
What?

204
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,184
[Yudai] Tsubasa.

205
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:42,955
If only I could see them

206
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,858
one more time.

207

209
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,451
[Wataru] I can't believe
I could see her again.

210
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,888
[music ends]

211

[birds squawking]

212
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,310
Good afternoon.

213
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,763
[Wataru] It was such a surprise

214
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,099
to unexpectedly see you yesterday.

215
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,607
[Minori] Why did you come to this town?

216
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:12,778
[Wataru] I visited here
on a travel seminar

217
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,715
and I liked how it's surrounded by nature.

218
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,785
[Minori] Travel seminar?

219
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,755
Thanks to you

220
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:27,059
I was admitted to the Faculty
of Education at Keiho University.

221
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,731
[Minori] So I was the one responsible

222
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,702
for him choosing this town?

223
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:41,173
Then you fulfilled your dream.

224
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,214
Minori.

225
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:54,286
I am now twenty-five years old.

226
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,490
I'm not a child anymore
like I was back then.

227
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:03,796
[Minori] Stop.

228
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,367
Don't look at me in the same way
you did back then.

229
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:12,338
I see.

230
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,008
I've become an old lady at forty.

231
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,778
You have your whole life
ahead of you at twenty-five.

232
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,815
Work, hobbies, romance...

233
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:24,984
Enjoy to the fullest, okay?

234
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,689
Minori.

235
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:33,625
I...

236
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,329
I'm certain now that we have met again.

237
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:42,601
Minori, I'm certain that I...

238
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,470
- [door opens]
- [bell chimes]

239
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,040
Hello.

240
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,675
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.

241
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,143
Hello.

242
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,613
Hello, Mr. Miyake.

243
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:55,781
Hello.

244
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,417
Are you working on a substitute holiday?

245
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,452
- You're such a hard worker.
- No.

246
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:01,687
Not really.

247
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:03,856
Ms. Kume.

248
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,992
What's on the menu for lunch today?

249
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,696
- [Minori] It's beef stroganoff today.
- [Taguchi exclaims]

250
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,531
What? Is it because--

251
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:15,234
Yes. You've requested it in the past,
so I tried making it.

252
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,403
Thank you so much. I'm excited to try it.

253
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:18,904
Please take a seat.

254
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,708
[customer chuckling]

255
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:27,413
I have an hour till pick-up time.
Maybe I'll have dessert.

256
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:31,216
Mr. Miyake, you're quite popular
among the girls.

257
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,819
They're saying a new handsome teacher
has come from Tokyo!

258
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,421
I don't think that's true.

259
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,123
I bet your mother is beautiful.

260
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,393
[Wataru] Not really.

261
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,862
Do you have any siblings?

262
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:45,864
[pensive music playing]

263
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:51,703
I have one younger sister.

264
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,906
I'd love to see what she looks like.

265
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,107
Are you okay?

266
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:57,843
What?

267
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,711
You look pale.

268
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,284
It feels a bit chilly in here.

269
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,553
I'll go turn the air conditioner off.

270
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:11,657
[music ends]

271
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,532
[customer 1] Oh, she's super cute!

272
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,501
I totally agree!

273
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,403
Minori, come look!

274
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:25,704
Don't...

275
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:30,109
It's a photo of Mr. Miyake's
little sister.

276
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,877
[customer 2] She's so cute!

277
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:33,078
[Minori] Please stop.

278
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:35,948
I don't want to see it!

279
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,318
[indistinct whispering]

280
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,363
Look how cute she is!

281
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,435
[customer 2] See?

282
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:58,904
[Minori] I see.

283
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:00,472
[customer 1] What's her name?

284
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,510
- Reika.
- [customer 1] How do you write it?

285
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,412
Rei as in "beautiful,"
and Ka as in "fragrance."

286
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,515
It's perfect for her.

287
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,316
Don't you think so, Minori?

288
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:13,452
Yeah, it is.

289
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,622
[customer 1] She looks like a Reika.

290
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,960
[Minori] I didn't want to know...

291
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,697
about this child.

292
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,570
[crashes]

293
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,275
- Gosh.
- Minori.

294
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,812
Are you all right?
I think there is a dustpan outside.

295
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,080
[customer 2] Let's go get it.

296
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,619
[Minori] The daughter
of Yudai and that woman.

297
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,855
She's the same as me.

298
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:52,724
A child of adultery.

299
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,261
Tsubasa's half-sister.

300
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,167
[Taguchi] Are you okay?

301
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,137
Thank you.

302
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,139
Do you have bandages?

303
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,943
- In the first aid kit.
- I'll go get it.

304
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:32,531
Does it hurt?

305
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,268
- There.
- Thank you so much.

306
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:38,637
No problem.

Come here.

310
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,459
What's the matter?

311
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,462
I don't know how to do this.

312
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,266
- Self-study?

"Try researching something you like."

314
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:11,603
How about a diary?

315
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:14,940
There's nothing to write
since my brother is not here.

316
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,377
You're so attached
to your big brother, aren't you? [laughs]

317
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:22,981
You say you miss him all the time, too.

318
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:29,388
Oh, I got a great idea.

319
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:33,125
Let's do research
about the town he lives in.

320
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,361
You said you wanted to go there,
didn't you?

321
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,330
I think you want to go more than me, Mom.

322
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,833
But I want to meet him too, so I'll do it.

323
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,036
Okay then.

324
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,339

being considerate towards us.

I guess so.

362
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:34,973
Could you please not come here anymore?

363
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,143
What?

364
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,248
Have you noticed?

365
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,017
Just now

366
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:50,689
you called me "Minori"
in front of everyone.

367
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:54,693
I'm sorry.

368
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:58,597
It's a small town.

369
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,933
I don't want any rumors going around.

370
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,608
Please keep in mind.

371
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:15,046
From now on, we are
only a teacher and a parent.

372
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:19,217
Goodbye.

373
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:40,539
Are you really going on a date
with Mr. Taguchi?

374
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:44,142
That has nothing to do with you,
Mr. Miyake.

375
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:45,343
It does.

376
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:49,748
- Minori, I--
- Mr. Miyake.

377
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:54,152
My hope is...

378
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:58,990
to lead a new life here.

379
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:02,594
Right now...

380
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:07,566
I want to know more about Mr. Taguchi.

381
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,105

382
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:17,509
[Minori] Tsubasa.

383
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:19,778
Hi, Tsubasa.

384
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:25,150
Mr. Miyake.

385
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:29,754
I thought I forgot my umbrella here.

386
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:31,790
I was telling him it's not here.

387
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:33,925
I see.

388
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:40,198
I'm going home now.
I'll see you at school.

389
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:41,967
Take care.

390
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,108
[door opens]

391
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:53,612
[door closes]

392
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,319
- I'll make dinner right away.
- Okay.

393
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:30,915
WE ARE CLOSED TODAY

394
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:47,766
You're going on a date
with Emiri's father today, right?

395
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:51,469
- Why?
- Taguchi told me.

396
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:53,972
I see.

397
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,374
I've got soccer practice, so don't worry.

398
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,378
Okay.

399
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,114
I'm going now.

400
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:04,783
I'll see you later.

401
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:19,564
That's how he sent me off.

402
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,533
I'm glad.

403
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,636
My daughter, Emiri

404
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,206
is always telling me

405
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,442
to hurry up and find a new partner.

406
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,144
She's worried about me being alone.

407
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:37,015
Emiri is a kind girl, isn't she?

408
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,351
I think...

409
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:45,223
she wants somebody to talk to
about things she can't tell her dad.

410
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:49,627
She's a girl, after all.

411
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,396
I think I understand.

412
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,234
Well...

413
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,773
it might not be appropriate

414
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,209
to be telling you this already...

415
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,779
But it's been

416
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,216
six years since my divorce.

417
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,285
It was due to...

418
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:16,821
the usual reasons for divorce.

419
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,090
We had different values.

420
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,964
She neglected our child
and often went out drinking.

421
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:28,800
After a while, I couldn't deal with it.

422
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,705
I'm sorry to subject you to this.

423
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:36,040
No, it's all right.

424
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,480
Well...

425
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:47,886
I'm sorry

426
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,421
but I think...

427
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:56,327
I'm not suitable for you after all.

428
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,230
What?

429
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:04,369
I'm really grateful
for you treating me kindly.

430
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:06,671
Which is all the more...

431
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,344
Is it okay...

432
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,582
if I tell you all about myself?

433
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,624
I divorced my ex-husband...

434
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:33,097
because he had an affair...

435
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:35,633
[somber music playing]

436
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:39,504
and the woman became pregnant
with his child.

437
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,513
I'm sorry I made you recall
such a painful memory.

438
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,950
There's another reason.

439
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,688
So I decided...

440
00:30:58,489 --> 00:30:59,791
to take revenge...

441
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,094
on my ex-husband.

442
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,434
I wanted to punish him.

443
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,040
Why did you cheat on me?

444
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:20,378
I can cut ties with you
without any regrets.

445
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:23,848
How do you feel
losing your precious family?

446
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,195
I am actually...

447
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,866
a person with a very black heart.

448
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:47,071
That's why I'm not worthy
of someone like you.

449
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,242
I'm sorry.

450
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:54,879
Minori.

451
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:58,549
I see you were hurt a whole lot.

452
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,558
Someone with a truly black heart

453
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,663
wouldn't suffer like you.

454
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:15,066
You shouldn't...

455
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,503
be so hard on yourself anymore.

456
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,949
[Taguchi] Well...

457
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:33,584
There's something on my mind.

458
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:37,989
May I ask you one further question?

459
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,393
What is it?

460
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,965
What is your relationship...

461
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:49,867
with Mr. Miyake?

462
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:55,540
I'm sorry

463
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,844
you just didn't seem like
a teacher and a parent.

464
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:09,287
Seven years ago,
when I was still living in Tokyo

465
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,990
I was his tutor at a cram school.

466
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:15,593
You mean

467
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:19,530
when he was in high school?

468
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:23,468
Yes. We were both surprised
to have met again by chance.

469
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:28,873
To avoid misunderstandings,
I asked him to act like strangers.

470
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:32,543
I see.

471
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:38,216
Anyway...

472
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:42,453
thank you for telling me.

473
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:44,722

00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,859
Thank you for honestly telling me
about your past hardships.

480
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:27,298
It made me like you even more.

that makes you sad.

00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:45,783
Would you consider...

484
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:51,322
a serious relationship with me
with marriage in mind?

[customer 2] Isn't it?

487
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,531
I might let her take an art class.

00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:03,468
- Sounds good.
- Thank you for waiting.

Mr. Miyake is a regular now, isn't he?

492
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,416
By the way, how is it going
with Mr. Taguchi?

493
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,152
Did he confess his love yet?

494
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,590
Oh, he did.

495
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:26,891
And?

00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:28,759
Well...

497
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:32,430
I said I wanted to
think about it for a while.

498
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,236
I am thankful, though.

499
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:39,504
Yes!

500
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:40,738
Please.

501
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:42,740
[Minori] Sorry.

502
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,009
Don't you think they're a perfect couple?

503
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:47,745
What?

504
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:51,415
I don't know.

505
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:59,290
- [Minori] Thank you.
- Thank you for the meal.

Thanks. The café is closed now.

509
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:09,433
We're going home.

00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:12,136
Please come again.

511
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:13,871
- High-five.
- Bye-bye.

[Riko] Just like I thought.

522
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:23,541
That woman and Wataru were in contact.

After I was punished by her

But that woman...

526
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:47,632
She secretly got close to Wataru
without me knowing.

527
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,435
You'd better brace yourself.

528
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,708
[Minori] Why is she here?

529
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:04,048

I'll cut ties with you, Mom.

533

[Riko] I want you to do something for me.

[Wataru] Do you remember
the promise you made?

536
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,844
[Minori] I only did it to use you.

537

[Wataru] I can't help myself

538
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:37,548
from loving you, Minori.

539
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:41,619
[Minori] Is it my turn to be punished?
