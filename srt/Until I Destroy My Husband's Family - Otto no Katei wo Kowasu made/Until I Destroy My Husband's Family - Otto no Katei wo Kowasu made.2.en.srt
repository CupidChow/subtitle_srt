[foreboding music playing]

3
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,795
[foreboding music stops]

00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:30,497
[train rumbling]

5
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:32,165
- [game beeps]
- [female student] What's that?

6
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:34,801
[male student] Just a game.

7
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,037
- Is it fun?
- Mm.

8
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:38,805
Yes, I guess.

9
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:42,675
Should I try that, too?

10
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,210
Sure.

11
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:52,886
Ah. Hey, I forgot my English textbook.
Can I look with you?

12
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,288
Okay, I guess.

13
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,323
[chuckles] Yes!

14
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,126
Okay, listen up, everybody!

15
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:04,030
Mrs. Tachibana is on maternity leave.

16
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:07,634
So your new tutor is starting today.

17
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,670
Please come in.

18
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,075
[tense music playing]

19
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,495
I'm Minori Kume.

20
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,698
So nice to meet you.

21
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,269
[students clapping]

22
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:49,742
[Minori] Have you picked

23
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,445
your school yet?

24
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,114
What?

25
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:56,349
Gosh, I...

26
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:58,017
Not yet.

27
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:03,423
I had a hard time deciding on a college.

28
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,425
AIM STRAIGHT FOR SUCCESS!

29
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,527
I wasn't sure until the last minute.

30
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:14,300
In the end,
I got into the Faculty of Education

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,002
at Keiho University.

32
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,471
I see.

33
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:22,976
INTO A SUMMER WE CAN'T LOSE!
SHAPE YOUR OWN FUTURE!

34
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:26,479
If you want advice about your future,
I'm here for you.

35
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,415
Thank you.

36
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:35,455
- Ah.
- Yes?

37
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,204
It's not straight.

38
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,676
[soft music playing]

39
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,113
[Minori] My husband...

40
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,482
is having an affair.

41
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,554
He has...

42
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,356
another family.

43
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,494
His mistress

44
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:19,265
and a son she dotes on.

45
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:25,104
[soft music plays, stops abruptly]

46
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:30,743
[train rumbling]

47
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:44,424
[eerie music playing]

48
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,125
[Minori] Maybe the boy is...

49
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,762
my husband's.

50
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,537
[Minori] I have to find out...

51
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:02,709
the truth about you.

52
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,380
There.

53
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,349
You're good.

54
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,653
Nice to meet you.

55
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:16,756
Wataru Miyake.

56
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,393
[light music playing]

57
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:48,054
[light music continues playing]

58
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:16,416
UNTIL I DESTROYED
MY HUSBAND'S OTHER FAMILY

59
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,351
[grunts, mumbles]

60
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,322
- Hey, Tsubasa!
- Hm?

61
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:24,757
[Tsubasa] Mom?

62
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,660
[giggles]

63
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,697
- Tsubasa! I'm home!
- Mom!

64
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,265
[both chuckle]

65
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:33,733
Here, this is for you.

66
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,234
Yay! Pudding!

67
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,403
Minori, you're home!

68
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,872
I'm so sorry I'm late.

69
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:43,042
Not to worry.
We played with clay today, didn't we?

70
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:45,111
We did! Mom, look!

71
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:49,115
Grandma is so bad at it.
She made this weird cat.

72
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:52,185
Don't be so mean! Grandma did her best.

73
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,087
Mom, I want pudding!

74
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,255
Sure! Let me go wash my hands.

75
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,357
[Tsubasa] Okay.

76
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,693
So, how did it go at the cram school?

77
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,497
I had fun. The students were great.

78
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,132
That's great.

79
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,568
I'm glad you found a good job.

80
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:09,702
Thank you.

81
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:14,540
But what made you decide
to get a job suddenly?

82
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:17,043
Had a change of heart or something?

83
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,479
No money problems, right?

84
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,581
Yes.

85
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:25,451
Tsubasa doesn't need
as much attention now.

86
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,287
I feel ready to work outside.

87
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,058
But I feel bad for relying on you so much.

88
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:35,628
Don't worry about me.
But is Yudai okay with this?

89
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:37,663
I think so.

90
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:39,632
Yudai is...

91
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,735
As a cram school tutor?

92
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:44,504
Yes.

93
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,106
Tsubasa is getting older now.

94
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,075
Maybe I could start slow.

95
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,844
Like just two days a week.

96
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,748
Fine by me.
But what about when you're at work?

97
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,884
I asked your mom

98
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,288
to watch him for a few hours.

99
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,157
I see.

100
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,427
I guess that's all right.

101
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,061
[chuckles]

102
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,131
Yes.

103
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,933
Thank you.

104
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,136
[Minori] It wasn't a smile of kindness...

105
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,871
[faint voices whispering]

106
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,807
...but of indifference.

107
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:25,611
Yudai is totally supportive.

108
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,247
Okay. That's wonderful.

109
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:32,618
Whatever I can do to help, just tell me.

110
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:36,823
Thank you so much.

111
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,357
[chuckling]

112
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,428
[Minori] I could never tell
my mother-in-law.

113
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,198
This is...

114
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,534
our problem.

115
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,738
Look, Mom!

116
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:58,878
Mom?

117
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,849
[Minori] But what if...

118
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,185
Yudai is the father of that boy?

119
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,187
[faint voices whispering]

120
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,956
[Minori] Then, what about us?

121
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:13,759
[sighs]

122
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:20,399
[faint voices whispering]

123
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,915
I'll help you
with your studies from now on.

124
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:37,850
Let's work hard.

125
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,253
Yes, thank you.

126
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:46,926
You scored below average in English.

127
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,730
What part is the hardest for you?

128
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,633
I'm weak at listening.

129
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,936
- The final is next month, right?
- Yes.

130
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,140
So, let's work
on your listening skills together.

131
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:02,775
Okay.

132
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,510
Now...

133
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:11,050
why don't we set your goal
and your rewards?

134
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,386
- Rewards?
- Yes.

135
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:18,190
Set your score goal first,
and if you reach it, reward yourself.

136
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:19,792
Like what?

137
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,260
Mmm...

138
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,396
Let's see...

139
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,602
Hey, do you like Anko Panic, too?

140
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,003
What?

141
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,205
I've gotten into it recently.

142
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,475
- See?
- Uh...

143
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,911
You know Anko Panic?

144
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,348
You can play this online too, right?

145
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:46,485
Yes. Playing online lets you send
Anko Lights to each other!

146
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,355
Oh, really? Ah.

147
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:51,958
I've got an idea.

148
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,063
If you score more than 85%

149
00:09:57,163 --> 00:10:00,733
I'll send you ten Anko Lights.

150
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,936
- Seriously?
- If you hit the target score.

151
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,506
- I'll do my best.
- [chuckles]

152
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,679
[Minori] You bit quicker
than I thought, nice!

153
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:16,782
Actually...

154
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,719
I already know a bit about you.

155
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,520
By the way...

156
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,959
you must get along well with your mom.

157
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:31,597
Uh... we get along okay.

158
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,700
I heard your mom calls often.

159
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,736
She's worried about your grades.

160
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:38,604
Oh.

161
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,073
My mom is overprotective.

162
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,209
I tell her I'll be okay.

163
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,011
But she doesn't trust me.

164
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:49,048
[uneasy music playing]

165
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,051
What's she like?

166
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:54,453
What do you mean?

167
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,624
- Normal, I guess.
- Normal?

168
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,494
What do you mean by normal?

169
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,230
What?

170
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:06,132
Why?

171
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,373
To tell the truth...

172
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,577
I didn't have a dad.

173
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:22,748
I see.

174
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:25,885
If...

175
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:29,522
If I had a dad...

176
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,193
my life might have been different.

177
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,637
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't be talking about myself.

178
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,741
Why did I do that?

179
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:54,814
[chuckles softly] I guess I feel like
I could talk to you.

180
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,888
Well, then...

181
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,757
Let's set up a study plan.

182
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:07,426
Sure.

183
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:10,496
[Minori] From now on...

184
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,899
you can tell me everything

185
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,903
about your mom...

186
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,708
and your dad.

187
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,614
Mmm.

188
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,783
God, this is so good!

189
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,818
[chuckles]

190
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,019
You're exaggerating.

191
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:37,189
I guess your no-fuss cooking
is my favorite.

192
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,258
[giggles] Is that a compliment?

193
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:41,961
Of course it is.

194
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:46,265
Isn't your wife a good cook?

195
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:51,370
Her cooking is fancy,
but I don't feel like eating it every day.

196
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,139
You're so mean.

197
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,776
I would love to eat
your cooking every day.

198
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,445
- I'm flattered.
- [both chuckle]

199
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,616
Gosh, look what time it is.
You should head home soon.

200
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,952
We still have a lot of time.
She's clueless.

201
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,055
She doesn't suspect a thing.

202
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,259
Well, that's good then.

203
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,095
Where's Wataru?

204
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,798
- Did he eat?
- Yes.

205
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:22,601
[Riko] He's been holed up in his room
studying for finals.

206
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,738
[Yudai] Really? That's unusual.

207
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,941
[Riko] Right?
I wonder what's gotten into him.

208
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,778
Any parent should be happy

209
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:35,080
when a son is so studious.

210
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:36,649
[Riko chuckles]

211
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,831
[inaudible]

212
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,239
[sighs deeply]

213
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,742
[Sara] I can't believe it.

214
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,981
Tutoring the son
of your husband's mistress?

215
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:11,884
I realized.

216
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,688
- What?
- I...

217
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,091
Even if I expose the affair

218
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:22,328
and get compensation

219
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:24,797
I won't be satisfied.

220
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:29,368
I want him to truly pay for his sins.

221
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,073
Mm.

222
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:40,112
Yes, of course. I get how you feel.

223
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,549
I'll do anything I can to help.

224
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:47,386
It's just...

225
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,992
Minori, you're really okay
with this, right?

226
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:54,927
What do you mean?

227
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,730
You know...

228
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,667
I've been watching you two
since high school.

229
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,803
When you started dating Yudai

230
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,673
it seemed like you really lit up.

231
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,677
Seeing your smile at the wedding

232
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:15,147
I thought, "Gosh, fate is real."

233
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:25,057
What Yudai did was awful.
No doubt about it.

234
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,728
I was so mad when I heard

235
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,830
and probably said too much to you.

236
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,901
But maybe...

237
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:38,604
you should think again.

238
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:43,909
Have a real talk.

239
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:48,047
Say what you feel,
everything you've held back.

240
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:49,882
[gasps]

241
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,219
This is not just for your sake.

242
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:56,889
You've got Tsubasa.

243
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,999
[gloomy music playing]

244
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,834
[Minori] Could talking with him

245
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,236
really make a difference?

246
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:13,906
[Yudai] These shoes.

247
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,675
The laces keep coming undone.

248
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,244
Do they?

249
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:21,613
[Minori] Then...

250
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:26,285
what do I even want with this man?

251
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:30,456
How do I want him to pay
for what he's done?

252
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,893
What kind of look do I want to see on him?

253
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,897
[Yudai] I got it!

254
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,602
Thank you. I'll see you later.

255
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,605
[Sara] You've got Tsubasa.

256
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,675
Yudai!

257
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:51,076
Hm?

258
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,614
I need to talk to you

259
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,916
later today.

260
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:00,819
Can you come home early?

261
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,623
What is it? Something serious?

262
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:06,792
I'll tell you later.

263
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,295
All right. I'll try to come home early.

264
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,731
- Okay.
- See you.

265
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:13,832
[Minori] Bye.

266
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:19,838
Can I...

267
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:22,975
ever love

268
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,546
this smile again?

269
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:32,317
[indistinct chatter]

270
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,419
Oh.

271
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,320
The exam is over,
and you're still studying?

272
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,356
Well, we are seniors.

273
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:38,857
How was the test?

274
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:40,859
It was okay.

275
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,228
Ms. Kume told you to study?

276
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,764
What are you talking about?

277
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:50,369
You seem a bit different since she came.

278
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,171
Not really.

279
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,908
She just said it'd be bad
if I don't study harder.

280
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:57,776
Hmm.

281
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,580
Hey, do you think Ms. Kume is married?

282
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,450
I don't know.

283
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:08,654
She's so pretty, she must be married.

284
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,990
- I want to be like her.
- I don't care.

285
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,994
Good luck to both of us!

286
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:22,734
ENGLISH EXAM, 92 OUT OF 100

287
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,203
This is awesome!

288
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,572
You went up 30 points!

289
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,207
Yes.

290
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,642
Congratulations.

291
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:32,845
Thank you.

292
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,980
Now I need to give you the rewards.

293
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:40,419
So, if you're up for it,
let's play online together.

294
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,288
Sure.

295
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,625
But don't tell anyone else.

296
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:49,962
Okay.

297
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,734
[Wataru] So...

298
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,804
can I have your account name?

299
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,474
Sure.

300
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:08,680
[Minori] The Yudai I loved back then

301
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,950
had a smile like this.

302
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,787
Innocent and completely untainted.

303
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:16,989
[phone buzzing]

304
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,124
- Uh...
- [phone buzzing]

305
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:20,893
You can take it.

306
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:23,362
Excuse me.

307
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,900
[Wataru] Uh, hello?

308
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,736
Yes, what's up?

309
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,606
Wow, I heard your grades jumped!

310
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:35,774
Congratulations!

311
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,576
Thank you.

312
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,479
Did Mom tell you?

313
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:42,915
[Yudai] That's right.

314
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,218
Let's celebrate when we meet next.
I made a reservation.

315
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,687
[Wataru] Wait, you reserved
a place already?

316
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:51,256
That's a bit much!

317
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,558
[faint voices whispering]

318
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,259
[Wataru] I'm at cram school.
I've got to go.

319
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,663
[faint voices whispering]

320
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:01,300
- I'm sorry about that.
- Your dad?

321
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:04,836
What?

322
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:06,838
Who was it from?

323
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:10,676
Your dad?

324
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:15,180
[Minori] Please. Tell me the truth.

325
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,350
Your dad.

326
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:20,485
Who is your dad?

327
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:22,154
Uh...

328
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,658
[Minori] These 17 years
Yudai and I spent together.

329
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,061
And you?

330
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,396
What's your life been like?

331
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,166
He is...

332
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,803
[tense music playing]

333
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:40,539
...not my dad.

334
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,709
He's someone I've known

335
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,778
for a long time, like a dad.

336
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,881
Not a real dad?

337
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,018
My dad...

338
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,722
left before I was born.

339
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:00,759
My mom never told me

340
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,462
anything about him.

341
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:09,067
[children laughing]

342
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:10,869
[Yudai] Wataru!

343
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,805
Hey, there!

344
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:19,444
Wataru, this is my friend.

345
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:23,081
Can I make a castle with you and your mom?

346
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:27,185
- Sure.
- Great! Let's make a huge castle!

347
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:29,888
How huge?

348
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,157
Let me see.

349
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:36,528
So big that the three of us can fit in.

350
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,264
- Mm.
- Mm. Let's make it.

351
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,768
[Wataru] After hanging out a few times

352
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:46,738
I realized he was my mom's boyfriend.

353
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,542
When she was busy with work

354
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,780
he acted like a dad and played with me.

355
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:57,316
So I wasn't lonely.

356
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,689
He was always...

357
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,292
taking care of me.

358
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,729
[Minori] Not a real dad.

359
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,266
Then why did he...

360
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:18,737
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to talk so much.

361
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:27,913
Thank you for telling me.

362
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:30,982
By the way

363
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,019
why do you think...

364
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,791
Why does he

365
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:43,729
never marry your mom?

366
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:50,736
Well...

367
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,105
- [running footsteps]
- [door opens]

368
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,806
Excuse me!

369
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:58,477
Miyake, the hospital just called.

370
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,445
Your mom has collapsed.

00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,117
[door opens]

372
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:06,618
Wataru?

373
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,055
[breathing heavily]

374
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,557
Ms. Kume?

375
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,594
Did something happen to Wataru?

376
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,663
Seems like it's a family issue.

377
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:20,999
I see.

378
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,736
[Minori] Yudai is not...

379
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:26,938
Wataru Miyake's dad.

380
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:30,375
[tense music playing]

381
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:31,977
[Minori] But...

382
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,980
if that woman has collapsed

383
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:37,749
what will he do?

384
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:39,951
[woman 1] Isn't she pretty?

385
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:43,755
[woman 2] I think she's married.

386
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,891
What? Why?

387
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:50,195
Come on, the "marriage"
and "children" sections are blank.

388
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:51,696
- Mm.
- If she were single

389
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,565
she'd have filled them in honestly.

390
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:55,667
She's here for an affair.

391
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:58,370
Right, boss?

392
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:03,675
What? Oh, I've never done that,
so I have no idea.

393
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,878
Boss, you'd totally be popular
on a dating app.

394
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:09,114
- No, that's basically cheating.
- Gosh, right.

395
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,317
Never do that, Chief.

396
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:16,521
- Of course I wouldn't!
- Of course not!

397
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:17,622
Mm.

398
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:19,257
Or maybe you should.

399
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,094
- What?
- Ms. Matsuzaki?

400
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:27,299
What? Ms. Matsuzaki,
are you okay with affairs?

401
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,502
Well, if the person you fall for

402
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,338
happens to be married, it can't be helped.

403
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:36,975
[woman 1] Gosh, modern kids these days.

404
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:40,812
Chief, say something

405
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:42,647
as a model-loving husband!

406
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:44,950
- [chuckles] Well...
- [phone buzzing]

407
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,385
[buzzing]

408
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,120
- Uh...
- [phone buzzing]

409
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,455
You have to excuse me.

410
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:53,859
[phone buzzing]

411
00:24:58,129 --> 00:24:59,164
[phone buzzes]

412
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:03,201
I'M SORRY, TROUBLE AT WORK.
DON'T NEED DINNER.

413
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:11,243
[gloomy music playing]

414
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,078
[Minori] Before I knew it, I was running.

415
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,681
Even though I might see...

416
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,218
something I wish I didn't.

417
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:24,656
Mom!

418
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:26,358
Wataru!

419
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:29,427
You collapsed? What happened?
Are you okay?

420
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:34,099
[sighs] I'm so sorry.
I scared everyone at work.

421
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,434
You are not strong.

422
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:38,103
Don't push yourself.

423
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:40,238
Thank you.

424
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:42,774
But I'm okay now.

425
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,084
[Riko] And your cram school?

426
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:54,853
[Wataru] I finished.

427
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,621
[Riko] I see.

428
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:01,159
I'm sorry for worrying you
when you need to be studying hard.

429
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:02,727
[Wataru] It's okay.

430
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:06,097
I'm just happy

431
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:10,502
that you seem motivated
for exam prep. [chuckles]

432
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,238
What?

433
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,641
I wanted you to study

434
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:20,078
get into a college you like,
and learn all kinds of things.

435
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:22,781
So I'm happy now.

436
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:24,549
- Mom.
- [Riko chuckles]

437
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:29,988
[Minori] That woman has a son, too.

438
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:35,226
A son more precious than her life.

439
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,913
[elevator bell rings]

440
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:01,686
[footsteps echo]

[gloomy music playing]

442
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:25,243
Riko!

443
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,681
[Riko] Yudai.

444
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:31,516
I'm sorry I made you leave work.

445
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:35,420
[Yudai] Don't worry about it.
Your health is more important.

446
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:39,524
[Riko] I'm sorry.
I suddenly felt sick and panicked.

447
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:43,628
[Yudai] It's okay.
So, what did the doctor say?

448
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:46,264
[Riko] Yes.

449
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,134
Well...

450
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:53,138
[phone buzzing]

451
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:00,412
Hello?

452
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:03,048
[male teacher] Hello? Ms. Kume?

453
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:07,252
Where are the graded quizzes
from the other day?

454
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,787
I need them quickly.

455
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,490
They're on my desk.

456
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:17,996
Gosh, I'm sorry. I took the key with me.

457
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,698
I'll bring it back now.

458
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,803
[gloomy music playing]

459
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:42,287
[Minori] Are you still with that woman?

460
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:47,058
Do you remember our promise?

461
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:50,495
When you get home...

462
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,298
what excuses will you make?

463
00:28:57,535 --> 00:29:00,438
[clock ticking]

464
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:07,712
[Minori] Do you care more
about that woman's child...

465
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,950
who isn't related to you

466
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:16,121
than our child, your own flesh and blood?

467
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,360
I'm sorry, Tsubasa.

468
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:26,297
I'm so sorry.

469
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,506

[door opens]

471
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,581
[Yudai] I'm home.

[door closes]

473
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:49,788
[Yudai] Gosh, I'm exhausted.

474
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:52,190
What are you doing in the dark?

475
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:01,166
[Minori] I said I wanted to talk tonight.

476
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:05,436
I'm sorry. I really couldn't get away.

477
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,705
[clattering]

478
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,675
[Yudai] I'll make time again next time.

479
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:15,780
[Minori] Next time? When?

480
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:21,519
[Yudai] Like, on my next day off.

481
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,858
[Minori] When?

482
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:30,995
[Yudai] I said I'm sorry. Don't be so mad.

483
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:32,764
I did text you, right?

484
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:36,067
[Minori] You did, but...

485
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:40,271
you promised.

486
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,143
[Yudai] Come on, give me a break.

487
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:48,079
It was work.

488
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,017
[chuckles]

489
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,288
It wasn't work.

490
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:00,558
What?

491
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:05,763
It wasn't work, was it?

492
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:08,333
What do you mean?

493
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:11,703
I know.

494
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,371
Know what?

495
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:41,833
[snipping]

496
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:51,209
Where were you today?

497
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:52,710
Huh?

498
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:54,512
What are you talking about?

499
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,682
You chose that woman...

500
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:00,184
[faint voices whispering]

501
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,387
...over talking with me.

502
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,756
What? What woman?

503
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:07,926
Finally, I get it.

504
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:16,067
I mean nothing to you. Nothing!

505
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:18,303
What are you saying, Minori? That's crazy!

506
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,837
Liar.

507
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:27,478
For 17 years, you've been lying to me

508
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:29,314
with a straight face.

509
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,650
[sighs] Liar.

510
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:38,356
- Liar! [grunts]
- [thumps]

511
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:39,958

[ominous music stops]

515
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:01,012
What did you say?

516
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,883
[clock ticking]

517
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:12,757
Nothing.

518
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:19,630
I'm really sorry.
I promise I'll make time.

519
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,169
Minori?

520
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:27,338
Are you okay?

521
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:32,677
I understand.

522
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,982
[Yudai] I'm going to take a shower.

523
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:45,523
[door opens]

524
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,291
[Minori] Perhaps...

525
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:52,130
we are already too broken...

526
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,201
to fix.

527

[upbeat music playing]

528
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,548
[Minori] My happy home
has been shattered...

529
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:14,819
by you.

530
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,790
Hey, you're playing Anko Panic again!

531
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,393
I downloaded it.

532
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:25,930
Tell me your account, Wataru.

533
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:28,866
I'm sorry, I don't really make
friends online.

534
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,469
I see. Too bad.

535
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:35,540
Hey, how do you level up in this?

536
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,110
I'm sorry.

537
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:43,047
Ms. Kume.

538
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:49,587
Miyake.

539
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,057
I hope your mom was all right.

540
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,660
She's fine. I'm sorry about the meeting.

541
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,931
No problem. I'm glad you were able
to get there right away.

542
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,732
Thank you for your concern.

543
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:03,868
Look...

544
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:06,737
I'd like your advice on something.

545
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,507
Do you have time later?

546
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:11,909
Sure.

547
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:14,579
Absolutely.

548
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,451
[Minori] What is it?

549
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:25,289
There's a university I want to aim for.

550
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:28,426
I see.

551
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,495
Which one?

552
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,798
Keiho University, Faculty of Education.

553
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:37,468
Gosh, that's...

554
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:40,838
I want to be like you.

555
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:49,180
I mean, I've always been interested
in teaching.

556
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:55,553
I feel it can really have
a big impact on someone's life.

557
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:00,124
So I...

558
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,160
I'll do my best.

559
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:05,963
Okay.

560
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,232
I think that's great.

561
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:12,403
What did you do before you came here?

562
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,672
I used to work

563
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,909
as a university staff member.

564
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:20,478
Why did you quit?

565
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:24,248
WANTS TO BECOME A TEACHER.

566
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,751
Well...

567
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:39,830
because I got married.

568
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:43,234
What?

569
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:47,538
[gloomy music playing]

570
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:49,907
You are...

571
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,411
married?

572
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,648
[Minori] I know...

573
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:02,420
that you have feelings for me.

574
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,392
Were you shocked that I'm married?

575
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:11,429
No.

576
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:14,832
I...

577
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:18,369
[Minori] I know it's not your fault.

578
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:20,905
But...

579
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,574
I have to do this.

580
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,810
Just kidding.

581
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:28,079
I'm kidding!

582
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:29,914
What?

583
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:31,916
But...

584
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,685
why did you suddenly decide?

585
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,588
Are you worried about your mom?

586
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:39,657
No.

587
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:41,726
Actually...

588
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:48,199
[gloomy music playing]

589
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:55,973
[chuckles]

590
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:58,509
I...

591
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:00,911
I'm going to be a big brother.

592
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,997
A baby is coming next year.

593
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:25,736
What?

594
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:29,640
She's pregnant with Yudai's baby.

595
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:32,476
You tend to tune out
everything around you.

596
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:33,778
Yudai.

597
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,713
[Minori] Maybe I'll get a haircut.

598
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,249
[Wataru] I thought you were in despair.

599
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:39,350
[Minori] I am.

600
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,585
Your hair really looks good.
