[clock ticking]

4
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:25,225
I'm sorry I fell asleep, Hiromi.

5
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,327
It's okay. You can lie down.

6
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:31,031
- I can help.
- You don't have to.

7
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,301
- [Minori] Tsubasa?
- [Hiromi] He's fast asleep.

00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:45,678
Minori? Did you lose a little weight?

10
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,283
Are you eating properly?

11
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:53,887
Um... I don't have much of an appetite.

12
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,723
You have to eat something
even if you don't have an appetite.

13
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:57,924
Wait a second.

14
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:05,532
[Hiromi] There you go. Eat.

15
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:07,667
Thank you very much.

[retches]

17
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:19,279
- Minori. Here.
- [Minori coughing]

18
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,481
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,584
Are you...

20
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,154
pregnant, by any chance?

21
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,259
[soft music playing]

22
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,394
I'm going to be...

23
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:36,663
a big brother.

24
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:39,365
What?

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,734
Actually...

26
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:45,572
a baby is coming next year.

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,174
[Minori] I was hoping

28
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:52,645
that it was just a bad joke.

29
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,822
But now

30
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:05,058
I know...

31
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,362
the stone-cold fact.

32
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,371
I bet Yudai would be thrilled.
Why don't you see a gynecologist?

33
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,877
I don't think I am.

34
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:25,945
[Minori] Mrs. Kisaragi--

35
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:27,881
I'm certain.

36
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:31,518
The one who is pregnant
with your son's child...

37
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,420
is not me.

38
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,124
It's this woman.

00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:41,861

00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,502
[Minori] I despise my husband so much
I want to exact revenge...

44
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,372
but I couldn't help

45
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,042
being a little hopeful.

46
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,248
It's because I've been wanting
a second child for a long time.

[somber humming]

48
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,191
Why do I have to make

49
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,962
a meal for that man on a day like this?

00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,902

00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,507
I'll hold it for you.

53
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,276
Wataru?

54
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:43,750
What a coincidence to be seeing you here.

55
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,453
No, it's not a coincidence.

56
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:54,260
Wait, were you waiting for me?

57
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:59,499
I heard you live around here,
so I thought maybe I'd see you.

58
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,974
I was worried.
Why are you absent from cram school?

59
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,177
I'm sorry. I was feeling
under the weather.

60
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,147
You seem a little thinner.

61
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:16,649
Yeah, a little.

62
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,721
- Are you okay now?
- Yeah, I'm much better.

63
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,827
Was it my fault?

64
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,266
Why do you think that?

65
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:36,736
The other day, when I asked you for advice

66
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,639
you were acting a bit weird.

67
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,345
A baby is coming next year.

68
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:47,647
What?

69
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,219
You're overthinking it.

70
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,956
I'd just gotten back to work
after a long time, so it wore me out.

71
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,126
Then I'm relieved.

72
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,169
How is your mom feeling?

73
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:13,206
She's calmed down now.

74
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,340
Oh.

75
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,676
- That's good.
- Yes.

76
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,344
And...

77
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,383
that man who's your father figure...

78
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:29,088
[Minori] How does Yudai feel
about having another child?

79
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,491
Was he excited?

80
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,928
Yes. He was very excited,
more than I expected.

81
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:39,232
He says he can't wait to meet the baby.

82
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,269
Aren't they getting married?

83
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,439
The man who's your father figure

84
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,441
and your mom?

85
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,077
Uh...

86
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,247
Since a baby is coming

87
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,784
I heard he's talking about
getting married eventually.

88
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,455
[Wataru] Ms. Kume?

89
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,566
Sorry, Wataru.

90
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,335
I have to go home to make dinner now.

91
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,271
See you at cram school.

92
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:29,649
[Minori singing] If you ever cheat on me

93
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:35,988
Be careful when eating at home

94
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,858
I'll be wise

95
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:43,396
I'll be creative

96
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:48,801
I'll make soup with poison in it
And we'll have it

97
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:52,071
Together

98
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:55,975
The room, the dress shirt, and me

99
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,978
For you, my love

100
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:03,683
I want to polish every day

00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:04,817
[door opens]

102
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:06,719
[Yudai] I'm home.

103
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,821
[door closes]

104
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,092
I heard you weren't
feeling well yesterday.

105
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,094
My mom told me.

106
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,630
Oh. Mm-hmm.

107
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,298
Are you okay now?

108
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:23,135
Yeah. I'm fine now.

109
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,504
That's good.

110
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,106
[indistinct television chatter]

111
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,441
[Minori] Is that it?

112
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,745
You rushed to the hospital
to visit that woman.

113
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,114
But for me

114
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,383
just one word?

115
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,685
[Yudai, lovingly] Tsubasa.

116
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,756
Looks like he's asleep.

117
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:50,062
Oh, are you making pasta today?

118
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,664
Yeah.

119
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,200
Can you guess what kind of pasta?

120
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,002
What kind of pasta...

121
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,204
Huh? Isn't this tomato sauce?

122
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,541
Have you heard of desperation pasta?

123
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,177
What's that? Desperation pasta?

124
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:09,282
A dish that tastes good
even when you feel desperate.

125
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,417
Huh?

126
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,987
That's where the name
comes from supposedly.

127
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,423
In Italy

128
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:21,627
that's what they call a pasta dish
made with leftovers in the fridge.

129
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,163
You startled me for a second.

130
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,632
I thought something had happened
that made you feel des--

131
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,867
There was.

132
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:29,902
Huh?

133
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,172
An affair.

134
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:35,875
[Yudai] What?

135
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,111
There was an affair.

136
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,519
By my friend's husband.

137
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:50,756
Really?

138
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:53,826
My friend said

139
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:58,064
she and her husband were
getting along so well until one day

140
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:02,802
she found out that her husband
was having an affair.

141
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:05,404
What do you think?

142
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,541
That...

143
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,179
is just terrible.

144
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:15,615
Isn't it?

145
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,452
That's why I was feeling desperate.

146
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:24,557
It's sweet how much
you care about your friend.

147
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:27,226
[Minori] That's right.

148
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:29,729
I had forgotten.

149
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,934
You're very good at telling lies.

150
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,671
You can do it
just as naturally as breathing.

151
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:42,875
Then...

152
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:45,945
I should do it, too.

153
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,384
[Minori] Thanks for helping me
with my situation.

154
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:56,589
No problem. I'll always be here for you.

155
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,731
- Hey.
- Hmm?

156
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,468
- Are you okay?
- Huh?

157
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:11,937
Are you getting enough sleep?

158
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,775
I'm okay.

159
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,844
I'm glad to hear that.

160
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:24,116
[Sara] You tend to have a one-track mind
when you focus on something.

161
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,086
Ah, well...

162
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,655
Maybe that's true. I know.

163
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,761
But hear me out.

164
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,632
I can't be satisfied
by just divorcing him.

165
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:43,769
Because that's exactly
what they want, isn't it?

166
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:47,606
I just know it.

167
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,309
Yudai intends to start
a new family with them.

168
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:56,248
She's pregnant! That woman
is having Yudai's baby!

169
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,652
Wait, are you sure?

170
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:01,654
Yeah, I already checked.

171
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,027
He's really the worst.

172
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,764
I didn't think it was this bad.

173
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,068
That's why...

174
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:21,474
I'm absolutely not letting them be happy.

175
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:26,579
- Kusunoki.
- Yes?

176
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,515
Would you share the minutes you took
for the meeting later?

177
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:30,649
Got it.

178
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:35,488
Chief, did you eat garlic yesterday?

179
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,658
Huh? Oh, there was garlic
in the pasta I ate yesterday.

180
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,893
Huh? You can smell it?

181
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,095
Yes. It smells pretty strong.

182
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:44,797
Seriously?

183
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,465
[quirky music playing]

184
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:49,835
[colleague] Chief.

185
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:53,806
Your wife might
be marking you with a scent.

186
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,941
Huh? What does that mean?

187
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,409
She might be

188
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,547
marking you so that other women
wouldn't come near you.

189
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,183
[Kusunoki] Whoa. That's a scary tactic.

190
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:07,386
Another thing I would do
is to pretend that my friend

191
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,955
was the one having doubts

192
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,892
and vent my own frustrations.

193
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:16,495
What?

194
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:19,331
- What's wrong, Chief?
- Uh, nothing.

195
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,803
Kusunoki, I have to go
to a client's office now.

196
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,871
- I'll leave it to you today.
- What?

197
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,039
[Kusunoki] Just me?

198
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,811
[clock ticking]

199
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,315
[door opens]

200
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,150
[Yudai] I'm home.

201
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:42,988
What happened?

202
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,792
It's rare that you come home this early.

203
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,360
Huh? Is it?

204
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,063
Well, my work is not that busy recently.

205
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:52,998
I see.

206
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:58,204
Oh, sorry. I haven't started
making dinner yet.

207
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,472
Minori.

208
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,310
I can come home early tomorrow, too.

209
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:08,581
Do you want the three of us
to go out together as a family?

210
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,087
Sorry.

211
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:19,925
I'm going to be working late tomorrow.

212
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,896
There's an important practice test
at the cram school.

213
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,899
I see.

214
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,135
Don't work too hard.

215
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:33,639
Mm-hmm.

216
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,008
Thanks.

217
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,812
[Minori] You probably think
I don't know anything

218
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,184
and that I'm just a meek wife.

219
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,721
If so...

220
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,424
you're underestimating me.

221
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,093
Yudai.

222
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,728
Hmm?

223
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,130
Can you go take a shower?

224
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,533
Hmm? Okay.

225
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:09,708
Oh.

226
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,145
- Yudai.
- Hmm?

227
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,615
I'm thinking about cutting
my hair. What do you think?

228
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,050
Sounds good to me.

229
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,725
[Minori] Just remember...

230
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,828
more than you could ever imagine

231
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:31,964
the real me is bold...

232
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,634
and has the ability

233
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,337
to take action.

234
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,639
I think it turned out really cute.

235
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,942
Manager, a new customer has arrived.

236
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,010
Excuse me.

237
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,581
[ethereal humming]

238
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:57,056
Hello. Thank you for coming.

239
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:01,493
I apologize for popping in
without a reservation.

240
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:03,462
[Minori] Yudai.

241
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:05,864
Are you...

242
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,400
ready for this?

243
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,103
I'm about to

244
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,673
ask this woman about the truth.

245
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,847
[manager] What can I do for you today?

246
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,084
I want to...

247
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:27,619
chop a lot of it off.

248
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,124
Recently, I felt like
it's getting in the way.

249
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,293
Certainly.

250
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:36,295
Excuse me.

251
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,035
How about this length?

252
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:46,171
People will think I got dumped

253
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,440
won't they?

254
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,109
Huh?

255
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:55,147
Didn't your friends think you had
a broken heart if you cut your hair?

256
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,449
[laughs]

257
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:00,386
- Yes, they used to say that.
- Well...

258
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:03,856
I can understand the feeling
of wanting to cut your hair

259
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,491
when heartbroken. Can't you?

260
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,793
Yes, I can.

261
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,797
Okay, let's start with a shampoo.

262
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:14,867
This way, please.

263
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,303
Have you had your hair at that length
for a long time?

264
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:23,876
- Um, yes.
- My hair used to be much longer.

265
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,578
I let it grow for my wedding day.

266
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,649
I see. A lot of people
grow their hair long

267
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,351
for their wedding ceremony.

268
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,789
I thought so.

269
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,958
Okay. Let's move to the shampoo basin.

270
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,227
[Minori] I see...

271
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,404
[manager] How long has it been
since you last cut it?

272
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,607
I had it cut three months ago.

273
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,477
Oh, then it's been a while.

274
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,578
But...

275
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,614
my husband gets a haircut
every other week.

276
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:05,484
Huh?

277
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,152
Huh?

278
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,922
Are you okay?

279
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,725
[exhales sharply] Oh, I'm sorry.

280
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,997
Men have short hair

281
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,867
so their hair grows out faster,
doesn't it?

282
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,037
It seems so.

283
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,147
[Minori] So pretty.

284
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,350
Huh?

285
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,552
That necklace.

286
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,689
Oh, this? Thank you.

287
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,823
By any chance

288
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:48,026
is it from Tsukishiro Jewelry?

289
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:52,764
Is it a present from someone?

290
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,336
It's a present from my son.

291
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:01,974
Oh, you have a son.

292
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,343
How old is he?

293
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,778
He's 18 years old.

294
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:10,949
You don't look like
you could have a son that age.

295
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,684
Really?

296
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,058
Ta-da.

297
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,695
[Minori] I have one, too.

298
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,565
[foreboding music playing]

299
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,901
A present from my husband.

300
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:36,041
He bought it for me just recently.

301
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:42,281
I see. Just recently?

302
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,349
That's very nice.

303
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:45,884
Yes.

304
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:47,085
[both laugh]

305
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,860
I'm sorry. Will you
excuse me for a moment?

306
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:56,528
Sure.

307
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,568
[foreboding music continues]

308
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,174
[Riko] Why is she here?
Is this a coincidence?

309
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,644
We weren't caught for over ten years.

310
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:14,880
And at a time like this?

311
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,686
[music ends]

312
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,187
Are you okay?

313
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,388
Uh...

314
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:27,392
You looked pale, so I was worried.

315
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,461
[nervous chuckle]

316
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,598
Could it be...

317
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,200
morning sickness?

318
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,005
I've had that experience, too.

319
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:43,842
Please take care of yourself.

320
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:49,881
Um, I'll be right back,
so please wait at your seat.

321
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:52,351
Okay.

322
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,797
I'm sorry for the interruption.

323
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,166
I'm ready to cut your hair.

324
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,476
[Minori] Are you really all right?

325
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,778
- What?
- I understand.

326
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:21,513
I had bad morning sickness, too.

327
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:23,982
No, I don't have--

328
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:27,185
It's important to have
the full support of your partner.

329
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:32,824
I think I was able to
get through my pregnancy

330
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:34,793
thanks to the support from my husband.

331
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,264
I see.

332
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,635
You have a thoughtful husband.

333
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:48,640
Yes. Even after I gave birth,
he's very attached to his kid.

334
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,547
I'm a single parent,
so it's been a struggle.

335
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,116
Oh, you're a single mom?

336
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:00,552
It must have been hard
taking care of a kid on your own.

337
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,855
Huh?

338
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,695
Does that mean the baby
in your belly right now...

339
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,798
is your second child?

340
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,336
If you're pregnant now

341
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,373
that means you have a partner, right?

342
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:26,611
But when my son was little,
my partner supported me.

343
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,714
He helped me a lot.

344
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,584
My son grew up properly thanks to him.

345
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,457
Sons are so cute, aren't they?

346
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:41,460
I have a son, too.

347
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,862
My son is in high school.

348
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,297
Aren't you worried?

349
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,332
- What?
- You know

350
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:51,636
high school boys
are very much interested in girls.

351
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:55,507
My son doesn't seem
to be interested at all.

352
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:58,276
You never know with those types.

353
00:22:58,877 --> 00:22:59,878
Excuse me?

354
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,546
I guess...

355
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:06,218
when they're that age,
they're not dependent on their parents.

356
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,221
That's not true.

357
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,891
Oh.

358
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:15,961
I'm sorry.

359
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,164
No, it's okay.

360
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,436
Why aren't you married?

361
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:27,806
What?

362
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:29,875
To your partner...

363
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,345
who's supportive.

364
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,215
Why aren't you married to him?

365
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,319
Don't you think...

366
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,924
having a partner beside you

367
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:49,394
is the most comforting?

368
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:53,832
Well, I...

369
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,337
[employee]
Manager, a customer is on the phone.

370
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:04,776
I'm sorry. Excuse me for a moment.

371
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,185
Thank you so much...

372
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,054
for making me pretty.

373
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:18,957
[soft music playing]

374
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:29,868
[breathes heavily]

375
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,144
[Hiromi] Everything is delicious.

376
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:40,378
[chuckles]

377
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:44,249
[Tsubasa] Mommy, your hair looks cute.

378
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,151
Thank you.

379
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:49,921
- Isn't it cute, Daddy?
- Yeah. It looks good on Mommy.

380
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:53,725
But why did you cut it so short
all of a sudden?

381
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,293
Hmm?

382
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,462
It kind of felt like it was in the way.

383
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:01,433
Short hair is easier for girls, I guess.

384
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:02,601
[Tsubasa] Yeah.

385
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:05,070
Well, I felt like
I didn't need it anymore.

386
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,438
What?

387
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:09,374
So on impulse, I chopped it off.

388
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:11,376
[Tsubasa] Chopped it off!

389
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:16,314
We have almond tofu for dessert.

390
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:18,783
[Minori] Thank you so much.

391
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:21,753
Your cooking has improved again, Minori.

392
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,389
Thanks to you,
because you always teach me.

393
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:27,492
It's not me. You need talent
to be good at cooking.

394
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:29,160
You're naturally good at it.

395
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:33,265
Tsubasa. She said
I have a talent for cooking.

396
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,799
[Hiromi] Wasn't it good?

397
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,468
[all chuckling]

398
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:40,272
[vibrates]

399
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:42,707
RIKO
CAN YOU COME OVER NOW?

400
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,776
[Yudai] Sorry, Tsubasa,
can you climb down?

401
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,211
Okay.

402
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,516
[Tsubasa vrooming]

403
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,153
Uh, Minori.

404
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:57,022
- Can I--
- Hey, Yudai.

405
00:25:57,822 --> 00:25:59,724
Can you go take a bath with Tsubasa?

406
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,826
Well, I, uh...

407
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:05,463
[Minori] How about it, Tsubasa?

408
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:10,035
Don't you want to take a bath with Daddy?

409
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:14,272
Yeah. Let's continue playing in the bath.

410
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:16,775
Huh? Uh...

411
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:19,678
- Why not?
- Yeah.

412
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:21,880
- Let's go.
- Yay!

413
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:27,519
- [Yudai] Here we go.
- [indistinct chatter from both]

414
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:36,728
CAN YOU COME OVER NOW?
WE CAN GET MARRIED, RIGHT?

415
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,396
[eerie music playing]

416
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:55,347
[Minori] The sin of having an affair

417
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:57,816
is immeasurably huge.

418
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,051
So...

419
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:03,655
no matter how huge the cost

420
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:07,092
I won't feel sorry for them.

421
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:09,995
I will absolutely...

422
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:13,064
make them pay for their sins.

423
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:15,533
[Yudai exclaiming]

424
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:17,602
- [water splashing]
- [Tsubasa giggling]

425
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:21,139
[indistinct chatter
from Yudai and Tsubasa]

426
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,974
[Tsubasa cheering]

427
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,810
[indistinct chatter
from Yudai and Tsubasa]

428
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:28,647
Your hair.

429
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,182
You cut it short.

430
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:36,121
Maybe I had it cut too short.

431
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:38,823
It's super cute.

432
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:44,029
Thank you. You're the only one
who's said that.

433
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:45,764
Huh?

434
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:49,000
[Minori] Just you wait

435
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,336
Ms. Riko Miyake.

436
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,173
I'm going to personally steal...

437
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,311
your precious son from you.

438
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:03,515
Oh?

439
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:05,850
You smell nice.

440
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,119
Are you using cologne?

441
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:10,722
Um...

442
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:13,124
Yes.

443
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,063
By the way, about that reward...

444
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:20,665
Is Anko Panic enough?

445
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:25,837
What do you mean?

446
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:28,773
If there's anything else I can do...

447
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,509
I'll do it.

448
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:36,715
Huh?

449
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,084
So you're letting me decide?

450
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,586
[Minori] Yeah.

451
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,729
- [Wataru] My next class is starting.
- [Minori] Do your best.

452
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,411
- Ms. Kume.
- What is it?

453
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:10,081
Do you like younger guys?

454
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:11,850
What?

455
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:17,222
I have a feeling you're hitting on Wataru.

456
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,392
Ms. Muto.

457
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:23,828
I'm married.

458
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:25,263
Ah, I thought so.

459
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:28,299
Why aren't you wearing a ring?

460
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,602
I've never worn rings.

461
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:33,204
I see.

462
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,875
Goodbye.

463
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:44,215
People have romantic relationships
even if they're married.

464
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,992
I guess some people do.

465
00:29:56,127 --> 00:30:00,231
But I'm no longer interested
in having romantic relationships.

466
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,202
Bye then.

467
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:07,272
[Yudai] Hey.

468
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,877
You look nice with short hair.

469
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:15,547
Yeah?

470
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:19,450
Yeah. You had long hair for a long time.

471
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,053
It's kind of refreshing.

472
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:23,922
[Minori] I know.

473
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:26,658
I don't think I've ever had my hair
this short.

474
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:29,460
Did you go to your usual hair salon?

475
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,402
No.

476
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:41,372
I went to a new place I happened to find.

477
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:43,308
I just stopped by.

478
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,343
I see.

479
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,379
They're good.
You should go there from now on.

480
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:52,116
- Yeah, I will.
- Mm.

481
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:01,793
[Minori] That woman...

482
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,596
She didn't tell him

483
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:07,332
that I went to see her?

484
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,103
YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE!

485
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,204
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT?

486
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:14,672
I WANT TO SEE YOU THIS WEEKEND.
JUST THE TWO OF US?

487
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,008
[keyboard clacking]

488
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,246
Wataru, I'm done taking a bath.

489
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:24,182
- Can't you at least knock?
- Oh, sorry.

490
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:26,551
What? What were you watching?

491
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:29,721
- Were you watching something bad?
- No way.

492
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:30,955
I'll go take a bath.

493
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:45,169
Cologne...

494
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:48,506
My son doesn't seem
to be interested at all.

495
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:51,276
You never know with those types.

496
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:52,944
[Riko] Excuse me?

497
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:54,445
[foreboding music playing]

498
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,781
[shower running]

499
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:14,365
I WANT TO MEET YOU THIS WEEKEND.
JUST THE TWO OF US?

500
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:15,600
YES. THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN
ON MY MIND.

501
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,268
[keyboard clacking]

502
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:24,976
- [Yudai] Minori?
- [music ends]

503
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,150
You're still up.

504
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:34,218
Mm-hmm.

505
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:37,188
Were you working?

506
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,757
Yeah.

507
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:43,962
I had to make study plans for my students.

508
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:53,538
Are you avoiding me these days?

509
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,208
Sorry.

510
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,179
I didn't mean to.

511
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:05,850
It's kind of stressful
until I get used to my job.

512
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:10,755
I was lonely.

513
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:15,660
[Minori] Don't touch me with those hands
that touched her.

514
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,230
It's filthy.

515
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,000
It's gross.

516
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:29,440
You can't let him know
until everything is prepared.

517
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,710
[Sara] You have to play the part
of a well-loved, happy wife.

518
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,387
[soft somber music playing]

519
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:44,522
[kissing]

520
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:53,698
[kissing continues]

521
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,002
[shower running]

522
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:05,543
[keyboard clicking]

523
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,648
I WANT TO MEET YOU THIS WEEKEND.
JUST THE TWO OF US?

524
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:12,183
[gasps]

525
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:15,753
YES. THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN
ON MY MIND.

526
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:18,189
OKAY. WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO?

527
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:28,466
SOMEWHERE WITH NICE SCENERY.
LIKE THE SEA?

528
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,902
PLAGE SUD RESTAURANT.

529
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,904
HOW ABOUT MEETING UP THERE?

530
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:37,608
- THEN I'LL SEE YOU THERE AT 1 P.M.
- ALL RIGHT.

531
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,178
- I'LL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO TOMORROW.
- I WILL BE TOO.

532
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:47,952
[Yudai kissing]

533
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:50,121
[Minori] I never thought that being held

534
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,724
by my own husband

535
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,761
would be this painful.

536
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:01,766
Next Tuesday

537
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,037
he will probably make love
to that woman again.

538
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,915
- [sighs]
- Hmm? What's the matter?

539
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:21,819
It's nothing.

540
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:25,056
[Minori] That thought made me realize...

541
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:29,694
how ridiculous this is.

542
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:33,498
Somehow, the whole thing felt

543
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,033
a little bit comical.

544
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:42,006
Perhaps, it's too much trouble for you

545
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:43,808
to be meeting like this.

546
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,146
Hmm.

547
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:50,848
I don't know.

548
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:55,953
But it's been a while
since I've been on a date like this.

549
00:35:56,921 --> 00:36:00,124
Don't you go on dates with your husband?

550
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,227
We don't anymore.

551
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,197
So you're not getting along...

552
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:08,766
with your husband?

553
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:13,404
We do get along.
We're happy with each other.

554
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,343
Why are you so concerned?

555
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:21,445
Uh...

556
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,516
[Minori] Wataru's mom...

557
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:27,952
aren't you worried?

558
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:34,091
I wonder if we look like mother and son?

559
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:37,562
But we aren't.

560
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,865
[chuckles]

561
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:43,467
Relax. I'm just kidding.

562
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:46,837
[closing theme music playing]

563
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:50,875
[Minori] Your precious son...

564
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:53,844
is about to be taken in

565
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:56,714
by an evil woman.

566
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,450
Um...

567
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:04,021
That hairstyle...

568
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,224
it really looks good on you.

569
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:10,628
Thank you.

570
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:13,097
But...

571
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:16,334
I don't think you should

572
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:19,370
casually say something like that to women.

573
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:21,839
Huh?

574
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,942
You might lead them on.

575
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:40,925
[Minori chuckles]

576
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,509
You have something here...

577
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,045
[closing theme music continues]

578
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,734
[music ends]

579
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:31,042
I despise your family intensely

580
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,344
for destroying my home!

581
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:36,213
Shouldn't you watch your wife more?

582
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,848
You're saying he's having an affair?

583
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:39,350
Shame on you!

584
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,819
[Hiromi] Apologize to Minori!
