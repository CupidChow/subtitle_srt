00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:12,479
Who are you?

4
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:16,449
I'm her...

5
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:19,719
ex-husband.

6
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,995
- Who are you and what are you doing?
- [Minori] Stop it.

7
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:31,664
Kotaro.

8
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,200
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:39,072
Can I get back to you later?

10
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,142
I understand.

[tense music playing]

12
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,050
[Kotaro] But...

no matter what happens

14
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,058
I'm...

15
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,860
on your side, Minori.

16
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,434
What was that?

17
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:08,535
[door closes]

18
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,072
Are you okay?

19
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,808
Yeah.

20
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:18,611
Why are you here?

21

[birds chirping]

22
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,186
I'M SORRY FOR THE OTHER DAY.

23
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,788
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
BUT I DON'T CARE HOW LONG IT TAKES...

00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,267
Don't make my mom suffer any more.

[sighs deeply]

28
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:05,325
What happened between you
and my mom in the past?

29
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:07,026
What?

30
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:13,433
I KNOW YOUR PAST WITH WATARU MIYAKE.
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE FORGIVEN?

31
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,975
What... is this?

32
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,079
It's your fault.

33
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,984
Things have been messed up
since you arrived.

36
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,542
I KNOW YOUR PAST WITH WATARU MIYAKE.
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE FORGIVEN?

37
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,144
What the hell is this?

38
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,979
Don't play dumb.

39
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,883
- It was you, wasn't it?
- Huh?

40
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:41,287
Why? Why would you do something like this?

41
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,424
Calm down! I didn't do this.

42
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:47,260
I didn't know anything until Riko told me.

43
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,928
I didn't know Wataru had moved here.

44
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,063
Riko?

45
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,600
You're...

46
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,769
still in contact with her?

47
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,305
Well, uh...

48
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,476
Did that woman do this too?

49
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,547
Did she tell you to come and spy on us?

50
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,682
- No.
- Then why?

51
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,418
Uh... Well...

52
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,955
All this time

53
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,992
I thought about you and Tsubasa.

54
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,199
I was feeling remorse

55
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,335
for seven years.

56
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:35,875
Of course, I won't say
we should start over, but...

57
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,514
Just once in a while

58
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,418
can't I come...

59
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,988
and visit you two like this?

60
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,063
Go home.

61
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:15,615
Minori...

62
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:20,453
Tsubasa has a quiet life now.

63
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,757
He doesn't ask about you these days.

64
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,094
I don't want to upset him.

65
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,303
Seven years have passed, you know.

66
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:43,910
We're already leading a new life now.

67
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:48,314
Why can't you live your life, too?

68
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:03,930
So that makes you think

69
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:06,532
dating Wataru is a good idea?

70
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:09,836
What?

71
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,074
What are you thinking?
He's Riko's son, you know.

[tense music playing]

73
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,715
Of all people...

74
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,423
Why...

75
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,659
does it have to be Wataru?

76
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:37,630
Do you really think

77
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,834
you can be happy with him?

78
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,278
[woman] Megu!

79
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:53,613

WATARU, WE NEED TO TALK.
DO YOU HAVE TIME?

83
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,334
[man] Mr. Miyake, over here.

84
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:19,505
[Wataru] Let me see.

85
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,823
- Sorry to call you over so suddenly.
- It's okay.

86
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,392
I wanted to talk to you too.

87
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,776
I heard from Tsubasa

88
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,412
about the threatening letter.

89
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:02,782
Tsubasa told you?

90
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:07,320
I want to apologize.

91
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:13,226
Maybe... it was created by my mother.

92
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,363
I'm so sorry.

93
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,468
I'll handle it.

94
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:26,005
I'll talk to her and make her stop.

95
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:30,877
Don't worry about it.

96
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,884
I feel that we shouldn't have met
in the first place.

97
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:44,690
You know what?

98
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,360
I decided to move away from this town.

99
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,963
Why do you have to go?

100
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,669
- You didn't do anything bad.
- Wataru.

101
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,838
That's not true.

102
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,342
Because I used you

103
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,711
to get back at Riko and hurt her.

104
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,550
That's the sin I committed.

105
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,120
It's not fair.

106
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,624
Then I'd go with you.

107
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:23,596
[chuckles]

108
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:24,864
There's someone else

109
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:27,900
I'm going with.

110
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,438
Is it Mr. Taguchi?

111
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,644
[approaching footsteps]

112
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:46,285
Why?

[somber music playing]

114
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,663
I take responsibility for what happened.

115
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,300
I'm going to support...

116
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,472
Minori and Tsubasa properly.

117
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,446
Minori.

118
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:16,549
Is it true?

119
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,721
With all that's happened?

120
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:24,824
Why would you?

121
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,328
Because Yudai

122
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,397
regrets what he did.

123
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:40,640
It's better for Tsubasa
to have his real father back, right?

124
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,142
What about your feelings?

125
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,713
Are you really fine with it?

126
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:54,587
I promise to protect you.
Both you and Tsubasa.

127
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:56,856
So please...

128
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,262
You're bothersome to me.

[somber music playing]

130
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,206
[Minori] If only I weren't a coward...

131
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,711
The fact that

132
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,314
you have feelings for me

133
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,484
is bothersome for me.

134
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:31,724
So...

135
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,027
I'm sorry.

136
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,731
If only...

137
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:41,634
I could express

138
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,806
my honest feelings.

139
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:49,475
I'm sorry.

140
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,149
Things have been messed up
since you arrived.

141
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,120
My mother...

142
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,123
stopped laughing again.

143
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,131
I understand.

144
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,070
I'm sorry.

145
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,908
I rushed ahead
without considering your feelings.

146
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:46,132
I wanted to make you happy.

147
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,803
I loved you so much.

[door closes]

151
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:01,981
[Minori] I'm not allowed...

152
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,418
to choose him.

153
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:12,925
Yudai.

[indistinct whispering]

155
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,394
I need your cooperation.

[tense music playing]

158
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:40,286
[Tsubasa] What happened between you
and my mother in the past?

159
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:49,895
[boy] Tsubasa!

160
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,833
Let's play games at my house today.

161
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,467
Um, okay.

162
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,436
[boy] I'll go and set it up.
See you later.

163
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:58,671
[Tsubasa] Bye-bye.

164
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,651
[gasps]

165
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,125
Tsubasa has a quiet life now.

166
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,463
He doesn't ask about you these days.

167
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,833
I don't want to upset him.

168
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,713
[somber music playing]

169
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,494
[Minori] Um, I'm sorry about the other day

170
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:58,230
for losing my composure.

171
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:02,902
Don't be. A letter like that
would cause anybody to panic.

172
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:06,639
I'm so sorry, Mr. Taguchi.
I should've known it couldn't be you.

173
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,873
It's all right.

174
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,377
By the way...

175
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:16,282
the reason I came here today is...

176
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,352
This.

177
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,789
Have you seen it?

178
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:31,764

182
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,207
What's this?

183
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,910
I didn't want to scare you.

184
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,446
But this is a small town.

185
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,916
These kinds of rumors spread very quickly.

186
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,286
I would be worried about Tsubasa.

00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,279
I'll call you later.

370
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:57,362
Tsubasa, can you wait for me
at Mr. Taguchi's house?

371
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:00,832
Okay.

372
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:03,401
I have to go.

373
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:05,804
See you later.

374
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:15,680
[somber music playing]

375
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,215
[Minori] I'll end it.

376
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,685
I have to...

377
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,655
end it all.

378
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:32,797
[ominous music playing]

379
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,402
What do you want, Wataru?

380
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,671
You threatened Minori, didn't you?

381
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,507
You're mistaken. I didn't do any--

382
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,742
Was it because you wanted
to start over with her?

383
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,879
Did you think she'd depend on you
if you intimidated her?

384
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,215
No, I really didn't.

385
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,683
Then, what about my mother?

386
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:53,985
Payback for being ditched?

387
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:55,820
Riko?

388
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,389
You're defaming her
on the beauty salon website, right?

389
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:02,393
Posting that the owner has a secret
love child with a married man.

390
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,964
Hold on. A secret love child?
You mean Reika?

391
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:07,999
Yeah.

392
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:12,103
Nobody else knows this fact
other than you, Yudai.

393
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,740
Yudai.

394
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:17,442
Is it true?

395
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:19,077
Mom.

396
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:24,582
Are you still doing something
that cowardly after seven years?

397
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,718
- No! It's not me!
- [slaps]

398
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,090
Are you taking revenge
for losing everything?

399
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,993
How stupid of you.
Go turn yourself in to the police.

400
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,262
I'm not going to the police
because I didn't do it!

401
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,097
- It's okay. Let's go to the police--
- No!

402
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:41,666
[Minori] You're the one
who should turn yourself in.

403
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:46,037
[suspenseful music playing]

404
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:47,205
Minori.

405
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:52,844
The threatening letters.

406
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:57,181
The rumors on the Internet.

407
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,084
They were all your doing.

408
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,188
Right, Hiromi?

409
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,995
I don't know what you mean.

410
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:13,932
It's no use pretending.

411
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:18,903
I asked my father to request a disclosure

412
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:22,640
of sender's information
using Tsukishiro Group's legal advisor.

413
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,144
All the slander on the Internet...

414
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:31,249
was posted from your
personal computer, Hiromi.

415
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,188
I don't know.

416
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:42,827
[paper rustling]

417
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:47,765
I had this checked for fingerprints, too.

418
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:54,672
This threatening letter
has your fingerprints all over it.

419
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,741
That's...

420
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,979
I'm sorry, Wataru.

421
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:05,316
I thought at first
your mother was the culprit.

422
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:10,054
But your mother wouldn't...

423
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,725
do anything to degrade you.

424
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:21,165
The only person who could do
such a despicable act

425
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:26,404
is someone who used her own son
to get her way.

426
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,941
[Minori] Nobody else but her.

427
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:35,346
It's too late
to talk your way out of it...

428
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,116
Hiromi.

429
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,886
[snorts, chuckles]

430
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,056
[laughs]

431
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,527
What goes around comes around, huh?

432
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:53,231
All I did...

433
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:56,834
was give the correct punishment.

434
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:00,638
Punishment?

435
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:07,879
[Hiromi] These seven years

436
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,048
were a living hell for me.

00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:20,625
[woman] Hey, Ms. Kisaragi.

439
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:23,728
- Yes.
- The numbers are wrong again.

440
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:24,862
I'm sorry.

441
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,833
It seems you know how to scam people,
but you don't know how to calculate.

442
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:34,105
[supervisor] I heard you made your son
marry into a wealthy family

443
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:36,441
and tried to con the family
out of their money.

444
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:37,642
Is that true?

445
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:39,911
[co-worker]
Isn't that called marriage scam?

446
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:42,580
Don't people get arrested for that?

447
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:46,584
I'd really rather not
be working with a criminal.

448
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,488

HANDMADE BY US

451
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:11,275
[Hiromi] Bad rumors spread quickly.

452
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:15,012
I didn't last long at any workplace.

453
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:21,686
I had no job nor money.

454
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:27,024
All I had left was a life with my son.

455
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,597
"Why do I have to live like this?"

456
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:34,999
That's what I thought every day.

457
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,603
If I lose my only treasure...

458
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:43,908
Murder would not be enough.

459
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,646
[Hiromi] I thought
she was absolutely right.

460
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,316
Everything I had was taken from me.

462
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,189
[Hiromi] Murder would not be enough.

463
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:02,827
I won't allow her
to walk away with a victory.

464
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,196
She'll never get away with it.

465
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:10,134
THE OWNER IS IN A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP
WITH YOUNGER TEACHER "M"

466
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,375
Why did you threaten my mother too?

467
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,710
[chuckles]

468
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:24,649
I'm the one who let her open
that beauty salon.

469
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,587
She kept working there
as if nothing had happened.

470
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,323
Your mother hasn't lost
anything in the end.

471
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:34,091
That's why I wrecked it.

472
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,563
I was going to...

473
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:42,066
put all the blame on him.

474
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,104
Yudai.

475
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:52,410
It's true, you are the root
of the problem.

476
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:55,813
If only you had not had an affair.

477
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:03,588
If you'd listened to me and stayed
married to her until we got rich...

478
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:09,727
without being swayed by a dumb thing
like love and even having a baby...

479
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:14,532
then child support
wouldn't be a problem now!

480
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,067
You idiot!

481
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,074
But you're his mother.

482
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:28,312
I never considered you
my daughter, you know!

483
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:35,553
I've just recorded...

484
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:39,123
everything you said.

485
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:46,530
Hiromi.

486
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:50,635
It's over, okay?

487
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,675
Why?

488
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,515
Why am I the only one who has to suffer?

489
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:13,591
Why?

490
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:21,699
[blow echoing]

[splatters]

492
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:33,944
[Hiromi] I didn't do anything wrong.

493
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:36,314
[Yudai] We destroyed

494
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,049
everyone's lives.

495
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,852
[Minori] We both hurt the ones we care
about more than our own lives!
