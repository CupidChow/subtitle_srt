00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:09,876
[salon attendant]
How do you like the finish, ma'am?

2
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:11,845
They're beautiful.

3
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:14,481
Perfect for my vacation
in Hawaii next month.

4
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:17,050
[salon attendant]
A vacation in Hawaii? I'm jealous.

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,620
Yes. I've been working without a break

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,589
so I'm rewarding myself.

7
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,990
[attendant]
Are you going with your family?

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,091
No.

9
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:28,561
I can't bring my daughter-in-law
and her child. They're staying home.

10
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:31,698
It's just me and my son. [giggles]

11
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:35,335
- I see. I hope you have fun.

12
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:36,703
Thank you.

13
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,338
Excuse me.

14
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:40,807
Yudai, what is it?

15
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,076
What?

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,080
He died?

17
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:51,918
He just passed away. Minori contacted me.

18
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,553
[Hiromi] Really?

19
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,289
The day has finally come.

20
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,759
Yeah. It's finally here, Mom.

21
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:03,696
[minister chanting]

22
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:12,505
I recognize that man.

23
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,308
I think he's the chairman
of Tsukishiro Group.

24
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:20,647
Mr. Tsukishiro.

25
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:28,955
[ominous music plays]

26
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:43,002
[whispers] Mom, why is he here?

27
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,337
I don't know.

28
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,942
[Minori]
You two are probably still not aware

29
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:51,878
of what...

30
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:55,014
is about to happen.

31
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,917
[ominous music continues]

32
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:01,087
Grandpa.

33
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,925
I have to do this.

34
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:11,397
This man wrecked Mom's life.

35
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:16,202
These two wrecked my life.

36
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:19,506
Soon...

37
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,009
I'll destroy all of them.

38
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,547
[theme music playing]

39
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:15,094
UNTIL I DESTROYED
MY HUSBAND'S OTHER FAMILY

40
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,631
- Here, Tsubasa.
- Thanks.

41
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,102
- Where's Mom?
- She has things to do.

42
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,238
You have to wait a bit, okay?

43
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,340
Okay.

44
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,844
Yudai. Come here for a second.

45
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,416
What is it?

46
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,518
What are Minori
and that man talking about?

47
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,521
That's what I want to know.
How does she know him anyway?

48
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,490
- [Hiromi] Why don't you go take a look?
- [Yudai] You go, Mom.

49
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,392
How about letting Tsubasa go look?

50
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,630
[Minori]
I heard everything from my grandfather.

51
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,901
About my mother.

52
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,204
About the money.

53
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:02,475
And...

54
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,146
the fact that you are my father.

55
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,922
I have no intention of pretending
to be family with you.

56
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:19,692
But...

57
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,597
There is something I really need to know.

58
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,406
The day my mother died...

59
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,981
she went to see you, didn't she?

60
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,187
Why did my mother

61
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,125
have to get into that accident?

62
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,399
Why did she have to die?

63
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:10,843
I knew

64
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:15,581
I'd have to tell you some day

65
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,885
about what happened to Miyuki

66
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,889
and the reason why you were born.

67
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:26,726
This is the finest quality, one of a kind.

68
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,960
It's beautiful.

69
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,863
Please feel free to take time
and look closely at them.

70
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,300
Sorry, can I have some water?

71
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,103
[man] Mr. Tsukishiro.

72
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,138
- May I have a moment?
- Mm.

73
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:44,444
I want to introduce Ms. Kume,
a salesperson at our Yokohama branch.

74
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,147
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm Miyuki Kume.

75
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,218
[Tsukishiro]
When I met Miyuki for the first time

76
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,755
I was captivated by her smile.

77
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:57,724
Here.

78
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,326
I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU TO CALL.

79
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,129
- What?
- If you don't mind.

80
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:10,002
Honey, your father wants you.

81
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,439
Yes, I'll be right there.

82
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,148
[Tsukishiro] Rather

83
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,984
I couldn't help but be captivated.

84
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,491
[Tsukishiro] I knew it was forbidden.

85
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,827
But when I was with her

86
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,097
the burden of responsibility as the heir

87
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,733
and the frustration
with a political marriage

88
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,171
I felt as though I can escape it all.

89
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:54,147
Sir, Ms. Kume is here.

90
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:56,816
Thanks.

91
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,522
I'm pregnant.

92
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:04,690
What?

93
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,592
[Miyuki] I don't know...

94
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:08,928
what to do.

95
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:12,598
I'm sorry.

96
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,541
[Tsukishiro] Miyuki.

97
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:23,776
Thank you.

98
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:27,447
[Tsukishiro] I was happy.

99
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,384
It might have been a thorny path

100
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,986
but I thought I could

101
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:37,089
overcome the obstacles with her.

102
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:39,425
But...

103
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:40,793
SUSUMU TSUKISHIRO'S FIRST SCANDAL
FORBIDDEN LOVE & A BABY?

104
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:44,664
- What in the...
- You're a disgrace to our family.

105
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:48,901
Do you know how much I had to pay
to stop this article?

106
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,471
You must break up with that woman.

107
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,306
Immediately.

108
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:57,610
I don't want to.

109
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,781
- I'd rather leave this family than--
- Your words are worthless.

110
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:03,549
Listen, Susumu.

111
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,085
You should know

112
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,922
that destroying one woman's life

113
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,793
is easy for me.

114
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,900
[Tsukishiro] In the end...

115
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:25,538
I couldn't protect Miyuki.

116
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,542
I am responsible for everything.

117
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,079
It was all...

118
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:37,984
due to my selfish actions.

119
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:46,292
I regret it.

120
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,298
Why couldn't I

121
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,002
choose Miyuki at that moment?

122
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:00,873
Please stop.

123
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,279
[Minori]
What my mother did was unforgivable.

124
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,682
And so she brought it on herself.

125
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,453
Karma got her in the end, as they say.

126
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,024
After all

127
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,394
- she had an affair.
- That's not true.

128
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:22,528
It's true!

129
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,165
It's true.

130
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,038
Miyuki died...

131
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:36,943
because of me.

132
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,646
[Tsukishiro]
Five years had passed since then.

133
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:43,983
[Miyuki] Susumu.

134
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:48,487
[Tsukishiro]
Miyuki suddenly came to see me.

135
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,657
Miyuki. What are you doing here?

136
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:53,859
I have a favor to ask.

137
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,396
I want you to meet Minori just once.

138
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,332
Minori?

139
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,408
[Tsukishiro] Is this girl...

140
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,945
Minori is feeling so lonely.

141
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:17,917
It was her birthday the other day,
and when I asked her what she wanted

142
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,353
she said, "Daddy."

143
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,058
Sir, it's time for your next appointment.

144
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:30,596
Sir.

145
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,169
- [Miyuki] Wait.
- You said I wouldn't have to see her.

146
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,472
It's over between us.

147
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:43,042
Don't cling to me like this.

148
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,344
Please don't go!

149
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,713

I apologize

154
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,178
for what I've done to you.

155
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,748
I'm so sorry.

156
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,024
She did it...

157
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,026
for me?

Mommy, are you crying?

168
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:14,500
I'm not crying.

169
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:18,070
I just had dust in my eyes.

170
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,407
Are you okay? Let me see.

Can you wait outside
just a little bit more?

I'll be with you in a minute.

176

Huh?

00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,325
- Okay?
- Okay.

178
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,426
Okay.

00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,536
Such a cute boy.

Yes.

- Hey. Give it back.
- I thought so.

194
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,972
I went to see Ms. Kume and warned her

195
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,542
that seducing a minor is a crime.

196

Why did you do that?

197

It was weird.

It didn't look like a normal relationship.

Again...

203
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,199
- it shouldn't matter to you.
- It matters!

552
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:19,497
[Minori] You and I

553
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:23,034
are getting a divorce.

554
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,807
Infidelity is not a crime?

555
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:31,442
Stop messing with me!

556
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:34,912
You're the one messing with me!

557
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,581
We're unrelated, you know.

558
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,116
I love you.

559
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:41,218
[Yudai] I want you to believe me.
