00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:10,443
[Minori] No matter how far I go

2
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,748
or how hard I try to forget

3
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:18,718
the sins I've committed

4
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,790
might never go away.

5
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,726
[Minori panting heavily]

6
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:44,277
Is that Mr. Miyake's...

7
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,382
- She's my mother.
- [both] What?

8
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,486
Wow, I thought she was your sister.

9
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,557
Thank you for all your support for my son.

10
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:59,359
[Haruna] Not at all.

11
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,027
Wow...

12
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,234
What are you doing?

13
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:13,206
Walking made me so thirsty.

14
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:17,577
[friend]
Oh, no! That's a really nice cafe

15
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:19,379
but it's already closed

16
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:22,015
Oh, no, really?

17
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:25,985
That's too bad.

18
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,324
- Are you okay?
- What?

19
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,528
You looked pale, so I was worried.

20
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,567
Could it be...

21
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:43,403
morning sickness?

22
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,839
[Riko] I wanted that woman

23
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:50,176
to experience the same terror
I went through.

24
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,012
Don't think this is the end.

25
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,049
This is just the beginning.

26
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,817
Let's go!

27
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,055
[Minori] Is this my turn

28
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,925
to be punished?

29

[theme music playing]

30
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:57,443
UNTIL I DESTROYED
MY HUSBAND'S OTHER FAMILY

31
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,579
[Wataru] Why did you come?

32
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:01,748
[Riko] What do you mean, why?

33
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:05,018
I should be asking you the same thing.

34
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:10,557
Wataru, that cafe
belongs to that woman, right?

35
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,594
Did you come to this town

36
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:18,631
- because she's here?
- Of course not!

37
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,876
[Wataru] Look at this article.

38
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,312
A NEW CAFE OPENS.

39
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:35,348
She opened the cafe two months ago.

40
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,217
I was assigned here last year.

41
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:43,289
You mean it's really a coincidence?

42
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,726
If you don't want to believe it, don't.

43
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:50,296
But I was able
to get into Keiho University

44
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,932
and become a teacher all thanks to her.

45
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:56,035
Stop it! Don't even say her name!

46
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,739
It's just the past catching up.

47
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:03,376
Blame your own actions, not somebody else!

48
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:08,047
That woman
wouldn't want to see us, either!

49
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,517
Please don't come here anymore.

50
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,386
What?

51
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:15,822
It's a small town.

52
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,292
People might get the wrong ideas.

53
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:22,762
[Riko] In any case

54
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:26,299
stay away from that woman. Please!

55
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:31,204
- I'll take care of the rest--
- Enough already!

56
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:35,508
Stop sticking your nose in my business.

57
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,511
This is my life!

58
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,350
Wait, Wataru!

[Wataru] If you lay a hand on Minori

61
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,826
I'll be done being your son.

[door closes]

64
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:12,679
I apologize

65
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,415
for what just happened.

66
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:22,221
I never thought my mother would show up.

67
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:27,060
I'm sorry it was unpleasant.

68
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:30,129
Don't worry.

69
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,265
You can go.

Seven years ago

71
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,914
do you remember what you said to me?

72
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,151
I want you

73
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,456
to live your own life.

74
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,325
[Wataru] During these years

75
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,895
I couldn't live my own life.

76
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:05,865
So

77
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,335
I came to this town

78
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,638
to make a fresh start.

79
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:16,976
What do you mean?

80
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:21,314
After you left Tokyo

81
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:23,816
I...

82
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,953
chose to be my sister's father

83
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:31,190
and carried the weight
of our mother's sins with her.

84
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,093
Here, Reika.

85
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:35,628
[Riko] I'm home!

86
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,364
- Sorry I'm late!
- It's okay.

87
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,833
[Wataru] Okay, I'm heading to cram school.

88
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,769
[Riko] Thank you.

89
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:48,875
- [Reika wails]
- Your brother's so nice, isn't he?

90
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,977
- Oh, the bath is ready.
- Thanks.

91
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,545
[Wataru] Both my mom and I

92
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,348
handled the house and the baby.

- See you.
- Bye.

94

[Wataru] But

95
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,820
my mom had only me to rely on.

96
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,356
She gradually...

97
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,563
Goodbye, Mr. Miyake, Ms. Muto.

- Bye.
- Take care.

Are you guys dating?

No, we just work together.

102
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,516
Are you sure?

103
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,353
I have a boyfriend.

Goodbye.

106
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,028
See you.

Stop spying on me!

108
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,570
- I'm not spying on you.
- You are!

109
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,073
Calling my college and contacting
my friends on your own.

110
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,808
This is not normal.

111
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,246
Not normal?

112
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:04,917
Sorry.

113
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:07,186
I went too far.

114
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,022
Why are you talking like that?

115
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,125
You made me choose

116
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,128
so I chose you!

117
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,999
You and Reika are all I have.

118
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,735
So what else can I do?

119
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,340
[Wataru] I knew we'd both end up worse.

120
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,644
So I left home and came here.

121
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,414
But maybe

122
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,619
all I did was

123
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,823
run from it all.

124
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:53,366
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:57,737
Why are you apologizing?

126
00:08:58,571 --> 00:08:59,572
Because

127
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:03,142
you did nothing wrong.

I wouldn't have met you.

Right now

I'm finally living my own life.

00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:37,944
And I was able

136
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,281
to find you again.

I still love you.

Don't.

Do you remember

to the Kanagawa Aquarium next time.

Give me a little more time.

You do love him

don't you?

378
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:52,744
It's too bad for me

379
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:57,315
but I understand.

380
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,323
Minori?

381
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:12,597
Don't carry the guilt by yourself.

382
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,269
We were both betrayed and suffered.

383
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,240
I think we deserve to be happy.

384
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:25,710
So please.

Who's suspicious of Wataru and me?

404

[Haruna] Good morning!

405
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:27,565
Sorry.

406
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:29,901
Did I scare you?

407
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,404
Good morning.

I know about you and Wataru...
