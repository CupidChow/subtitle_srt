was only one thing.

00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,805
I was hoping someday

00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:44,177
- [horse neighing]
- my prince on a white horse would come.

8
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:48,314
That was my wish forever.

All I want

Happiness to me

13
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,535
would be for that to happen.

14
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,939
I'd be happy if he were my first

But something is clearly off.

136
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,424
Why would he meet someone

Mm...

138
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:21,694
Well, maybe

he met a colleague there
before the business dinner

140
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,701

Maybe he did, but...

You're being too paranoid.
You've been that way since you were young.

Am I?

00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,090
Listen, Minori. Lawyers are busy people.

147
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,160
Could you not come to my office
for something as trivial as this?

148
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,067
He acts cold to Tsubasa, I think.

149
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:02,702
Hm?

150
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,472
It's hard to describe it, but...

151
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:09,942
he seems uninterested

152
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,212
in Tsubasa.

153
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,749
He seems indifferent to him.

154
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:18,784

155
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,854
I'm thinking maybe

156
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:25,558
he didn't want children.

157
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,361
No, that's impossible.

158
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:30,262
Hey.

00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,033
What if he's cheating on me?

I can't tolerate that.

Don't worry.

164
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,985
He's not the type
to do something like that.

00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,564
Yes! Actually, I made this.

185
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,933
[Yudai] You made it, didn't you?

186
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,769
Here, show Mom her omelet rice.

187
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,305
Okay. Ta-da!

188
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,407
[chuckles]

189
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:24,443
It says "Mom" on it. Did you write it?

190
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:28,013
- [Tsubasa] Yes!
- That's wonderful, Tsubasa!

191
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:33,519
But Dad wanted to draw a heart,
and so he drew this heart.

192
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,223
- He did?
- Yes. Isn't that amazing?

193
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,192
Eh...

194
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:42,361
Yes, it's amazing.

195
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,032
Our plan was a success.

196
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,467
[both] Yeah!

197
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:49,668
MOM

198
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,779
Huh?

199
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,280
What's the matter?

200
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,017
I'm sorry.

201
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,953
What is it, all of a sudden?

202
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,127
Since we're always together

203
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,664
I take happiness for granted.

204
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:21,867
I stopped noticing some things.

205
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,805
Minori...

206
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,907
Were you troubled by something?

207
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,945
No, it's nothing.

208
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,389
[laughs]

209
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,492
Hey, rinse your mouth first.

210
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:47,960
[Yudai] Does it matter?

211
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,910
[cell phone buzzes]

212
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,217
[indistinct whisper]

213
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,551
CAN I WAIT FOR YOU AT THIS STORE?

214
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,464
[suspenseful music plays]

215
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,701
[indistinct whisper]

216
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,010
[buzzing]

217
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,112
SEE YOU TOMORROW! GOOD NIGHT.

218
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,484
[upbeat music plays]

219
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,189
- [Yudai] Ms. Matsuzaki.
- Yes.

220
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,959
Can you check these numbers
and submit this to the manager?

221
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,861
- Sure.
- I'm counting on you.

222
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,099
Wakako.

223
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:03,168
- Yes?
- [friend 1] Isn't Mr. Kisaragi perfect?

224
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,371
He's good-looking, pleasant

225
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,506
he's competent and nice to everybody.

226
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,208
- [friend 1] Too good to be true.
- [friend 2] Definitely.

227
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:12,211
But unfortunately, he's married.

228
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,480
What is his wife like?

229
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:17,283
A younger woman he went to school with.

230
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,551
I'd lock onto him from high school, too.

231
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,620
- Pure love.
- Definitely.

232
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,991
Mr. Kisaragi, the materials
for the meeting tomorrow.

233
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,426
[speaks in English] Oh, thank you.

234
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:28,961
[in Japanese] Mr. Kisaragi?

235
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,463
How about going for a drink tonight?

236
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:35,034
- I'm sorry, I have plans for tonight.
- What?

237
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:38,370
It feels like you're always busy
every Tuesday.

238
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,372
[chuckles] It's just a coincidence.

239
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:43,842
It's just a guess,
but are you going out with your wife?

240
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,147
You need to hurry up and find someone.

241
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,481
[friend 3] What's that?

242
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,317
Are you trying to one-up me?

243
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,718
- You were, weren't you?
- [Yudai] No.

244
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,553
You were trying to one-up me.

245
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:55,955
Oh, stop it.

246
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,276
[passerby 1] I'm sorry I'm late.

247
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,119
- [passerby 1] Did you have to wait?
- [passerby 2] Not much. Let's go.

248
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,993
[footsteps]

249
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,094
[passerby 3] I'm sorry, I'm late.

250
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,135
[Yudai] I didn't wait long.

251
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:45,237
Did you come from cram school again?

252
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,405
Yes. I'm so tired.

253
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,506
[Minori] A man?

254
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,142
[gasps]

255
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,611
- Is this the place?
- Yes.

256
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,079
- Should we go in?
- Yes.

257
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,582
A high school student?

258
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,351
[tense music plays]

259
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,858
[store clerk] What about this one, sir?

260
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,926
[Minori panting]

261
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,167
[Minori] What's their relationship?

262
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:25,077
It can't be...

263
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,150
No.

264
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,220
[Minori] What's more likely

265
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,857
is that although it's impossible...

266
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:46,565
they look as though they're dad and son.

267
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,501
Why?

268
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,140
[tense music plays]

269
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:12,558
[Minori] Who is that?

270
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,159
[cell phone buzzes]

271
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,661
MOTHER-IN-LAW

272
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,167
Hello?

273
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,937
[mother-in-law over phone]
Hello, is this Minori?

274
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:29,208
Tsubasa can't find
his favorite dinosaur toy.

275
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,742
Do you know where it is?

276
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,145
- Uh...
- [Tsubasa] Mom...

277
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,350
- Where's my dinosaur...
- The dinosaur toy is...

278
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:48,527
- [Tsubasa] What?
- [mother-in-law] Minori? Hello?

279
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:53,899
Hello?

280
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,638
[suspenseful music plays]

281
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,224
[Minori] I couldn't comprehend
what was happening

282
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,760
in front of my eyes.

283
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:29,067
My husband was casually laughing

284
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,937
with a high school student I don't know

285
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,505
and...

286
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,641
this woman.

287
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:41,880
Mom.

288
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:47,853
Hello.

289
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,857
[Tsubasa] When are you coming home?
Where are you?

290
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,528
I'll be right home.

291
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,183
[car door opens]

292
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:29,795
[Minori] I'm home.

293
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:31,830
I'm so sorry, Tsubasa.

294
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,599
- I didn't mean to be late.
- [shushes]

295
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,635
He got tired of waiting for you
and fell asleep.

296
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:41,506
I apologize for being late, Mother.

297
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:46,178
No problem. I'm sorry I called you.
Is your friend okay?

298
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:48,313
Yes.

299
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:51,049
It had been a while since
we got together, so we got excited.

300
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,217
I'm sorry.

301
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:55,153
Don't you worry about me at all.

302
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:58,090
I don't mind visiting every day
to see Tsubasa.

303
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,224
Here, have some.

304
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:02,628
I'm very grateful you would say that.

305
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,730
Where's Yudai? Isn't he coming home yet?

306
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:07,799
Yudai is...

307
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:09,668
[indistinct whisper]

308
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:16,341
Yudai seems to be working late tonight.

309
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:18,510
Goodness.

310
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:24,082
If he ignores you too much,
you should let me know.

311
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,485
- I'll spank him.
- [both laughing]

312
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,120
Thank you so much.

313
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,560
[Sara] So?

314
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,764
Was he really cheating on you?

315
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:40,699
I don't know.

316
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,468
But I saw them

317
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:45,837
buying a necklace together

318
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,040
and giving it as a present to that woman.

319
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:52,544
If...

320
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,815
he's really having an affair...

321
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,385
what should I do?

322
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:05,590
How about you?

323
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:07,793
What do you want to do?

324
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:11,430
I don't know.

325
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:14,399
But...

326
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,302
I could never forgive an affair.

327
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:22,974
Then

328
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,278
you need to make sure.

329
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:28,914
What?

330
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,983
You can't pretend not
to notice anymore, right?

331
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:40,525
Oh, yes, about this Friday.

332
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,027
I'm getting a haircut

333
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:44,129
then going to drink
with friends from junior high.

334
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,299
But how do I make sure?

335
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,068
Tell me if Yudai acts strangely.

336
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:52,971
He acts suspiciously every Tuesday

337
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:55,474
but maybe there are other days
he meets that woman, too.

338
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,877
Okay.

339
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,547
Try not to drink too much.

340
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:04,783
I know that.

341
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,388
[Sara] But...

342
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,824
no matter what the facts are

343
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:15,594
you will have to accept them.

344
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,464
Are you prepared for it?

345
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,017
[clacks]

346
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:45,056
Baby boy

347
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,461
I'm right here

348
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:53,698
- Waiting for you I'm not going anywhere
- [clacks]

349
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:01,940
- Kusunoki.
- Yes?

350
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:04,309
Come here for a moment.

351
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,279
Here.

352
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,214
You don't like green beans?

353
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:11,850
Mm... I'm not fond of them.

354
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:16,321
No matter how far apart we are

355
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,658
[Kusunoki] You shouldn't be picky about
the daily lunches she makes for you.

356
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:23,094
- You should be thanking your wife.
- I do thank her.

357
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:27,098
My love for you will never change

358
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:30,635
- [Kusunoki] Oh, how about tonight--
- I'm sorry. I have plans for tonight.

359
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:34,973
You must know what I mean to say

360
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,541
Prior commitment.

361
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,411
- [Minori] I'll be waiting
- [clacks]

362
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:46,351
