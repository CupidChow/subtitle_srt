1
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:04,537
Wataru?

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:09,976
[tense music playing]

3
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:15,048
[Yudai] What's going on?
Why are they here together?

4
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,753
Is he a friend of yours?

5
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:25,725
Yeah.

6
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:28,661
He's the son of a friend

7
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:30,797
who was in a club with me in college.

8
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:32,599
Right?

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,235
Uh...

10
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:37,737
yes.

11
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:41,441
Oh, this is my wife and my son.

12
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,246
Pleased to meet you.

13
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,548
I'm Minori, his wife.

14
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,085
I'm Wataru Miyake.

15
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,755
This is a surprise. It's been a long time.

16
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,224
Yes, it's been a while.

17
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,563
Is your father well?

18
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:06,366
[Wataru] Yes.

19
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:12,105
This must mean you came for advice
on something you can't ask your dad.

20
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:13,840
Yes.

21
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:15,809
Kind of.

22
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:22,148
Sorry, I want to have a man-to-man
talk in private. Go on home.

23
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,186
Okay.

24
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,721
Let's go.

25
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,993
[tense music fades]

26
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:41,701
Yes.

27
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:45,638
Daddy's friends come over a lot
these days, don't they?

28
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:47,740
Friends?

29
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:52,812
Yeah. A lady stopped by
when we were playing in the park.

30
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:55,815
A lady?

31
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,085
A pretty lady with long hair.

32
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:00,787
Are you friends with her, too?

33
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,624
[Minori] That woman...

34
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,160
met Tsubasa?

35
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,063
No.

36
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:12,932
I don't think I do.

37
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,568
She gave me candy.

38
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,443
[ominous music playing]

39
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:32,752

[gasps]

41
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:38,458
What did you do with it?

42
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:39,826
- I ate it.
- [gasps]

43
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,495
Why did you eat candy from a stranger?

44
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,534
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:49,135
[gasps]

46
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,605
[Minori] If she harms Tsubasa...

47
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:54,774
I'll kill her.

48
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,580
What are you doing?
I told you not to come near this house.

49
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,650
I didn't think
I would bump into your wife.

50
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,885
Why didn't you text me?

51
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,388
You know better than to do this.

52
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:14,494
Your wife...

53
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,630
she's beautiful.

54
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,266
What? What are you saying all of a sudden?

55
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,870
Mom and your wife
are different types, I noticed.

56
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,340
Never mind that.

57
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,577
What's so important for you
to have come all the way here?

58
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:35,682
Well...

59
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,718
[Yudai] I've got to fake it somehow.

60
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,554
I can never let Minori find out

61
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:45,458
that I have another family.

62
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,063
[theme music playing]

MY HUSBAND'S OTHER FAMILY

64
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,012
[Minori and Tsubasa] Squeeze.

65
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,314
[gasps] Finished!

66
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,950
Wow, you drew such a cute cat!

67
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,218
Next one's Daddy's.

68
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,453
You should draw a heart for him, Mommy.

69
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:48,588
Me?

70
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,757
Daddy drew one for you before, remember?

71
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:55,995
[Tsubasa] There.

72
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:59,132
I'm done. Now it's your turn
to draw a heart.

73
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,402
- Hmm?
- A heart.

74
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,170
[chuckles]

75
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:07,707
Okay.

76
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,215
[somber music playing]

77
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,221
[indistinct whispering]

78
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,258
[indistinct whispering continues]

79
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,269
That's... a lot of ketchup.

80
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:39,772
Sorry. I squeezed a little too much.

81
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,911
Mommy drew a heart for you, Daddy.

82
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,813
It just didn't work out today.

83
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,881
Uh... oh, okay.

84
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,149
- [Tsubasa] Mm.
- [chuckles]

85
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,417
That's nice of you.

86
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,753
Thank you for the meal.

87
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,256
[Minori] How can he keep smiling?

88
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,693
What did Wataru come here to say?

89
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,162
Did he come

90
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,965
to tell Yudai about me?

91
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,000
That boy who came...

92
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,103
What was his name? Miyake?

93
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,307
What was such an emergency
that he had to come see you?

94
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,109
Well, he...

95
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,745
Um... [clears throat]

96
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,782
...he had questions
about which college to go to.

97
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,353
He has a college he wants to go to
but his parents are against it.

98
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,489
I see.

99
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,092
Which college does he want to go to?

100
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,193
Huh?

101
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,397
What was it... Oh, an art university.

102
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:40,233
He says he likes art.

103
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,602
Keiho, the Faculty of Education.

104
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,705
[uneasy music playing]

105
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:49,976
Mommy, I want milk.

106
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,312
Just a second.

107
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,115
[Tsubasa humming]

108
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,653
[sighs]

109
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,623
Sorry, Tsubasa, we're out of milk.

110
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,025
But I want to drink milk.

111
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,962
Okay, then I'll go buy some milk.

112
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,931
- Watch Tsubasa for me.
- Sure.

113
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:22,608
Wataru.

114
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:24,510
Ms. Kume.

115
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:27,280
I...

116
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,981
[breathing heavily]

117
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,524
Why did you come to our house?

118
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,297
Is it because I used you?

119
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,134
Did you come to reveal everything?

120
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:49,869
That's not it.

121
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,539
I wanted to see you.

122
00:07:58,911 --> 00:07:59,946
I...

123
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,649
I've been thinking
since the last time we met.

124
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,686
That day we went to the sea.

125
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:09,489
Ms. Kume...

126
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,992
Minori, you said to me that day...

127
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,230
You are plunging
the family of your lover into hell!

128
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:18,998
You made me think about...

129
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,769
why I was okay with infidelity.

130
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,039
I realized...

131
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,477
I was running away from it
this whole time.

132
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,682
If Mom was happy,
then it was fine for me, too.

133
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:40,720
So...

134
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,724
I was just looking away
from the reality of their affair.

135
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:47,193
I was trying not to think about it.

136
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:53,866
That's why

137
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,403
I wanted to see you in person
and apologize to you.

138
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,340
I know my apology won't solve anything.

139
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,013
It's not for you to apologize.

140
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,483
But...

141
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,220
it was also my fault
it got awkward just now.

142
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,361
Tell me.

143
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,934
What did you talk about
with Yudai just now?

144
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:33,773
I asked him if he was serious
about getting married to Mom.

145
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,578
And?

146
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:41,948
Yudai said...

147
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,718
You don't have to worry about it.

148
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,353
But...

149
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,523
didn't you marry your wife
because you loved her?

150
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:53,225
- Then why--
- The one I love is...

151
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:57,263
Your mother is the only one I love.

152
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,768
[Minori] I already knew the answer, but...

153
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:14,780
[Wataru] I'm sorry.

154
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,618
But...

155
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,220
I don't want to lie anymore.

156
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:26,792
Minori.

157
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:36,002
[somber music playing]

158
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,006
Hey, Wataru.

159
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:42,942
Are you on my side?

160
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:45,678
Huh?

161
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,614
Would you do anything I say?

162
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,618
Anything?

163
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:54,920
Yes.

164
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,089
Anything.

165
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,130
[somber music continues]

166
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:13,506
I'm home.

167
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:16,575
Tsubasa, I got milk.

168
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,344
[Yudai] What is going on?

169
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,216
[uneasy music playing]

170
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,754
[Yudai] Mm-hmm.

171
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,123
Yeah, and?

172
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,726
Uh-huh.

173
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,664
I already know that.

174
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:41,667
But if we're found out,
everything will be in vain.

175
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,803
How long do we have to wait for the money?

176
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:49,575
We don't have much time. My marriage
to Minori would become pointless!

[door opens]

00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:30,282
- It's hot, isn't it?
- This never happened before, Teacher.

184

It's fine.
The kids are in their sensitive years.

185

He's probably letting off steam somewhere.

00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,457
I'm so sorry.

187
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,427
You don't have to worry, Ms. Miyake.

188
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,897
Wataru is doing very well recently.

189
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,100
- Really?
- Look at this.

190
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,835
It's his study plan sheet.

191
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,805
Mom.

192
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,574
Wataru. Where were you?

193
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,177
I just had to go get something
I left at school.

194
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,847
You know you should have
contacted your teacher.

195
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,818
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. [chuckles]

196
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:09,622
But don't worry your mother so much.

197
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,561
Sorry.

198
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:20,266
- Wataru?
- I'll come home after studying.

199
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,203
- You can go home without me.
- Hey, Wataru.

200
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,273
[sighs]

201
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:31,010
I'm really sorry for all this trouble.

202
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,478
No worries. Please take a look.

203
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,152
Keiho University?

204
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:43,222
His scores for English
are improving rapidly

205
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,892
so if he keeps it up, it's not impossible
for him to be admitted.

206
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:48,861
[gasps]

207
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,163
Is that so?

208
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:54,967
[Riko] I didn't know.

209
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,002
FIRST CHOICE: KEIHO UNIVERSITY
FACULTY OF EDUCATION TUTOR: KUME

210
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:00,873
Were you okay?

211
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:05,211
Uh... Yeah.

212
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,983
- Give it to me.
- Huh?

213
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,652
I want that.

214
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,623
Huh? This?

215
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,893
- Why?
- You owe me, don't you?

216
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:22,895
Here.

217
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,273
[chuckles]

218
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,407
Thank you.

219
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,546
Where were you really?

220
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,951
I bet you went to see Ms. Kume.

221
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:52,691
- I seriously think you shouldn't.
- It's nothing like that.

222
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,793
What's it to you?

223
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:02,001
[uneasy music playing]

224
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,673
My marriage to Minori
would become pointless!

225
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,709
[Minori] Why did he say
there wasn't much time?

226
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,046
Wait for what money?

227
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,817
Why would marrying me be pointless?

228
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:23,589
Hey.

229
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,491
Hmm?

230
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,394
Who were you talking to on the phone?

231
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,063
What?

232
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,333
Um...

233
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,502
You were

234
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,004
raising your voice, so...

235
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,206
Oh.

236
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,009
It was about work.

237
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,845
Kusunoki messed up again.

238
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,582
I see.

239
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,786
It must be hard working late.

240
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,554
[Yudai] It is.

241
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,224
I'm going to take a bath.

242
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,897
[door opens]

243
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,136
[knocking on door]

244
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,105
[Riko] Can I come in for a second?

245
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,808
- What?
- [door opens]

246
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,510
[chuckles softly]

247
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:20,746
Guess what?

248
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:26,051
Your teacher said getting into Keiho
is possible if you work hard.

249
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:27,586
[chuckles]

250
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:30,255
- I was pleasantly surprised.
- Mom.

251
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,324
Hmm?

252
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,461
Do you...

253
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,033
really believe
you could get married to Yudai?

254
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,204
Why all of a sudden?

255
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:48,574
You know...

256
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,544
he has his real family over there.

257
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,148
[chuckles]

258
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:59,218
Why are you bringing
something like that up now?

259
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,224
I believe in Yudai.

260
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,060
I see.

261
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,632
You're acting strange lately. [chuckles]

262
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:14,800
Did something happen?

263
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,468
Not really.

264
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:23,409
Are you done?

265
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:25,611
I have to study.

266
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,447
Oh. Okay.

267
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:30,983
Try your best.

268
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:49,802
[Yudai] It's only a matter of time
before Minori finds out.

269
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:52,104
Wataru?

270
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,473
Who were you talking to on the phone?

271
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,241
I've got to do something.

272
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,077
[door opens]

273
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:06,085
Hey, are you free on Friday?

274
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:09,455
- Friday?
- Isn't it our first date anniversary?

275
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:13,826
I'll take off work,
how about we eat out together?

276
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,163
[Minori] What's gotten into him?

277
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,233
Huh?

278
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,735
Wow. You remembered?

279
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,038
Of course.

280
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,273
[chuckles]

281
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,109
I'm glad you did.

282
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,212
We can let my mother babysit Tsubasa

283
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,214
and spend some time alone together.

284
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,516
Do you have a restaurant in mind?

285
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:44,022
I'd go anywhere you choose.

286
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,259
Okay, then I'll search for one.

287
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:49,928
I can't wait.

288
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,769
[pensive music playing]

289
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,672
[Sara] It sure is suspicious.

290
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,108
Right?

291
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:07,613
Wataru's visit made him nervous.
He's trying to get on my good side.

292
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:08,747
Yeah.

293
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:12,317
And that phone call is concerning.

294
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:16,655
Not having much time
could be about the baby being born.

295
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,458
But marriage to you being pointless?

296
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,693
What is he plotting?

297
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,166
[Ichiro] Fancy!

298
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:30,602
- A date with your wife?
- You've got to once in a while.

299
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:34,907
I've never eaten anywhere like this.
You're loaded.

300
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:39,144
It's just like our chief
to take good care of his wife.

301
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:40,612
That's why he's married.

302
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,382
That looks like a nice place.

303
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,517
I want to go there with you someday.

304
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,519
What?

305
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,255
I've never been to a restaurant like this.

306
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,992
Right. Someday.

307
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,929
[woman] Really? All right!

308
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,098
[boy] It went that way.

309
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,435
[Hiromi] I'm sorry to make you come by
after work when you're tired.

310
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,438
No, I don't mind. What do you want?

311
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:11,076
I made a lot of chikuwa salad
that Tsubasa likes, so take some home.

312
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,979
You can still eat it tomorrow
if you store it in the fridge.

313
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,914
You called me for this?

314
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,316
Don't be silly.

315
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,884
Just wait a second.

316
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:27,693
[children laughing, screaming]

317
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,228
[woman] Sorry.

318
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,099
[indistinct whispering]

319
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,470
[indistinct whispering continues]

320
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:43,809
Yu-chan!

321
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:45,510
[Hiromi] Take this.

322
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,414
- This is the main reason I called you.
- Oh.

323
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:51,250
[Yudai] What is it?

324
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,253
This is what's in it.

325
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,056
[Yudai] Expensive!

326
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:00,559
- It's an anniversary gift for her.
- Huh?

327
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,229
You have to take special care of Minori.

328
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:07,766
Only then can we be happy, right?

329
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,404
[indistinct whispering]

330
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,673
I know.

331
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:19,611
[Minori] Do you remember...

332
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,414
our first first-date anniversary?

333
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,149
Of course I do.

334
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:28,020
- You wanted to go to Disneyland so badly.
- [chuckles]

335
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:33,392
My dream was to take a picture with you
wearing Mickey Mouse ears.

336
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,594
I took so many part time jobs
to pay for it.

337
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:41,800
We ate churros for the first time
that day, remember?

338
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,302
Hmm? What's that?

339
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:46,672
They're those long,
stick-like things that have ridges--

340
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:49,574
- Ah, those donuts.
- Yeah. That's it.

341
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:50,842
[both chuckle]

342
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,381
That was 17 years ago, huh...

343
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:00,752
Does that feel long ago?

344
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:03,989
Or does it feel recent?

345
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,492
[sighs]

346
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,295
I don't know.

347
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:15,967
My marriage to Minori
would become pointless!

348
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:27,412
This bracelet.

349
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:31,483
This was what started it all.

350
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,721
Tonight...

351
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:39,524
let's start by making a toast
to our first encounter.

352
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:41,259
Yes.

353
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:44,830
Cheers.

354
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:46,665
- Cheers.

[tender music playing]

356
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:06,585
Hey.

357
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,958
I've been wanting to ask you.

358
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,065
How do you feel about me?

359
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,869
Why do you ask?

360
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,413
We've had 17 years together.

361
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,017
During this time...

362
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,387
have you really...

363
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,257
loved me?

[light music playing]

365
00:23:58,737 --> 00:23:59,771
I...

366
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,841
Mm?

367
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:08,213
[phone buzzing]

368
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:09,648
Mm?

369
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:14,186
[phone buzzing]

370
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,888
- [chuckles]
- [phone buzzing]

371
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:18,156
Sorry.

372
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,495
Just a minute.

373
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:27,699
Hello?

374
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:31,236
Yes.

375
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:34,673
What?

376
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,944
[gasps] I see. I'll be right there.

377
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:42,447
- What's the matter?
- Grandpa got taken to the hospital.

378
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,749
- What?
- I have to go.

379
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,184
I'll go too.

380
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:48,019
I need you to go pick up Tsubasa.

381
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:52,424
[uneasy music playing]

382
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:10,542
Hello? It's me.

383
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:26,324
Grandpa.

384
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,629
[Minori] The cancer is spreading?

385
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:34,165
[doctor] Unfortunately,
it's advanced further.

386
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,837
With it spreading to this level,
treatment by surgery is difficult.

387
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:45,977
[Minori] I didn't realize it at all.

388
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:48,914
I'm sorry.

389
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:57,088
Grandpa.

390
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,393
Oh.

391
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:03,795
Minori, it's you.

392
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,765
You must have been surprised.

393
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:08,533
Sorry.

394
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:13,405
Have you been suffering for a long time?

395
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,641
Why didn't you tell me?

396
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:20,612
I didn't want to worry you.

397
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,420
Were you doing something special today?

398
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,423
Oh? Ah.

399
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:35,560
It was my anniversary with Yudai.

400
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:37,462
I see.

401
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,831
I feel bad for ruining it.

402
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,800
It's okay.

403
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:45,503
I seems I don't have long to live.

404
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:51,743
Minori.

405
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,648
There's something I want to tell you
before I die.

406
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,017
Stop it.

407
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:01,586
Don't say something like that.

408
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,756
That bracelet...

409
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:08,860
- This?
- Yes.

410
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:11,696
Do you know where it's from?

411
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:13,798
Where it's from?

412
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:15,934
Tsukishiro Jewelry, right?

413
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:17,836
Yes.

414
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:20,939
That was given...

415
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,142
by Susumu Tsukishiro

416
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:26,978
to Miyuki.

417
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,147
Tsukishiro...

418
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,383
Susumu...

419
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,153
He's the chairman of Tsukishiro Group.

420
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,301
[Minori] This man?

421
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:51,403
SUSUMU TSUKISHIRO

422
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,773
Yes.

423
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:01,279
Why did this prominent man
give this to Mom?

424
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,719
That man...

425
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,990
is your father.

426
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:19,064
[somber music playing]

427
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:22,233
Forgive me for not telling you until now.

428
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,606
Really?

429
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:33,978
Why?

430
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,248
Why didn't you tell me?

431
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:40,351
Minori.

432
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,122
You probably were aware

433
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,158
of why you didn't have a father.

434
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:51,463
[woman] Karma got her
for having an affair.

435
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,201
What Miyuki did...

436
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,003
was unacceptable.

437
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:01,973
But the same can be said

438
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:04,676
about Susumu Tsukishiro.

439
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,280
In spite of that...

440
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:14,352
the moment he knew
that Miyuki was pregnant

441
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,057
he abruptly left Miyuki.

442
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:25,764
But...

443
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,869
after Miyuki died in an accident

444
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:34,606
he came to see me.

445
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,576
On the day

446
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,113
of the accident

447
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:45,884
he and Miyuki saw each other.

448
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:48,820
[young Minori] What happened, Mom?

449
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,488
You look pretty today.

450
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:54,526
So that's why.

451
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:57,228
He tried...

452
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:02,567
to settle everything with money.

453
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:05,703
I couldn't forgive him.

454
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,575
That kind of man...

455
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:15,847
wasn't worthy of being called a father.

456
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:21,085
That's why I never told you

457
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:25,423
the true identity of your father.

458
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:29,561
I'm sorry.

459
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:34,899
Minori.

460
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,838
Can you hand me my bag?

461
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,660
There's a passbook inside.

462
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:12,770
That passbook

463
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:15,173
is what he gave me

464
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,943
as child support for you, Minori.

465
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:37,695
So much...

466
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,066
He also gave me stocks.

467
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:46,404
I have it arranged

468
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:50,875
so that when I die,
you will get all of them.

469
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:58,383
Don't talk about dying.

470
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:02,654
[sobs] What am I going to do

471
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,456
without you, Grandpa?

472
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:10,695
You have your beloved family,
don't you, Minori?

473
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,166
You should live happily

474
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:17,902
with Yudai...

475
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,539
and Tsubasa.

476
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:26,411
[Minori] I can't let my grandfather

477
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,815
worry about me.

478
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,051
Yes.

479
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,955
I will.

480
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:43,695
[chuckles]

481
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,899
[Minori sobbing]

482
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:54,072
[somber music playing]

483
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,613
[Minori] Susumu Tsukishiro left my mother

484
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:06,050
as soon as he found out

485
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,619
my mother was pregnant.

486
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:11,389
On the other hand

487
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,624
Yudai said....

488
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,129
He says he can't wait to meet the baby.

489
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:24,268
Why?

490
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,007
Grandpa...

491
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,810
no matter how much money you give me

492
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,048
my happy home is no more.

493
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:40,118
How long do we have to wait for the money?

494
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,557
TSUKISHIRO ANNOUNCES
THEIR FIRST EUROPEAN STORE

495

[foreboding music playing]

497
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:00,405
[Minori] Could it be?

498
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,444
But...

499
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,580
how would Yudai know about

500
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,650
a secret that's unknown to me?

501
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,723
[munches, laughs]

502
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,796
[Minori panting]

503
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,131
[Hiromi] Coming!

504
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,200
- [door opens]
- [gasps]

505
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,502
I'm so sorry I'm late.

506
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:33,538
Haven't you heard from Yudai?

507
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,774
He took Tsubasa home a while ago.

508
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,378
I forgot.

509
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:44,782
I'm the one who told him to,
but I got confused.

510
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:46,451
Don't worry, it can't be helped.

511
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:49,587
So, how is your grandfather doing?

512
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:54,659
The cancer is spreading?

513
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,329
[Minori] They can only delay
the spread with medication.

514
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:00,498
Nothing else they can do.

515
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:05,103
But with the recent advancements
in medicine...

516
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:09,340
I'm sure he'll be all right.

517
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,410
Minori.

518
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,379
Try to stay strong.

519
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:20,218
Thank you.

520
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:26,924
Yudai told me you didn't have time to eat.

521
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:29,861
Oh. I guess so.

522
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,865
I wish I had some sweets in the house.

523
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:37,268
I know, I'll go get some
at the convenience store.

524
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:40,471
- It'll only be a minute.
- Don't worry about it.

525
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,807
Okay. Huh?

526
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:45,176
- Where did I put my wallet?
- [phone chimes]

527
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:48,713
I keep putting it somewhere
but I forget where.

YOU MUST HAVE HEARD FROM MINORI.

WE SHOULD GET MOVING.

00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:04,762
Yes.

533
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:07,298
I'll be right back. [chuckles]

534
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,469
- Be careful.
- [Hiromi] I will.

00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,391

KISARAGI NEW FAMILY (3)

555

[gasps]

556
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:47,999
[closing theme music playing]

557
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:54,238
[Minori in Japanese] How can even
my mother-in-law betray me?

558
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:59,310
How can they be hoping
to make a new family?

559
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:15,293
I won't let them.

560
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:19,463
I can't let them.

561
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:22,900
[laughing]

562
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:27,638
I won't let them.

563
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:34,679
[Minori] It's our family's big project.

564
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:38,149
They were all involved in a plot
to steal your assets?

565
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:39,750
[Minori]
You'll catch a cold like that.

566
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:41,852
[Wataru]
I'm on your side, Minori.
