1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:08,942
[Yudai] Minori told you, right?
Once the money comes in, we move.

2
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:13,279
[Hiromi] His condition sounds serious.

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,116
He might not have more than a few months.

4
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:22,789
[Riko] I'm sending you the photos
from the dinner party.

5
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:24,391
[gasps]

6
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:28,695
[Minori] His mom has been working
against me, too!

7
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:34,300
They are creating a new family?

8
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:48,648
I'll never...

9
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,652
forgive them!

10
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:59,059
[Yudai] When are we getting the money?

11
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,065
We're running out of time!
What's the point of marrying her?

12
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,535
[laptop chimes]

13
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:15,275
THANK YOU FOR THE BROOCH.

14
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,944
[Hiromi] Glad he went to the hospital.

15
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:19,846
I didn't have to give him the present!

16
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,382
[notification chimes]

17
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,417
[Riko] Looks great on you!

18
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:26,953
[Hiromi] I'll pass it on to you, Riko!

19
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,256
[Riko] Goodness! Thank you so much!

20
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,925
[Yudai] How's it going over there?

21
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:36,229
[Hiromi] I'll buy some cake
and play the nice mother-in-law.

22
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,832
I owe you. Thank you.

23
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:40,900
[laughs]

24
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,446
[dramatic piano playing]

25
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,487
[laughs]

26
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,099
- [door opens]
- [Hiromi] Hello!

27
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:18,438
I got some shortcake!
You like it, don't you?

28
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,407
Yes, thank you.

29
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:25,478
Let's see.

30
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:30,583
I'll make some nice hot tea.
Minori, tea or coffee?

31
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,153
Whatever you're having.

32
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:34,754
Are you sure?

33
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:36,756
Well, how about this?

34
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,091
Someone gave it to me.

35
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:39,759
[dramatic music continues]

36
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:47,433
[Minori] All your kindness was a lie.

37
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,435
You...

38
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:52,839
only wanted my money.

39
00:02:55,842 --> 00:03:01,181
[Hiromi] At last, our long-awaited plan
is coming together.

40
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,285
Our life is about to begin!

41
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,363
[music ends]

42
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:18,565
You, too...

43
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,968
are beyond forgiveness.

44
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,972
[theme music playing]

45
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:21,961
UNTIL I DESTROYED
MY HUSBAND'S OTHER FAMILY

46
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,406
This is so good!

47
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:36,175
[Minori] Honestly

48
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,912
I want to spit it right in your face.

49
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,383
You are so thoughtful. Thank you.

50
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:48,821
Of course. We're family.

51
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:54,127
[Hiromi, laughs] Some "family" you are.
You make me laugh.

52
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:56,963
Do you think

53
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:01,734
I could be a wonderful mom like you?

54
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:06,105
You're a much better mom, Minori!

55
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,509
I was working all the time
when Yudai was young.

56
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,644
I couldn't spend much time with him.

57
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:13,746
I didn't know that.

58
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,184
[Minori] How did Yudai and she

59
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,988
learn about my money?

60
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,895
Do they have any connections
with the Tsukishiro Group?

61
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,165
By the way

62
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:37,737
you never told me about
when you were younger.

63
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,441
There's nothing interesting to tell.

64
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,010
I want to hear!

65
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,146
- Do you?
- Absolutely!

66
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:49,816
Well...

67
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,654
I've kept this a secret.

68
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,322
What is it?

69
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,262
[Hiromi] Me in my younger days.

70
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,898
Believe it or not,
I used to be pretty popular.

71
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,871
Oh, my gosh! You're so cute.

72
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,040
This is sure to turn heads.

73
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,844
I met Yudai's dad through this work
related to a pageant.

74
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,446
We got married and moved to Tokyo.

75
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:25,718
But he turned out to be a gambler.

76
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,488
He racked up a ton of debt

77
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:31,290
and quickly got in over his head.

78
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,361
So you took the young Yudai

79
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,630
and left him.

80
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:39,799
Yes.

81
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,503
But it didn't get any easier after that.

82
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,477
[Hiromi] I worked day and night.

83
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,614
[groans]

84
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:58,718
And still, we could barely eat.

85
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,396
I felt sorry for what my son
had to endure.

86
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,333
Yudai, come!

87
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,873
You'll show them what you're made of.

88
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,476
HOUSEKEEPER WANTED

89
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:27,413
Then I got a job at the house
of the president of a big company.

90
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,550
The president of a big company?

91
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,486
Here is a premium piece
I've selected for you.

92
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,188
[exclaims in awe]

93
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,123
- How beautiful!
- Please.

94
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,258
Pick it up and take a closer look.

95
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,894
My wife has earrings in that series.

96
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:45,932
More champagne, please.

97
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,905
After I became a housekeeper,
my life changed.

98
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,741
Changed how?

99
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,879
Through doing housework as a job,
I built my confidence.

100
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:04,717
I also found a true friend
for the first time.

101
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,520
[Hiromi] She was a young employee.

102
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,391
- [woman] Great work.
- Thank you.

103
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,728
- [employee] Sarubobo!
- What?

104
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,198
I'm sorry. That charm
is from my hometown, so...

105
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:23,569
Really? I lived there, too,
until I was six.

106
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,571
Oh, my goodness!

107
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:29,842
I've never come across someone
from my hometown in Tokyo.

108
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:33,679
But she was...

109
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,617
having an affair.

110
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,320
[ominous music playing]

111
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,189
I'll get you more tea.

112
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:49,962
[Minori] Could she be...

113
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,006
This is really good. Take it.

114
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,376
[employee] Thank you!
I'd love it! [chuckles]

115
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:07,213
- See you.
- Thank you.

116
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:18,357
- [employee] Thank you for waiting.
- [man] What do you want to eat today?

117
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:19,959
Oh, watch out.

118
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,762
[Hiromi] She suddenly grew distant

119
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:27,166
to conceal her affair with the future
president, Susumu Tsukishiro.

120
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,277
She might be in the shadows now

121
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:42,615
but she could become
Mrs. Tsukishiro someday.

122
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,785
That left me with mixed feelings.

123
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:51,891
TO THE EDITORIAL DEPARTMENT

124
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:55,728
[moans]

125
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,430
[chuckles]

126
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,300
[tapping table]

127
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:04,870
[Hiromi] Serves you right!

128
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,606
[laughs]

129
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,908
[moans]

130
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:30,496
- Kisaragi!
- Yes?

131
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,099
The president wants to see you
about the tabloid.

132
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,469
- What tabloid?
- Just come!

133
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,205
- Hurry up! Move!
- Wait.

134
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:52,018
I pleaded with her
to end the relationship.

135
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:56,389
But she never listened.

136
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:03,162
Sure enough,
she got dumped and quit her job.

137
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,331
Then I heard...

138
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,068
she was in a car accident or something.

139
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:12,772
A car accident?

140
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,610
Goodness, that got depressing.

141
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,711
Let's eat.

142
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:24,050
[Minori] She was talking about my mom,
I'm sure.

143
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,586
[Hiromi] When I heard she died

144
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:32,391
and her daughter
was going to inherit a fortune

145
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,795
my heart burned with envy
of the daughter... you.

146
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:41,634
[Minori] So she worked
at the Tsukishiro household.

147
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:43,836
It all makes sense now.

148
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:49,041
[Hiromi] When I found out you were
in the same school as Yudai

149
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,977
I knew it was a godsend.

150
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:58,084
That's when I found a way to achieve
a bright, glittering future.

151
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,922
But now, I'm truly happy

152
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,491
because of you and Yudai.

153
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:07,960
Me, too.

154
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,764
I'm so blessed to have you...

155
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:14,967
as a mother-in-law.

156
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,139
[Minori] I hate you.

157
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:22,508
I will never

158
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,511
ever let you become happy.

159
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,848
Gosh, that was good!

160
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,650
Thank you so much for the treat.

161
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,252
[both chuckle]

162
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,556
[Yudai] Now it's time, finally.

163
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:41,994
I've been waiting for this
for a long time.

164
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:44,029
[door opens]

165
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,238
Hi.

166
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:56,475
Hi.

167
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,147
Mom told me about your grandpa.

168
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:05,718
It must be tough.

169
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:11,023
Mm.

170
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:16,428
And Tsubasa?

171
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,531
He's asleep.

172
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,499
Thank you.

173
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:27,339
I'm sorry about today. You booked
such a lovely place for us.

174
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,277
It wasn't just any situation.
Don't you worry.

175
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,686
You must be exhausted.

176
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,222
You should go to bed.

177
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,064
I think I will.

178
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,213
But before that...

179
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,217
I want your answer.

180
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:13,652
To what?

181
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,696
To what I asked you today.

182
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:27,466
You haven't answered.

183
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,035
What?

184
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,239
What do I...

185
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:36,809
really mean to you?

186
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,112
These 17 years...

187
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:43,682
have you ever...

188
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,753
really loved me?

189
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,626
Do you really want me to answer?

190
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,697
I couldn't ask this on any other day.

191
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,168
Okay.

192
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,775
I've never told you this before.

193
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,378
[indistinct chatter]

194
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:15,948
[Yudai] Among us boys

195
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,452
you were always the favorite.

196
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,659
[low, dark music playing]

197
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,229
Was I really?

198
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,298
I had no idea.

199
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,034
[chuckles]

200
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,969
I was too embarrassed to tell you.

201
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:38,203
[Minori laughs]

202
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:42,408
And?

203
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,578
The first time we talked

204
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:48,514
were you happy?

205
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,859
Was I happy?

206
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,433
It was more like,
"I finally did it!" I guess.

207
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,103
It was a coincidence

208
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,407
but that's how we ended up together.

209
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,477
[Minori] Was it really a coincidence?

210
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,447
Weren't you waiting for a chance

211
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,350
to get close to me?

212
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,322
Can I get you anything?

213
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,259
I'll have barley tea.

214
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,295
Yes, ma'am.

215
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:47,973
[Yudai] That day,
my destiny was set in motion.

216
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,580
Is that girl Minori Kume?

217
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:59,251
What? How do you know?

218
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,786
A bit of history.

219
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,856
- History?
- Anyway

220
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,159
you should ask her out.

221
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:11,030
Gosh, where did that come from?

222
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:16,435
She's so cute. Feelings will grow
as you spend time together.

223
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:18,437
I can't.

224
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,241
I like someone else.

225
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,950
Just date both without getting caught.

226
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,053
[foreboding music playing]

227
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,254
Huh?

228
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,388
No way!

229
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:41,326
Do you want to live your whole life
constantly worried about money?

230
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,562
What?

231
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,564
I don't get it.

232
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:48,567
This is a huge deal for us, you and me.

233
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,603
If you marry her

234
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,443
you'll never, ever have to worry
about money. We can be happy!

235
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:01,713
[Minori] Where is it?

236
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:05,284
[Yudai] Honestly,
I'd had enough of being poor.

237
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,119
So I...

238
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,620
[student] You're so clumsy!

239
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,122
[Minori] I'm sorry!

240
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:12,091
[Yudai] Excuse me!

241
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:15,861
Did you drop this?

242
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:21,200
I asked her out,
just as Mom had planned.

243
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,068
But...

244
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,438
we crossed paths again as adults.

245
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:30,042
Riko had become a single mom.

246
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,278
At that moment

247
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,881
I remembered what Mom had said.

248
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,351
Just date both without getting caught.

249
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:40,619
[music ends]

250
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,456
[Yudai] My double life is almost over.

251
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:50,162
Here you go.

252
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,799
Thank you.

253
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:56,502
[can opens]

254
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:00,572
Hey.

255
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:03,275
Tell me the truth.

256
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:05,611
While we were going out...

257
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,048
were you ever attracted to someone else?

258
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,151
What?

259
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,319
Of course not.

260
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,589
When we met in high school...

261
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,193
I thought...

262
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,764
"Hey, maybe this is fate."

263
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,405
If I had another life to live...

264
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,510
I would...

265
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,652
choose you all over again.

266
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:51,123
[emotional music playing]

267
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,094
You okay?

268
00:19:58,163 --> 00:19:59,298
[exclaims softly]

269
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,707
[voice breaking]
I was savoring the feeling

270
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,176
of being so lucky.

271
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:15,414
So...

272
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:17,950
to answer your question...

273
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,688
these 17 years...

274
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,027
have truly been a blessing...

275
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,432
because of you.

276
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,405
Let's keep going strong.

277
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:46,311
[Minori] And you'd never say you love me.

278
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:03,996
[raspy breathing]

279
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,198
[softly] Dad.

280
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,000
[eerie stinger]

281
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:15,140
[Sara] Cut ties with them quickly,
so they don't get a single penny.

282
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,911
We need to get the ball rolling
on your divorce.

283
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,316
Divorce...

284
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,090
Okay.

285
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,661
By the way...

286
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,098
what happened to that woman's son?

287
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:43,168
Would you do anything for me?

288
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:45,170
"Anything"?

289
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:51,276
Uh...

290
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,315
I think...

291
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:01,019
I'll have a job for him later.

292
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,855
[eerie humming playing]

293
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,293
I'm looking forward
to seeing you tomorrow.

294
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:10,262
I'm Minori Kume.

295
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:13,832
Got something on you.

296
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:20,739
[sighs]

297
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:28,246
[Yudai] Hang in there a little longer.

298
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:31,049
We'll handle the divorce and marriage

299
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:34,720
once her stocks are in my name
and all the preparations are done.

300
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,423
[Riko]
Will it really work out that easily?

301
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,694
There's no way she could manage
that much wealth.

302
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:46,231
She'll come running to me for help,
so I'll take charge.

303
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:50,535
You think you know everything
about your wife.

304
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,138
Seventeen years!

305
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:56,641
I've been with her since high school.

306
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,344
No one understands her better than me.

307
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:03,181
Since high school...

308
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,418
That's a pretty long time.

309
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,823
Timing is everything in a divorce.

310
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:15,794
With Tsubasa's last name changing to Kume

311
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:18,997
maybe it should be right before
his elementary school.

312
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,408
Kume?

313
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,879
[suspenseful music playing]

314
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,287
THE STUDY PLAN APPROVAL BY MS. KUME

315
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,434
[Riko] Why didn't I see this before?
I was so blind.

316
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:05,677
Is this...

317
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,046
her handwriting?

318
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,424
Is she going to take Wataru away from me?

319
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:28,066
- [door opens]
- [footsteps approaching]

320
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,507
Where are you going?

321
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,017
I asked where you were going.

322
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:50,956
Wait!

323
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:52,858
- Get out of the way.
- No, wait!

324
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:54,960
You're not going to that woman!

325
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,262
I'm not going to allow it!

326
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:08,306
She is...

327
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,677
not what you think.

328
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,181
My grades went up...

329
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:19,484
because of her advice.

330
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:27,425
That woman is trying to get revenge on me.

331
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:30,328
And she's using you for that!

332
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:33,865
I know that.

333
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:36,434
What?

334
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:38,737
I know everything.

335
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,840
Then why?

336
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:45,076
Because...

337
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:48,313
I still like...

338
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:54,319
Enough already! [sobs]

339
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:57,722
You know she's lying,
and you're still going to defend her?

340
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,594
She's the victim.

341
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,635
You think you did nothing wrong?

342
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,840
It was you who went for a married man!

343
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,211
Have you ever thought about...

344
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,682
how it feels to be cheated on?

345
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:28,820
I...

346
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,392
I had no idea how much she was suffering.

347
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:39,497
Mom.

348
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:44,302
We're the ones who inflicted pain.

349
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:48,540
I just thought...

350
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:50,976
I just wanted

351
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:54,412
you to have a dad.

352
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:57,382
That's just your selfish agenda.

353
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:02,621
You're blaming me for your affair?

354
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:06,324
No! That's not what I'm saying!

355
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,428
[sobs]

356
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:11,529
Do you...

357
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:17,068
do you have any idea
how much I've done to raise you?

358
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,338
Hell if I know!

359
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:24,542
- Wataru, wait!
- Don't touch me!

360
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:26,778
- Wataru!
- Let me go!

361
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:30,849
[door opens]

362
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,668
[rain pattering]

[doorbell ringing]

364
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,180
[Minori] Yes?

365
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:09,821
What happened?

366
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,525
