1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:04,838
You and I...

2
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:09,743
are getting a divorce.

3
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:15,548
[somber music playing]

4
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:16,649
[gasps]

5
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:20,754
No, please, Minori. Don't say that.

6
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,424
You're the only one I love!

7
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,892
You have to believe me!

8
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:30,964
[somber music continues]

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,401
Liar.

10
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:42,275
Minori?

11
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:44,811
[Minori] Tsubasa and I
will leave tomorrow.

12
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:47,247
Sign the papers.

13
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:48,948
Minori, wait...

14
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,050
[door closes]

15
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:53,686
[indistinct whispering]

16
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:56,790
[flesh squelches]

17
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,794
So, where are you staying now?

18
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,265
At a hotel with Tsubasa.

19
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,335
You held on.

20
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,571
I'm proud of you.

21
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:14,674
[Minori] But...

22
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:18,344
but it's not over yet.

23
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:22,849
[Riko] Wataru.

24
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:26,953
[doorbell chimes]

25
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:30,990
Wataru!

26
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,394
You...

27
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:37,430
[uneasy music playing]

28
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,531
[Riko] What do you want?

29
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:45,538
[theme music playing]

30
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:31,818
UNTIL I DESTROYED
MY HUSBAND'S OTHER FAMILY

31
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,955
Are you here to ridicule me?

32
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:39,392
Ridicule you?

33
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,662
Why?

34
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,565
Isn't this enough?

35
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,538
Give me back my Wataru.

36
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,741
Give you back...

37
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,343
Stop it!

38
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,580
You took my son from me!

39
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,083
I took him?

40
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,719
Yes, you did!

41
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,390
You flirted with him
to trick him, didn't you?

42
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:14,027
It's not my fault that Wataru
doesn't want to come home, is it?

43
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:19,666
[sobs]

44
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,268
Don't you say his name!

45
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,339
It's all your fault!

46
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,308
He's changed

47
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,877
ever since he met you.

48
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,280
What you're doing is a crime.

49
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,383
You manipulated a high-schooler

50
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,386
and even kidnapped him!

51
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,058
[Riko sobbing]

52
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:51,764
So...

53
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,572
adultery is not a crime?

54
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,409
What?

55
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:07,347
Isn't it a crime...

56
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:13,453
to have an affair
and wreck someone's family?

57
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:19,058
[somber music playing]

58
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:21,794
[Minori] Hey, Riko.

59
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,334
How does it feel
to have lost your precious family?

60
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,773
Stop messing with me!

61
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:34,874
[grunts]

62
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,277
[whimpers]

63
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,648
You're the one messing with me!

64
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:46,919
[somber music playing]

65
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,357
Damn it.

66
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:56,329
Damn it!

67
00:04:56,896 --> 00:05:00,366
[grunts, whimpers]

68
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,568
[Yudai screams]

69
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,672
[sobbing]

70
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,742
Just tell me where Wataru is.

71
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,211
Please.

72
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,085
[sobbing]

73
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:20,720
I'm sorry!

74
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:25,158
I apologize for everything I did!

75
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:31,064
[sobbing]

76
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,367
Please give me back my son!

77
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,273
[Riko sobbing]

78
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:47,213
[soft thumping footsteps]

79
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:57,657
[somber music playing]

80
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,225
Wataru! [gasps]

81
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:03,663
Where have you been? I've been so worried!

82
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,667
She did something to you?

83
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,303
Minori did nothing.

84
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,440
I just ran off.

85
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:16,776
So...

86
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,245
don't blame her.

87
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:23,683
[gasps] Why are you defending this woman?

88
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,020
I get it. She's threatening you, right?

89
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,122
No.

90
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,591
It's all my doing.

91
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,361
I just fell in love with her.

92
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:37,463
[gasps]

93
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,134
[Riko] Fell in love?

94
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,004
You're joking!

95
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:47,874
[gasps]

96
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,510
[laughing] Stop it!

97
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,313
[whimpers]

98
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,917
Why, why her, of all people?

99
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,888
A pathetic woman, fooled by her husband!

100
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,089
Mom!

101
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:04,690
[Minori] Wataru.

102
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:08,394
Do you know...

103
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,731
it was your mom

104
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,035
who cut my hair?

105
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,238
What?

106
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:21,674
But you...

107
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,779
didn't tell Yudai, did you?

108
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,687
I wondered

109
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,156
why you didn't.

110
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:42,295
But I realized.

111
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,068
Were you afraid?

112
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:55,208
Did you think that if he found out
I knew about the affair

113
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,012
he'd drop you in a heartbeat

114
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,951
because what he really wanted
was my money?

115
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:07,820
You did, didn't you?

116
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,124
For Yudai...

117
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:17,330
you're nothing more than a mistress.

118
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,200
So...

119
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,704
you couldn't tell him.

120
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:25,938
No!

121
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:29,342
Yudai has loved only me!

122
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,377
Not you! Me!

123
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,779
[Riko] He promised he'd marry me

124
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,549
no matter what!

125
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:39,485
[chuckles softly]

126
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:44,757
Maybe he did.

127
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:52,265
Money or not, Yudai might have chosen you.

128
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,334
That's right.

129
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,104
He'd never...

130
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,339
But can you choose him?

131
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,578
What does that mean?

132
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:08,848
Mom.

133
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,584
I...

134
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,419
I'll come home...

135
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,126
if you break up with Yudai.

136
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,032
[Wataru] He can't...

137
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,739
make you truly happy.

138
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,143
[sobs]

139
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,879
[Wataru] You choose me...

140
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:42,882
or him.

141
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:46,686
It's up to you.

142
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,623
[somber music playing]

143
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:59,932
[indistinct whispering]

144
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,101
[flesh squelches]

145
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,041
[Yudai] How have you been?

146
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,111
Okay.

147
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,615
I'm glad I finally got a hold of you.

148
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,485
I'm sorry I made you worry.

149
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,357
It's finally over.

150
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:28,327
Riko.

151
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,030
I'm sorry for the wait.

152
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:32,732
Now we can--

153
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:33,933
We should break up.

154
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,871
What?

155
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,077
It's time...

156
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,247
we ended this.

157
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,517
What are you talking about?

158
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:55,087
I got a divorce for you and Wataru.

159
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,057
Yudai.

160
00:10:58,858 --> 00:10:59,859
Yes?

161
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:03,896
Have you ever really...

162
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:08,367
loved me?

163
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:12,571
Of course.

164
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,344
Riko, you have to believe me.

165
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,415
We've always loved each other.

166
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:26,686
[Riko] I loved you.

167
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:28,754
- Please pick it up.
- Or...

168
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,223
I wanted someone to love me.

169
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,892
- Watch it!
- [gasps]

170
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:34,694
I'm sorry.

171
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,267
- [Yudai] Here.
- Thank you.

172
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,703
Miyake?

173
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:46,939
Kisaragi?

174
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:52,878
[somber music playing]

175
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:55,815
Are you okay?

176
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,386
[Riko] I let myself depend on him.

177
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,455
Hey.

178
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,123
Hm?

179
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,259
Aren't you going to leave her?

180
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:09,929
I am.

181
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,231
But...

182
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,734
I have to

183
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,236
take care of something.

184
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,673
What are you saying?

185
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,779
Use this money to start your salon.

186
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:30,683
That woman

187
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,187
is going to come into a fortune.

188
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,156
A fortune?

189
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:41,393
Until then, my son cannot divorce her.
Please be patient.

190
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,469
[Riko] Even so...

191
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,106
he had become someone
I couldn't live without.

192
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,911
Can I see you tonight?

193
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:02,882
[Yudai] What, tonight? Why? What's wrong?

194
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:04,950
Nothing.

195
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,187
I just want to see you.

196
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:12,057
[Yudai] Ah. I want to see you, too

197
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,160
but I told her I'd come home early.

198
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,530
Ah. [chuckles]

199
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:21,300
Okay. That's fine. I'm sorry about that.

200
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:26,272
Is money really the only reason
he won't divorce?

201
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,440
I've kept pretending

202
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,477
not to see that fear.

203
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:37,416
That's not true.

204
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,787
I couldn't see you when I needed you

205
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,790
for more than ten years.

206
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:50,062
How could you say I've been loved?

207
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,531
Well, that's because the money...

208
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,866
Liar.

209
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,540
You...

210
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,244
love your wife.

211
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:10,950
No.

212
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,753
Did Wataru say something?

213
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,724
He showed up at my office
to tell me to break up with you.

214
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,527
Wataru did?

215
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:26,999
It turned into a real issue at work,
and I got suspended because of it.

216
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,737
[laughs]

217
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:33,739
Pathetic.

218
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:35,808
What?

219
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:44,617
We're pathetic.

220
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,654
Both you and me.

221
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,926
[somber music playing]

222
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:00,866
Goodbye.

223
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,369
Wait!

224
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,106
What about the baby?

225
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,377
You needed my help to raise Wataru.

226
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,245
I don't need your help!

227
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,520
You're not part of my family, you know.

228
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,398
[door opens, closes]

229
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:38,137
[sighs deeply]

230
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,407
That was a big sigh.

231
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,844
What's up? She dumped you?

232
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,782
- [Wataru] Nothing like that.
- Really?

233
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,151
I wish she would already.

234
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:56,922
Just tell her you like her.

235
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,893
Then you'll crash and burn.

236
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,363
What?

237
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,099
Wataru.

238
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,268
You have no idea...

239
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:14,139
what it's like to love someone

240
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,041
you shouldn't.

241
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:23,749
- I know.
- No, you don't.

242
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,017
I do, God damn it!

243
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:28,854
Oh.

244
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,891
I'm sorry.

245
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,329
[sighs]

246
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,631
Well...

247
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,800
do what you want.

248
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,404
If you can take the punishment.

249
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,946
Here, I'm giving this back.

250
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,149
What?

[somber music playing]

252
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,093

00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:47,099
Are you okay?

[light music playing]

262
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,647
I don't think it's bad.

263
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:03,849
Adultery.

264
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:05,951
- What?
- Because

265
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,153
you can't help falling in love.

266
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,126
Thank you.

267
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,430
Only you would take my side like this.

268
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,800
- After my suspension, let's get dinner.
- Oh.

269
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:25,938
I don't think

270
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,173
I'm on your side.

271
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:30,242
What?

272
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,411
I'm okay with adultery.

273
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:36,115
But getting caught is another story.

274
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,486
You underestimated
both your wife and mistress.

275
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,288
You thought they'd never catch on.

276
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,657
- No, I never--
- You know...

277
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,495
I hate men who look down on women.

278
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,698
So I wanted to tell you, face to face.

279
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:54,566
What?

280
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,405
Go to hell.

281
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,108
You scumbag.

[somber music playing]

283
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,350

really catch up with you, don't they?

[somber music playing]

289
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,205
[Ichiro] That's so lame. Seriously!

290
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,575
- That's enough.
- I was shocked!

291
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,544
You were betraying your wife?

292
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:42,247
- You're an idiot!
- Keep it down!

293
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:44,616
But seriously...

294
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,419
you really married her for money?

295
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,188
What?

296
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,192
Yes, I sure did.

297
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,127
That's mind-boggling.

298
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,129
I know.

299

Marrying someone
you don't even like for money--

300
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,167
That's not it.

301
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:03,769
What?

302
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,338
Even if it's for the money

303
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,241
can you really stake your life?

304
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,110
Isn't it because

305
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,079
you loved her

306
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,316
that you stayed together for so long?

You wanted to talk?

327
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:20,906
And the divorce papers?

328
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,508
Did you sign them?

You haven't.

Why not?

I know an apology won't make it right.

But please

333
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,209
forgive me.

334
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:05,784
Is there any way...

335
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:10,188
we could...

336
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,359
start over? You and me?

337
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,699
Is this because Riko dumped you?

338
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:25,370
Or you're feeling a bit lonely?

339
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,607
- No.
- Then what?

340
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:31,877
I...

341
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,448
started dating you

342
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:38,750
because my mom told me to.

343
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:41,853
But the truth was...

344
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,990
I liked Riko.

345
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:50,962
It was...

346
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,432
all for the money.

I...

00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,476
I didn't love you, Minori.

though you may not believe me...

351
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,526
since we got married

352
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,830
and we had Tsubasa...

Give me a break.

I know it's too late.

361
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:02,801
But with you and Tsubasa gone...

362
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,606
I finally realized.

363
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:11,276
So...

364
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,178
please.

365
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,783
Can you give me...

366

just one more chance?

367
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,595
I'm really sorry

368
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:33,865
that I hurt you so much.

You know...

372
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:58,690
I took revenge on you.

373
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:01,793
What?

374
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:04,863
I wanted you...

375
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:09,467
to realize the sins

376
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,338
you've committed.

377
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,679
I used Wataru for that

378
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:25,183
and took everything from you.

379
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,860
I wanted you to know what it's like

380
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:39,698
to be betrayed by someone you trusted!

00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,635
I wanted to tear you apart

382
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,439
and destroy everything.

383
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:51,943
I wanted to make you beg me

384
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,747
for forgiveness, no matter what it took!

385
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:00,485
I thought

386
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,855
that would save me...

387
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:08,793
and make me feel better.

388
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,467
But...

389
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,305
the pain is still there.

390
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:29,547
I wanted to see you in despair.

391
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:34,452
I hate you so much I could kill you.

392
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,825
But each time I get you cornered...

393
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:45,697
the pain gets worse.

394
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:49,834
Perhaps

395
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:52,704
it wasn't...

396
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,539
[breathes heavily]

397
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:57,442
...that I wanted to hurt you.

398
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:01,813
Instead...

399
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,718
[sighs deeply]

400
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:09,220
I only...

401
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,927
wanted you to look at me.

402
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,532
[sobbing] I only

403
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,568
wanted you to know

404
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,072
that I'm here.

405
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:31,810
I only...

406
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,782
wanted you to love me.

I'm so sorry.

410
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:59,904
I'll never put you through this again.

411
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:04,909
Minori.

412
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:08,980
I love you.

413
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,451
I'm telling the truth now.

414
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:24,529
So...

415
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,467
let's start over.

416
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,305
Please.

417
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,083
I'm glad.

418
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,086
Minori.

419
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:55,593
But...

420
00:29:58,062 --> 00:29:59,063
do you mean it?

421
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:02,433
Of course.

422
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:05,236
I love you

423
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,740
from the bottom of my heart.

424

Minori.

426
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:17,415
I love you.

427
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:21,753
I don't feel it.

428
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:24,422
What?

429
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:27,592
Say it again.

430
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,796
I... I love you.

431
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,600
[chuckles]

432
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:41,539
It's not working.

433
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:51,249
You know what?

434
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:54,419
I can't...

435
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:58,723
trust you anymore.

438

I'll do anything.

439
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:15,573
I'll be a good husband, a good dad!

440
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:22,914
Then...

441
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,753
why did you cheat?

442
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,157
[whimpering]

443
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:34,325
I'm sorry.

444
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,762
I'm sorry.

445
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:40,665

Thank you for waiting. Let's go!

461
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:52,163
Mom, where are we going on the bus?

462
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:55,900
Well...

463
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,805
we are going to our new house.

464

- Tsubasa?
- What about Dad?

465
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:25,530
I'm sorry.

We are not going to...

live with Dad anymore.

468

Why not?

469
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:40,812
Mom, don't you like Dad anymore?

470
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:47,652
No, it's not like that.

471
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:52,256
He's your Dad. How can I not like him?

472
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,592
Is it my fault?

473
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,095
What?

474
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:01,599
Did you and Dad fight because of me?

475
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:08,973
No, we didn't.

476
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,477
You did nothing wrong.

477

I'm okay.

You let me realize my mistakes.

503

You don't need to be sorry about anything.
