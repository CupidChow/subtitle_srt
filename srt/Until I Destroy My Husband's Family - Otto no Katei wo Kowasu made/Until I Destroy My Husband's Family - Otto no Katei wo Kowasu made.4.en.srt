Your turn for the bath, Wataru.

- Can't you knock?
- Sorry.

I'll take a bath.

00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,296
[Riko] Does he have something to hide?

00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:32,632
SURE. WHERE DO U WANT TO GO?

00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:33,733

17
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,430
Yes. Do you know what that is?

No.

High schoolers are naturally

Oh, not mine. He doesn't seem interested.

00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,994
It's the ones who seem uninterested.
You never know.

27
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,005
I'll teach you

- about the adult world.
- What?

29
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,885
[Riko] She might actually do that.

Please! Let me make it in time.

I'm sorry.

Ms. Kume, what made you start
playing Anko Panic?

What made me?

41
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,627
You don't know much about games.

42
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,930
There are more popular games. Why this?

I've always liked aquariums.

that he always took care of me.

even if he's married

142
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,439
as long as he made us happy

143
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,309
I thought that was fine.

144
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:13,746
But he's married.

145
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,482
Is it really that bad?

146
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:18,818
That wrong?

147
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,155
Isn't it because of

148
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,125
problems in his own marriage?

149
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,429
No matter the form

he's making us happy.

151
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,770
Maybe it's excusable.

Are you saying cheating can be forgiven?

to the one person.

[snickering]

168
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:46,972
I was a bit surprised.

169
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,013
I grew up just like you.

170
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,849
Like me?

171
00:11:58,317 --> 00:11:59,518
I had only my mom

172
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,722
and no siblings.

173
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,459
I never knew my father.

- Yes!
- Okay, let's go!

Grab your backpack.

and I loved her.

But...

- What do you want for a present?
- Mm...

I want a dad!

why I didn't have a father.

She had a child with a married man.

- She sure did.

Minori.

193
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,873
You come live with Grandpa.

194
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,377
Dad too?

195
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,082
Grandpa?

196
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,086
Where is my dad?

197
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,123
Does he have another family?

198
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,027
[Minori] My mother

199
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,632
loved someone she shouldn't have.

200
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:11,016
When I learned why I didn't have a father

201
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:13,485
I kept thinking...

202
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:19,191
I shouldn't have been born.

203
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,729
[inhales heavily, exhales]

204
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,765
I've lived my life

205
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:33,305
feeling guilty for being the child
born from infidelity.

206
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:38,878
That's why

207
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,748
I've never considered

208
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,384
infidelity to be excusable.

209
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:50,723
Sorry.

210
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,259
I was inconsiderate.

211
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,465
Infidelity

212
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,636
doesn't make anybody happy.

213
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:07,573
[Minori] I didn't want

214
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:12,344
to be like my mother who died alone.

215
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:13,946
So...

216
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,017
ever since I was a child...

217
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:23,789
I've always dreamed of

218
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,059
getting married.

219
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,931
The happiness I finally found.

Yudai?

226
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,166
What?

227
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:10,569
At the park?

228
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,106
Okay.

229
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:15,874
Thank you.

230
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:20,145
Have lots of fun with Tsubasa.

231
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:23,615
Bye.

232
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:28,620
Well...

233
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,457
You said Yudai.

234
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,860
My husband.

235
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,699
The man who's like your father.

236
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:44,903
It can't be.

237
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:47,806
Is this

238
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:50,709
a coincidence?

[ominous music plays]

240

You knew everything?

242
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,363
Say something, Ms. Kume!

243
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,400

00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,775
of my husband's mistress?

246
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,011
Do you really think

247
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,481
that's possible?

248
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,688
You and your mother

249
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,859

250
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,063
I hate you so much!

[ominous music continues]

00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,439
Now you understand

253
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,810
why I approached you.

254
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:01,480
Ms. Kume.

255
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:05,717
Was it...

256
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,520
all a lie?

257
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:14,259

[Riko] Yudai said she didn't know.

who supports you...

263
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,307
isn't he marrying you?

Her eyes told me she knew everything.

265
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:10,249
What if something happens to Wataru?

266
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,894
[Minori] I felt stupid

267
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,130
for spilling out everything.

[sobs, gasping]

269
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,169
But now I knew the source of my anger.

270
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,543

- Yes?

- Stop.
- Why? Are you done?

277
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,602
There.

278
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:08,674
Because she keeps watching us.

279

Do you know her?

280
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,018

Who's her friend?

I don't know. Probably Sara.

Ms. Kume quit.

322
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,699
Did you know?

323
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:01,807
She quit so soon! Totally irresponsible.

324
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:06,611
She wasn't wearing a ring
but she's married.

325
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:07,746
It's bad, right?

326
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:11,283
- I knew she was.
- You did?

327
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,320
So it's good that she quit, right?

Tutors who mess with students'
emotions are a pain.

329
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:23,395
She wasn't a pain.

She helped me raise my grades.

[Sara] What?

337
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,129
You told him everything? Are you insane?

338
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,067
Because he has not a shred of guilt.

339
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,736

It's over.

00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,575
- You think so?
- Mm.

348
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:47,012
From my experience at work

349
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,848
when the wife finds out about the affair

350
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,816
the husband feels liberated.

351
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:59,391
It's like he's relieved
that the lying is finally over.

352
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:03,495
Then he shrugs it off
and goes straight to divorce.

353
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:06,231
What the...

354
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:11,570
Maybe they've been working out
on the divorce for the past few days.

355
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:18,376
Hey.

356
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:24,215
My guess is he'll suddenly
be all apologies tonight.

357
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:27,185
Why?

358
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:31,289
He'd want to keep the damages
as low as possible.

359
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:35,360
Above all, he'd want to settle it
quickly, without any drama.

360
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,864
He plays the humble card
so he can win his wife over.

00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,435
Treating you like a doormat.

362

Thanks for coming.

363

I don't know.

00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:01,953
I guess I wasn't feeling well.
I wasn't myself.

00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,322
I'm really sorry.

367
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,126
I see.

You're in such a delicate stage.

00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:13,765
Take it easy.

00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:16,968
Okay.

00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:23,208
It's just...

372
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,779
Are we really good?

00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,251
