[Episode 6]

6
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:33,940
Pei Wenxuan,

7
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,940
This is the imperial court.

8
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,540
How could you use a folk song

9
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,780
as court evidence?

10
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,100
If the rumors are indeed true,

11
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,980
would you let His Majesty be deceived?

12
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,420
If we let tyrants fill the streets

13
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,700
and be revered by the people,

14
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,540
we'd be a joke for millennia to come.

15
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,900
Blasphemy! This is nonsense!

16
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,300
You're just trying to bring chaos!

17
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,860
Mr. Wang, if you think I'm lying,

18
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,460
why do you appear so angry?

19
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,100
Perhaps...

20
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,900
you are related to this matter?

21
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,220
H-How am I involved?

22
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,060
Pei Wenxuan,

23
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,700
if your words were to obstruct the truth

24
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,020
and cause instability of the borders,

25
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,460
how shall you be punished?

26
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:17,780
Mr. Xie,

27
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,300
I am merely giving suggestions,

28
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,700
yet you accuse me
of obstructing the truth.

29
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,540
If we do not get to the bottom of this,

30
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,100
Mr. Xie,

31
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,860
can you bear the consequences?

32
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,700
I only know that for years,

33
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,220
the Yang Family
has protected our borders.

34
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,620
As for you,

35
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,380
with your desire to marry Princess Pingyue,

36
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,380
you use the Yang Family

37
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,780
to sow discord,

38
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,300
hoping to up your status.

39
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,060
Mr. Xie is correct.

40
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,180
You may never know
what's under one's mask.

41
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,420
Mr. Wang resides in court.

42
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,340
You know little about our borders.

43
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,700
But the weapons used by our enemies

44
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,220
are mostly from the Great Xia.

45
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,180
Our soldiers saw it with their own eyes.

46
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,220
How will you

47
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,380
explain this matter?

48
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,180
In my humble opinion,

49
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,540
Mr. Xie is the one spewing lies.

50
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,260
What if the Yangs were sabotaged

51
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,740
and are truly innocent?

52
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,020
Your Majesty,

53
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,300
if the Yang Family is really framed,

54
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,380
all the more we should investigate.

55
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,460
Or else,

56
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,420
all loyal members of the Yang Family

57
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,220
will be haunted by rumors for eternity

58
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,820
with their names tainted.

59
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,380
Such is injustice, Your Majesty.

60
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,740
If everyone here truly respects
the Yang Family,

61
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,060
is this the result

62
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,940
you wish to see?

63
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,140
My subjects,

64
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,540
any other comments?

65
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,020
Well, with no other comments,

66
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:02,940
it is decided.

67
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,500
Since this involves the esteemed Yangs,

68
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,340
Pingyue will be in charge of this case.

69
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,420
Pei Wenxuan will be the Inspector Censor

70
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,660
and assist her with the case.

71
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,980
Since you two are involved
in this matter,

72
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,380
Su Rongqing will supervise.

73
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,220
What do we think of this?

74
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,300
Your Majesty is wise.

75
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:25,980
Draft the decree.

76
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,580
Good job.

77
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,180
Next, we'll have to talk reason
with the Yangs.

78
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,700
Will they listen?

79
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,260
Perhaps not to me,

80
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,540
but surely to you.

81
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,540
After all, being unreasonable
is your forte.

82
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,260
With the current situation,

83
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,260
Concubine Ning must have a plan.

84
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,740
The Yang Family has also earned
the people's hearts.

85
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,740
If we don't secure enough proof

86
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,500
before we search their residence,

87
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,780
we'll become the villains.

88
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:09,980
Mr. Su.

89
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:15,820
Your Highness.

90
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,140
Mr. Su,

91
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,540
now is not the right time

92
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,100
to search the Yang Family's residence.

93
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,700
Hence, I want to find some ledgers

94
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,100
from the Bureau of Military Appointments.

95
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,020
Can you help me, Mr. Su?

96
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,540
As per your instructions.

97
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,100
I will have to trouble you

98
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,460
to liaise with the bureau.

99
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,900
I'll go if the bureau is willing

100
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,860
to check the ledgers.

101
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,860
Understood.

102
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,740
Good day, Mr. Su.

103
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,100
Your wedding with the princess

104
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,340
must've been finalized.

105
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,580
I heard there was quite a ruckus
in the palace last night.

106
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,180
You seem to care a lot, Young Master Su.

107
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,580
Who doesn't care about

108
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,220
the princess's wedding in the capital?

109
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,220
You're the hot topic in the capital

110
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,500
right now.

111
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,060
Hot topic? About what?

112
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,300
About whether I'll marry the princess?

113
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,140
Well, allow me to be frank.

114
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,860
I will marry the princess.

115
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,060
I'm a little curious.

116
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,940
What do you think of the princess?

117
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,340
She is good.

118
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,980
She is eloquent.

119
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,780
More like harsh.

120
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,740
But I heard

121
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,020
you had an engagement
when you were a child.

122
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,460
How do you feel about that lady...?

123
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,620
I understand.

124
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,340
Some people are like the moon.

125
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,620
You may watch, but never touch.

126
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:01,900
Mr. Su,

127
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,140
please refrain from discussing
Her Highness.

128
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,060
Otherwise, I might become confused

129
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,300
about who you see as your moon.

130
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,460
Of course. I would never dare.

131
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,580
I still have business with the princess.

132
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,300
Please excuse me.

133
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,820
See you next time, Mr. Pei.

134
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,140
What?

135
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,340
Inform everyone

136
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,420
to guard the residence.
No one is to leave.

137
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,940
Also, send a letter to the border

138
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,820
for an urgent solution.

139
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,980
We're going to Hanqiu Palace.

140
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,700
Su Rongqing is interested in you.

141
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,660
Aren't you as well?

142
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,100
I...

143
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,300
I don't mind.

144
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,900
Remember Tuoba Yan?

145
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,180
The bank owner you once arrested?

146
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,340
Yes.

147
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,580
He travels among the states

148
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,020
and launders money for a living.

149
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,380
Many nobles in Huajing
are involved with him.

150
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,700
Including the Yangs.

151
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,100
Tuoba Yan

152
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,460
is able to survive for so long

153
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,380
not because he's good at business,

154
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,460
but also because he has
a protective charm.

155
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:37,740
The ledgers.

156
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,220
So that's why you're taking your time
with the bureau's ledgers.

157
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,060
Something that's audited every year

158
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,980
cannot be the real deal.

159
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,900
If we obtain the ledger from Tuoba Yan

160
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,140
detailing their laundering acts,

161
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,420
we get to prove

162
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,740
the guilt of the Yangs.

163
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,580
But what next?

164
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,460
Do you have any plans?

165
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,900
We've cornered the Yangs.

166
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,780
General Yang may be at the front line,

167
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,220
but he got a distress signal for sure.

168
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,060
He'll threaten Father
with his resignation.

169
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,020
Don't worry about that.

170
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,020
His Majesty is prepared.

171
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,180
He has the Xiao Family taking care

172
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,140
of everything in the dark.

173
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,180
However,

174
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,300
the Xiaos cannot hold them back for long.

175
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,860
That why, on the surface,

176
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,780
the Crown Prince needs to take charge.

177
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,860
Tomorrow, we'll go find
Qin Lin and Cui Qinghe.

178
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,420
They'll follow the Crown Prince to the front line.

179
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,180
We just need two more weeks.

180
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,940
When the enemies' weapons

181
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,980
are exhausted,

182
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,140
the Crown Prince will earn his merits.

183
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,580
Say...

184
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,780
if we weren't enemies in the past,

185
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,940
perhaps we would've been great partners.

186
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,300
Don't you think?

187
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,180
If it weren't for your beloved,

188
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,020

I'll take you to my courtyard later.

376
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,740
I'll show you what it means

377
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,940
when I say the flower is breathtaking.

378
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,940
You know, breath?

379
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,940
He's bluffing!

380
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,820
How is that bluffing? I...

381
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,820
Come on! Don't stop me!

382
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,780
Actually, help me up.

383
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,900
I'm going to show you

384
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,380
what's in my backyard right now.

385
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,300
If you like them,

386
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,820
you can take a few back.

387
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,620
Come on!

388
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,300
Let's go to the garden right now!

389
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,220
Scary wife?

390
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,100
No!

391
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,140
N-No, of course not!

392
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,820
It's just some flower-viewing.

393
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,060
You should come as well!

394
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,180
Come!

395
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,020
The moon is beautiful tonight too.

396
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,260
Look, maple!

397
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,420
Very nice!

398
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,140
Forward! A bit more!

399
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,740
I-I feel a little unwell.

400
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,580
May I ask... where I may relieve myself?

401
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,580
Please follow me, ma'am.

402
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,620
Please excuse me.

403
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,620
Let's go!

404
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,500
This is it.

405
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,500
Your Highness, this is...

406
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,540
Persian.

407
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,300
It's the five elements.

408
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,140
It should be in order.

409
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,500
This way!

410
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,460
Found them yet?

411
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,380
No.

412
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:50,780
Check that side.

413
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,580
We'll go over there.

414
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,100
Okay.

415
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,980
Look closely!

416
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,820
This isn't it.

417
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,060
It's this row.

418
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,500
[Ledger]

419
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,520
[Bureau of Military Appointments: Yang Yan]

420
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:36,940
I found it.

421
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,220
Let's split up.

422
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,940
It's them! Inform the Sixth Master!

423
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,500
Get them!

424
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,300
Find Pei Wenxuan.

425
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:50,940
Okay!

426
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,980
Stop right there! Freeze!

427
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,140
Freeze!

428
00:21:59,340 --> 00:21:59,980
Get her!

429
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,980
Your Highness, don't move. It's me.

430
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:11,860
Split up!

431
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,780
Roger! Roger!

432
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,940
Young Master Su.

433
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,300
I had to improvise. Please excuse me.

434
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,260
Your Highness.

435
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,580
Your Highness.

436
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,060
There are too many important figures
at the banquet.

437
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,620
They wouldn't want to make a scene.

438
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,380
How about...

439
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,340
You should change into this.

440
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,580
That way, I can get you out.

441
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,700
I suppose I have no choice.

442
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,940
Sorry to trouble you

443
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,460
into getting changed.

444
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,580
As for other issues,

445
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,220
we can discuss later when we get out.

446
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:06,740
Okay.

447
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,260
By the way, what are you doing here?

448
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,860
I thought there was no point

449
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,540
looking at the bureau's ledgers now.

450
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,140
That's why I looked at alternatives.

451
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,220
Tuoba Yan is heavily involved
with nobles of Huajing.

452
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:31,060
It's said that many questionable silvers

453
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,780
in Huangjing come from him.

454
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,540
Hence, I came here looking for clues.

455
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,100
The Ministry of Justice

456
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,540
once ordered me to contact him.

457
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,940
We're acquainted.

458
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,060
I thought I might try my luck here.

459
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,700
I didn't think I would see Your Highness here.

460
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,980
Can you do it or not?

461
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,500
You can quit if you want.

462
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,980
Not this again.

463
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,500
We're finishing this, okay?

464
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,060
Fine!

524
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,660
I should be thanking you instead.

526
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,700
I know this is out of line.

527
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,700
But if there weren't
all these power struggles,

528
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,780
would you have considered marrying m...

529
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,420
Your Highness.

530
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,620
Put this on.

531
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,060
You...

532
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,580
I know what you want to say,
Su Rongqing.

533
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,140
But as long as I'm still here,

534
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:22,860
swallow them.

535
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:27,900
Let's go.

536
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,980
Why are you so drunk?

537
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,820
What happened over there?

538
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,980
I got the ledgers.

539
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,380
Slow down.

540
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,420
How strange.

541
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,460
Did you hear what he just said?

542
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,860
He asked if there weren't
power struggles,

543
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,340
would I have married him.

544
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,140
Logically speaking...

545
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,580
You...

546
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,820
Hurry, get some water.

547
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,300
Slowly, slowly. Slowly.

548
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,020
I was wondering why you were so quiet.

549
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,020
So you wanted to puke!

550
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,940
Hang on, water's coming.

551
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,460
Your Highness.

552
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,060
Okay.

553
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,500
I haven't thrown anything up!

554
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,380
Have another sip then.

555
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,020
Enough, enough.

556
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:23,620
What are you doing?

557
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,060
Su Rongqing, that bastard.

558
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,380
What did he make you wear?

559
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,260
It's all over the place.

560
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,220
What all over the place?

561
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,780
More clearheaded now?

562
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,900
You should walk the alcohol off.

563
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,260

750
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,420
Killing him will create
even more evidences.

751
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,860
Your Highness, you mean...

752
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,580
Contact Wang Shun,
housekeeper for Tuoba Yan.

753
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,620
You've kept him for a long tim.

754
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,420
He ought to help.

755
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,220
After Tuoba Yan is dead...

756
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,980
That ledger is just a book.

757
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,740
When the times comes,

758
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,900
we'll send that fella
into prison as well.

759
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:04,420
Wrevent Quan
and the entire Yang family!

760
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,700
The Crown Prince first meeting with Qin Lin,

761
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,260
took two whole years.

762
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,180
His Majesty wore out the Yangs
and reinforced the borders

763
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,180
along the Northwest.

764
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,380
Putting down his staff,
he's long hollowed out the Yangs.

765
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,300
When the enemies attacked again
two years later,

766
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,820
this batch of staff

767
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,980
all died on the battlefield.

768
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,740
That was the time

769
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,140
Qin Lin went onto the battlefield.

770
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:28,980
Qin Zhenzhen

771
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,740
caught Queen Mother's eye

772
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,820
and was made
the Crown Prince's concubine.

773
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,180
What are you getting at?

774
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,100
Now that we're doing this over,

775
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,180
would you still let
Qin Zhenzhen enter the palace?
