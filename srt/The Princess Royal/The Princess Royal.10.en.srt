00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:39,980
It's okay.

7
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,020
Miss Qin, I'm back.

8
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,060
Why didn't you tell me you came back?

9
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,940
There happened to be
my sister's wedding.

10
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,700
I was thinking about going to you
once it's over.

11
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:58,980
Miss Qin,

12
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,940
everything in the army is under control.

13
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,420
You can rest assured.
Your brother is all right.

14
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,460
You came back

15
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,540
a little steadier this time.

16
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,260
By the way,

17
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,820
this is the jade I brought back
from the border.

18
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,140
I had craftsmen carve it into this.

19
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,460
I want to give it to you.

20
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,900
Do you like it?

21
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,380
I thought you were steadier.

22
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,020
You are playing with these toys again.

23
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,900
Come and tell me about the battlefield.

24
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,700
Let's go.

25
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,620
You bathed quickly.

26
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,500
Mrs. Pei, you're in bed.

27
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,580
Where am I supposed to sleep?

28
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,860
You can sleep wherever you like.
I'm too sleepy.

29
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,660
Why don't you come to bed, too?

30
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,580
That's not appropriate.

31
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,620
Then forget about it.

32
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,820
You can sleep where you like.

33
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,060
Wait. You...

34
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,620
Many eyes are on us on this wedding day.

35
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,660
If I go out looking for a quilt,

36
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,180
is it not appropriate?

37
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,060
But I'll freeze to death sleeping here.

38
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,660
Whatever!

39
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,620
Oh, I almost forgot...

40
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,300
Come back.

41
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,860
Come over.

42
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,620
Confess to me.

43
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,180
What does Your Highness
want me to confess?

44
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,900
Tell me the truth.

45
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,060
Why did Su Rongqing come
to escort me today?

46
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,300
I thought Your Highness
had something special to say.

47
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,180
After all, this is
Your Highness's wedding day.

48
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,700
I was just trying
to please Your Highness.

49
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,020
To please me?

50
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,260
Did you do that on purpose?

51
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,020
You knew I was killed by Su Rongqing.

52
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,420
Yet you asked him to pick me up.

53
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,540
Were you humiliating me?

54
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,860
Why does that sound so bad
coming from you?

55
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,620
Am I that type of person
in your opinion?

56
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,140
In my opinion...

57
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,020
In my opinion, you're a saint.
A real gentleman.

58
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,460
You're being a...

59
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,420
I won't argue with you.

60
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,380
I was thinking

61
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,900
Your Highness's relationship
with Su Rongqing didn't work last time.

62
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,740
Then maybe you can start over this time.

63
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,020
Why do I have to start it over?

64
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,140
Why?

65
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,260
Don't you still care about Su Rongqing?

66
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,260
Never mind.

67
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,060
I would be lying to say I don't care.

68
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,060
However,

69
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,820
you and I are married now.

70
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,580
It doesn't make any sense anymore.

71
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,180
I know

72
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,740
you're afraid Su Rongqing
will remain the same,

73
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,420
putting power before you

74
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,580
and his family before you.

75
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,100
You say you understand him
and don't blame him.

76
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,340
But is that true?

77
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,180
If Your Highness really don't blame him,

78
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,020
why not choose him from the start?

79
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,860
I'll be honest with you.

80
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,780
I talked with Su Rongqing
before the wedding.

81
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,100
I asked him

82
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,420
if the wife conflicted with the family,

83
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,900
who would he choose?

84
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,940
I side with whoever is right.

85
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,740
Mr. Su made a good point.

86
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,900
I'll take my leave.

87
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,780
Mr. Su.

[Censorate]

89
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,980
Mr. Pei, what else do you need?

90
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,300
I still have one favour to ask.

91
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,700
I'm sure you know
about my family situation.

92
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,260
On the day of the wedding,
I don't want them to do anything.

93
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,420
So I dare ask you
to pick up the bride for me.

94
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,300
Mr. Pei, you're joking.

95
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,820
Su, you should know

96
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,340
the princess marrying me is expedient.

97
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,020
The wedding of me and the princess is

98
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,500
just a deal.

99
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,060
Then...

100
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,980
Why me?

101
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,180
I think

102
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,940
Su, you want to protect the princess.

103
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,300
But what identity should I use
when picking her up?

104
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,260
How about my sworn brother?

105
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,740
My greetings, sworn brother.

106
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:18,980
So,

107
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,420
Su Rongqing is
not who Your Highness think he is.

108
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,500
He still cares about you.

109
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,100
And don't feel old all the time.

110
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,100
You look like you're eighteen now.

111
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,340
At such a young age,

112
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,740
why do you refuse all the possibilities

113
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,740
so easily?

114
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,100
Let me ask you something.

115
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,140
When Su Rongqing came to pick you up,

116
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,740
did you really not think about

117
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,980
marrying him for a moment?

118
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,180
Why should I tell you that?

119
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,820
To begin with,
I don't know if what you just said is

120
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,660
true or not.

121
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,380
Even if it's true,

122
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,100
we're married now.

123
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,180
One day when we'll be apart,

124
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,860
even as a princess,

125
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,060
the Su Family won't allow him

126
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,660
to marry a divorced woman.

127
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,780
Rest assured.

128
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,620
I have drawn up a plan
for Your Highness.

129
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,420
Wait here.

130
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,100
[Eastern Palace]
Young Master Qin

131
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,260
cut three enemy generals
off their horses.

132
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,660
The enemy troops lost faith.

133
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,460
We pursued with victory.

134
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,220
By the time we reached the canyon,

135
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,500
there was a whistle.

136
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,580
Ambush?

137
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:34,860
What happened later?

138
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,700
How did you fight your way out?

139
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,180
Well, I need to tell you in detail.

140
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,780
This plan has

141
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,860
four steps.

142
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,500
The first step is to know yourself.

143
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,300
Your Highness must first
make your position clear.

144
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,860
Figure out what your feelings
for Su Rongqing are.

145
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,740
Secondly, to know your enemy.

146
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,380
We need to find out

147
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,100
what Su Rongqing's feelings for you are.

148
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,860
Leave that to me.

149
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,820
I will make good relations
with Su Rongqing in advance.

150
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,100
The third step is
to encourage the enemy.

151
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,900
We must let Su Rongqing know

152
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,900
Your Highness and I are only allies.

153
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,700
He still has a chance.

154
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,460
The fourth step is

155
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,940
the most important step.

156
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,820
To capture the enemy.

157
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,540
I will create some opportunities

158
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,620
for you and Su Rongqing

159
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,220
so that things can happen
between you and Su Rongqing.

160
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,860
With your capability,

161
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,340
Su Rongqing should be

162
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,820
captured by you easily.

163
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,300
You really have me covered.

164
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,300
I don't have you covered.

165
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,980
With your face, your figure,

166
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,580
your temper, and personality,

167
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,860
all men in the world

168
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,100
will be yours,

169
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,220
if you want.

170
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,100
Su Rongqing is just another man.
Is it difficult?

171
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,220
You've been talking a lot.

172
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,500
Is that all true?

173
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,700
I'm going to believe it.

174
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,060
You don't have to believe me,

175
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,620
but Your Highness must
believe in yourself.

176
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,740
Yeah.

177
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,140
What you just said
makes perfect sense to me.

178
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,020
It was like a wakening call to me.

179
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,740
How about this?

180
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,540
Since you've thought about
so much for me,

181
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,780
starting from today,

182
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,260
I'll work for your marriage, too.

183
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,020
You and Miss Qin

184
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,500
were separated by fate then.

185
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,820
Now you have another chance.

186
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,100
Don't you want to muster up the courage
to go after her?

187
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,260
No need.

188
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,100
Miss Qin and I were...

189
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,060
How can that be?

190
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,220
You thought so much for me.

191
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,820
How can I not make plans for you?

192
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,580
No, I...

193
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,580
If you keep rejecting me,

194
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,860
I will start wondering

195
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,260
what your real purpose is
setting me up with Su Rongqing.

196
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,980
Your Highness have a point.

197
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,860
It's just
that the most important thing now is

198
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,340
Your Highness's relationship
with Su Rongqing.

199
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,140
Miss Qin and I can wait.

200
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,900
Then Su Rongqing and I can also wait.

201
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,220
Fine.

202
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,540
Then go to sleep.

203
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,500
You need to stop wandering around.

204
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,820
Sleep here,

205
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,980
so no one finds out.

206
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,940
You and I are really funny.

207
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,420
Twenty years of ups and downs.

208
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,780
We are a couple, but not a real couple.

209
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,620
We are allies,

210
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,540
but not exactly real allies.

211
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,340
We tease each other,

212
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,140
while wanting the best for each other.

213
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,860
I'm sure there's no one like you,

214
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,300
on the wedding day,

00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,380

for the bride's relationship

216
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,780
with someone else.

217
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,740
What kind of relationship
do you think we have?

218
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,940
Didn't I tell you?

219
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,700
I was hoping

220
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,060
Your Highness could be happier
on your wedding day.

221
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,300
If Your Highness think well of me,

222
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,420
you can think of me as a brother.

223
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,420
Don't.

224
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,980
I don't have a hobby
of getting brothers.

225
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,140
Then suit yourself.

226
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,460
However,

227
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,100
you and I should be able
to count as best friends

228
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,620
by now.

229
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,620
Besties?

230
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,220
What do you think?

231
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,140
No.

232
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,540
Bestie.

233
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,340
Bestie, my bestie.

234
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,860
Okay, stop. Don't gross me out.

235
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,180
Good night, my bestie.

236
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,420
Dawn breaks.

237
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,620
I was too focused
on talking about the war.

238
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,700
I didn't notice
it had been a whole night.

239
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,420
It's my fault.

240
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,100
No. No.

241
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,820
I was just too involved
in the conversation.

242
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,220
Since my father died in the war
and I stayed in the capital,

243
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,820
it's been five years
away from the border.

244
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,660
Don't blame me
if I talked a little too much.

245
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,540
I'll take my leave soon,

246
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,300
so as not to let people walk in
and be misunderstood.

247
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:48,980
That's all right.

248
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,100
If you still want to hear it,

249
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,660
I'll just keep telling you more.

250
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,180
One day we can go to war together.

251
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,940
Miss Qin can also find a place
to show your martial arts.

252
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,620
Huajing ladies think
being thin is beautiful.

253
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,540
People practicing martial arts
for years like me are

254
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,260
often accused
of being vulgar and indecent.

255
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,540
Do you also think so?

256
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,060
Of course, not.

257
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,900
Speaking of being brave and valiant,

258
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,220
there is only one person in Huajing.

259
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,180
Who is that?

260
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,620
Qin Zhenzhen.

261
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,020
The Crown Prince is
sure to be reassuring.

262
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,660
I'm leaving. See you later.

263
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,340
Miss Qin,

264
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,700
I'll let the porter
escort you out the back.

265
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,580
If you want to see me, don't fly around.

266
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,780
The guards around me are experts.

267
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,340
I wouldn't want my people

268
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,020
to hurt each other.

269
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,140
Who are your people?

270
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,780
General Qin is like a brother to me.

271
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,180
Of course, you're my people.

272
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,820
Then I'm leaving.

273
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,100
I'll walk you out.

Lately, Queen Mother has been

275
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,500
talking about making Shangguan Ya
the Crown Princess.

276
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,460
I just want to ask her what she thinks.

277

You can rest assured.

278
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,940
I know Shangguan Ya very well.

279
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,900
There were only a few places
she used to go.

280
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,100
If she isn't home,

281
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,140
she must be at some tea party
or poetry club.

282
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,940
She's easy to find.

Your Highness,

284
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,540
sorry for the inconvenience.

285
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,860
My lady was invited
by the Jiwen Poetry Society today

286
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,700
and has been off to the tea party.

287
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,140
She is at the Jiwen Poetry Society.

288
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,660
I'll just go looking for her.

289
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,420
Your Highness, please suit yourself.

290
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,580
Call me if you need anything.

00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,740
Do you know her well?

293
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,460
Of course.

294
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,660
After she married
into the Eastern Palace in the past,

I know her well.

I wonder what Your Highness think

she is like.

299
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,900
We often talk together.

300
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,220
She's a person who knows the rules.

301

She has elegant taste
and graceful manners.

00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,820
Though,

303
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,380
there were a few moments
when she was less elegant,

304

overall,

305
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,020

She didn't come here today.

Didn't come?

309
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,740
Since Miss Shangguan moved to Huajing,

310
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,660
she's only come to the poetry club once.

311

But

312
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,980

313
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,340
she used to be here
before she got married.

Today, the princess has urgent business
with Miss Shangguan.

318

and tell us where Miss Shangguan

00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:00,980
How dare you!

370
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,500
Come and play with me.

371
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,300
Go away.

372
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,260
This is my wife.

373
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,260
Beat him.

374
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,540
Do you see the token? Take him.

375
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,300
All right, let's go.

376
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,060
Beat him.

377
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,780
Knock it off.

378
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,380
Seriously.

379
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,300
My wife.

380
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,300
This is my wife.

381
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,060
My wife.

382
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,060
Are you done with the cuddle?

383
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,700
Don't you forget what we're here for.

384
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,100
To protect my wife.

385
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,020
What are we doing here?

386
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,540
Looking for Shangguan Ya.

387
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,340
Yeah, where is she?

388
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,540
Make your decision now.

389
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,540
Big, big.

390
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,580
Everything you buy today is on me.

391
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,060
Everyone, eat and drink as you please.

392
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,100
Shangguan Ya?

393
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,260
Enough with the food. Here's silver.

394
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,100
Bravo.

395
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,300
Take the money. Take the money.

396
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,780
Shangguan Ya, stop.

397
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:23,780
Slow down.

398
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:24,580
Move. Move.

399
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,060
Be careful.

400
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,060
Thank you. Thank you.

401
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,740
Make way. Move.

402
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,580
No.

403
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,100
You go down there and I'll go after her.

404
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,220
Be careful.

405
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,740
Don't look, man.

406
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,380
Stop right there.

407
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,220
Make way. Move.

408
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,300
Shangguan Ya, stop it.

409
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,620
Why did she hit me?

410
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,780
Why hit me?

411
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,220
Are you blind?

412
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,380
I didn't know
beauties did fall off the sky.

413
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,060
Thanks. You're very kind.

414
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,700
Take this, man.

415
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,380
I just won them. To give you good luck.

416
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,860
Don't tell people you've seen me.

417
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,100
What? Not enough?

418
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,100
Did you just see a girl

419
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,340
dressed as a man?

420
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,380
I didn't.

421
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,220
Have a look here.

422
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,500
Take a look. It's cheap.

423
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,300
First Young Master Su?

424
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,980
Your Highness, why are you here?

425
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,540
Did you see a girl

426
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,620
dressed as a man?

427
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,220
I did.

428
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,780
She went that way.

429
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,700
Wait. I'll come down. Pick me up.

430
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:32,820
Li Rong?

431
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,300
Are you okay?

432
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,340
What were you yelling about?
You scared me.

433
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,460
I...

434
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,020
What's wrong with you?

435
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,420
Inducing Her Highness
to jump from such a height?

436
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,780
Can you make it up
if anything happens to her?

437
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,660
I...

438
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,140
You can't blame Mr. Su.

439
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,580
I wanted to jump myself

440
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,500
and asked him to pick me.

441
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,820
She is your princess,

442
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,340
How can you mess around with her?

443
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,860
Mr. Pei just said yourself.

444
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,340
She is my princess.

445
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,460
She wanted to jump
and told me to carry her.

446
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,540
How can I refuse?

447
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,020
You're still making excuses, aren't you?

448
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,660
I do the right things.

449
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,740
Why do I need to make excuses?

450
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,660
Mr. Pei, on the other hand,
why are you so angry?

451
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,980
Are you worried that Her Highness

452
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,140
might hurt herself,

453
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,340
or did you get jealous

454
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,500
because Her Highness
asked me to pick her?

455
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,180
Are you questioning me here?

456
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,140
Stop it.

457
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,460
Let's catch up another day, Mr. Su.

458
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,580
Let's find her first.

459
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:27,860
Over there.

460
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,180
In the basket.

461
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,620
Are you okay?

462
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,380
I'm okay.

463
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,460
Mr. Pei, why did you come back?

464
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,380
I want to apologise.

465
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,220
That's not necessary.

466
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:49,940
Your Highness.

467
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,420
Your Highness...

468
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,140
Let go.

469
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,340
There's nobody in here.

470
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,260
Somebody is here. Come out.

471
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,220
I'll throw you in the river
if you don't get out.

472
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,540
What do you want, young lady?

473
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,620
Why do you touch my basket?

474
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,900
Miss Shangguan, rest assured.

475
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,220
We didn't come to catch you
for the Shangguan Family.

476
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,220
What?

477
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,580
First Young Master Su, help me.

478
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,780
Why didn't you say so?

479
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,780
Your Highness, my greetings.

480
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,540
What His Majesty does is

481
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,620
none of my business.

482
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,660
He insisted on burying Qin Zhenzhen
with the empress's rites.

483
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,620
You know he is always like a child.

484
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,860
You are very mature.

485
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,340
Don't take it too seriously.

486
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,900
I never cared about His Majesty.

487
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,300
There's no reason to take it seriously.

488
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,300
From the moment I entered this palace,

489
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,780
I was destined to go down a path
without turning back.

490
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,700
It's the case for Qin Zhenzhen.

491
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,380
It's the case for me.

492
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,020
Ya.

493
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,940
As for His Majesty...

494
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,580
Since I entered the palace,

495
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,580
I knew I was living
for the Shangguan Family.

496
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,740
My life is like walking on thin ice.

497
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,980
What else can I ask for?

498
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,980
Let's talk somewhere else.

499
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,180
First Young Master Su is
handsome and righteous.

500
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,780
Even more so in real person.

501
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:50,580
I've heard that Miss Shangguan was
the model for ladies of noble families.

502
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,700
Seeing you in person today...

503
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,460
You are really unique and special.

504
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,060
Please do not laugh at me.

505
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,100
I'll see you soon.

506
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,380
Though...

507
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,260
Miss Shangguan, rest assured.

508
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,220
I took your money. I'll do my part.

509
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,060
No one except us would know about this.

510
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,260
First Young Master Su,

511
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,500
you know customs and keep your word.

512
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,500
I like you.

513
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,180
Are you done yet?

514
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,580
See you.

515
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,300
See you.

516
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,380
Mr. Shangguang,

517
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,100
I sincerely ask to marry Shangguan Ya.

518
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,700
Please allow me.

519
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,820
Su Ronghua without the Su Family is

520
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,140
nothing at all.

521
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,140
Father,

522
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,180
please allow it.

523
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,500
Ya.

524
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,060
Someone.
Shut Shangguan Ya into the backyard.

525
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,660
My heart belongs to someone.

526
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,580
I don't want to be the Crown Princess.

527
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,340
If you leave with Su Ronghua,

528
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,540
the Shangguan Family

529
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,620
will be the biggest joke
of the Great Xia.

530
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,580
Unexpectedly, the two of them

531
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,140
met each other again in this way.

532
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,350
[Jucai House]

533
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,020
Miss Shangguan,

534
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,860
you must be of marriageable age now.

535
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,980
They've arranged a marriage for you.

536
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,820
Didn't you know?

537
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,020
Why do you still come to

538
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,260
such a vulgar and messy place?

539
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,660
I know.

540
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:15,940
So what?

541
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,700
Your marriage is with my brother,

542
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,020
the Crown Prince.

543
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,380
So that's what Your Highness came

544
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,260
looking for me today.

545
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,780
Do you want to talk to me
about the Crown Prince's marriage?

546
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,700
Yes.

547
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,220
I heard the Shangguan Family's choice
for the Crown Princess was

548
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:33,860
you.

549
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,340
Seeing me like this today,

550
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,060
Your Highness must be very disappointed.

551
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,220
But that's okay.

552
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,300
If Your Highness are not happy with Ya,

553
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,260
the Shangguan Family has many girls.

554
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,780
At your choice.

555
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,860
I'm not unhappy with you.

556
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,660
I just wanted to say

557
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,660
there had been three empresses
from the Shangguang Family.

558
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,300
Aren't you afraid?

559
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,020
Of what?

560
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,540
What happened to the Yang Family

561
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,220
can serve as an example
for the Shangguan Family.

562
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,220
As a daughter of the Shangguan Family,

563
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,420
since I was a child,

564
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,260
I was ready to sacrifice for my family.

565
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,060
Besides, the Crown Prince may not lose.

566
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,380
Sacrifice for the family?

567
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:21,820
Right.

568
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,300
If you enter the palace,

569
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,060
you can say goodbye
to places like Jucai House.

570
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,020
But it's not my decision to make.

571
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,820
I'm just taking my chance
before their decision

572
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,500
to have as much fun as I can.

573
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,100
Rich or poor,

574
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,500
a life with only freedom and joy is

575
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,380
just an illusion.

576
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,500
No one can force it.

577
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:39,700
All right.

578
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,300
About seeing Ya here today,

579
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,340
I hope Your Highness won't tell anyone.

580
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,020
Especially the Shangguan Family.

581
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:51,220
Your Highness, prince consort,
I'll take my leave.

582
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,700
Su Ronghua was the man
Shangguan Ya loved before.

583
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,740
After she marries the Crown Prince,

584
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,220
should tell Li Rong?

585
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,740
What are you thinking?
You haven't said a word.

586
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,420
I am thinking

587
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,940
our priority now is
to stop the Crown Prince

588
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,300
from marrying Shangguan Ya.

589
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,220
But now it seems

590
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,660
we don't have to try ourselves.

591
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,380
Yeah.

592
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,900
I may not be sure with the old her.

593
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,540
Now seeing her being so free,

594
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,580
I am pretty sure

595
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,780
Watching Huajing from the Phoenix Tower.

596
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:34,300
The country is so beautiful
it attracts the dragons.

597
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:38,260
Phoenixes build homes in a noble family.

598
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,260
Phoenixes build homes in a noble family.

599
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,460
It will still be flourishing
in the fourth generation.

600
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,700
The fourth generation?

601
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:51,740
This children's song is

602
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:55,100
saying that the Shangguang Family
will have the fourth Crown Princess.

603
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,300
[Mingyue Palace]
Flourishing in the fourth generation?

604
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,780
Watching Huajing from the Phoenix Tower.

605
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,340
The country is so beautiful
it attracts the dragons.

606
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,100
I am not dead yet.

607
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,260
Someone is already trying

608
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,460
to make me give the throne
to that puppet of the noble families.

609
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,060
Your Majesty is the most noble person.

610
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,100
Don't let those people
get under your skin.

611
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,180
It's not worth it.

612
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:24,540
The Shangguan Family has gained
so much power for so many years.

613
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,460
Is that still not enough?

614
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,180
If the Crown Prince insists on
the marriage with the Shangguan Family,

615
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,980
I'll have no choice
but to get rid of them.

616
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,940
He is the Crown Prince after all.

617
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,580
Now he hasn't got a wife yet.

618
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,100
Even if it's not the Shangguan Family,

619
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,060
other noble families

620
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,180
might also be thinking about it.

621
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:48,180
In five days,
it'll be the Chinese Valentine's Day.

622
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,260
We can take the chance

623
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,940
to gather all the noble ladies
in the palace

624
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,300
to get to know them.

625
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,580
One day, when it's time
to decide on the marriage,

626
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,140
we'll be prepared.

627
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,060
What do you think?

628
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,420
You are very thoughtful.

629
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,820
Assist the Empress

630
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,780
and get it done then.

631
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

632
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,700
Your Majesty.

633
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,940
Consort Rou taught people the song

634
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,940
and instigated His Majesty
to host a palace banquet,

635
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,300
hoping to keep Ya down

636
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,940
and pave the way for her niece.

637
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,820
It's nothing but dirty tricks.

638
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,100
I won't let her have what she wants.

639
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,740
Besides Ya,

640
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,500
we need to pick more girls

641
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,300
who can help Chuan.

642
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,460
Mother, you must give up your dreams.

643
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,260
The Yang Family controlled the military,
so Father destroyed the Yang Family.

644
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,300
The Shangguan Family
controls the palace,

645
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,500
so it's even more dangerous.

646
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,100
The Yang Family is a perfect example.

647
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,980
Without the Shangguan Family,

648
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,540
how could he have ruled the Great Xia?

649
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,820
Why being so ungrateful?

650
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,460
Because Father did not forget,

651
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,980
he wouldn't want his power
to fall into others' hands.

652
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,460
But why are you so sure

653
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,540
that your Father will win
and the noble families will lose?

654
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,340
The noble families have fought
the imperial power for a hundred years.

655
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,500
We never lost.

656
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,260
He who wins the noble families wins.

657
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,340
He who loses the noble families dies.

658
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,380
I've made up my mind.

659
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,660
You don't have to say any more.

660
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:27,100
Now we have to stop Consort Rou's niece.

661
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,100
Rong,

662
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,180
this is where I leave you.

663
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,540
I'm tired.

664
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,180
Rong, I'm tired.

665
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,700
It used to be against Father.

666
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,260
Now Father is gone.
I have to fight the noble families,

667
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,580
try to defeat the enemy,

668
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,060
and learn to plot and calculate.

669
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,660
I can't trust anyone.

670
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,740
Rong,

671
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,820
I'm really tired.

672
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,140
Your Majesty is tired.

673
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,060
Go and rest today.

674
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,740
No, it's not that.

675
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,500
Rong,

676
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,540
in my heart,

677
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,100
there is a monster locked up.

678
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,580
The monster in Chuan's heart.

679
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,660
When exactly was it locked in?

680
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,260
Is that now?

681
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,060
But who fed it?

682
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,420
What are you doing
standing here all by yourself?

683
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:48,980
What's it to you?

684
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,980
You don't like me coming, do you?

685
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:55,940
No.

686
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,460
It's good you're here.

687
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,580
What happened to you?

688
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,100
Bullied in the palace?

689
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,260
Who can bully me, the princess?

690
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,500
You can talk. Why did you hit me?

691
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,460
I wanted to.

692
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:11,580
You...

693
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,900
You can be nice to other people.

694
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,100
But you always hit me.

695
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,620
You need to change that habit.

696
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,500
I suggest you

697
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,620
look for reasons in yourself
when there's a problem.

698
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,260
Why don't I mess with other people,

699
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,380
but just you?

700
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,020
Tong Ye.

701
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,540
I didn't hear anything.

702
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,580
You heard nothing.

703
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,460
Help me up.

704
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,620
[Princess's Mansion]

705
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,540
Prince consort, you asked for me?

706
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,460
When Her Highness was
in the palace today,

707
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,860
did she argue with the Crown Prince?

708
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,420
Not really.

709
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,780
They just talked a little.

710
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,700
It seems that the Crown Prince
is not ready to accept a wife.

711
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,220
But after the princess talked to you,

712
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,660
she became much happier.

713
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,860
Don't tell Her Highness
what I said to you.

714
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,660
Prince consort, it's...

715
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,580
Just do it.

716
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,500
Fine,  fine. I know.

717
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,460
Prince consort,
you secretly care about her.

718
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,660
No, don't read too much into it.

719
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,100
All right,
I'll prepare some soothing incense.

720
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,740
I'll go to Her Highness in a moment.

721
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,580
Leave me.

722
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,420
Yes.

723
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,740
Let's play.

724
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,260
Okay.

725
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:08,100
Did Consort Rou
give you another hard time?

726
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,220
Consort Rou proposed to Father

727
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,140
to host a party

728
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,420
to choose a wife for Chuan.

729
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,140
Father has agreed.

730
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,620
I'm just worried

731
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,780
she would take this opportunity
to ask for Father's permission

732
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,100
to make her niece the Crown Princess.

733
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,460
Such a small thing
could have you worry so much?

734
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,260
That's not like you.

735
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,260
In fact,

736
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,500
there's one thing I can't figure out.

737
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,260
Before,

738
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,420
why do you think Chuan became that way?

739
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,420
He was already the emperor.

740
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,500
He wiped out the noble families
and pacified the North.

741
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,500
He had everything he wanted.

742
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,100
But why was he still

743
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,100
so painful?

744
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:20,060
Just because Qin Zhenzhen died?

745
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,900
Can love for one person last so long?

746
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,220
Li Rong,

747
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,820
do you know why the Crown Prince

748
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,220
insisted on uniting the North?

749
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,860
Because the wars in the North
caused the people too much suffering.

750
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,300
Of course.

751
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,980
And beyond that?

752
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,300
He didn't tell me.

753
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,020
He told me.

754
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,580
Do you remember Princess Yunyan?

755
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,980
Of course.

756
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,340
That was a long time ago.

757
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,380
That was Xuanzhi 8th year.

758
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,260
There were constant wars
between the North and the Great Xia.

759
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,100
The noble families wanted stability,

760
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,100
so they chose to talk.

761
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,780
They let Princess Yunyan
marry into the North.

762
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,340
I remember the Great Xia

763
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,820
sent twenty million grams of silver,

764
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,620
five hundred maids,

765
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:29,100
cattle, horses, silks, and satins.

766
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,580
But unexpectedly,

767
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,700
after only one year,

768
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,660
Princess Yunyan died in a foreign place.

769
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,740
Your Father told the public

770
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,580
Princess Yunyan died of illness.

771
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,140
But everyone in the palace knew

772
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:49,100
Princess Yunyan died
in the enemy's harem.

773
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,180
Why are you suddenly telling me this?

774
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,660
Your Highness, why do you tell me this?

775
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,020
You don't know.

776
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,580
The day we knew Princess Yunyan died,

777
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,540
my sister was only ten.

778
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,500
She stayed up all night and asked Mother

779
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,220
if one day,

780
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,820
she would be like Princess Yunyan

781
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,700
who married to the North and died there.

782
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,140
It was decades ago.

783
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,340
I don't even remember.

784
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,380
But the Crown Prince remembers.

785
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,540
From that moment on, I told myself,

786
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,300
if one day I took the throne,

787
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,820
I would go straight North

788
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,500
and bring the foreign enemy
to their knees,

789
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,260
never daring to offend us.

790
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,660
So his idea of conquering the North

791
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,340
formed so early.

792
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,060
Thus,

793
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,260
you and the Crown Prince are

794
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,220
the same people, essentially.

795
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,460
You are rational.

796
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,860
But his every move is driven by emotion.

797
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,460
He wants to go North.

798
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,900
He wants to fight the noble families.

799
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,740
It's to protect the people
and his family.

800
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,620
Unfortunately,

801
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,460
although he got what he wanted,

802
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,500
he had already forever lost

803
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,860
what he originally wanted.

804
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,380
Do you think he'll be happy?

805
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,420
Didn't he just lose

806
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,820
Qin Zhenzhen?

807
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,580
He lost his Mother,

808
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,260
his wife.

809
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,620
He also lost you,

810
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,740
and himself.

811
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,940
Even with mountains and rivers in hands,

812
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,380
there is no point to that.

813
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,300
How did he lose me?

814
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:29,300
Time has changed
more than just the Crown Prince.

815
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,940
It also changed you and me.

816
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,420
Those who forsook us shall not stay.

817
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,900
Bygones are bygones.

818
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,020
We lost this one.

819
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:45,940
Let's just start over.

820
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,620
Who said I lost?

821
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,780
If you go out in the future,

822
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,260
let me pick you up.

823
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,700
Why?

824
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,020
Aren't you glad I picked you up today?

825
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:15,940
I was okay.

826
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,820
That will do.

827
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,660
Later when you go out,

828
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,980
I'll come to take you home.

829
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,660
So you can have company on the way home.

830
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,820
It wouldn't be so boring.

831
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,460
Tell me the truth.

832
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,660
Are you going to ask me for money again?

833
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,380
Li Rong, oh Li Rong.

834
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,540
You're that type of ungrateful...

835
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,180
All right, you have my permission.

836
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:52,100
Before you and I go our separate ways,

837
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,180
pick me up every day.

838
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,180
Go to sleep.

839
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,420
