6
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,140
Enough.

7
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,260
I can keep him alive,

8
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,380
but he can't escape his punishment.

9
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,180
Decree that Su Rongqing
be subjected to castration.

10
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,220
What have I done

11
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,420
to deserve such protection
from the Princess Royal?

12
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,220
Your great kindness

13
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,220
is beyond my ability
to repay in this lifetime.

14
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,140
You don't have to feel like you owe me.

15
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,380
Rise.

16
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,460
Have you

17
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,540
thought about what you'll do next?

18
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,140
I...

19
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,260
am no longer a real man,

20
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,980
and I'm at a loss

21
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,540
about where to go from here.

22
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:25,940
Perhaps,

23
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,740
you can stay in my place.

24
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,620
Would you want that?

25
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,060
And think about it,

26
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,460
he didn't leave when you let him go.

27
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,740
Why did he want to stay by your side?

28
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,060
Li Rong,

29
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,860
are you okay?

30
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,820
I did think about the possibility

31
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,380
that he'd want revenge.

32
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,540
No one can forget such an annihilation,

33
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,620
especially not him, once
the most eligible bachelor in Huajing.

34
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,460
I just didn't foresee

35
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,220
that even the deepest bonds

36
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,020
would be overshadowed by political strife.

37
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,220
I was too naive.

38
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,380
So

39
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,980
he made the first move

40
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,900
to administer the slow poison to me

41
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,780
and then took over the power I held

42
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,380
with the guise of eliminating you.

43
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,740
We can't be entirely sure, though.

44
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,660
Perhaps we're both wrong.

45
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,420
Enough said.

46
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,340
I've come to terms with it.

47
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,100
I was killed by Su Rongqing.

48
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,580
Satisfied now?

49
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,100
I warned you

50
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,020
to stay away from him,
but you didn't listen.

51
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,580
See what happens?

52
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,300
You're suffering now.

53
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,020
Pleased to see me suffer, are you?

54
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,540
I didn't mean it like that.

55
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,140
Why must you always challenge me?

56
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,700
Indeed, it happens once in a lifetime

57
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,340
to see the Princess Royal suffer.

58
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,460
How could I not be pleased?

59
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,500
Then you're mistaken.

60
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,580
After all,
he served me for seventeen years.

61
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,300
I willingly accepted death at his hands.

62
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:58,940
And you,

63
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,420
you're just a bystander
caught in the fire.

64
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,500
What's there for you to gloat about?

65
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,380
Stop talking about it.

66
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,500
The grilled fish is almost ready.
Let's eat.

67
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,500
Here.

68
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,380
Take it.

69
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,500
But let me remind you, Your Highness,

70
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,820
your previous entanglements
with Su Rongqing

71
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,740
would only cause
some physical punishments.

72
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,020
Now, if you keep this up,

73
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,380
you're risking your life.

74
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,300
Your Highness,

75
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,620
the flowers are particularly beautiful
this year.

76
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,620
Meixiang,

77
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,700
do you know

78
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,820
which flowers bloom the brightest?

79
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,060
I do not, my lady.

80
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,820
It's not the phoenix flowers.

81
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,260
It's the thorny ones

82
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,820
that bloom the most brilliantly.

83
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,870
[Mingyue Palace]

84
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,900
Concubine Ning, why did you visit me

85
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,500
in the middle of the night?

86
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,820
It looks like a storm is brewing outside,

87
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,220
and yet you can sleep?

88
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,100
Just don't beat about the bush.

89
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,940
As you know,

90
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,780
I've always lived alone

91
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,940
in Mingyue Palace,

92
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,740
unconcerned with the outside conflicts.

93
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,620
Only you know

94
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,660
whether you're concerned or not.

95
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,580
My nocturnal visit

96
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,860
is to bring you a significant gift.

97
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,580
I'm not sure whether I can bear it.

98
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,740
Prince Su holds the Emperor's favor.

99
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,020
Even the Crown Prince can't rival him.

100
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,660
As Prince Su's mother,

101
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,020
born of humble origins,

102
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,380
have you ever considered

103
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,900
even if the Emperor intends
to make him the Crown Prince,

104
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,020
how could your brother, Xiao Su,

105
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,660
with his mere 20,000 troops,

106
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,060
compete against the Crown Prince

107
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,260
and his mother's powerful

108
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,140
Shangguan family?

109
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,500
You must be kidding.

110
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,940
This whole world belongs to the Emperor.

111
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,660
If the Emperor wishes
to promote my son,

112
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,140
there's no need for contention.

113
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,100
If not,

114
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,580
no one can usurp that position.

115
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,380
Is that so?

116
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,700
Even if Prince Su doesn't vie for power,

117
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,500
the Empress and her clan
will certainly back the Crown Prince.

118
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,420
My family has commanded
the northwestern front

119
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,300
for three generations,

120
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,460
holding significant military power.

121
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,540
With the support of my family's troops,

122
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,100
Prince Su's rise is inevitable.

123
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,580
You just came from the Empress,
didn't you?

124
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,540
Your gift is too big

125
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,020
for me to accept it.

126
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,820
Just by visiting you,

127
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,900
the Empress will grow suspicious.

128
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,700
Given her nature,

129
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,620
she's bound to make a move.

130
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,700
So,

131
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,180
whether you believe me or not
isn't that crucial anymore.

132
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,460
Concubine Rou,

133
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,980
I take my leave.

134
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,780
Are you cold?

135
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,860
It's so cold,

136
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,780
and you gave your coat to me.

137
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,540
How about...

138
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,460
Coming.

139
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,220
Why didn't you say it earlier?

140
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,300
Let me ask you,

141
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,860
have you thought about

142
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,940
seeking out Qin Zhenzhen?

143
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,220
We'll talk about that later.

144
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,460
I thought nothing had changed,

145
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,460
but on reflection,

146
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,620
before we were married,

147
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,700
you had nothing to do with Su Rongqing.

148
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,540
So,

149
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,660
there are still many unknowns.

150
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,660
We'll take it one step at a time.

151
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,420
I have a suggestion for you.

152
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,300
If you're going to intervene,
do it early.

153
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,380
The palace isn't suitable for her.

154
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,980
Don't let her enter the palace.

155
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,340
I see.

156
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,940
But it's rare for you
to say something nice.

157
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,620
You're funny.

158
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,260
Don't you like hearing
something nice from me?

159
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,020
I didn't say that.

160
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,420
I'm just not used to it.

161
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,660
I hadn't planned on saying so.

162
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,420
But I am

163
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,980
a reasonable person.

164
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,620
You came to rescue me,
and even though it backfired,

165
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,060
I still appreciate your effort.

166
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,940
I've indeed made many mistakes,

167
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,860
and I take the blame.

168
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,100
Pei Wenxuan,

169
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,300
let's not discuss

170
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,420
the past anymore.

171
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,780
Can you promise me,

172
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,140
let's not be enemies anymore

173
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,020
right here?

174
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,580
Hurry!

175
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,580
We must evacuate before
the Princess's reinforcements arrive.

176
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,340
Yes.

177
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,340
Your Highness, it's them.

178
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,260
They're the Yangs' men.

179
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:29,980
Hold them back!

180
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,620
Capture them!

181
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,540
Yes!

182
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,380
Your Highness,

183
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,500
we should focus
on finding the Princess first.

184
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,700
What are your plans next?

185
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,780
I...

186
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,260
I haven't decided yet.

187
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,580
What about you? What are your plans?

188
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,980
I don't want to live like before,

189
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,860
constantly surrounded
by endless suspicion,

190
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,460
witnessing the brutality of Chuan,

191
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,420
or seeing

192
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,820
Su Rongqing's family destroyed.

193
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,420
What about you?

194
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,780
Do you have any regrets from before?

195
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,820
Prince Consort,

196
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,140
you're finally here.

197
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,900
Though you and the Princess
have been at odds for so long,

198
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,340
you both care for each other.

199
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,700
Just bow your head and apologize to her.

200
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,180
Make up with her, please.

201
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,540
She won't understand.

202
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,220
I don't think so.

203
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,980
The Princess is proud,

204
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,540
and there were reasons behind the scenes.

205
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,060
The matter with Concubine Qin,

206
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,020
though she stepped forward
to take responsibility

207
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,180
and helped you out,

208
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,940
people outside are saying

209
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,460
she did it because she was betrayed
by her husband

210
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,380
and had to make this move to save face.

211
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,220
Actually, she just needs a way out.

212
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,700
If it were that simple,

213
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,780
it'd be wonderful. However...

214
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,580
Prince Consort,

215
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,780
sometimes things are really that simple.

216
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,580
Or,

217
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,220
maybe I should go and tell the Princess

218
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,140
you're here to see her?

219
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,860
No need.

220
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,660
It's my fault
for not handling things properly,

221
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,940
and I owe it to the Princess.

222
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:32,980
It's better

223
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,820
not to disturb her further.

224
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,820
Prince Consort,

225
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,740
there's trouble!

226
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,060
What's happened?

227
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,740
Following the Emperor's decree

228
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,500
to execute the entire Su family,

229
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,380
the Princess tried to save Young Master Su

230
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,860
by pleading in front of the Emperor

231
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,220
and accidentally spoke out of turn.

232
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,380
She's been sentenced to a caning.

233
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,980
I'm worried she won't endure it.

234
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,700
You must come to her rescue!

235
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,500
Hold it.

236
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,460
Thirteen.

237
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,260
Fourteen.

238
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,020
Fifteen.

239
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:10,900
Stop hitting her!

240
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,780
Your Highness, just apologize
to His Majesty.

241
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,300
Give up on Young Master Su.

242
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,780
If you keep getting beaten,
you'll lose your life.

243
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,340
Why put yourself through this, Li Rong?

244
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,500
Pei Wenxuan, Pei Wenxuan!

245
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,140
I must save Su Rongqing.

246
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,220
I've indeed

247
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,380
had regrets before.

248
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,300
I...

249
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,380
In my life,

250
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,020
I've been loyal to the court

251
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,180
and loyal to the people,

252
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,700
but I've only failed

253
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,620
the Princess Royal.

254
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:30,740
Your Majesty.

255
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,660
Speak up.

256
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,660
There's trouble with Princess Pingyue.

257
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,300
Pei Wenxuan,

258
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,220
why are you so nervous?

259
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,820
I'm not nervous.

260
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,940
I'm just trying to think
of how to prove my innocence.

261
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,900
What innocence?

262
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,260
I'm thinking about how to tell you

263
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,700
that I did nothing last night.

264
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,700
I know.

265
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,780
If you really did something,

266
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,980
I'd definitely feel it.

267
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,580
Li Rong, you're a princess.

268
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,260
Can't you be

269
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,220
a bit more reserved?

270
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,580
Pretend to be pure at my age? Seriously?

271
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,460
Let's go.

272
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:22,900
Where are we going?

273
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,700
Not here.

274
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,580
Nothing is found here either.

275
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,220
What are you doing, Pei Wenxuan?

276
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,300
Slow down.

277
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,060
Come here.

278
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,940
Pei Wenxuan,

279
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,220
how did I never notice

280
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,460
you're like a rabbit?

281
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,180
Take this.

282
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,900
What for?

283
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,820
Cover yourself.

284
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,180
Wait.

285
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:55,740
Su...

286
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:57,900
What are you doing?!

287
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,540
Don't keep reminding me

288
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,220
that he once killed me.

289
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,500
Don't overthink it.

290
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,860
It's not the time yet.

291
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,060
Today's Su family is of noble status,

292
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,060
upright and honorable.

293
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,460
The current Su Rongqing is a gentleman

294
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,100
who never engages in factional disputes,

295
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,980
especially now that Yang Quan
is the main schemer.

296
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,940
Su Rongqing

297
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,700
should pose no threat.

298
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,540
Young Master Su.

299
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,580
Haven't we already found her?
Where is she?

300
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,780
Your Highness,

301
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,540
look here.

302
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,060
They should have stayed here overnight.

303
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,300
They should have just left recently.

304
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,300
Chuan.

305
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,340
Sister.

306
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,500
Are you alright?

307
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,420
I'm fine.

308
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,020
But you,

309
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,700
why the rush?

310
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,540
I'm okay.

311
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,540
I heard you were kidnapped.

312
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,900
I searched all night and couldn't find you.

313
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,700
Sister,

314
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,380
you didn't...

315
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,660
Young Master, you...

316
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,420
Behave!

317
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,100
You scoundrel!

318
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,500
Your Highness!

319
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,460
I'm going to kill you today.

320
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,260
Calm down.

321
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,140
Let go. I'm going to kill him.

322
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,140
Seems I'm still too polite.

323
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:34,940
Bring me a sword.

324
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,700
Chuan,

325
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,340
you're the Crown Prince. Be modest.

326
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,460
Your Highness,

327
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,300
the Princess and I...

328
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,220
No explanations to me.

329
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,460
Take it up with Father and Mother
back at the palace.

330
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,780
Let's go back.

331
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,060
Princess.

332
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,180
Scoundrel,

333
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,460
stay away from my sister.

334
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,820
Sister, get on my horse.

335
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,260
Sure, who else's horse would I ride?

336
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,180
Your Highness, if you don't mind,

337
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,540
you can use my horse.

338
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,260
Alright, thanks.

339
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,940
Your Highness, are you alright?

340
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,700
The Su Rongqing of the past

341
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,900
never had such early dealings with me,

342
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,900
with Li Rong,

343
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,580
or even with Li Chuan.

344
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,300
He called me a scoundrel.

345
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,060
That's too far.

346
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,300
He's the Crown Prince.

347
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,020
Y-Young Master, are you alright?

348
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,660
Young Master Pei, please.

349
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,180
Let's go, Young Master.

350
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:05,980
Sister,

351
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,780
everyone in the court knows

352
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,220
Father dislikes me

353
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,060
and is always looking for a chance
to depose me.

354
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,140
And yet he still tries
to get close to me.

355
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,300
Do you think the Yangs
are out of their minds?

356
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,140
They are not at all.

357
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,140
They're very clever.

358
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,900
Father wants to deal
with the Yang family,

359
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,980
and our Shangguan family
is the foremost noble family,

360
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,260
so of course, they'd try
to get close to you.

361
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,620
Well, they could be a bit nicer.

362
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,340
How could they just kidnap directly?

363
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,460
I guess they didn't really want
to kidnap me.

364
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,100
Probably just wanted to scare me,

365
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,220
then play the hero to rescue me.

366
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,100
How despicable.

367
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,620
Pei Wenxuan is even better than them.

368
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,380
By the way, Sister...

369
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,820
Did Pei Wenxuan...

370
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,580
Did he kiss you?

371
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,020
Pei Wenxuan

372
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,020
is a gentleman.

373
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,620
He wouldn't take advantage of me.

374
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:07,780
Sister,

375
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,700
you have to promise me one thing.

376
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,420
Go ahead.

377
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,220
Even if you get married,

378
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,140
I still have to be the most important man
in your heart.

379
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,100
Your Majesty.

380
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,420
Get out!

381
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,860
She didn't want to see you
when she was alive,

382
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,020
even less now that she's dead.

383
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:36,820
Your Majesty.

384
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,380
Scram!

385
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,660
What are you doing?

386
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,140
Your Majesty.

387
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,580
You served Concubine Qin today.

388
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,900
You deserve to die.

389
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:11,980
Your Majesty,

390
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,620
I have served Concubine Qin loyally

391
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,660
for many years.

392
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,220
Why is she dead,

393
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,900
and you are still alive?

394
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,540
Mercy, Your Majesty!

395
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,580
Li Chuan, what are you doing?

396
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,300
Have you lost your mind?
You are the Emperor!

397
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,620
Mercy, Your Majesty!

398
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:30,780
Scram!

399
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,220
Get out of here!

400
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,820
Such a beautiful smile.

401
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:47,340
This is what I must protect in the future.

402
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,460
Sister,

403
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,060
what are you murmuring?

404
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,580
I'm saying you're foolish.

405
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,540
The Princess and the Crown Prince
indeed share a deep sibling bond.

406
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,900
In the noble families,

407
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,860
such a close bond is rare.

408
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,260
They grew up together from childhood.

409
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,380
The Princess also values family ties.

410
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,580
By the way,

411
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,420
I heard that you and your brother
also share a good relationship.

412
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,180
I misspoke.

413
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,020
This is just our second time

414
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,660
seeing each other.

415
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,220
Young Master Pei, how did you know?

416
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,900
It's no secret.

417
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,980
The Su family has been prestigious,

418
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,940
and brotherly respect
is your family's instruction.

419
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,060
Of course, I know that.

420
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,540
By the way, Concubine Ning paid a visit

421
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,340
to Mingyue Palace
and Qionghua Palace last night.

422
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,780
It seems

423
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,340
she was concerned
bout the Princess's marriage.

424
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,300
Does the Crown Prince know?

425
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,380
Yes.

426
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,340
I have already informed the Crown Prince.

427
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,100
But I think

428
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,660
Young Master Pei
should also be aware of this.

429
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,860
Young Master Su, why do you

430
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,860
help me like this?

431
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,340
Princess Pingyue is known
for her virtues,

432
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,940
and I also wish her well.

433
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,180
If the Princess needs to choose

434
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,980
between Yang Quan and you,

435
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,620
then I would bet

436
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,820
on you.

437
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,980
Why does he speak so cryptically

438
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,500
Could it be that he also...

439
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,140
I'm so flattered.

440
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,020
The Princess's marriage

441
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,540
should be decided by herself.

442
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,020
I'm just a minor official.

443
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,020
I dare not aspire for more.

444
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,460
Greetings to the Crown Prince
and Princess Pingyue.

445
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,380
Eunuch Shande,

446
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,260
weren't you supposed
to be attending to the Empress?

447
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,020
What brings you here?

448
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,420
Her Majesty heard

449
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,780
that the Crown Prince
and the Princess had returned,

450
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,060
and she sent me here specifically
to wait for you.

451
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,300
Her Majesty said

452
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,220
Your Highness had a tiring night

453
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,300
and should go rest.

454
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,500
I will escort the Princess

455
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,700
and Young Master Pei

456
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,900
to meet Her Majesty in Qionghua Palace.

457
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,140
The Empress wants to see me?

458
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,020
Sister.

459
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,340
It's alright.

460
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,700
Your Highness, your palanquin is ready.

461
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,980
Let me escort you

462
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,420
to change into clean clothes

463
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,660
before meeting Her Majesty.

464
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,980
Your Highness, please step this way.

465
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,780
Young Master Pei, please.

466
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,620
Mr. Pei,

467
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,700
have you figured out those problems?

468
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,380
Not yet.

469
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,700
Well, you don't have much time left.

470
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,860
Just wait here.

471
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:41,860
Come inside when you're summoned.

472
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,060
Copy.

473
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,860
Greetings, Mother.

474
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:52,060
Long live, Mother.

475
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,900
I heard you spent a night

476
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,260
with Pei Wenxuan last night.

477
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,380
Yes.

478
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,380
How do you intend

479
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,980
to handle your marriage?

480
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,460
May I ask what Mother thinks

481
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,100
should be done?

482
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,300
You have your ideas in mind.

483
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,740
Don't you, Mother?

484
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,860
I...

485
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,740
I'd like to hear your thoughts first.

486
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,860
I wish to marry you to Yang Quan.

487
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,460
What has the Yang family
promised you, Mother?

488
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,340
Military power.

489
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,060
You're pushing Chuan to his demise.

490
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,420
It's your father
who's driving us to our demise.

491
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,700
Do you know
why he demolished the Yang family?

492
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:06,300
It was to elevate Prince Su's uncle

493
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,700
to the position of King in the Northwest.

494
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,820
He wants to grant military power
to Prince Su.

495
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,300
Li Cheng's only fourteen,

496
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,740
and he's already appointed as a prince.

497
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,820
Now,

498
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,100
your father even plans
to give this young boy military power.

499
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,220
Mother, please calm down.

500
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,740
I'm not sure what you've heard,

501
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,060
but as long as Chuan
remains the Crown Prince

502
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,980
and Father doesn't catch him
in any wrongdoing,

503
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,420
Father can't do anything to him

504
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,540
for the time being.

505
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,980
But you want to marry me to Yang Quan.

506
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,580
Father has long targeted the Yang family

507
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,660
and has likely already

508
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,940
held ample evidence against them.

509
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,580
When the time comes,

510
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,060
all those faults will fall upon Chuan.

511
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,420
If we gain military power,

512
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,300
what does it matter

513
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,660
if Chuan is at fault?

514
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,020
Mother,

515
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,980
have you considered me?

516
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,660
You keep talking about military power

517
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,900
and the position of the Crown Prince.

518
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,860
May I ask, Mother,

519
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,980
in this marriage,

520
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,460
have you ever thought,
even for a moment,

521
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,580
about your daughter?

522
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,660
Given our status,

523
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,260
we don't have the freedom to choose.

524
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,340
But aren't we choosing now?

525
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,140
I've already spent a night
with Pei Wenxuan.

526
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,420
You know,

527
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,900
I'm not without choices.

528
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,300
So,

529
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,900
you want to choose that pretty boy

530
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,820
who can offer you nothing?

531
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,420
It's not the case.

532
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,700
His status could bring me peace.

533
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,060
Father could lower his guard towards me.

534
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,260
He just can't

535
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,060
offer Mother,

536
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:10,940
no,

537
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,340
offer Your Majesty

538
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,740
military power like the Yang family can.

539
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,580
In your heart,

540
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,780
my marriage

541
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,060
is merely a bargaining chip,

542
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,380
and I

543
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,740
am just a pawn,

544
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,020
whose happiness,

545
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,140
preferences,

546
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,020
and well-being don't matter.

547
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,780
Since Your Majesty
has always seen it this way,

548
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,740
why not make it clear?

549
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,460
I am not a daughter

550
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,300
but merely a weapon in your hand.

551
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,460
You!

552
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,820
How can you speak to me like this?

553
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,860
Do you not have a heart?

554
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,940
Just because I asked
for your cooperation once,

555
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,220
you belittle me this way?

556
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,620
How about I ask for your cooperation
this time?

557
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,140
What difficulties are you facing?

558
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,180
Tell me,

559
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,100
and I will solve them.

560
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,980
But this time,

561
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,380
you need to be my mother,

562
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,020
not the Empress.

563
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,020
You're blinded by jealousy now.

564
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,500
In time, you will understand

565
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,060
we must stay away from the Yang family.

566
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,740
Chuan should have military power,

567
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,220
but not from the Yangs.

568
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,500
I will make arrangements in the future.

569
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,020
While my marriage

570
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,580
can be a bargaining chip,

571
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,020
it should carry more value.

572
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,060
Mother,

573
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,260
you're not cut out to be a politician.

574
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,420
Leave these matters to me and Chuan.

575
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,380
As for you,

576
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,260
you only need to do one thing.

577
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,300
Do you even realize what you're saying?

578
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,500
I've thought this through.

579
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,540
All I need from you

580
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,660
is to truly be a mother.

581
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,300
I just want to survive,

582
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,700
and Chuan needs to survive.

583
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,500
What threat

584
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,860
have the Yangs posed?

585
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,740
If they rebel,

586
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,220
they would implicate Chuan
as the mastermind.

587
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,260
Your father

588
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,660
has always been looking for something
to use against Chuan and your uncle.

589
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,540
I see.

590
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,820
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

591
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,540
If Mother wants to summon Pei Wenxuan,
go ahead.

592
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,300
I'm talking to Chuan now.

593
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:15,740
Your Highness,

594
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,980
do you think

595
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,620
our marriage should happen again?

596
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,420
Are you feeling sorry for me?

597
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,620
The side hall has been prepared.

598
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,740
You can have a good rest there later.

599
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,500
What's wrong?

600
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,460
Thank you for your kindness,
Your Highness,

601
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,500
but I'm not worthy of it.

602
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,460
Rongqing,

603
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,060
don't degrade yourself like that.

604
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,500
Do you think

605
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,660
I am any different from you?

606
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,580
I once believed Father cherished me,

607
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,820
but in the end,

608
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,180
I was just a pawn he used
to manipulate the noble families.

609
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,940
I thought Mother was wholly
looking out for my best,

610
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,020
but compared to the interest
of the Shangguan family,

611
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,220
I could be discarded at any time.

612
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,540
I believed that man

613
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,700
was sincerely devoted to me,

614
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,220
but his heart

615
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,500
was set on another woman.

616
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,860
I thought the brother I helped to rise

617
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,220
would respect and value me,

618
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,020
but to suppress the noble families,

619
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,380
he didn't hesitate to punish me.

620
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,980
I am alone

621
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,460
and live a life full of hardship

622
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,420
and exhaustion.

623
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,860
Your Highness, there are ways
to help you out.

624
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,180
I don't need to feel sorry for you.

625
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,940
You may be different from the Princess

626
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,940
I used to know.

627
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,540
Starting over and knowing each other again

628
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,020
might not be a bad idea.

629
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,300
You do make a point.

630
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,820
Then let it be so.

631
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,940
I cannot tolerate Your Highness's guest.

632
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,900
Nor can I accept

633
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,500
Mr. Pei's beloved.

634
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,220
It seems we have reached an understanding.

635
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,620
Then, let's settle our marriage.

636
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,820
Let's endure each other.

637
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,660
After a couple of years,
when you hold more power,

638
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,820
we can separate.

639
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,740
Then, we can seek revenge

640
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,780
and settle grievances.

641
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,020
What do you think, Your Highness?

642
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,140
Alright, let's make do for now.

643
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,660
But, if you want to marry me,

644
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,780
you'll have to prove your worth.

645
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,460
If Mr. Pei isn't capable,

646
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,220
I won't stoop to marry you.

647
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,620
Rest assured, Your Highness.

648
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,980
I will certainly ease your burden.

649
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,620
I'm expecting it.

650
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:44,900
Wait.

651
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,780
What now?

652
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,340
I'd like to ask Your Highness
for a small favor.

653
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:53,980
Tell me.

654
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,260
Please prepare a lavish carriage for me.

655
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,140
Greetings, Your Majesty!

656
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,900
Long live, Your Majesty!

657
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,340
I summoned you to the side hall.

658
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:15,180
I assume you understand
what this implies.

659
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,740
You seem somewhat weary,

660
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,260
and I have prepared fresh clothes
for you.

661
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,940
You should return now.

662
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,300
Do you have any grievances?

663
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:37,260
Your Majesty, if I retreat,

664
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,140
what would become of the Princess?

665
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,580
That's not for you to worry about.

666
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,620
And if I wish to worry?

667
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,340
What are you implying?

668
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,980
Currently, the Yang family
is like a fish out of water

669
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,380
and is merely struggling in vain.

670
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,420
But if the Crown Prince aligns with them,

671
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,620
it would drag him into trouble.

672
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,620
In your opinion,

673
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,260
what should be done now?

674
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,300
Your Majesty and the Crown Prince

675
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,860
only need to do one thing.

676
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,420
Once I leave Qionghua Palace,

677
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,260
seal off any information
about my entrance to the palace

678
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,860
and my time
with the Princess last night immediately.

679
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,980
I have already done so.

680
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,340
But why do you ask this

681
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,260
of me?

682
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,220
Your Majesty,

683
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,540
the Emperor has many eyes and ears
in the palace.

684
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,380
Nothing you do can be hidden from him.

685
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,060
Now,

686
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,180
only if Your Majesty targets me,

687
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,220
can I gain the Emperor's trust.

688
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,180
You're just a minor eighth-rank official.

689
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,860
Why are you willing to be embroiled

690
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,860
in royal intrigues?

691
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,940
If not for ambitious dreams,

692
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,900
why not retire and return home?

693
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,580
Aren't all those in the court

694
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,860
striving for the same thing?

695
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,740
Then why choose the Crown Prince?

696
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,460
I...

697
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,460
cannot bear
to see the Princess humiliated.

698
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,020
You care for my daughter?

699
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,500
I'm eager to assist and protect

700
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,140
Your Majesty and Her Highness.

701
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,580
Mr. Pei, please.

702
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,260
Ultimately,

703
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,660
we can't escape this siege.

704
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,140
Wait.

705
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,140
This isn't the way out of the palace

706
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,980
but towards the Emperor's Imperial Study.

707
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,460
I assume the Emperor

708
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,060
has already heard about what happened
at Qionghua Palace

709
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,140
and is summoning me.

710
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:16,380
I am Fu Lai,
an attendant by the Emperor's side.

711
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,980
His Majesty wants to meet Mr. Pei.

712
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,060
Please follow me.

713
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:26,940
Eunuch Fu,

714
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,380
do you know
why His Majesty is summoning me?

715
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,940
Mr. Pei surely has an idea.

716
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:43,060
Please wait here for a moment.

717
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,020
Major General Yang?

718
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,700
I'm curious as to

719
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,700
why you are here today.

720
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,620
To seek a marriage alliance.

721
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,980
I'm afraid that might disappoint you.

722
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:20,620
This matter is likely already settled.

723
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,780
What do you mean?

724
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,020
Don't you know

725
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,860
why I turned back last night?

726
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,260
It... was you last night?

727
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,740
Exactly.

728
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,460
I was fortunate indeed.

729
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,060
Not only did I rescue the Princess

730
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,380
from your hands

731
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,780
but also spent the night alone with her.

732
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,780
You're asking for trouble.

733
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,860
Do you intend to resort to violence
in front of His Majesty?

734
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,900
His Majesty is a wise ruler.

735
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:03,060
You have no reason to be resentful.

736
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,500
Perhaps you should return to the Northwest.

737
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,700
I hear the silk there

738
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,340
is particularly fine.

739
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,980
The silk is used for funerals
in the Northwest.

740
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,340
You dare curse me?

741
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,740
Sorry to let you down.

742
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,340
But I was the designated
Prince Consort candidate.

743
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,020
There was a hiccup last night,

744
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,300
and His Majesty commanded me
to return immediately.

745
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,140
You're served as a stepping stone

746
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,060
to pave the way for me and the Princess.

747
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:38,380
Yang Quan, Pei Wenxuan,
enter the hall now!

748
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,780
I, Pei Wenxuan.

749
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,060
I, Yang Quan.

750
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,300
Wish Your Majesty well.

751
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,100
Pei Wenxuan, rise.

752
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,780
Thank you, Your Majesty.

753
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:10,300
I, Yang Quan, wish Your Majesty well.

754
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,700
What are you doing here?

755
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:14,860
Your Majesty,

756
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:18,220
I have come today
to seek a marriage alliance.

757
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:20,540
Oh?

758
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,100
Whom do you wish to marry?

759
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,420
I am fond of Princess Pingyue.

760
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,300
Your Majesty, please grant your approval
for our marriage.

761
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,540
Pingyue is my eldest daughter,

762
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:37,940
and her marriage is no trivial matter.

763
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,540
Let me give this further thought.

764
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,420
Pei Wenxuan,

765
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,620
come walk with me in the garden.

766
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:46,380
Yes.

767
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:49,620
Your Majesty,

768
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,620
Major General Yang is still kneeling.

769
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,060
Rise.

770
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:56,820
If you have nothing else to say,
you may leave now.
