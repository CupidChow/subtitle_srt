[The Princess Royal]

00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,950
[Adapted from Mo Shu Bai's novel,
The Princess Royal on jjwxc.net]

3
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,020
[This is a work of fiction.]

4
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 25]

5
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,580
Did you talk to Hongde
after you came back?

6
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:38,620
No.

7
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,940
Neither of us has talked to him.

8
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,380
So he was brought to falsely accuse us.

9
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,740
But with Consort Rou's capability,

10
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,820
she isn't smart enough
to devise this plan.

11
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,060
It's probably Su Rongqing

12
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,700
who's behind Consort Rou.

13
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,900
Are you suggesting...

14
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,660
Your Highness.

15
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,500
Mr. Su?

16
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,700
What are you doing here?

17
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,540
The Crown Prince's wedding is near.

18
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,100
The Ministry of Justice
is responsible for security.

19
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,500
So, it has been quite busy.

20
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,700
As for me,

21
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,940
I was just planning to take a stroll
in the Imperial Garden

22
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,260
during official duties.

23
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,300
I didn't expect

24
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,500
to meet you here.

25
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,740
I'm here to relax

26
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,100
and also think about Chuan's wedding.

27
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,620
Chuan's wedding is approaching.

28
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,940
But he's been sad.

29
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,820
I'm not sure

30
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,900
if his marriage

31
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,580
with the Shangguan Family is good

32
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,380
or bad for him.

33
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,380
It seems like everyone,

34
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,620
including myself,

35
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,900
is pushing him to make a choice.

36
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,060
Have you considered postponing

37
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,100
the Crown Prince's wedding

38
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,100
to give him more time
to decide, Your Highness?

39
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,380
That's an option.

40
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,420
But

41
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,860
the Crown Prince's wedding
is a major event

42
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,500
of the court.

43
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,940
It's not something we can easily change.

44
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,660
If that's the case,

45
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,100
I do have a solution.

46
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,260
I remember

47
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,740
you only mentioned it to me back then

48
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,420
and didn't take further action.

49
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,100
As for the matter of using Hongde
to postpone the Crown Prince's wedding,

50
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,100
no one would know about this.

51
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,980
Besides, we didn't even
go to Hongde this time.

52
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,620
But Su Rongqing took
preemptive action by using Hongde.

53
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,980
More importantly,

54
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:33,940
how did he know

55
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,380
about your intention
to postpone the wedding?

56
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,460
That's the problem.

57
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,580
This excuse is exactly

58
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,260
the same as what I thought before.

59
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,300
Why use this reason

60
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,700
to postpone the Crown Prince's wedding?

61
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,260
And in this new life,

62
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,180
he seems to know everything in advance.

63
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,060
Is it all just a coincidence?

64
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,540
So you are saying

65
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,020
- Su Rongqing has also returned.
- Su Rongqing has also returned.

66
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,850
[I wish to see you, hopefully,
in the peach blossom season next year.]

67
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,140
Your Highness,

68
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,980
I have endured silently

69
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,460
because fate has played a trick on me,

70
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,340
forcing me

71
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,700
to choose
between my beloved family and you.

72
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,180
I can only avoid tragedy
for the Su Family

73
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,620
and stabilize the situation

74
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,260
before proposing marriage.

75
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,660
Your Highness,

76
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,940
do you understand

77
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,260
my feelings?

78
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,260
My longing is so deep

79
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,060
that it never ceases
throughout days and nights.

80
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,620
I wish to see you, hopefully,

81
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,420
during the peach blossom season
next year.

82
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,060
Originally from Heaven,

83
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,220
why fall to the mortal world?

84
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,380
If you don't want those books,

85
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,580
they will belong
to someone else tomorrow.

86
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,380
Those books are too precious.

87
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,940
I'm powerless.

88
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,940
So I don't deserve to own them now.

89
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,820
If one day in the future,

90
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,740
I can...

91
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,820
I see now.

92
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,260
He actually hid it for so long.

93
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,060
I wondered why he didn't dare
to marry me before.

94
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,820
Now, it all makes sense.

95
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:44,940
Rong.

96
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,380
What I fear

97
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,020
isn't that Su Rongqing
is as prescient as we are

98
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,180
or takes actions before we do.

99
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,060
What I fear

100
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,700
is the relationship
between you and Su Rongqing,

101
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,020
where I was cast aside
for seventeen years.

102
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,380
I am confident
I can win the current Su Rongqing.

103
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,500
But what if it's the Su Rongqing

104
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,580
who has been with you
for seventeen years?

105
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:19,980
Pei Wenxuan.

106
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,140
Pei Wenxuan.

107
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,820
Don't overthink it.

108
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,300
Su Rongqing is just

109
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,900
an old acquaintance to me.

110
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,100
You know

111
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,220
my heart belongs to you.

112
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,060
This has nothing to do with anyone else.

113
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,100
You are my wife.

114
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,100
Yes, I am.

115
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,380
May I know who you...

116
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,780
We're from the Inspectorate Office

117
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,380
under Princess Pingyue's order
to conduct an investigation.

118
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,540
Please ask Daoist Hongde to come out.

119
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,700
Sir,

120
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,300
someone took Daoist Hongde

121
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,860
into the palace a few days ago.

122
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,740
It's just as Her Highness suspected

123
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,860
that he's in the palace now.

124
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,020
Sorry for disturbing you.

125
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,900
We need to report this matter
to Her Highness promptly.

126
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:21,780
Yes, sir.

127
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,940
Young Master,

128
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,700
the Princess has entered the palace.

129
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,860
Take this over

130
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,420
and say

131
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,740
the prey has appeared.

132
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,660
Yes, Young Master.

133
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,180
Your Highness.

134
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,580
What is this?

135
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,940
This was sent by Mr. Su

136
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,580
to be handed to Daoist Hongde.

137
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,220
[Chou hour, 19th day, Renshen]
He said

138
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:50,780
[7th month, the 6th year of Yongning Era]
we can't keep

139
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,570
[Wei hour, 11th day, Gengwu 4th month,]
Daoist Hongde

140
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,820
[the 4th year of Yongning Era]
anymore.

141
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,420
The most important thing now

142
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,380
is to prevent Pei Wenxuan from becoming
the Vice Minister of Personnel.

143
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,380
Mr. Su is indeed resourceful.

144
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,620
Why is there no one this wise

145
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,540
in the Xiao Family?

146
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,580
Go.

147
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,380
Pass this to Daoist Hongde in secret

148
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,780
and let him say so.

149
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,660
Yes, Your Highness.

150
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,340
Greetings, Father.

151
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,740
Rise.

152
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,180
I heard you came to the palace

153
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,620
to arrest someone.

154
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,620
Yes, Father.

155
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,740
Upon receiving multiple reports,

156
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,300
I have been investigating reports

157
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,940
alleging that Daoist Hongde
of the Qingfeng Taoist Temple

158
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,060
has committed many atrocities

159
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,780
under the guise of a Daoist.

160
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,500
I began investigating him

161
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,540
and have collected evidence
over the past three months.

162
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,420
Now, I've got solid evidence.

163
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,780
So I went to the Qingfeng Taoist Temple
to arrest him.

164
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,340
I didn't expect him

165
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,940
to have entered the palace.

166
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,580
Father, have you heard any slander?

167
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,740
Well, nothing slanderous.

168
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,340
But there was an interesting incident.

169
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,460
Interesting incident?

170
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,780
Someone said

171
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,540
you made Hongde lie

172
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,340
to postpone the Crown Prince's wedding.

173
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,460
Is there such a thing?

174
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,260
Postponing Chuan's wedding?

175
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:15,900
Father,

176
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,980
put aside whether I did such a thing.

177
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,460
As a Daoist,

178
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,580
how could he influence
the Crown Prince's wedding date?

179
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,100
Father, you don't believe me?

180
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,540
Well, no.

181
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,420
I only heard

182
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,580
that this so-called Daoist Hongde

183
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,180
has quite a reputation
among the common people.

184
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,300
With just any prophecy,

185
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,260
he can gain a lot of support.

186
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,580
If he indeed said

187
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,700
that the Crown Prince should not marry
in the coming years,

188
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,500
many people would believe it.

189
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,980
Then to appease public opinion,

190
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,940
Chuan's wedding

191
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,420
would have to be postponed.

192
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:05,780
Father,

193
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,900
I do not understand
why he would slander me.

194
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,820
Since you say he slandered you,

195
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,020
we'll summon him here

196
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,540
so that you can confront
each other face-to-face.

197
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,580
All right.

198
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,660
Young Master, I have brought her here.

199
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,660
Do you know what to say?

200
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,660
Sir,

201
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,300
he had already explained it
to me while we were on the way.

202
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,180
Send her to the palace.

203
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,140
Yes, Young Master.

204
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,940
Greetings, Your Majesty.

205
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,140
Greetings, Your Majesty.

206
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:38,900
Rise.

207
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,540
Thank you, Your Majesty.

208
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,700
Rou, Pingyue said
Hongde committed an offense

209
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,900
and came to the palace to arrest him.

210
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,060
I shall let you clarify

211
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,780
the misunderstanding here in person.

212
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,580
Upon hearing the news,

213
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,500
I came together with Daoist Hongde.

214
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,060
I invited him here.

215
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,500
If there is no misunderstanding,

216
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,780
it is not wrong
for Princess Pingyue to take him away.

217
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,060
Hongde.

218
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,180
Yes, Your Majesty.

219
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,180
You said that people
from the Princess's Mansion consulted

220
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,260
with you
about the Crown Prince's marriage.

221
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,500
Do you have any evidence?

222
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,140
Your Majesty,

223
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,500
these are talisman papers
delivered to me

224
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,580
by people from the Princess's Mansion.

225
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,660
They were specifically instructed
by the Prince Consort.

226
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,300
It includes

227
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,500
the birth charts of the Princess
and the Prince Consort,

228
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,420
personally written by the Prince Consort

229
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,900
and sent together

230
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,540
with the Crown Prince's birth charts.

231
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,300
I agreed to it

232
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,300
and have just finished drawing
the symbols these days.

233
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,660
I was just about to send them back
to the Princess's Mansion.

234
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,060
Pingyue, take a look too.

235
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,020
On your wedding,

236
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,900
I've seen your charts.

237
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,940
What's your explanation?

238
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,020
I have nothing to explain.

239
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,260
This really
is Pei Wenxuan's handwriting.

240
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,020
Father,

241
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,300
I am investigating his case.

242
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,060
How could I possibly believe him

243
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,420
and go to him for a fortune-telling?

244
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,420
Could it be Pei Wenxuan
went to Hongde before?

245
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,180
That shouldn't be.

246
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,860
It's really hard to say
whether it's true or false.

247
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,100
Why don't I take the talisman back

248
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,700
and check the handwriting?
Then, we will know.

249
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,060
This talisman paper is used
by ordinary Taoist temples.

250
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,220
What does it matter
whether to check it or not?

251
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,100
What do you mean by that, Your Highness?

252
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,180
The paper used
by Qingfeng Taoist Temple is supplied

253
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,620
by the royal court.

254
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,100
It has a unique fragrance.

255
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,060
But this paper doesn't have that.

256
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,140
It's obviously
from an ordinary Taoist temple.

257
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,140
I wonder where you stole it from?

258
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,660
Or

259
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,660
you were not using
Qingfeng Taoist Temple's paper

260
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,900
but went to other temples

261
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,580
to get talisman paper
for drawing symbols?

262
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,100
This...

263
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:28,780
Your Majesty, I...

264
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,620
Father,

265
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,220
this should be the time

266
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,860
when the Prince Consort went out to play

267
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,980
and got it casually.

268
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,580
I don't remember it anymore.

269
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,860
I just don't know
why Daoist Hongde wants

270
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,100
to frame us.

271
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:41,860
I... I...

272
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,820
Your Majesty,

273
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,060
I'm telling the truth.

274
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,100
Your Majesty, I swear

275
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,380
that there's not a word of falsehood.

276
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,380
Haven't you been telling a lot of lies,
Wang Caishan?

277
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,180
Wang Caishan

278
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,900
is from Qingshui Town.

279
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,100
He used to be a mountebank
in the market as a fortune teller.

280
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,420
Later, he got into an argument,

281
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,220
fought with someone,
and committed murder.

282
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,020
He abandoned his wife
and his mother to wander around.

283
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,460
Later, he claimed to be Immortal,

284
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,300
swaggering and cheating for decades.

285
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,100
Finally, he sneaked
into Qingfeng Taoist Temple.

286
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,340
What are you talking about,
Your Highness?

287
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,220
I do not understand one bit.

288
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,980
Actually, I also brought a witness here.

289
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,060
Summon the witness.

290
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,740
Bring Mrs. Wang in.

291
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,060
This... This is simply inexplicable.

292
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,340
Greetings, Your Majesty.

293
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,820
Rise and speak.

294
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,100
Thank you, Your Majesty.

295
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,420
Tell me. Do you recognize this person?

296
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,700
Shan.

297
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,300
You're still alive!

298
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,500
Madam. Madam, please watch your manners.

299
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,820
It's...

300
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,540
You called me "Madam"?

301
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,340
It turns out nothing happened to you.

302
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,340
You just didn't want to come back home!

303
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,780
You're so evil, Wang Caishan.

304
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,620
What are you talking about?

305
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,820
I've taken care of your mother
for over ten years.

306
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,740
You scoundrel! Today, I'll...

307
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,300
Enough!

308
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,020
Someone!

309
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:12,980
Your Majesty.

310
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,620
Take them away.

311
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,580
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

312
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,620
This is...

313
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,300
Your Majesty,

314
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,060
I only heard
about his profound Daoist skills,

315
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,220
nothing else.

316
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:23,940
Never mind.

317
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,660
Take them away.

318
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,740
Your Majesty, I'm innocent.

319
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,180
Your Majesty, I'm innocent.

320
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:33,780
This...

321
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,420
Father, I request to bring Hongde back

322
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,340
to the Inspectorate Office
for further questioning.

323
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:40,940
Permission granted.

324
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,900
I'll take my leave.

325
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,940
You shrew!

326
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,300
You fool!

327
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,020
[Hanqiu Palace]
You've ruined my future!

328
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,580
You scum.

329
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,140
What more future do you want?

330
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,860
They all say men are heartless.

331
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,180
I finally understand it's true.

332
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,100
You shrew, you...

333
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,660
All I know is you're just a scum.

334
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,420
Wait until we're out of the palace,

335
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,140
I'll make you suffer.

336
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,220
You darn shrew.

337
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,620
What was the talisman paper

338
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,900
with Pei Wenxuan's birth charts
and mine used for?

339
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,140
Was it really handwritten
by Pei Wenxuan?

340
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,900
What else do you have to say?

341
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,140
I know nothing more should be said
about this matter.

342
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,860
But I worry for you

343
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,260
and can't help but say more.

344
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,020
Your Majesty, do you know

345
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,020
what kind of talisman Daoist Hongde took

346
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,460
just now?

347
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,380
It's for love to be lasted for three
lifetimes and unbroken by life or death.

348
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,500
The talisman paper was written
by the Prince Consort himself.

349
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,700
It also means

350
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,740
it was the Prince Consort
who sought the talisman.

351
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,380
Your Majesty,

352
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,820
how many men
in this world have such feelings

353
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,020
for their wives?

354
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,140
One lifetime is not enough.
They vow to be together

355
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,940
across three lifetimes.

356
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,340
I remember you once said

357
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,300
that Pei Wenxuan
is from a humble family.

358
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,180
He is a blade you use
to balance the noble families.

359
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,900
He and Princess Pingyue
seem to be deeply in love.

360
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,620
But in reality,

361
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:25,020
it's a means for him
to manipulate Princess Pingyue.

362
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,300
But now, who manipulates whom

363
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,660
between those two?

364
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,500
If Pei Wenxuan truly loved

365
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,780
Princess Pingyue, what would happen?

366
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,660
What do you think would happen?

367
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,700
Keep going.

368
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,260
What if

369
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,740
Princess Pingyue were loyal
to the Crown Prince

370
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,980
and the noble families?

371
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,500
In your opinion,

372
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,620
what should we do, then?

373
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,100
In my opinion,
keeping a tiger around invites trouble.

374
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,580
Since the Prince Consort is devoted
to Princess Pingyue,

375
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,100
why doesn't he
just be an obedient prince consort?

376
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,460
If Princess Pingyue turns out
to be a tiger in the future,

377
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,180
you will have the power
to deal with her.

378
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:19,860
Pei Wenxuan,

379
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,020
what are you doing here?

380
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,100
I'm waiting for you.

381
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:24,940
Alright.

382
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,940
Take a look at this.

383
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,900
Where did you get it?

384
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,580
Hongde gave this to me.

385
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,940
Didn't you write this?

386
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,140
No.

387
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,020
Someone forged my handwriting

388
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,580
and set up a situation for you to judge

389
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,860
while distracting you
with Daoist Hongde's matters.

390
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,660
So

391
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,620
you'll overlook the judgment
of other matters.

392
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,620
They must have another plan.

393
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,740
I guess they already planned

394
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,340
to abandon Daoist Hongde long ago.

395
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,260
Even Consort Rou had anticipated

396
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,500
to be suppressed by me.

397
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,980
Their goal is to make us admit

398
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,620
that this talisman belongs to us.

399
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,100
What exactly is this talisman for?

400
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,940
It's a talisman made by an abbot in the
Matchmaking Temple in the northern city.

401
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,820
To request one, you must bathe, fast,

402
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,020
and recite scriptures
for forty-nine days to make a wish.

403
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,900
The meaning of this talisman

404
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,940
is for two people on the charm
to form a three-lifetime bond

405
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,020
and be bound in life and death.

406
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,820
I was too careless.

407
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,060
Your Highness,

408
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,220
I'm not surprised you failed this time.

409
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,300
After all, no one can take precautions

410
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,700
against hidden attacks from those

411
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,140
who were once close to us.

412
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,940
I should have been more careful.

413
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,860
Don't be angry with me.

414
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,980
I won't be angry.

415
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,860
But what should we do now?

416
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,260
After Father sees this talisman,

417
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,140
he probably won't believe
what you said before.

418
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,460
If we don't do something,

419
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,020
we'll be at the end

420
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,500
before Chuan ascends the throne.

421
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,540
It's all right.
There will always be a way.

422
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,900
Do you have any ideas?

423
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,820
Su Rongqing's move was too aggressive.

424
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,660
He cut off my sources

425
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,300
and ruined my foundation completely.

426
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,540
This talisman...

427
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,100
is Father's most handy weapon.

428
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,020
But these pieces
of evidence now will only raise

429
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,580
Father's suspicion.

430
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,820
Knowing Father's temperament,

431
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,820
he'll definitely test you again.

432
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,260
When that time comes,

433
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,180
you must demonstrate loyalty
as required.

434
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,660
Understand?

435
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,180
What do you mean?

436
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,740
Are you saying that,

437
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,180
if necessary,

438
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,700
you would divorce me?

439
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,540
Exactly.

440
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,620
First, we interfered with the promotion
in the Ministry of Personnel.

441
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,580
Then, Hongde revealed
my relationship with Chuan.

442
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,220
Now, this talisman has appeared.

443
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,540
Father will definitely be suspicious.

444
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,100
No.

445
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,820
I absolutely won't divorce you.

446
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,140
Show your loyalty to Father.

447
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,060
Our divorce may not necessarily
be divorce for real.

448
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,060
Even if Father
really orders us to divorce,

449
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,140
our feelings

450
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,260
aren't something
a marriage contract can decide.

451
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,340
Are you saying

452
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,980
whether we are husband
and wife is really not important?

453
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,060
I never said that.

454
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,980
Then, what do you mean?

455
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,900
There seems to be no other way now.

456
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,220
If you don't do this,

457
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,060
you may lose the position
of Vice Minister of Personnel.

458
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,180
We cannot divorce because of that.

459
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,780
I won't be
the Vice Minister of Personnel, then.

460
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,340
It's not just about being
the Vice Minister of Personnel.

461
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,660
You might never hold

462
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,780
any position with real power again.

463
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,900
You might not even hold

464
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,180
the position of investigating censor.

465
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,420
It's fine if I'm not
the Vice Minister of Personnel,

466
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,220
an investigating censor,
or even the Grand Chancellor.

467
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,140
Whether I hold office
or not doesn't matter to me.

468
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,100
I just don't want to divorce you.

469
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,460
Then what are you going to do
if you don't hold any position?

470
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,660
Return to Luzhou to row boats,
pick lotus flowers,

471
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,780
and relive the past?

472
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,460
Do you want to live
your whole life indecisively?

473
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,500
Listen to me.

474
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,420
Relationships require qualifications.

475
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,340
You and Chuan's biggest problem

476
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,540
is that when you lack ability,

477
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,340
you crave things you shouldn't.

478
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,260
When have I desired that I shouldn't?

479
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,300
I just hope my wife won't give up

480
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,260
on our marriage like I do.

481
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,020
Is that something I shouldn't desire?

482
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,420
Pei Wenxuan, you're panicking.

483
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,620
You're scared.

484
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,940
You don't trust me.

485
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,900
If you trusted me a little more

486
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,940
and believed in yourself a little more,

487
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,820
you would agree with me.

488
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,700
Fine.

489
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,820
If you really want to divorce me,
I don't care anymore.

490
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,580
I can fulfill your wish.

491
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,300
What do you mean by "I"?

492
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,300
But listen, Li Rong.

493
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,380
It's not that I don't trust you.

494
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,340
It's that you haven't given me
the respect I deserve.

495
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,140
Every time you make a decision,

496
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,820
you choose power
without hesitating at all.

497
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,020
Have you ever considered my feelings?

498
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,060
Have you ever thought of me?

499
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,100
No, you haven't.

500
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,380
If you insist on thinking like this,

501
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,620
there's nothing more
for me to say to you.

502
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,300
Fine.

503
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,820
All right. No problem.

504
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,740
If you don't want to hold office,
then don't.

505
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,140
If you want to get killed,
then go ahead.

506
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,100
If you're willing to lose
to Su Rongqing,

507
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,220
I don't mind.

508
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,940
Do you think I care about you that much?

509
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,580
I just want to tell you

510
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,220
that love is useless in this situation.
The future is important.

511
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,100
But it's all right.

512
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,100
You figure it out on your own.

513
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,060
I'm not coming back tonight.

514
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,700
If you don't come back,
I'll write the divorce letter now.

515
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,460
Go ahead.

516
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,220
I'll go and drink
on a show boat now.

517
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,820
I'll have eight or ten handsome men
keep me company.

518
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,380
If you don't divorce tomorrow,

519
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,380
you're a coward.

520
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:24,780
Your Highness,

521
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,300
where are you going?

522
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,540
I'm going to the lake to find a boat

523
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,340
and go to Nanfeng House
to find the most handsome man.

524
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,980
It would be best
if he could play some music.

525
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,220
Your Highness, are you really going?

526
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,580
The most important thing now
is to find a solution,

527
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,660
not to argue with Li Rong.

528
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,500
Young Master,

529
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,740
bad news.

530
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,500
The princess went to the lake,

531
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,100
rented a show boat,

532
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,340
and called many men
from Nanfeng House.

533
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,460
Nothing major will happen
with so many people.

534
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,940
How could you say that?

535
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,300
You can't
allow the Princess to act recklessly.

536
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,460
When there's a first time,
there will be a second time.

537
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,980
There may be many people this time.
What if there are fewer next time?

538
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,820
Get out.

539
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:04,660
What?

540
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,780
I said, get out.

541
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:08,900
Young Master...

542
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,420
Did I not make myself clear enough?

543
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,780
This is so frustrating.

544
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,820
You want to divorce me?

545
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,020
Yes.

546
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,540
Have you ever cared about me at all?

547
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,220
No, you haven't.

548
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,500
Do you think I care about you that much?

549
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,900
I just want to tell you

550
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,780
that love is useless in this situation.
The future is important.

551
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,820
Pei Wenxuan, are you all right?

552
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,180
I'm waiting for you in the palace.

553
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,180
If you don't come back,

554
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,380
I may think it's fine.

555
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,540
But I'll still be afraid.

556
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:14,660
Forget it.

557
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,300
This letter can't be sent out anyway.

558
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,660
I'll tell you the truth.

559
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,180
How could I be fine

560
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,540
if you didn't come back?

561
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,220
Pei Wenxuan,

562
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,700
I regret letting you leave Huajing.

563
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,020
I'm fine
without the Inspectorate Office.

564
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,700
If you don't come back,

565
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,820
where should I look for you?

566
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,500
Pei Wenxuan, they all say you're dead.

567
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,140
But I don't believe it.

568
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,540
They wouldn't know

569
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,540
how capable and clever you are.

570
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,940
How could those people

571
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,140
from high places understand

572
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,780
the amazing resilience of tender grass

573
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,900
breaking through stones?

574
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,180
Moreover, I'm still waiting
for you in Huajing.

575
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,900
Pei Wenxuan, do you have no heart?

576
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,700
Li Rong is not like ordinary girls

577
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,900
who talk openly about emotions.

578
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,380
Even in letters,

579
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,580
she rarely mentions it.

580
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,500
But she would set up an ambush
at the Butterfly Gorge

581
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,580
for you being assassinated.

582
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,780
She would drive away Xie Lanqing

583
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,620
She would even try to please you

584
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,500
by meeting people everywhere

585
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,660
only to get you a position
as the secretary of examinations.

586
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:26,180
How can you say she only loves power?

587
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,460
It looks so pretty.

588
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,300
What did you wish for?

589
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:49,980
Let's go.

590
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,700
There's another one there.

591
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,140
It looks so beautiful.

592
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,180
How beautiful!

593
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,980
Come on, let's go set one off too.

594
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,340
All right.

595
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,860
Let's pick a red one.

596
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,540
All right.

597
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,940
Slow down. Don't run.

598
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,060
Your Highness, all the best places
to see lanterns today

599
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,420
have been reserved
by various families in advance,

600
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,020
instructing their servants
to mark out the spots.

601
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,460
We came late,

602
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,780
leaving us and the common people

603
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,740
in the same lake.

604
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,060
It might be a bit noisy.

605
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,220
Your Highness,
please don't be angry.

606
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,380
It's all right as long as we're here.

607
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:23,940
Yes, Your Highness.

608
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,260
- Greetings, Miss.
- Greetings, Miss.

609
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,700
Everyone, please rise.

610
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,420
- Thank you, Miss.
- Thank you, Miss.

611
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,180
Those who can play music, play.

612
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,580
Those who can sing, sing.

613
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,700
Those who can dance, dance.

614
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,980
If you can't do anything,

615
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,340
it's all right if you enjoy yourselves

616
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,660
so long you can liven things up.

617
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,740
- Yes, Miss.
- Yes, Miss.

618
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,460
Miss, shall I massage your shoulders?

619
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,380
Shall I massage your legs?

620
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,380
Speaking of which...

621
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,020
No need.

622
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,260
Miss, is this pressure all right?

623
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,260
No need.

624
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,580
After retiring from office

625
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,460
and returns to his hometown...

626
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,780
News of me boarding this show boat

627
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,660
will reach the palace tomorrow.

628
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,940
If Pei Wenxuan calms down,

629
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,460
he will explain

630
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,940
to Father

631
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,380
that our relationship
isn't as good as he thinks.

632
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,260
If he can't calm down,

633
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,980
he probably wants a divorce.

634
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,340
I'm the Earth Deity

635
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,980
of the county where you resigned...

636
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,060
That would be good.

637
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,420
So he won't ruin his future.

638
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,180
Then why are you here?

639
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,300
I saw the Earth Deity staring blankly
at the county magistrate.

640
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,700
Your land

641
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,060
has been blown away.

642
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,020
I can only follow you here.

643
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,260
That's a good story.

644
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,300
Go and get your reward later.

645
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,140
Thank you, Miss.

646
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,540
If you like it,

647
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:55,820
how about I perform a magic trick?

648
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,620
A magic trick?

649
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,140
I've been entrusted by someone

650
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,780
to entertain you today.

651
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,700
Entrusted by someone?

652
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,020
Please watch, Miss.

653
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,420
At this moment,

654
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,660
this box is empty.

655
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,820
Please watch closely.

656
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,180
There's nothing.

657
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:45,860
Awesome.

658
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,620
Incredible.

659
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,420
That's amazing.

660
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,740
It's been a while.

661
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,940
Are you satisfied
with the special surprise

662
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,700
prepared just for you?

663
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,460
You can leave now.

664
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:06,700
Leave.

665
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,460
Leave now.

666
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,700
Both of you, hurry up.

667
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,500
I'm coming.

668
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,660
Jinglan.

669
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,460
Your Highness.

670
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,260
I know Her Highness has invited people
from Nanfeng House.

671
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,900
I'm not here to cause trouble.

672
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,420
Where is she?

673
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,100
I won't ask the second time.

674
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,660
The boat has already set sail.

675
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,180
Which one?

676
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:42,780
Tell me!

677
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:47,260
The one in the middle of the lake,
with flowers painted on it.

678
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,540
A double-decker boat.

679
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,780
Mister, where's my boat?

680
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,540
Sir,

681
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,420
why are you alone?

682
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,260
Weren't you supposed
to bring your wife along?

683
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,380
Enough talking. Take me there.

684
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,620
This way, please.

685
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,860
Please keep trouble out.

686
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,260
What are you doing here?

687
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,900
I've been wanting to speak
with you for a long time, Your Highness.

688
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,660
But I've never had the chance.

689
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,780
I saw you at the lakeside today.

690
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,300
So, I mingled with the crowd
and boarded this boat.

691
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,500
I didn't expect it

692
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,820
to be a banquet hosted by you.

693
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,780
Your lifestyle

694
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,580
has truly broadened my horizons.

695
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,060
Why aren't you bowing,
knowing I'm the Princess?

696
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,020
You don't want to reveal your identity.

697
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,620
So I'm just following your wishes.

698
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,500
Stop the nonsense.

699
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,860
What do you want from me?

700
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,140
I want to ask you a favor.

701
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,860
I want to seek justice

702
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,860
for a friend of mine,
Chen Houzhao, from Qingcheng Academy.

703
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,260
What justice

704
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,220
do you need help from me?

705
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,100
Chen Houzhao is an old friend of mine

706
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,620
who is very talented.

707
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,300
This time in the imperial examination,

708
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,420
he topped the local exam

709
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,900
and was supposed to participate

710
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,060
in the metropolitan
civil service exam as a candidate.

711
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,980
But the local squire, Xiao Pingzhang,
colluded with the authorities

712
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,540
to take away his spot

713
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,380
and let his own son, Xiao Shunwen,

714
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,860
take his place and opportunity instead.

715
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,700
My friend traveled
to the capital to appeal.

716
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,180
But he was chased
and attacked along the way.

717
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,820
When he finally reached the capital,

718
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,940
no official was willing
to hear his case.

719
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,780
I have long heard of your reputation.

720
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,580
I know that you're righteous and fair.

721
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,500
I hope you can seek justice
for my friend.

722
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,380
Thank you, Eunuch Fu.

723
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,900
I brewed this calming soup myself.

724
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,660
It's your favorite.

725
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,860
Please drink it and rest early.

726
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,460
Thank you.

727
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,820
Do you think

728
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,460
you can get no benefit in this case?

729
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,180
Why?

730
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,340
Do you have something to offer?

731
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,820
Most of the things I can offer you

732
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,420
aren't to your liking.

733
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:22,860
But there's only one thing.

734
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,300
Let's see if you want it.

735
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,820

738
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:35,220
while enjoying a boat ride?

739
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,020

as a bed partner, huh?

743

744
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,740

Let's go.

750
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,620
What are you doing?

751
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,340
Move aside!

752
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,220
What are you doing?

753
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,140
Pei Wenxuan,

754
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,420
where are you taking me?

755
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,180
What are you doing?
Stop acting like a mad person.

756
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,900
Calm down a bit.

757
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,900
Pei Wenxuan is a sensible person.

758
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,180
He won't lose his mind
even if he's being mad.

759
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,380
Even if he goes crazy tonight

760
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,940
and wants to die with me,

761
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,980
there's a proper way to do it.

762
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,660
Why did you come running to me

763
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,060
late at night

764
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,820
instead of writing
the divorce letter at home?

765
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,500
Could it be that
after thinking it through,

766
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,020

767
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,220

768
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,300
Make haste if you have something to say.

769
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,220
Many men are waiting for me.

770
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,980
You want to go back, right?

771
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,940
In your dreams.

772
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,660
Even in your dreams,
you won't get anything.

773
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,700
From now on,
stay at the Princess's Mansion

774
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,780
and be a good wife.

775

776
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,020
Row the boat back.

777
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:16,940
Go back yourself.

778
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:18,980
Go.

779
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:27,540
All right.

780
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,380
I thought you were good at swimming.

781
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,500
You can swim back.

782
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,540
You can do it.

783

784
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,180
What did Cui Yulang mean just now?

785
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,700
Exactly what you heard.

786
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,420
Can't you say something nice to me?

787
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,380
What do you mean by something nice?

788
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,020
Can't you explain to me

789
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,620
what you're thinking?

790
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,540
Is it that difficult?

791
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,900
That's what I think.

792
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,260
Didn't you say

793
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,540
I never had you in my heart?

794
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,100
I just wanted to come out and have fun.

795
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,740
I leased the show boat

796
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,060
and I invited those men.

797
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,780
You know what Cui Yulang meant.

798
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,100
He volunteered to be a bed partner.

799
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,980
What's wrong? Are you upset?

800
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,060
If you're upset,
go back and write the divorce letter.

801
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,940
Or you can go to Chunfeng House

802
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,900
and find some pretty girls.

803
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,260
Why bother coming here
to vent your frustration on me?

804
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,940

What can you do about that?
