00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 12]

5
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,540
I am not speaking to you tonight

6
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,140
to seek any response.

7
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,380
I was hoping

8
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,980
to resolve our past misunderstandings,

9
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,380
so it could benefit

10
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,940
our future cooperation.

11
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,180
About what happened tonight,

12
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,180
find a chance
to explain things to Miss Qin

13
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,020
to prevent misunderstandings.

14
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,780
I know.

15
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,180
I want to apologize
for my previous actions too.

16
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,980
I should not have tried
to match you with Su Rongqing.

17
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,180
It won't happen again.

18
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,580
Actually, I never blamed you.

19
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,940
I just feel

20
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,460
that before a relationship is clear,

21
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,260
I don't want to disturb others.

22
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,660
All right.

23
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,500
But we need
to find a new way to get along.

24
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,100
We're not just good friends anymore?

25
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,780
From now on,

26
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,180
you manage your affairs,

27
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,860
and I'll manage my own.

28
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,380
I also have a request.

29
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,740
In the future,
whenever something is troubling us,

30
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,860
we must express it.

31
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,820
Moreover,

32
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,700
we've been given

33
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,020
a second chance by fate.

34
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,700
Why suffer alone?

35
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,500
I...

36
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,460
I'll try my best.

37
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,900
Can I say something?

38
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,580
What is it?

39
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,860
Can you stop mentioning separation
so easily in the future?

40
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,620
I need some dignity too.

41
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,500
Sure.

42
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,140
Don't laugh.

43
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,820
[Taiji Hall]
General Jianwu, Wang Jun.

44
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,900
General Jianwei, Wang Minghai.

45
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,620
This list of military achievements
has been verified without errors.

46
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,500
We respectfully request
the imperial judgment.

47
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,380
We received good news today

48
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,060
where the front line
won a great victory.

49
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,780
General Xiao submitted a list
of merits to the Ministry of War,

50
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,660
totaling 17 military officers.

51
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,260
If you have no objections,

52
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,740
it should be approved.

53
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,260
Your Majesty,

54
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,060
General Xiao
and his soldiers have worked hard,

55
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:30,780
which is undeniable.

56
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,380
However, the Crown Prince led
the noble families' sons

57
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,820
to fight bravely in the initial phase.

58
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,900
We cannot overlook that.

59
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,580
But why is there no mention of them
in the list?

60
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,740
Your Majesty,

61
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,820
military success is always rewarded
based on merit.

62
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,820
The true victors were
the Xiao Family's soldiers.

63
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,620
Why should noble families' sons vie
for these military honors?

64
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,860
A true servant should uphold integrity
and fairness

65
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,580
without being biased.

66
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,420
You say I am biased?

67
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,260
Your Majesty,

68
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,500
I am unjustly accused without basis.

69
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,820
Please seek justice for me.

70
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,620
That's enough!

71
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,260
You're giving me a headache.

72
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,060
Crown Prince,

73
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,620
this matter involves you.

74
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,820
What do you think?

75
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,140
Father,

76
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,380
as the Crown Prince,

77
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,740
my duty on the front line was
for the country and the people.

78
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,020
Since it was for the people,

79
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,620
why seek military honor?

80
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,260
Soldiers are different.

81
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,820
They either fight bravely

82
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,380
or sacrifice for the country.

83
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,380
We should reward

84
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,180
based on merit.

85
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,700
Since opinions vary,

86
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,580
this matter
should be thoroughly verified.

87
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,180
We shall discuss this another day.

88
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:50,820
You are dismissed.

89
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,740
- Farewell, Your Majesty.
- Farewell, Your Majesty.

90
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,060
People inside said
the Crown Prince was also inside,

91
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,620
and the argument was heated.

92
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,420
What's going on?

93
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,580
Why are you fighting again?

94
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,340
You dare to mention this?

95
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,780
Kneel!

96
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,140
What's the matter, Mother?

97
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,180
Why are you so upset?

98
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,820
Between us both,

99
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,140
do we still need to put an act?

100
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,140
What did you mean yesterday?

101
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,620
Mother, I shall ask the same question.

102
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,340
What do you intend to do?

103
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,940
I want Shangguan Ya
to become the Crown Princess.

104
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,180
Was I not clear enough?

105
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,140
Why did you meddle in this matter?

106
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,820
He is the Crown Prince
and acts recklessly.

107
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,420
Do you follow him
in his recklessness too?

108
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,980
This has nothing to do with Rong.

109
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,380
I already said

110
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,220
it was I who asked Rong for help.

111
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,820
So please calm down, Mother.

112
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,660
Yesterday was such a great opportunity.

113
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,900
But you wasted it.

114
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,500
Are you mad or foolish?

115
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,980
Your father has been suppressing

116
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,300
the marriage between you and Ya.

117
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,100
Yesterday, everything was ready.

118
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,620
If you had chosen
Ya's lily palace incense,

119
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,540
your uncle would have brought people out

120
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,260
and forced an imperial edict.

121
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,100
But why did you choose your sister's?

122
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,140
Do you know how hard it is

123
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,460
to get another opportunity like that?

124
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,900
Forgive me.

125
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,700
Please calm down

126
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,660
and punish me however you want.

127
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,220
How could you have such audacity?

128
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,140
Do you think I'm blind?

129
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,460
What are you thinking?

130
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,580
You refused to cooperate
with the Yang family,

131
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:27,980
so fine.

132
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,380
But marriage alliance is
such a significant matter.

133
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,060
If you don't marry Ya,

134
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,740
how will your uncle ever trust you?

135
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,220
Uncle won't trust him

136
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,660
just because he won't marry a woman?

137
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,380
What did Chuan do wrong?

138
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,340
The Shangguan Family has been in power
for three dynasties.

139
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,300
Do you still not understand

140
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,620
where the conflict
between Father and us comes from?

141
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,820
Do you think Chuan still has a way out?

142
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,820
With the Shangguan Family blood
in his veins,

143
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,220
he's destined to have no way out.

144
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,740
Since we're already so deeply tied,

145
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,740
we must rely on the Shangguan Family.

146
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,420
What else does Uncle have
to worry about?

147
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,060
Why force them together?

148
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,180
What's the benefit of this?

149
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,460
Mother,

150
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,220
we all know

151
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,580
Uncle doesn't just want
a Crown Princess.

152
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,540
He wants the Empress position.

153
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,980
Each generation of the Li Family flows

154
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,900
with the Shangguan Family's blood.

155
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,620
You represent
the present Shangguan Family.

156
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,220
But Uncle wants Chuan

157
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,580
to promise the future.

158
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,220
But this is ultimately
the Li Family's empire,

159
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,580
not the Shangguan Family's.

160
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,500
The Shangguan Family should step back.

161
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,740
What did you say?

162
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,700
Say it again.

163
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,700
I said,

164
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,140
if the Shangguan Family wants
to remain well,

165
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,700
he should step back.

166
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,220
When water overflows, it spills.

167
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,100
When prosperity reaches its peak,
it will fall.

168
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,620
Father won't tolerate
the next emperor having

169
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,220
a Shangguan Empress.

170
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,660
If you insist on forcing this union,

171
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,420
the future ruler of the nine provinces

172
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,980
may not be Chuan.

173
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,740
Mother,

174
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,180
let the Shangguan Family withdraw
from the capital.

175
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,460
It will be better for everyone.

176
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,340
Get up.

177
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,100
Let's go.

178
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,540
Li Chuan,

179
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,740
get up.

180
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,900
We will take our leave.

181
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,580
Li Chuan!

182
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,900
Rong, you're amazing.

183
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,420
I can't believe
I defied Mother with you just now

184
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,380
and did something
I have always wanted to do.

185
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,300
Silly boy.

186
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,540
I am serious.

187
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,540
I thought

188
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,780
you would think I was wrong

189
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,580
and help Mother persuade me.

190
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,300
Chuan.

191
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,020
I don't understand.

192
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,060
Even you are here to persuade me
to marry Shangguan Ya.

193
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,140
The marriage alliance

194
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,820
between two noble families was always
based on mutual ulterior motives.

195
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,420
If there are conflicting interests,

196
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,540
how can marrying a woman solve anything?

197
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,780
Besides, I am not even familiar
with Shangguan Ya

198
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,140
and I have never met
those four secondary consorts.

199
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,500
I only want to marry someone
with mutual affection.

200
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,260
You need to understand

201
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,540
that in this royal city,

202
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,020
no one can do as they please.

203
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,300
Chuan,

204
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,940
everyone lives for others.

205
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,700
You can't be too selfish.

206
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,660
Just…

207
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,660
Just do it for me and Mother.

208
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,180
What do you say?

209
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,540
If one day I ascend the throne,

210
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,580
will you also pressure me

211
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,820
like the noble families pressure Father?

212
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,300
Chuan...

213
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,300
If this is what you want,

214
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,700
then so be it.

215
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,260
I just think

216
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,820
no one will truly support you

217
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,300
because of a marriage.

218
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,580
In reality, it doesn't matter
whether you marry the Shangguans.

219
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,540
So long as your core interests align,

220
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,180
they will always stand by your side.

221
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,580
Moreover, given the current situation,

222
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,660
marrying the Shangguans

223
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,140
will only bring you harm
and no benefits.

224
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,300
You have a point.

225
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,300
You truly have sharp eyes.

226
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,540
Well, not really.

227
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,780
I…

228
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,700
I only saw things clearly

229
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,780
after a dream.

230
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,700
In the dream,

231
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,060
I was too immature.

232
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,940
You had such a dream?

233
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,940
Why do you believe anything people say?

234
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,860
Actually, I was just being too willful.

235
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,540
You didn't get to choose
whom you married either.

236
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,860
So why should I have this privilege?

237
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,020
You're not willful.

238
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,700
You're just not strong enough.

239
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,580
People only have the right to choose

240
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,660
when they are strong enough.

241
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,340
If you want the right to choose,

242
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,780
I will always support you.

243
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,140
But you need to have the ability.

244
00:12:59,300 --> 00:12:59,940
Don't you agree?

245
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,540
So, if I am strong enough

246
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,860
and do not harm those
who shouldn't be harmed,

247
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,860
you wouldn't think I'm wrong,

248
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,460
am I right?

249
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,780
As long as you think you're not wrong,
that's what matters.

250
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,380
Whether I think you're wrong
is not important.

251
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,380
Besides, I'm not always right either.

252
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:27,180
What if my thoughts are different
from yours?

253
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,460
Chuan.

254
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,580
Even if one day

255
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,660
your thoughts are completely different
from mine,

256
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,780
you are still my brother.

257
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,660
I will never give up on you.

258
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,620
Rong,

259
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,500
I think you are too kind.

260
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,580
Stop talking nonsense.

261
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,140
Your Majesty,

262
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,780
don't be too upset.

263
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,500
The Princess and the Crown Prince are

264
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,700
in their youthful and spirited years.

265
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,500
Don't take it to heart.

266
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,180
They will understand your intentions
in the future.

267
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,900
With Chuan like this,

268
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,660
what should I say to my elder brother?

269
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,180
It seems quite strange.

270
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:25,060
The Crown Prince
has always been obedient to you.

271
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,740
But now he seems
to have changed completely.

272
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,660
He even dares

273
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,060
to defy this marriage.

274
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,740
You are right.

275
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,700
Why would Chuan defy this marriage?

276
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,100
Could there be someone in his heart?

277
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,660
His Highness is not young anymore.

278
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,140
It's common to have
some questionable people around,

279
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,980
and it's possible

280
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,260
to be bewitched by someone.

281
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,460
Investigate any suspicious women

282
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,020
around the Crown Prince recently.

283
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,100
I want you to report everything

284
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,100
including where he went, what he did,

285
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,220
and whom he met.

286
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

287
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:07,900
Young Master Pei,

288
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,780
we've received news from our spy.

289
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,900
Xiao Su's list
of recommended military officers

290
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,460
for commendation is causing

291
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,700
a lot of controversy.

292
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,380
His Majesty replaced the generals
before the Crown Prince's success was

293
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,540
to suppress the noble families.

294
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,820
But the Crown Prince's
earlier successes relied

295
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,860
on the support of these noble families.

296
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,180
If they are not rewarded this time,

297
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,900
their previous efforts will be in vain.

298
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,700
How would they let it go easily?

299
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,900
Xiao Su is still on the front lines.

300
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,180
The noble families can't make a move.

301
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,300
Consort Rou is favored by His Majesty.

302
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,380
If they could act,
they would have done so already.

303
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,220
The noble families will look
for an easier target.

304
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,060
But His Majesty won't just stand by.

305
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,820
Inform Her Highness

306
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,020
that she need not worry.

307
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,660
Let His Majesty
and the noble families fight it out.

308
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,820
If the noble families win,

309
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,540
they support the Crown Prince anyway.

310
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,420
So it won't matter.

311
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,660
If His Majesty wins,

312
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,580
some of the military officers
on Xiao Su's list are

313
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,460
our people too.

314
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,660
We'll find another way for the rest.

315
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,820
Have the spy contact Qin Lin.

316
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,900
If he needs anything, he should say so.

317
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,980
In the court,

318
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,100
I'll have Tuoba Yan secretly assist
the Qin Family.

319
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,220
But this must remain a secret.

320
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,260
The relationship between the Princess,

321
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,380
the Crown Prince,

322
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,500
and the Qin Family must appear

323
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,740
as distant as possible.

324
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,500
Yes, Young Master.

325
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,340
Your Highness.

326
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,300
Miss Qin.

327
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,900
You just went through
the consort selection process.

328
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,180
It's not appropriate
to meet other women privately.

329
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,460
I invited Miss Qin according
to the customs of the martial world

330
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,740
to select a suitable sword

331
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,300
as a birthday gift for my friend
in the army.

332
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,300
So it is not considered
a private meeting.

333
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,620
Just so you know,

334
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,420
swords made by Master Jiang

335
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,020
[Yixiang Blacksmith]
are unmatched, truly exceptional.

336
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,540
I waited a long time
before he softened his heart.

337
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,820
Aren't you the Crown Prince?

338
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,340
How can you use your power

339
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,780
to coerce someone for a gift?

340
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,020
This is the list of military merits
that His Majesty approved today.

341
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,220
Grand Chancellor, please take a look.

342
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,580
Take it back to the palace.

343
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,900
I do not approve of it,

344
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,020
nor will I take responsibility for it.

345
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,060
Grand Chancellor, aren't you afraid

346
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,380
of angering His Majesty?

347
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,180
It's just an official hat.

348
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,300
I don't care if I lose it.

349
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,140
Ask His Majesty

350
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,540
if he also wants my head

351
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,780
for this list.

352
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,540
Official Shangguan,

353
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,820
do you think

354
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,020
the decree cannot be issued

355
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,380
without you?

356
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,820
I wonder

357
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,220
how tall your friend is.

358
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,740
She is about your height.

359
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,540
Is he good at offense

360
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,020
or agility?

361
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,860
It seems she is skilled in both.

362
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,860
Versatile indeed.

363
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,260
Wouldn't that make him
the greatest martial artist?

364
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,620
Miss Qin,
which do you think you are good at?

365
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,500
Forgive my presumptuousness.

366
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,620
But you can be frank with me.

367
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,100
Is this sword a gift for me?

368
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,540
I saw your natal chart
on the day of the incense ceremony.

369
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,460
So I know today is your birthday.

370
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,660
I prepared this hastily.

371
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,260
If it doesn't meet your liking,

372
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,340
I will spare no effort

373
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,300
to obtain it

374

375
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,460
No,

376
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,020
I really like it.

377
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,980
It's just that I grew up
on the frontier.

378
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,820
My mother passed early

379
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,140
and my father and brothers
were all rough men.

380
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,420
They only know fighting and killing.

381
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,460
Have you never celebrated your birthday?

382
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,140
No matter.

383
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,020
There's a first time for everything.

384
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,420
Birthday girl, pick a sword.

385
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,580
But

386
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,020
I cannot accept this for no reason.

387
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,140
If you don't choose one,

388
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,580
how will you defend

389
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,900
against Zhilan you gifted me
in future battles?

390
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,820
Choose one, please.

391
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,500
All right.

392
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,580

397
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,580
His Majesty and the Secretariat
have approved this list today.

398

399
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:00,940

400
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,500
Eunuch Fu,

401
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,420
your timing today is indeed unfortunate.

402
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,780
You see,

403
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,020
the sun is already setting.

404
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,100

to receive birthday gifts,

eat longevity noodles, and watch a play.

409
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,540
Now, I've received the gift,

410
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,900
watched the play, and eaten the noodles.

411
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,740
Is there anything else?

412
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,700
There is one more thing.

413
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:38,780

surely you're not thinking

of dismissing us like this?

so I naturally refused this list.

Grandfather!

559
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,020
Leave now!

560
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,100
Grandfather, I'm not leaving.

561
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,340
I said, leave now!

562
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,460
Is anyone there? Help us!

563
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,780
Help! They're killing people!

564
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,420
Stop them!

565
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,100
Is anyone there?

566
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,340
- Help!
- Help us!

567
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,340
Who are you?

568
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,620
Please save our Qin Family!

569
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,020
What's the situation
with the Qin Family?

570
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,220
How did you get out?

571
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,740
They have killed so many people.

572
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,260
We escaped in the chaos.

573
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,940
Please save our young lady.

574
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,940
Qin Zhenzhen?

575
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:54,980
Where is she?

576
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,500
She escaped in that direction.

577
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,060
Please save her.

578
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,660
Yuan Feiyu, settle these ladies down

579
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,820
and have the area nearby searched.

580
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,220
Save anyone from the Qin Family.

581
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,980
You'll follow me to find Qin Zhenzhen.

582
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:05,740
Yes, Your Highness.

583
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:06,980
Keep them safe.

584
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:07,740
Follow me.

585
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,780
Outrageous.

586
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,820
How many lives do they have?

587
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,180
What do they take me for?

588
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,300
Your Majesty, calm down.

589
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,540
Now is not the time to confront them.

590
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,660
Please issue orders immediately

591
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,660
to keep the Qin Family safe first.

592
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,780
However, the evidence currently held
by the Ministry of Justice is solid.

593
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:31,020
Their actions are in line with our laws.

594
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,260
Your Majesty,

595
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,980
this so-called evidence
without verification

596
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,140
may just be
the Ministry of Justice's word alone.

597
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,740
Your Majesty is also aware
that the Qin's case is

598
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,140
the noble families purging dissenters.

599
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,460
It's a warning to Your Majesty
who favors the lower classes

600
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,580
and competing military honors
with the border soldiers.

601
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,540
I know all this too.

602
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,180
Tell me

603
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,820
what other options are there now.

604
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:55,940
Your Majesty,

605
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,060
why not appoint someone to represent you

606
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,900
in supervising
the Ministry of Justice's investigation

607
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,900
to ensure
the noble families do not act unfairly.

608
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,100
Then take advantage of the situation
and make good use of them.

609
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,460
Your Majesty,

610
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,380
I'm willing...

611
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:08,980
Fulai.

612
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,100
Summon Su Rongqing

613
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,140
and have him handle this matter.

614
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,700
Yes, Your Majesty.

615
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,780
Let's split up and search.

616
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:27,940
Who's there?

617
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:29,940
Put down your swords.

618
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,260
I'm here to save you.

619
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,780
How can I believe you?

620
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,420
Do you remember what you said to me
while blending scents?

621
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,860
Go and find Pei Wenxuan

622
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,220
and tell him I've found her.

623
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:00,740
Yes, Your Highness.

624
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,140
Let no one reveal anything

625
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,980
about today's events.

626
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:04,860
Yes, Your Highness.

627
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,100
Come out.

628
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,060
Mother!

629
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,340
Your Highness, you can't go in.

630
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,020
Mother!

631
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,140
Your Highness, you...

632
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:17,860
Come out!

633
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,100
Do you have something to do
with the Qin Family incident?

634
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,300
Do you like the daughter
of the Qin Family?

635
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,020
Mother,

636
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,340
answer me first.

637
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,300
Yes

638
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,100
and no.

639
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,380
What do you mean?

640
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,220
Originally, it was just a Qin Family.

641
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,980
If you like her,

642
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,260
you can just marry her.

643
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,780
It's not worth my effort to do anything.

644
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:48,900
But she insisted on standing
with Consort Rou

645
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,660
to oppose noble families.

646
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:55,580
It's not just me
who wants to get rid of the Qin Family.

647
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,700
Tell me where Qin Zhenzhen is,

648
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,420
or I'll kill Qin Yun!

649
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,020
Grandfather.

650
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,020
I don't mind dying.

651
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,340
Kill him!

652
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,100
Stop!

653
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,100
Your Majesty has decreed

654
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,820
that although there is evidence
in the Qin case,

655
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,940
considering their contributions
to the northwest war,

656
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,460
the Ministry of Justice will postpone
the trial.

657
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,300
Private execution is not permitted.

658
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,300
- We thank Your Majesty for your grace.
- We thank Your Majesty for your grace.

659
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,060
His Highness has ordered

660
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,940
that finding Miss Qin is enough.

661
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,380
There should be
no further complications.

662
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,740
- Yes.
- Yes.

663
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,270
[Princess's Mansion]

664
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,300
Chuan.

665
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,700
Rong,

666
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,780
have you seen Qin Zhenzhen
at the Qin's Mansion?

667
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,460
No.

668
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,740
We're still searching.

669
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,100
If you have any news,

670
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,580
please inform me immediately.

671
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,820
Don't worry for now.

672
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,020
Come with me.

673
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,180
Tell me

674
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,620
about the situation in the palace.

675
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,340
Father intends to review this case.

676
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,300
But,

677
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,460
can you preside over the trial?

678
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,020
Me?

679
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,620
It's not convenient for me to act.

680
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,740
If I do,

681
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,060
the noble families will retaliate.

682
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,340
I'm concerned

683
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,140
they might even try
to depose me as the Crown Prince,

684
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,620
especially since Father
doesn't trust me.

685
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,740
Regarding the noble families,

686
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,980
I cannot be too forceful.

687
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,980
Are you planning

688
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,140
to take action
against those involved in this case?

689
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,500
But they are all Uncle's people.

690
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,620
Are you sure about this?

691
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,420
Yes.

692
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,380
Unless they dull their edges,

693
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,380
rebellious swords

694
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,380
should be discarded.

695
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,500
Did Mother say anything to you?

696
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,940
Mother secretly investigated me

697
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,660
and found out about my friendship
with Miss Qin.

698
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,340
She's worried

699
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,180
that Qin Zhenzhen might threaten
Shangguan Ya's position.

700
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,780
So she passed the information to Uncle.

701
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,660
Recently, those from humble origins
led by Consort Rou

702
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,660
have been aggressive.

703
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,260
Uncle took the Qin Family
as a warning to the rest.

704
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,660
For the noble families
to target a family of humble background,

705
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,860
I'm not surprised at all.

706
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,860
But I didn't expect they would resort
to such drastic measures,

707
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,420
almost to the point of extermination.

708
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,780
They even accused them of treason.

709
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,100
This serious crime is a warning

710
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,580
from the Shangguan Family to Father

711
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,300
and a warning to you about refusing
to accept the Crown Princess.

712
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,420
Rong,

713
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,460
one can only have choices
when one becomes powerful.

714
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,380
Today, I want to ask you a question.

715
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,740
Do you want this power or not?

716
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,980
If you do,

717
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,540
I will support you with all my strength.

718
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,820
How would you support me?

719
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,620
Now, the Qin Family's case
is a perfect opportunity.

720
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,820
Father currently lacks someone

721
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,220
who is in a high enough position

722
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,700
that can naturally suppress others

723
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,060
and whom the noble families dare not
or be able to act against,

724
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,500
to help him clean up the court.

725
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,980
This is your best opportunity.

726
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,020
Rong,

727
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,020
find a suitable reason

728
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,460
to pledge loyalty to Father.

729
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,340
Use this opportunity
to establish your own guards

730
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,420
under the pretext
of thoroughly investigating this case

731
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,460
directly under Father's command,

732
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,540
not under the jurisdiction
of the Three Departments.

733
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:56,060
It would act independently
outside the court's influence,

734
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,380
with the power over life and death.

735
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,860
I have just discussed this
with Mr. Pei.

736
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,820
You can call it the Inspectorate Office.

737
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,980
Inspectorate Office?

738
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:13,780
Yes.

739
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,980
If you establish this office,

740
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,220
I will protect you
if the noble families cause trouble.

741
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,900
They won't dare to touch you.

742
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,260
Rong,

743
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,980
you are the best candidate
to investigate Qin's case.

744
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,500
You can speak to Father now.

745
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,500
He will agree to it.

746
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,700
But in the future,

747
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,300
no one will tolerate
the Inspectorate Office.

748
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,540
This matter is

749
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,620
too sudden.

750
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,100
Indeed,

751
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,500
it is very risky.

752
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,020
I have to return to prepare
for tomorrow's court assembly.

753
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,020
Rong, get some rest.

754
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,020
I will take my leave now.

755
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,580
Chuan.

756
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,140
Why are you suddenly asking me

757
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,660
to establish this office?

758
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,580
I know Father.

759
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,860
I know what he wants.

760
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,540
I've been striving

761
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,180
to become the Crown Prince

762
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,740
you and Mother see in your hearts.

763
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,420
But I find I can't do it.

764
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,940
I can't protect anyone.

765
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,660
It used to be you.

766
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,740
Now, it's Miss Qin from the Qin Family.

767
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,260
They've pushed me this far.

768
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,900
I can't bear it.

769
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,140
Qin Lin went to the front line
at the invitation of the court.

770
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,380
Miss Qin also has feelings for me.

771
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,460
I owe the entire Qin Family.

772
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:48,980
This revenge,

773
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,980
I must repay myself.

774
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,660
You've returned.

775
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,620
They did meet

776
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,620
again.

777
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,780
Their feelings for each other
are developed deeply

778
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,900
and earlier than we know.

779
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:24,780
Your Highness.

780
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,580
Why did you come out?

781
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,980
I'm willing to go through all obstacles
for Your Highness.

782
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,300
I beg Your Highness

783
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,020
to establish the Inspectorate Office.

784
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,940
You just heard what Chuan said.

785
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,500
You said you'd go through all obstacles.

786
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,660
What can you do for me?

787
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,620
If Your Highness is willing,

788
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,660
Miss Qin Zhenzhen can disappear
from this world.

789
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,020
Qin Zhenzhen,

790
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,420
I won't make such a decision

791
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,260
for you alone.

792
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,580
Your Highness, you saved my life.

793
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,100
You can ignore this favor.

794
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,980
But I cannot.

795
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,860
I'm willing to be Your Highness
and the Crown Prince's sword.

796
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,220
Wherever you point,

797
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,100
that's where I will unsheathe my sword.

798
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,780
Get up first.

799
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:32,780
I will think

800
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,500
about this matter again.

801
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,540
You should go and get more rest.

802
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,300
Your Highness.

803
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,140
Miss Qin,

804
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,020
don't worry.

805
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,580
The Crown Prince and Her Highness
will definitely clear

806
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,900
the Qin Family's grievances.

807
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:57,900
What are you talking about?

808
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,460
I was comforting Miss Qin
on your behalf.

809
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,140
All right.
Let's talk about the matter at hand.

810
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,180
Why did you mention
the Inspectorate Office to Chuan?

811
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,020
This ghostly organization caused him

812
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,660
so much trouble later on.

813
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,580
His deposition back then

814
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,860
was due to many cases uncovered
by the Inspectorate Office.

815
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,780
Why did you bring it up?

816
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,380
It's precisely because I know this
that I brought it up.

817
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,100
Instead
of letting His Majesty establish it

818
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,180
and then having us accept it passively,

819
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,260
why not take the initiative?

820
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,940
I'm giving Your Highness a chance
to choose.

821
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,900
Is this really giving me a choice?

822
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,220
If you already said that,
do I still have a choice?

823
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,100
Of course you do.

824
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,380
You can give up power
and not set up the Inspectorate Office.

825
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,100
You can even ignore the Crown Prince.

826
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,980
This way, you'll still be my wife

827
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,380
and Princess Pingyue.

828
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:49,900
I find you're not losing out
on any side.

829
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,300
You're planning everything perfectly.

830
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,940
Your Highness, you're flattering me.

831
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,300
But speaking of which,

832
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,980
if we have power,

833
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,580
we can protect people like
the Qin Family

834
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,860
who are devoted to their country
and have clean hands.

835
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,540
We can also protect the Crown Prince.

836
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,580
But

837
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,140
the Inspectorate Office reports
to His Majesty directly.

838
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,540
Once established, it will offend
the Chancellors and the Six Ministries.

839
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,020
Today is the Qin Family,

840
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,300
tomorrow it could be Your Highness.

841
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,420
Your Highness,

842
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,540
you need to think carefully about this.

843
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,660
Your Highness.

844
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,300
Your Highness...

845
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,580
What did you say

846
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,020
about me having nothing again?

847
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,620
I am still going to be your wife?

848
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,260
Did I say that?

849
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,540
You will know when the time comes.

850
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,500
The cost is too high.

851
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,780
I think it's better to feign ignorance.

852
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,300
Are you going to the morning court soon?

853
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,260
Go and change your clothes.

854
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,100
I...

855
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,660
I need to think again.

856
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,260
Your Highness.

857
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,740
As your husband,

858
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,860
no one can touch you

859
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,260
unless

860
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,580
someone steps over my dead body.

861
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,460
As your ally,

862
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,260
I'll stand in front of you

863
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,940
even if you're cut to pieces.

864
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,660
So

865
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:30,100
whether we are husband and wife
or allies,

866
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,740
our fates have long been tied together.

867
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,940
Just choose a path you like.

868
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,900
Whether we are husband and wife
or allies,

869
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,420
our fates have long been tied together.

870
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,620
Just choose a path you like.

871
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,940
Are Pei Wenxuan and I

872
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,540
just using each other?

873
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,620
A person

874
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,900
doesn't change overnight.

875
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,260
You should know this.

876
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,780
Those thoughts and those words

877
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,980
only represent his past.

878
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,500
We can never return

879
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,500
to certain moments.

880
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,660
That may be true.

881
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,060
But he was so sincere back then.

882
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,940
What if he really fell in love with me?

883
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,420
It's not about whether he fell for you.

884
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,860
What matters is

885
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,900
if you want to live through it again?

886
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,580
And

887
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,060
have you truly let go of Su Rongqing?

888
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,300
After nearly twenty years together.

889
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,860
I've thought about this too.

890
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,500
But now

891
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,580
I find Su Rongqing

892
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,100
a person I feel sorry for.

893
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,060
Now, I've returned.

894
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,740
I'm glad

895
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,580
to see him safe.

896
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,380
I

897
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:31,580
don't feel uncomfortable
or troubled by him.

898
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,140
But my relationship with Pei Wenxuan

899
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,780
overlaps memories from two lifetimes.

900
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,380
I suddenly do not know

901
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,180
how to interact with him.

902
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,140
When entangled in emotions
within the palace walls,

903
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:08,660
the only one who gets hurt is you.

904
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,060
Not crossing the line is

905
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,300
the best protection for yourself.

906
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:19,940
Yes.

907
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,260
But without power,

908
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,020
how can you protect yourself

909
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,420
and those around you?

910
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,140
Keep those thoughts to yourself.

911
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,740
Just maintain a cooperative relationship

912
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,140
and fight side by side.

913
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:40,660
Right now,

914
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,140
standing firm in court is
most important.

915
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:48,660
Don't let others find any weaknesses
to use against you.

916
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:55,580
It's better for both him and you.
