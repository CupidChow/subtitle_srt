[Adapted from Mo Shu Bai's novel,
The Princess Royal on jjwxc.net]

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,020
[This is a work of fiction.]

4
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 35]

5
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,460
So

6
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,540
I've specially brought

7
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,060
this person here.

8
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,420
Who is he?

9
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,260
You found us

10
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,940
a substitute?

11
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:31,940
That's right.

12
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,460
One year ago,

13
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,300
I had some drinks with Su Rongqing

14
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,660
and he inadvertently reminded me

15
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,460
that His Majesty had two sons

16
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,140
and we were banking on Cheng.

17
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,060
If anything were to happen to Cheng,

18
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,540
what would we do?

19
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,260
It just so happened
that Su Rongqing had a servant

20
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,020
who resembled Cheng very much.

21
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,660
So, I asked for the servant

22
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,780
and taught him about etiquette
and how he should speak and act.

23
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,140
Even his voice

24
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,220
and the scars on his body
are the same as Cheng's.

25
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,420
I have everything prepared.

26
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,060
When Cheng was injured that day,
I came to visit him.

27
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,580
I observed his wounds and fabricated
the same ones on this boy.

28
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,180
Rou, if Cheng...

29
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,140
I understand.

30
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,180
Keep him here.

31
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,860
I will use him

32
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,540
when I have to.

33
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,340
Rou, if we use this substitute,

34
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,260
we will be bound together
with Su Rongqing.

35
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,340
It will be a gamble we have to take.

36
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,780
Su Rongqing has always
been supporting Cheng wholeheartedly.

37
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,500
Whatever he wants from us,

38
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,740
just give him.

39
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,940
Right now, as long as Cheng
can ascend the throne

40
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,780
and you can become
the Empress Dowager,

41
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,900
nothing else can be more important.

42
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,300
I understand.

43
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:42,820
Rou.

44
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,340
I also want you to be frank with me.

45
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,580
Do you need me

46
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,140
to deal with Cheng?

47
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,700
Deal with him?

48
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,780
How?

49
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,420
I will find a desolate place

50
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,620
and burn his body.

51
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,060
If you want,

52
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,820
I can bring his ashes back.

53
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,940
Burn him?

54
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,420
He is Prince Su, a royal prince!

55
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,300
You're going to...

56
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,460
That boy lying there is not Cheng!

57
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,580
This...

58
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,420
This one is my son.

59
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,740
Mother...

60
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,780
Mother, I'm begging you.

61
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,740
Cheng is over there.

62
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,020
Cheng is over there, Mother.

63
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,580
Even if you have to bury him
somewhere desolate,

64
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,580
at least keep his body intact.

65
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,860
Mother.

66
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,580
- Huayue!
- Mother!

67
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,740
Don't you understand?

68
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,180
He's dead!

69
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,420
If we keep his body intact,

70
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,980
we may suffer a backlash
from it someday.

71
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,580
If anyone digs his body out and asks

72
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,580
who he is,

73
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,900
how are you going to answer?

74
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,460
Mother, I'm begging you.

75
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,460
That one lying there is our Cheng.

76
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,980
Cheng.

77
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,980
My poor brother.

78
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,180
Mother!

79
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:57,980
Huayue!

80
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:05,980
Su.

81
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,740
Hurry up.

82
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,940
Mr. Su, run.

83
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,060
We're here to protect you.

84
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,340
Who sent you here?

85
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,500
Princess Pingyue.

86
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,140
Run!

87
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,020
Are you going back
to the Ministry of Personnel later?

88
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,580
No.

89
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,620
But, I will be going out soon

90
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,700
to deal with other things.

91
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,740
Just stay at home and recuperate.

92
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,220
Your leg hasn't fully healed yet.

93
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,260
Don't go out and start any trouble.

94
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,900
What do you mean by,

95
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,420
"Don't go out and start any trouble?"

96
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,300
I have nothing to do out there.

97
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,220
Why should I go out?

98
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,420
Very well, then I need to go now.

99
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,900
Take care of Her Highness.

100
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:35,700
Yes.

101
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,780
Your Highness, we just received news

102
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,020
that as soon as Mr. Su showed up,

103
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,220
he was chased by the Prince Consort's
men and fled into the woods.

104
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,020
They're still searching for him.

105
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,580
Our men are asking

106
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,420
if we should fight
the Prince Consort's men directly.

107
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,500
Your Highness, are you sure

108
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,660
you don't want
to tell the Prince Consort about this?

109
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,740
I...

110
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:16,940
I...

111
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,820
I don't know how I should tell him.

112
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,060
Prepare the carriage. I'm going out.

113
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,620
Your leg is still injured.

114
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,820
That's what the carriage is for.

115
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,340
Go.

116
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,180
Yes, Your Highness.

117
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,940
Actually, Su Rongqing was right.

118
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,620
Given Li Chuan's temperament,

119
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,700
no matter how many times we travel back,

120
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,340
as long as he becomes the Emperor,

121
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,900
we are bound to come into conflict

122
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,220
and fight each other till death.

123
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,500
Why should I put my life
on the line for him?

124
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,060
The last time it happened,

125
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,660
I was foolish enough
to spend my whole life assisting him.

126
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,420
This time,

127
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,140
other than Pei Wenxuan,

128
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,540
I cannot trust anyone.

129
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,860
Your Highness,
the weather is cold today.

130
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,860
It's not a suitable day to go out.

131
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,140
You should return to your room.

132
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,540
Tell your men

133
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,620
to bring him here.

134
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,140
I want to meet him.

135
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,380
As soon as we detected your men nearby,

136
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,020
I already asked my men to retreat.

137
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,100
The Su Family has also sent
their men to save him.

138
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,660
You don't have to worry

139
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,060
about his safety.

140
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,460
I have something to tell him.

141
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,500
Jinglan, take Her Highness
back to her room.

142
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,700
What do you mean?

143
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,980
You won't be meeting Su Rongqing today.

144
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,900
Before the Crown Prince
ascends the throne,

145
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,220
you won't be meeting Su Rongqing.

146
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,260
The Crown Prince ascends the throne?

147
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,260
Fine.

148
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,380
I'll go back to my room.

149
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,860
You must have a lot of questions for me.

150
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,780
I'm going back now.

151
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,140
What do you want?

152
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,460
I should be the one asking

153
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,980
what you exactly want.

154
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,380
I know you're Li Chuan's friend.

155
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,620
You've always been his supporter.

156
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,180
So, today,

157
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,700
let's make everything clear.

158
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,460
I'm not going to help him anymore.

159
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,180
Li Chuan...

160
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,140
He's a capable person.

161
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,380
He has his own mind.

162
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,900
If he ascends the throne,

163
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,060
many unimaginable things may happen,

164
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,620
so I won't help him anymore.

165
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:28,980
Your Highness.

166
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,180
Was all this

167
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,980
told by Su Rongqing?

168
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,780
Right now,

169
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,820
instead of placing my bets on Li Chuan,

170
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,460
I'd rather bet on Li Cheng.

171
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,500
Li Cheng has to rely on someone else,

172
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,940
but Li Chuan doesn't.

173
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,860
As long as he gives up on me

174
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,300
and the Shangguan Family,

175
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,460
he will gain Father
and the commoners' trust

176
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,980
and then ascend the throne.

177
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,860
So, both he and I
have choices to make now.

178
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,940
He needs to choose
whether he should give up on me

179
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,300
and I need to choose
whether I should give up on him.

180
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,420
But, Your Highness,

181
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,540
you're choosing to give up on him

182
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,820
even before he makes his choice.

183
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,460
Can't I?

184
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,100
Are you blaming me as well?

185
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,780
Do you also feel that I shouldn't...

186
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,380
I shouldn't pursue the life I want

187
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,700
and that I should risk my life,

189
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,060
and have my corpse smashed into pieces

190
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,180
without asking anything in return?

191
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,740
But why?

192
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,260
I married you, a commoner,

193
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,660
just to protect him back then.

194
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,740
I spent 20 years doing everything
I could for him.

195
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,940
I devoted my whole life to him.

196
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,020
But what did I get?

197
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,620
This time, all I want
is to live for myself.

198
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,460
Can't I?

199
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,780
Your Highness.

200
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,500
Do you think that marrying me
was a humiliation to you?

201
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,700
Or, do you think

202
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,780
that it was not worth
devoting your whole life?

203
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,220
Yes.

204
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,740
But not because of you.

205
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,420
It's because of them.

206
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,060
Your Highness.

207
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,820
How has the Crown Prince

208
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,060
let you down?

209
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,780
Is it just because he can't
give you power now?

210
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,340
Or is it because in his past life,

211
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,500
he massacred Su Rongqing's whole family?

212
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,220
He didn't just massacre
Su Rongqing's whole family.

213
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,540
Who else did he kill?

214
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,420
Me.

215
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,660
His own sister,

216
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,260
the Regent Princess Royal, Li Rong.

217
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,100
Happy now?

218
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,340
I failed to recognize his true color.

219
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,460
I brought doom upon myself
and led myself to be utterly isolated.

220
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,620
Everyone I devoted myself to
betrayed me.

221
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,300
Everyone who I loved hated me.

222
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,900
My life was a joke.

223
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,220
Li Chuan...

224
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,620
He was worried that I would
harm him and his successor,

225
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,700
so he applied poison
to the weiqi pieces he played with me.

226
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,580
Shangguan Ya

227
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,260
had an illegitimate son with Su Ronghua

228
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,340
and they were scared I would find out,

229
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,700
so they colluded with Su Rongqing

230
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,940
to make sure I wouldn't
find out I was poisoned.

231
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:08,860
Su Rongqing...

232
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,060
He allowed everything to happen.

233
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,100
He stood by
and watched me die in front of him.

234
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,140
No one believed

235
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,540
that a princess royal
cared about relationships.

236
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,620
No one believed
that I would spare their lives,

237
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,780
so all of them ganged up...

238
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,740
and killed me.

239
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,460
Pei Wenxuan.

240
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,820
I thought you were the only person

241
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,500

00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,260
I'm thinking

371
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:20,060
whether the Empress is right.

372
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,340
Is there really someone who only
cares about power but cares for no one?

373
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,380
I can try.

374
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,820
Then, let me tell you

375
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,180
what I know.

376
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,500
Perhaps you may think differently, then.

377
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,980
You may leave now.

378
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,300
Ronghua, please have a seat.

379
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,100
Feeling better?

380
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,660
Much better.

381
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,420
I have some questions for you.

382
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,700
As for this attempted assassination
of the Crown Prince,

383
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,620
was it you allied
with Huayue and Consort Rou

384
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,380
and planned this?

385
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,220
Yes.

386
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,260
Since when did you ally
with Consort Rou?

387
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,620
When Princess Pingyue
founded the Inspectorate Office.

388
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,980
That's why I assigned you
a position there.

389
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,020
Do you still remember...

390
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,300
the instructions from our ancestors?

391
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,620
Yes.

392
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,860
What's the first instruction?

393
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,940
Anyone from the Su Family
must not participate

394
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,980
in the imperial family's
fight for the throne.

395
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,820
You colluded with Consort Rou.

396
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,740
Do you need me to tell you

397
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,580
what you have to do?

398
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,980
I will tell Father about this.

399
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,940
Just wait for the results.

400
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,340
Ronghua.

401
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,700
Don't you want to know why I did so?

402
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,020
What Consort Rou did
has become something

403
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,580
that can be no longer resolved
by our family.

404
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,180
Regardless of your reason,

405
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,780
our family is now involved in this.

406
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,820
I managed to protect you
in Hongde's case,

407
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,060
but how am I supposed to help you now?

408
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,660
But I have my reasons.

409
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,460
So does every other sinner in the world.

410
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,580
Get some rest.

411
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:14,980
Ronghua.

412
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,180
Let me tell you a story.

413
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,580
I had a dream

414
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,340
about our family's future.

415
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,940
You were in it too.

416
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,300
Don't you want to listen to it?

417
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,020
Ronghua.

418
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,860
Please listen to my story

419
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,220
before you make a decision.

420
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,700
You seem to know
many things that I don't.

421
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,340
You probably have a rough idea of it.

422
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,700
But, you should know

423
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,580
that knowing just the rough idea
and knowing the exact details

424
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,780
are two different things.

425
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:18,940
Tell me, then.

426
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,140
I spent five years
investigating Su Ronghua

427
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,780
before I learned about his past
with Shangguan Ya.

428
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,900
One day, you told me

429
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,860
that you met a girl.

430
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,620
She dressed up like a man
to gamble in the gambling den.

431
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,500
She played ten rounds with you

432
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,460
and asked to gamble again someday,

433
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,540
but she lost again.

434
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,740
That day,

435
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,940
you smiled happily

436
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,460
and said she was interesting.

437
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,260
Then, you often mentioned her to me

438
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,620
and said that she refused
to talk to you,

439
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,380
but you still tried to tease her.

440
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,340
To avoid you,

441
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,100
she switched
to one gambling den after another,

442
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,140
but you would pursue her nonetheless.

443
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,180
What a nuisance.

444
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,100
Don't go.

445
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,900
One day, on your way home...

446
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,260
Beat him up!

447
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,740
You can have all my money!
Stop beating me!

448
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,300
Feeling offended,

449
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,100
you hatched a plan to retaliate.

450
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,420
While she was on her way
to bet on a cock fight...

451
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,020
Who are you?

452
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,820
What do you want?

453
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,980
We're bandits. What else would we want?

454
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,140
Listen,

455
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,740
I'm Shangguan Ya, the young lady
of the Shangguan Family.

456
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,340
Release me now.

457
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,460
I can give you

458
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,780
as much money as you want.

459
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:34,700
We...

460
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,860
We don't want money.

461
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,780
We only want you.

462
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,860
You jerks.

463
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,780
Stop it right there.

464
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,260
A few thugs like you

465
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,620
won't be hard to get rid of...

466
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,420
I guess.

467
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,060
Su Ronghua?

468
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,420
It's you?

469
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,300
Yes.

470
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,900
Untie me now!

471
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,580
I know I shouldn't have
got you beaten up,

472
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,300
but must you do this to me?

473
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,380
It's not like I'd kill you. Run now.

474
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,500
Leave them to me.

475
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:27,860
Stop!

476
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,220
Stop fighting!

477
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,180
Stop it!

478
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:30,820
Stop!

479
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,820
Everyone.

480
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,500
You're robbing him for money.

481
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,820
We are from the Su Family in Huajing.

482
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,220
If you hurt us,

483
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,140
even if you take our money,

484
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,020
the Su Family

485
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,980
will go all out to eliminate you.

486
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,060
You can

487
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,420
take the money,

488
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,380
but as for my man,

489
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,220
give him back to me.

490
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,700
One day,

491
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,140
you came back home and told me seriously

492
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,540
that you were in love with her

493
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,380
and you had decided

494
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,940
to marry her.

495
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,620
But, you knew

496
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,620
that our family enjoyed
a high social status.

497
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,580
If you were to propose to her,

498
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,740
that girl would be forced to say yes,
whether she liked it or not.

499
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:09,940
Later,

500
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,460
you decided to ask her personally.

501
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,420
That day,

502
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,300
I chose a nice set of clothes for you

503
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,980
and you forged
a nice jade hairpin yourself.

504
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,060
Then, you happily took it to go to her.

505
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,740
Ronghua, you...

506
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:25,980
I'm fine.

507
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,620
From that day onward,

508
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,980
you never left the mansion

509
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,980
until the palace held a banquet.

510
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,500
As Prince Su's tutor,

511
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,020
you were forced to attend it.

512
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,860
During the banquet...

513
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,420
Su Ronghua saw Shangguan Ya.

514
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,020
A palace banquet?

515
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,220
How could you refuse
to marry Shangguan Ya?

516
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:05,820
Chuan.

517
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,740
You are the Crown Prince.

518
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,460
You cannot afford to be willful.

519
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,340
I am already stuck in the palace.

520
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,740
Why would I want to drag
someone innocent down?

521
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,540
Your Highness, why don't you
want to get married?

522
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,220
I can tell

523
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,460
that Ya doesn't like me

524
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,340
nor life in the palace.

525
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,060
I'm already miserable enough
living in the palace.

526
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,820
Why make her join me?

527
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,100
Everyone says

528
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,260
I'm the Crown Prince,

529
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,820
a noble existence.

530
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,460
But, I have no control over anything.

531
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,940
I don't get to choose anything.

532
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,260
To be frank,

533
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,460
I can't feel

534
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,580
the noble perks
of being the Crown Prince.

535
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,700
Right now...

536
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,460
I just want to escape from this.

537
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,300
That was just him being childish.

538
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,740
Shangguan Ya was
much more mature than him.

539
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,300
Yes.

540
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,420
During the palace banquet,

541
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,980
Shangguan Ya and Su Ronghua

542
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,580
didn't exchange a single word.

543
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,900
But, it was exactly this banquet

544
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,060
that made Su Ronghua realize

545
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,260
why Shangguan Ya rejected him.

546
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,500
Naturally, he wouldn't simply give up.

547
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,540
When you have a goal in mind,

548
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,780
you'd want to try anyway.

549
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,460
Father, I want to marry Shangguan Ya.

550
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,740
Do you have a death wish?

551
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,620
Everyone knows

552
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,020
that Shangguan Ya will be
the future Crown Princess.

553
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,980
You're going to marry
the future Crown Princess?

554
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,740
How could we accept this?

555
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,980
If this family cannot accept this,

556
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,620
I ask to be expelled from this family

557
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,940
and propose to her.

558
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,060
Whether I live or die,

559
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,140
I will bear the consequences.

560
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:55,700
You...

561
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,620
Ronghua.

562
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,420
Rongqing, don't persuade me.

563
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,540
I shall have no regrets about it.

564
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,860
Today, my son Su Ronghua,
who's been harboring atrocious thoughts,

565
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,020
has requested
to be expelled from our family.

566
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:13,060
According to our family rules,
he shall be flogged

567
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,180
and expelled from the Su Family.

568
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,020
So,

569
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,260
do you accept this punishment?

570
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,500
Even if I die, I will never regret it.

571
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,140
Ronghua.

572
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,300
Don't you care about us anymore?

573
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,540
I hope you can support my decision.

574
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,420
Flog him.

575
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,460
Well...

576
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,180
That's what I was planning to do lately.

577
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,620
What happened after that?

578
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,580
Su Ronghua.

579
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,660
Love is just nothing.

580
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,260
So is fancying someone.

581
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,140
Since we're alive...

582
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,540
we have our responsibilities to fulfill.

583
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,580
I will enter the palace.

584
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,100
And I will become the Crown Princess.

585
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,260
I will also be the future Empress.

586
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,500
You won't like

587
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,460
the way I'll be in the future.

588
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,740
Just take it
as if you've never met me before.

589
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,900
Leave Huajing.

590
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,460
Go as far as you can.

591
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,980
Visit as many places as you can.

592
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,180
Travel and see the world

593
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,460
for me, will you?

594
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,940
Whatever makes you happy,

595
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,380
please do it for me.

596
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,820
If there comes a day...

597
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,700
when you meet someone you fancy...

598
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,740
and you marry her,

599
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,700
that will be the best.

600
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,340
Su Ronghua.

601
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,980
Let me go.

602
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,220
Let yourself go.

603
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,900
Su Ronghua.

604
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,100
Stop forcing me.

605
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,940
You couldn't bear to force her.

606
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,500
Why do I feel like

607
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,500
you can foresee the future?

608
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,500
What you described in the story

609
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,580
matches my upcoming plans.

610
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,100
But...

611
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,260
But, is that truly the outcome?

612
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,820
That was why you returned home.

613
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,820
When Father saw you,

614
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,980
he gave in eventually

615
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,900
and he forgave you.

616
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,620
Our family and her family
covered up this incident.

617
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,300
Shangguan Ya entered the palace

618
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,260
and became the Crown Princess.

619
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,740
As for you, you left Huajing

620
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,660
and visited many places.

621
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,180
And then?

622
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,020
Then, as you had expected,

623
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,180
since Li Chuan married someone
from the Shangguan Family,

624
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,620
it triggered His Majesty's
deepest fears.

625
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,060
His Majesty wanted
to make Prince Su his successor instead

626
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,500
and deposed the Crown Prince.

627
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,940
After it happened,

628
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,780
Pei Wenxuan persuaded the noble families

629
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,140
to deploy their armies

630
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,700
and help Li Chuan regain his position.

631
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,620
The noble families must have hesitated.

632
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,060
By doing so,

633
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,140
they would be declaring war
against His Majesty.

634
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,180
Actually, while the noble families

635
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,780
were still hesitating,

636
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,460
the first person to agree to the plan...

637
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,140
was you.

638
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:49,380
If we send our armies,
there will be no turning back.

639
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,700
That would mean we're siding
with the Crown Prince.

640
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,780
Our family would be in great danger.

641
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,940
Rongqing, do something.

642
00:38:59,180 --> 00:38:59,860
Father.

643
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,100
I believe

644
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,580
we can deploy our troops.

645
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:06,900
Why?

646
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,140
This time, it's the Crown Prince.

647
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,620
Next time, they'll target
the noble families.

648
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,780
Once Li Cheng ascends the throne,

649
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,020
he will not let the noble families go.

650
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,220
But, I knew that
whatever your reasons were,

651
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,660
they could never conceal your intentions

652
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,180
that shouldn't have existed
in the first place.

653
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,140
You were actually worried
about Shangguan Ya.

654
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,620
I wouldn't gamble our family's future

655
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,780
for my personal feelings.

656
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,980
You weren't gambling.

657
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,740
It just so happened

658
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,460
that it was a suitable decision.

659
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,860
You made the right choice.

660
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,940
Back then, it was actually obvious

661
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,620
that our family should support Li Chuan.

662
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,340
Li Chuan was known to be virtuous

663
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,980
and he was a trueborn royal prince,

664
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:56,780
making him the most legitimate successor
to the throne.

665
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,780
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

666
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:02,300
- Long live Your Majesty!
- Long live Your Majesty!

667
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,860
You may rise.

668
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,140
After Li Chuan ascended the throne,

669
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,620
Shangguan Ya became the Empress.

670
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,300
It was the first year of Dexu Era.

671
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,020
When Li Chuan just ascended the throne,

672
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,860
war broke out in the North.

673
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,740
The entire imperial court
wanted to negotiate for peace,

674
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:18,100
save for Pei Wenxuan, Qin Lin,
and Li Chuan, who wanted to fight.

675
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,700
In order to help Qin Lin
establish a troop,

676
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,860
Li Chuan and Pei Wenxuan did
all they could

677
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:28,500
to gather resources
and money from everyone.

678
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,500
You worms!

679
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,580
You've never paid
any taxes for your fiefs

680
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,940
and you have all sorts of privileges
that you refuse to give up!

681
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,940
Here in the palace, you try
to take advantage whenever possible.

682
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,040
At the borders,

683
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,540
you steal the military provisions
and funds for your own gain!

684
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:44,180
When the money comes into your mansion,

685
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,380
you are just secretly pleased!

686
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,100
Now, I need to wage war

687
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,380
against our enemies in the North.

688
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,220
Just when I need all of you

689
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,860
to contribute in any way,

690
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,420
you retract your heads
like a bunch of tortoises

691
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,300
and refuse to react positively!

692
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,380
Don't you think

693
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,140
you fail our people?

694
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,260
Don't you?

695
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,300
Starting a war at this stage
sounds like a bad idea.

696
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,260
After the war began,

697
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,420
they realized they were wrong.

698
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,340
They knew all about strategies

699
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,540
but had zero battlefield experience.

700
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,220
The funds they gathered

701
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,540
weren't enough to sustain
our troops in the North.

702
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,060
So, they had to retreat.

703
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,900
Then came the plague in the South.

704
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,340
The national treasury was out of money.

705
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,500
I tried to think of solutions.

706
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,300
Li Chuan and I traveled south
to relieve the people in disaster.

707
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,220
But when we reached there, we realized

708
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,660
that the noble families had been
hoarding food to sell at high prices.

709
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,940
The disaster relief funds
couldn't reach the people.

710
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,180
Your Highness.

711
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,860
You had never seen
the country beyond Huajing.

712
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:52,420
On the battlefield, dead bodies
were strewn everywhere.

713
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,940
In the plague-ridden lands,
there was nothing but pure misery.

714
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,500
Only in Huajing could you see
people indulging in debauchery.

715
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:01,500
It was like heaven and hell.

716
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,100
However, back then,

717
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,540
we were childish and reckless.

718
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,340
After we returned,

719
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,380
we started drafting policies

720
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,060
to aid the disaster relief efforts
in the South.

721
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,540
It was then that Li Chuan
made his mind up.

722
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,140
What did he plan to do?

723
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,500
A radical reform of the system.

724
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,180
The imperial examination

725
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,900
would become
the only channel to select officials.

726
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,420
Taxes were imposed on noble families.

727
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,140
A limit was set on the number
of lands and servants they could own.

728
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,380
A merit system was also introduced.

729
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,900
When the Ministry of Personnel
wanted to promote any official,

730
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,740
it was done based on their merit scores.

731
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:40,980
As for the grading process,

732
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,860
ten marks would be deducted
if the one was from the noble families

733
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,780
and ten marks would be awarded
if the one was a commoner.

734
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:58,670
♪Who gazes at the sky from afar?♪

735
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:02,140
♪Who gazes at the sky from afar?♪

736
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:05,540
