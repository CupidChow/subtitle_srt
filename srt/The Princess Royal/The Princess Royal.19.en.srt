[Episode 19]

5
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,620
Just put the things over there later.

6
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,500
Tong.

7
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:45,700
Jinglan.

8
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,020
Have you noticed something?

9
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,820
Since the Prince Consort came back,

10
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,100
his relationship with Her Highness

11
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,020
has got much closer.

12
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,620
Of course.

13
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,740
You've noticed it too?

14
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,740
You bet.

15
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,180
Guess what, last night...

16
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,540
Ms. Xun Chuan.

17
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,220
Tong Ye, Jinglan,

18
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,380
I want to thank Her Highness in person.

19
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,380
Have you seen her?

20
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,180
Why are they so audacious?

21
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,420
It's because they know
you will protect them.

22
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,700
That's why they dare
to falsely accuse loyal ministers

23
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,900
and embezzle
military provisions and funds.

24
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,220
If I don't protect them,

25
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,300
Your Highness,
what worth do you think I have?

26
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,780
His Majesty has entrusted
the Inspectorate Office to you.

27
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,220
What do you think is backing you up?

28
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,260
You and I are nothing.

29
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,500
Whether it's you or me,

30
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,500
we are just nonentities

31
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,780
under the power struggles
of the noble families.

32
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,380
Ms. Xun Chuan.

33
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,820
Should I go and inform you

34
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,300
once the guests have left?

35
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,620
No need.

36
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,020
Thank you, Tong Ye.

37
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,860
You are welcome.

38
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,060
I'll take my leave now.

39
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,140
Take care.

40
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,580
You are a Grand Chancellor of the nation

41
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,260
and I am the Princess Royal.

42
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,900
Both of us have the ability
to change these rules.

43
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,180
It's just you are unwilling to do that.

44
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,060
You are determined
to maintain the current situation,

45
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,500
unwilling to upset this balance.

46
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,850
It's because you want
to continue playing political games

47
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,220
against His Majesty.

48
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,180
But then what?

49
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,620
Are you happy to watch

50
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,700
the Shangguan Family decay
day after day without taking action?

51
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,060
Since the founding of the Great Xia,

52
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,420
being ruled by four emperors,

53
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,700
the nation has been established
for nearly a century.

54
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,860
The Northwest has been plagued
by warfare and disturbances.

55
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,460
There have also been natural disasters
from time to time within the nation.

56
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,700
It's no longer a nascent dynasty

57
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,620
that can take such turmoil
caused by you.

58
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,580
I've never intended
for the Shangguan Family

59
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,500
and myself to be against each other.

60
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,820
What I want is simple.

61
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,060
I want the Shangguan Family
to be clean and innocent.

62
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,500
I want the Shangguan Family's master not
to be the puppet of the noble families.

63
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,660
I want a Shangguan Family
that won't hold Chuan back in the future

64
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,700
and won't overstep its bounds.

65
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,740
That's all I want.

66
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,540
Do you understand?

67
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,260
I understand what you're saying,
Your Highness.

68
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,740
But it's simply beyond my ability.

69
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,940
If you can't do it...

70
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:22,900
what about others?

71
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,060
What about Shangguan Ya?

72
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,580
If the Shangguan Family

73
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,500
were entirely under your control,

74
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,780
could you manage it?

75
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,420
Rest assured, Your Highness,
there's no need

76
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,140
for the Inspectorate Office
to intervene in our family's matters.

77
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,140
When we go back today,

78
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,700
the entire Shangguan Family will conduct

79
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,420
a thorough self-inspection
from Huajing to Youzhou.

80
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,700
If the self-inspection goes smoothly,

81
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,460
the Crown Prince
will have no future troubles.

82
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,580
If it does not...

83
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,180
Father, you can punish me

84
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,060
to give an explanation to our clansmen.

85
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,180
You are still
the master of the Shangguan Family.

86
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,180
Father, what do you think?

87
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,420
As expected of members
of the Shangguan Family,

88
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,860
you are born with a desire

89
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,780
to gain power.

90
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,460
The future belongs to you young people.

91
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,580
I am indeed old.

92
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,580
I'm old.

93
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,980
Truly old.

94
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,510
[Inspectorate Office]
In response to the will

95
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,820
of Heaven and time
and blessed by His Majesty's grace,

96
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,100
we gather here today

97
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,900
to establish the Inspectorate Office,

98
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,860
abide by the principles
and discipline of the state,

99
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,740
and uphold the laws and regulations.

100
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,420
The foundation of our office

101
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,700
lies in the principles
of fairness and justice.

102
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,180
- Yes.
- Yes.

103
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,900
No matter what kind of family
are you from,

104
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,860
those who are capable

105
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,260
shall occupy positions
in the Inspectorate Office.

106
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,460
Do you not feel oppressed?

107
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,300
Oppressed?

108
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,420
What do you mean by that?

109
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,180
With such a dominant wife,

110
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,340
do you not feel
that you're under immense pressure?

111
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,940
I've heard people say

112
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,260
that men all fear such women.

113
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,540
They prefer someone
who's gentle and soft,

114
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,470
ideally serving as a good wife

115
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,900
who stays at home
and handles all the family affairs.

116
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,260
But now, Her Highness appears

117
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,580
to require you to play that role.

118
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,300
What's wrong with being the one

119
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,260
who stays at home
and handles all the family affairs?

120
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,300
Are you not worried
about being called spineless

121
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,220
or incapable?

122
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,940
Only the incompetent ones

123
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,380
need to use their wive's weaknesses

124
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,940
to prove themselves.

125
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,140
What I desire

126
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,780
is for my wife
to achieve her aspirations.

127
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,780
From this day forth,

128
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,660
the Inspectorate Office is established

129
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,150
[Inspectorate]
to guard the Great Xia

130
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,140
and protect its people.

131
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,420
If she desires the world,

132
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,380
I can give it to her.

133
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,580
If she wants to live a tranquil life,

134
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,780
I can provide that with her too.

135
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,160
- Guard the Great Xia
- Guard the Great Xia

136
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,900
- and protect its people.
- and protect its people.

137
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,420
Moreover, as her husband,

138
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,020
my love for my wife

139
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,100
is not about confining her
in a gilded cage

140
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,980
but being able
to offer her opportunities

141
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,980
to do whatever she desires
without restraint.

142
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,740
Your words sound quite eloquent.

143
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,140
But aren't you two friends?

144
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,340
It seems you still need
to make more effort

145
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,660
to take your relationship
to the next level.

146
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,780
That's not necessarily true.

147
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,180
Xun Chuan.

148
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,660
Yes, Your Highness.

149
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,300
From now on,

150
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,700
I appoint you as the Inspector General
of the Inspectorate Office,

151
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,870
tasked with making inspection tours
to the local governments

152
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,620
on behalf of our office.

153
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,580
Yes, Your Highness.

154
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,940
And if you don't mind,

155
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,500
we can invite you

156
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,820
to attend our wedding banquet again.

157
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,620
It won't take long.

158
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,220
I'll be waiting then.

159
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,340
To tell you the truth,

160
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,000
when I heard they wanted me

161
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,900
to enter the palace
to be the Crown Princess,

162
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,620
I was terrified.

163
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,340
I thought to myself, "Oh no,

164
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,500
my future life will be hopeless."

165
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,340
Look at my aunt.

166
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,460
She's been the Empress her whole life.

167
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,900
That's so pitiful.

168
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,260
Even though she's powerful,

169
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,660
it's just meaningless to me.

170
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,420
I'd rather stay
as the Shangguan Family's young lady,

171
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,580
enjoying all the delicacies

172
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,660
and fine liquor.

173
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,620
If I enter the palace,

174
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,980
I won't be able to hike mountains, fish,

175
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,980
or even play polo with my friends.

176
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,980
Tell me,

177
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,820
what's the point
of me entering the palace?

178
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,460
Just to watch people kowtow
in different ways?

179
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,460
Am I right?

180
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,860
That makes sense.

181
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,300
She's drunk.

182
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,780
Are you leaving soon?

183
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,900
I won't specifically come
and bid a formal farewell to you again.

184
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,140
It's just that I don't know

185
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,940
when we'll meet again after you leave.

186
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,340
I will do my best

187
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,180
to serve you well while I'm away.

188
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,540
I'm not worried about that.

189
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,460
Just a reminder though,

190
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,060
don't be too straightforward
when you're out on your own.

191
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,660
Your Highness, rest assured.

192
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,980
I'll proceed cautiously
in any situation.

193
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,500
Actually...

194
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,180
Qin Zhenzhen's death

195
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,180
might not be a bad thing.

196
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,580
I've been quite happy...

197
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,540
following your lead these days.

198
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,860
Here's a toast to you, Your Highness.

199
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,540
Thanks for saving my life.

200
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:47,700
And this second toast
is for recognizing my worth.

201
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,820
Meeting you made me realize...

202
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,420
that the world is vast

203
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,900
and that women
can live a different life.

204
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,180
I understand

205
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,380
that you have a vision for the world.

206
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,420
That's also the world

207
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,540
I desire.

208
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,220
You should drink no more.

209
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,500
This third toast...

210
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,180
please don't laugh at me.

211
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:37,860
It is for my encounter with you and Ya.

212
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,540
I'm here.

213
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,260
Though our time together has been short,

214
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,660
in my heart,

215
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,660
I already consider both of you
as good friends.

216
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,820
As we face the long journey ahead,

217
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,820
I hope we three
can live up to this life.

218
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,220
Live up to this life.

219
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,220
Live up to this life.

220
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:14,860
Cheers.

221
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,180
Cheers.

222
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:43,940
Your Highness.

223
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,380
Did you see them out?

224
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,420
Yes.

225
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,700
You should get up.
It's cold on the floor.

226
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,580
Feel it.

227
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,460
It's warm here now.

228
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,340
Come on. Sit here.

229
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,260
What's on your mind?

230
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,740
Xun Chuan is leaving tonight.

231
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,780
You are not the sentimental type.

232
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,620
Pei Wenxuan.

233
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,740
I have friends now.

234
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,380
I have friends and family.

235
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,420
I'm really happy in this life.

236
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,460
No matter what the future holds,

237
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,020
at least I have what I should have now.

238
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,900
Don't be upset
with what I'm about to say.

239
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,020
I used to think

240
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,220
that Su Rongqing understood me better.

241
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,220
But in this life,

242
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,460
I've realized

243
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,500
that it's not true.

244
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:03,940
Thank you for understanding me.

245
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,100
You will always be

246
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,820
by my side,

247
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,060
right?

248
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,340
Su Ronghua.

249
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,340
Can you walk properly?

250
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,860
Why are you stumbling like that?

251
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,460
Oh my,

252
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,500
how much have you had to drink?

253
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,540
I'm not drunk.

254
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,100
Look, I can walk a straight line.

255
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,740
I'm fine.

256
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,740
Alright, you're not drunk.

257
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,300
You're perfectly sober.

258
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,060
But could you drink a bit less
in the future?

259
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,060
My friend is leaving.

260
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,700
How can I not drink
for such a big thing?

261
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,700
Come on.

262
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:06,020
Su Ronghua,
you should hold on to me like this.

263
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,380
Miss Shangguan,

264
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,580
this isn't appropriate.

265
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,420
Are you afraid?

266
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,580
When have I ever been afraid?

267
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,420
You're afraid, aren't you?

268
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,780
Let me tell you.

269
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,780
The more afraid you are...

270
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,980
the less likely I'll let you go.

271
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:45,340
I'm going to ruin your reputation

272
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,940
and make everyone...

273
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,220
absolutely everyone, look down on you.

274
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,420
Shangguan Ya,

275
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,380
if you intend to tarnish my reputation,

276
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,660
I do have a way.

277
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,540
If you hold my hand
and walk out with me,

278
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,140
then I will be yours.

279
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,140
And when you abandon me later,

280
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,620
my reputation will definitely be ruined.

281
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,780
That makes sense.

282
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,180
Where's your hand?

283
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,060
Are you taking it seriously?

284
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,180
Your hand.

285
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,380
I'm not drunk.

286
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,260
Su Ronghua.

287
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,380
You really don't know
how to hold someone.

288
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,780
Slowly.

289
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:56,820
Mr. Su,

290
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,220
holding our young lady's hand
like this might not be appropriate.

291
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,580
I...

292
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,460
Qian Ning,

293
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,820
it's okay.

294
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,700
It's all good.

295
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,060
All good.

296
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,900
Qian Ning,
don't mention it to anyone else.

297
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,180
Yes.

298
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,180
Careful.

299
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,740
Su Ronghua.

300
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:27,620
Your reputation
has already been ruined today.

301
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,020
Yes.

302
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,500
From now on,

303
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,500
I'm yours.

304
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,140
Take good care of your young lady.

305
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:44,700
Yes, sir.

306
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:46,940
Let's go.

307
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,260
Rongqing, why are you here?

308
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,920
I was afraid that you'd get drunk,

309
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,820
so I decided to come and pick you up.

310
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,900
I know my limits.

311
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,340
Alright, let's go home.

312
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,980
I'm not drunk.

313
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,100
It's a beautiful full moon tonight.

314
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,140
Indeed.

315
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,850
[Princess's Mansion]

316
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,060
Greetings, General Qin.

317
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,340
Ms. Xun, are you planning to travel far?

318
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,510
I am going to make inspection tours
to the local governments

319
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:40,900
on behalf of Her Highness.

320
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,420
Okay.

321
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,580
Have a safe journey.

322
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,220
General Qin.

323
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,380
You are going back
to the Northwest, right?

324
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,300
Yes.

325
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,740
Then you have a safe journey too.

326
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,220
Please.

327
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,500
Zhenzhen.

328
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,100
I know it's you.

329
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,660
I only want to ask you one question.

330
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,380
Are you happy
with the way things are now?

331
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,620
Lin.

332
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,420
Don't worry.

333
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,380
I'm doing well.

334
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,500
At least,

335
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,620
I won't be a woman
who's going to be trapped in the palace.

336
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,740
I can also secretly protect
the Qin Family.

337
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,100
Zhenzhen.

338
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:05,340
Let me take a look at you
one more time.

339
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,700
Lin.

340
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,100
Remember.

341
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,220
Don't push yourself too hard.

342
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,820
I know.

343
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,380
You too.

344
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,300
Go now.

345
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,580
Someone's still waiting for you
at the back door.

346
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,540
Okay.

347
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,580
Your Highness.

348
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,740
How's your injury?

349
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,380
It's healed.

350
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,460
Thank you for asking.

351
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,660
Are you leaving now?

352
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:26,820
Yes.

353
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,780
If there's nothing else,

354
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,940
I'll take my leave now.

355
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,420
Wait.

356
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,820
I'm sorry.

357
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,380
I couldn't protect you before.

358
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,460
It's alright.

359
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,180
Can you please not leave?

360
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,900
Give me another chance to protect you.

361
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,180
This time,

362
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,980
I... I won't ask you
to enter the palace.

363
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,900
For the rest of our lives,

364
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,980
I want to create opportunities

365
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,740
to roam the world with you.

366
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:40,900
Your Highness.

367
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,060
Some things have already happened

368
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,100
and cannot be changed.

369
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,900
You have your mission.

370
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,700
And I have my responsibilities.

371
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:00,940
We...

372
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,820
Can you really not stay?

373
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,060
Yes.

374
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,780
Take care of yourself
when you are in the Northwest.

375
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,460
Please remember

376
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,700
what I said.

377
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,260
You too.

378
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,340
Keep yourself safe.

379
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,920
[Inspectorate Office]

380
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,580
The evidence is conclusive
in the case of embezzlement

381
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,420
of military provisions
and funds in the Northwest.

382
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,860
Do you plead guilty?

383
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,740
- Yes, we do.
- Yes, we do.

384
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,180
Someone.

385
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,380
Get their fingerprints.

386
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,740
Who would have thought that this case

387
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,260
would involve
over seventy court officials?

388
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,060
Father, you've endured these people
for a long time.

389
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,020
Why not take this opportunity
to get rid of them completely?

390
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,660
Otherwise, it will be hard
to find another chance.

391
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,020
For the sake of the nation,

392
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,500
maintaining stability
is also very important.

393
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,260
Besides, if we investigate and deal
with all these officials accordingly,

394
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,860
I'm afraid even more officials
will come to impeach you.

395
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,780
What do I have to fear?

396
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,580
Your Majesty, I must report

397
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:20,660
that Princess Pingyue has broken
into a house without permission.

398
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,300
Her Highness had a search warrant.

399
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,180
Princess Pingyue has abused her power

400
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,060
and covered up for the Shangguan Family.

401
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,770
The Shangguan Family
has already punished themselves

402
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:30,980
by having seventeen people
resign from their positions.

403
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,020
What?

404
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,780
Do you also want to do it, Mr. Xie?

405
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,540
Someone reported

406
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,460
that on the day
the Inspectorate Office was established,

407
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,740
Princess Pingyue wore
bright yellow accessories,

408
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,980
which was inappropriate.

409
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,820
That's because His Majesty
dotes on Princess Pingyue.

410
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:54,980
He gave it to her.

411
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,740
Rong, though you are a princess,

412
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,140
many of these officials have served
both His Majesty and the late Emperor,

413
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,860
so you should show them more respect.

414
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,900
It's interesting that you say so.

415
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,140
If these officials uphold integrity

416
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,820
and I disrespect them,

417
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,300
the populace will condemn me
as harshly as they can.

418
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,820
Perhaps you should ask around
at Caishikou.

419
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,300
Then you'll find out all these officials

420
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,740
are secretly cursed

421
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,900
by the common folk

422
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,300
for taking bribes and bending the law.

423
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,100
Rong, don't you think
you're going too far?

424
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:23,700
You...

425
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,540
Enough.

426
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,700
As for the others involved,

427
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,980
we'll discuss it
after Pingyue verifies everything.

428
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,020
It's just that the Qin Family
is indeed wrongly accused.

429
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,140
The Qin Family has merits
in guarding the border.

430
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:42,340
Qin Lin is promoted
to General of Loyalty and Valor.

431
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,820
Qin Feng will be the Vice General,

432
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,180
and Xiao Su will be the Grand Marshal
of the Northwest,

433
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,820
stationed in Chenzhou,
commanding the Northwest Army.

434
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,940
Pingyue really is impressive.

435
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,460
She actually has managed

436
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,220
to keep those old ministers in line.

437
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:00,940
I'm very pleased.

438
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,700
Pingyue is indeed clever and capable.

439
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,540
But I think

440
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,300
it's because
you have a keen eye for talent.

441
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,380
It allows you
to utilize her abilities effectively.

442
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:20,940
Tong Ye.

443
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:22,900
Hurry up.

444
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,820
Coming.

445
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,180
Look at how impatient you are.

446
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,780
I need to get everything prepared,
don't I?

447
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:29,900
Come on.

448
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,460
Be meticulous, okay?

449
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,660
I have something important
to attend to later.

450
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,540
Don't worry. I'll put in extra effort.

451
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,540
Be gentle, alright? What are you doing?

452
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,060
You want me
to be both meticulous and gentle.

453
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,180
What exactly do you want?

454
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,660
You're getting harder
and harder to please.

455
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,060
This should make it easier.

456
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:56,940
How's that?

457
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:57,940
Not bad.

458
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,500
Once you are done here,

459
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,860
prepare a set
of nicer-looking nightclothes for me.

460
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,540
Okay.

461
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,540
Also,

462
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,740
prepare a cloak.

463
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:09,820
Sure.

464
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,380
Her Highness
will like the nice-looking nightclothes.

465
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,030
[Liquor]
This Inspectorate Office

466
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:17,780
has just been established.

467
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,940
You must have been busy
with official duties lately.

468
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,140
You've worked hard.

469
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:23,980
Well,

470
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,060
this time, I've also experienced

471
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,460
the life of being an official.

472
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,300
Cheers.

473
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,900
I just feel that in the past,

474
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,940
you were living

475
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,540
a carefree life.

476
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,940
Now suddenly taking on this position,

477
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,740
I'm worried

478
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,100
you might feel a bit restrained

479
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,020
or uncomfortable.

480
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,540
After all, it's His Majesty's decree,

481
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,580
so I can't refuse.

482
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,140
The Deputy Supervisor
of the Inspectorate Office

483
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,820
is basically an overseer.

484
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,100
Among the noble families,

485
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,180
the Su Family member is the one
who's most suitable for this position.

486
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,460
However,

487
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,380
there are some things

488
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,060
I haven't said before,

489
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,860
but I know it all in my heart.

490
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,220
The reason I was able

491
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,660
to live a carefree life before

492
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,260
was because of you.

493
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,500
You took on the burden

494
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,540
of being the young master
of the Su Family for me.

495
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,620
Looking at it this way,

496
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,740
I feel that I'm somewhat incompetent.

497
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,220
What are you talking about, Ronghua?

498
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,380
I've never thought that way.

499
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,140
Since I was young, I've been used

500
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,540
to seeing your smiling face.

501
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,460
I also hope that in the future,

502
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,140
you'll have countless reasons

503
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,420
to laugh heartily every day.

504
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:30,980
Cheers.

505
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,140
Well, I also hope

506
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,980
that you can find at least one reason
to be happy every day.

507
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,460
Speaking of which,

508
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,700
this job at the Inspectorate Office
isn't bad at all.

509
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,540
Every day, I get to meet

510
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,180
a certain lovely lady.

511
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,100
Seeing her always makes me happy.

512
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,180
You should also make an effort.

513
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,620
It's colder today than usual.

514
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:14,780
Indeed.

515
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,060
That's why I specifically
asked people to add extra charcoal.

516
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,260
You are not cold now, are you?

517
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,700
I'm not cold.

518
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,260
But I'm worried
that you might feel cold.

519
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,580
Why are you wearing such thin clothes?

520
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,860
I'm strong and healthy.

521
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,780
Besides, I don't spend
much time outdoors.

522
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,980
These clothes are enough for me.

523
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,220
Let's see how long
you can keep up the act.

524
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,340
Let's eat.

525
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:37,900
Sure.

526
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,820
No cilantro.

527
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,660
Thinly sliced meat.

528
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,580
And extra green onions.

529
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,540
Pei Wenxuan has known
my habits inside out

530
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,340
after living with me all those years.

531
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,060
With such a deep understanding of me,

532
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,500
poisoning me to death

533
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,020
would have been a piece of cake.

534
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,820
Luckily, he never had
that intention back then.

535
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,260
Otherwise, I fear
I would have died long ago

536
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,260
and Su Rongqing wouldn't even
have had a chance to kill me.

537
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,140
Go ahead and eat.

538
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,980
This fish is very fresh.

539
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,740
Why don't you have some?

540
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,580
It will help keep you warm.

541
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,860
I'm not hungry.

542
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,380
I just enjoy watching you eat.

543
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,620
Okay.

544
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,700
The meat today is delicious.

545
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,660
Why are you laughing?

546
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,020
Didn't you say you were not cold?

547
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,700
Eat your food.

548
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,260
Let's take some charcoal out,

549
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,300
so we don't end up being sick
for getting too hot.

550
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,820
I'm freezing to death here.
Don't take the charcoal out.

551
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,300
Then why were you being stubborn?

552
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,260
Once the case is closed,
it will be almost the Spring Festival.

553
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,780
The court will grant us
a seven-day holiday.

554
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,380
Have you thought
about how you will spend it?

555
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,580
I don't have time to think about it.

556
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,980
I'm busy with the matters
of the Inspectorate Office every day.

557
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,100
Do you want to go flower viewing?

558
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,900
Flower viewing?

559
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,100
There are flowers all over my yard.

560
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,900
Why are you asking that?

561
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,220
Nothing, just asking casually.

562
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,500
Eat now.

563
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,940
Or else, the food will be frozen later.

564
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,820
Could you show it to me one more time?

565
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,620
Show you what?

566
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,660
Your Highness, I'm so tired.

567
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,020
How about you treat me
to a gambling session tonight?

568
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,020
What about wooden cards?

569
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:29,400
[Stop]

570
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,140
Your Highness, I'll go have a look.

571
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,820
Wait.

572
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,780
Your Highness,
they probably haven't gone far.

573
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:48,820
I can catch up with them.

574
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:55,340
Only desperate people like to purposely
make a mystery of simple things.

575
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,780
There's a saying,
"Do not pursue a desperate foe."

576
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,700
Let them go.

577
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,060
When we go back, bring more people.

578
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,540
We'll continue interrogating the rest.

579
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,460
The sooner we finish,

580
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,460
the sooner
you can go out and play, right?

581
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:12,860
Let's go.

582
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,260
Yes, Your Highness.

583
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,020
Young Master,
are we buying too much here?

584
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,420
We don't often get out like this.

585
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,220
It's a good opportunity to buy
some new things for the mansion.

586
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,700
Besides,

587
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,660
Her Highness has been working hard
on the case lately.

588
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,220
What's wrong with her eating a bit more
to replenish her energy?

589
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,540
It could cause inner heat.

590
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,620
Just shut up.

591
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,500
Take a look at the top-tier rouge.

592
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,900
Take a look. Have a glance.

593
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,780
Take a look at the finest rouge.

594
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,900
It will beautify and nourish your skin.

595
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,060
Take a look at the top-tier rouge.

596
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,980
Sir, have a look.

597
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,060
This finest rouge beautifies
and nourishes the skin.

598
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,540
Take a look.
It will beautify and nourish your skin.

599
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,100
Everyone, feel free to take a look.

600
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,540
Are these the newest styles
that haven't been seen before?

601
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,620
Of course, sir.

602
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,580
This is the best rouge ever known.

603
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,460
Buying one for your wife

604
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,900
will surely help you win her heart.

605
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,140
Watch out, Young Master!

606
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,100
Wait.

607
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,500
He's just a child.

608
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,500
Sir, he's an assassin.

609
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,460
There's an organization

610
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,260
that likes to find such people
and train them to become assassins.

611
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,740
They may look like children,

612
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,140
which easily lowers people's guard.

613
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,540
But in strength and skill,

614
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,260
they are fully capable adults.

615
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,860
They are so evil.

616
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,940
It might disturb Her Highness.

617
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,140
Hurry back to the Inspectorate Office
and prepare for support.

618
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:24,940
Yes, sir.

619
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,500
Ya.

620
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,660
You need to pay close attention
in the coming days.

621
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,260
They're sure to take further action.

622
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,100
Understood.

623
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,380
Your Highness.

624
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,540
Your Highness. Bad news.

625
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,420
The Prince Consort encountered
an assassination attempt

626
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,140
on the way back to the mansion.

627
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,700
He encountered an assassination attempt?

628
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,580
Your Highness, please don't panic.

629
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,220
You may return to the mansion
and take care of the Prince Consort.

630
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,940
I will go investigate who did this.

631
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,140
Use whatever means
necessary to find them.

632
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,900
I'll execute them myself.

633
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,900
Since I've chosen this path,

634
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,380
I'm bound to experience such things.

635
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,420
Don't worry, I'll protect myself.

636
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,060
So,

637
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,900
I'll figure out who did this.

638
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,620
Let's eat.

639
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,260
Let me do it.

640
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,740
Let's start with soup.

641
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,580
You usually prefer
to have soup before the meal,

642
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,500
don't you?

643
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,060
You might think I don't care
about these things, right?

644
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:09,580
But I'm also learning to improve.

645
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,500
Here.

646
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,780
Alright, that's enough.

647
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,780
You should also have some.

648
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,140
I'll manage on my own.

649
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,300
Really, I can handle it myself.

650
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,020
How are you going
to manage by yourself?

651
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,180
You couldn't even
pick things up just now.

652
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,540
Don't starve yourself.

653
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,380
I'm fine.

654
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:34,860
Your Highness.

655
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,540
Miss Shangguan has arrived.

656
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,060
Go ahead and see her.
I can manage on my own.

657
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,900
If I leave, how will you eat the food?

658
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,140
Don't be stubborn.

659
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,540
Ask Ya to wait a bit.

660
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,580
I'll go to see her
after I finish eating.

661
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,260
Yes, Your Highness.

662
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,220
Open your mouth.

663
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,580
Actually, being injured like this
could be quite good.

664
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,260
I mean, the dish tastes really good.

665
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,460
Try it.

666
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,700
Your Highness.

667
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,860
Your Highness, how's the Prince Consort?

668
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,940
Is he seriously injured?

669
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,220
Not that serious.

670
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,420
Why are you here so late then?

671
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,900
It's inconvenient for him
to have soup on his own.

672
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,740
I'm getting

673
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,860
a bit jealous of him.

674
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,860
Let's get to the point.

675
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:44,100
Is the knife that injured
the Prince Consort poisoned?

676
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,900
They just want to warn me

677
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,580
rather than completely ruin
our relationship.

678
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,460
At this point,

679
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,660
all they're asking for is a way out.

680
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,020
They are already targeting
the Prince Consort as a mere warning.

681
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,780
If they're serious,

682
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,500
then today, the Prince Consort might...

683
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,540
What are you trying to say?

684
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,590
Your Highness,
I'm afraid being too rigid

685
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,700
will lead to a downfall.

686
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,500
Perhaps we should take a step back.

687
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,180
If they hadn't taken action,

688
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,060
I might have spared them.

689
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,300
But now...

690
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,140
unless I'm dead,

691
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,420
it will be them who die.

692
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,580
What do you plan to do?

693
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,620
They're in the dark
while we're in the open.

694
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,980
We can't keep up like this.

695
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,500
You go investigate first.

696
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,020
If you can't find anything,

697
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,020
we'll lure the enemy in

698
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,460
and then trap them.

699
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,740
What will we use as bait?

700
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,300
Me.

701
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:00,740
Slowly.

702
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,340
I often wonder...

703
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,380
what you would be like as a wife.

704
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,220
You'd probably be a good wife
and a loving mother.

705
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,460
Although you appear decisive
on the surface,

706
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,500
you are also gentle.

707
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,020
Being taken care of by you
for this while

708
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:32,140
makes me feel at home.

709
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,700
I might leave the capital...

710
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,940
for a trip in a few days.

711
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:52,860
Leave the capital?

712
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,500
There have been too many things going on

713
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,420
at the Inspectorate Office lately.

714
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,100
I need to get out and clear my mind.

715
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,660
You're going out
without taking me with you?

716
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,700
You're injured.
You should stay home and rest.

717
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,780
This injury is nothing.

718
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,820
No, you can't...

719
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,540
Where are you planning to go?

720
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,420
I haven't decided yet.

721
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,340
No worries.
I'll help you think about it.

722
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,540
I need to find a place
where it's easy to ambush them.

723
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,620
Young Master.

724
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,180
I found it.

725
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,420
Make some space.

726
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:36,780
What place is it?

727
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,300
Butterfly Gorge.

728
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,780
There is a river in the gorge
and flowers on the shore.

729
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,020
I have inquired about it.

730
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,780
Many literati in Huajing

731
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,220
like to go there for an outing.

732
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,220
And they have organized
many social activities there.

733
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,550
[Butterfly Gorge]

734
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:55,940
Sounds good.

735
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:24,860
Your Highness.

736
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,060
Take a look at this.

737
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,900
This scholar wants to confess
his feelings to the girl he likes.

738
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,900
This is clearly a matter
that could be resolved

739
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,540
with just a few words.

740
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,420
Why make such a big fuss about it?

741
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,420
Why are you so savorless?

742
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,980
What do you mean?

743
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,300
Let me ask you.

744
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,460
What does this scholar want to do

745
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,860
after confessing his feelings
for the girl?

746
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:56,500
He wants to spend his life with her?

747
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,420
You're smart.

748
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,460
So, since it's such an important matter,

749
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,740
if he just confesses his feelings
with a few words,

750
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,100
wouldn't it make the girl feel

751
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,100
that she's under-appreciated?

752
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,260
That's true.

753
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,860
It seems

754
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,860
that no one has sincerely confessed
their feelings to you.

755
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,620
Aren't you the same?

756
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:23,820
Of course not.

757
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,900
Many people confessed
their feelings to me before.

758
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,340
