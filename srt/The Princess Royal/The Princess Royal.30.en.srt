4
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 30]

5
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,180
I contacted my friends
around the country

6
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:35,980
to check
the published examination essays

7
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,860
on all the bulletin boards
across the country.

8
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,100
My essay was finally found

9
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,820
posted in the next county.

10
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,660
It was then I realized

11
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,020
that someone had stolen
my exam candidature.

12
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,060
I understand

13
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,660
your predicament.

14
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,260
Consort Rou shall do you justice.

15
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,740
- Thank you, Mr. Pei.
- Thank you, Mr. Pei.

16
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,340
You may leave now.

17
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,900
Consort Rou has arrived!

18
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:12,900
Your Highness.

19
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,620
Skip the formalities.

20
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,660
Mr. Pei.

21
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,300
You've interrogated them just now.

22
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,100
Have you noticed anything wrong?

23
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,620
After listening to these candidates
whose candidatures were stolen,

24
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,420
I've indeed found
there was something strange.

25
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,660
First,

26
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,500
these people all come from Youzhou.

27
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,140
Second,

28
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,180
most of them realized
they had been replaced

29
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,620
after checking the published essays
posted on the bulletins.

30
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,820
Before the scripts reached the capital,

31
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,140
no one knew who would
pass the examination.

32
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,740
So,

33
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,620
it's likely that no one would
take action at this point.

34
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,060
If someone wanted
to tamper with the scripts

35
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,900
and replace the candidates' names,

36
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,620
there are only
two possible stages to do so.

37
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,260
The first stage

38
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,140
is when the officials
open the scripts to read

39
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,660
and sort them according to region.

40
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,620
The second stage

41
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,500
is when the scripts are sent back
to all the counties.

42
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,540
The people in charge of these stages

43
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,300
are often from the powerful clans
who are managing different territories.

44
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,860
Then, how do you suggest
we proceed with this?

45
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,500
Of course, we have to investigate.

46
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,860
You even dare
to investigate the Shangguan Family?

47
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,460
Your Highness?

48
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,780
You're right.

49
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,300
However, many officials
are involved in this

50
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,300
and most of them come
from the noble families in the capital.

51
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,420
I'm afraid it's not easy

52
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,300
to get to the bottom of this.

53
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,940
I understand your concerns.

54
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,100
His Majesty sent me here

55
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,420
just to resolve your problems.

56
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,980
If you would trust me, Your Highness,

57
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,700
you may leave the entire case to me.

58
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,660
I guarantee that I will
resolve this properly.

59
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,780
Thank you in advance, Mr. Pei.

60
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,540
We'll be counting on you.

61
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,580
Mother.

62
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,740
Cheng.

63
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,660
We believe that Mr. Pei is trustworthy,

64
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,340
right?

65
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,780
Thank you for your trust,
Your Highnesses.

66
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,580
I'll just play along with Mr. Pei

67
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,420
and stage this act together.

68
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,340
[Shangguan's Mansion]
Mr. Pei,

69
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,940
what are you doing?

70
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,180
Miss Shangguan,

71
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,380
as the Vice Supervisor
of the Inspectorate Office,

72
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,940
you should know

73
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,620
that the Inspectorate Office

74
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,380
has been investigating
the imperial examination fraud lately.

75
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,940
Four men from the Shangguan Family
are involved in this.

76
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,380
I would like to take them back
for interrogation.

77
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,900
I hope you'll allow me to do so.

78
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,420
You came all the way here, Mr. Pei.

79
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,620
As a part of the Inspectorate Office,
I ought to set an example.

80
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,940
I will bring them personally

81
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,140
to the Inspectorate Office

82
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,500
and hand them over to you.

83
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:48,820
Kneel!

84
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,460
Kneel!

85
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,780
Prince Su,

86
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,820
Consort Rou and Princess Huayue.

87
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,900
I have brought the four suspects
from the Shangguan Family.

88
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,100
Please give the command.

89
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,060
No wonder His Majesty
appreciates you a lot, Mr. Pei.

90
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,140
That was swift.

91
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,260
Thank you.

92
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,940
You flatter me, Your Highness.

93
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,220
I will need you to take these people
here for interrogation as well.

94
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,380
I shall do it right away.

95
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,580
- Don't move!
- Don't move!

96
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,500
I am here

97
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,060
at the order
of Prince Su and Consort Rou

98
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,100
to arrest the suspects.

99
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,100
Take these suspects
who committed fraud out.

100
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,060
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

101
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,540
- Move!
- Move!

102
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,340
Hurry.

103
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,300
Mr. Pei is wise indeed!

104
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,380
With Mr. Pei around,

105
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,180
scholars like us can study in peace.

106
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,020
If there's any other grievance,

107
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,540
Mr. Pei will also serve the justice.

108
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,860
- Mr. Pei!
- Mr. Pei!

109
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,980
Mr. Pei, nice work.

110
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,780
Kneel!

111
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,580
Your Highness.

112
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,060
I've brought you
the people you requested.

113
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,260
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

114
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,300
You are truly decisive.

115
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:32,940
Your Highness.

116
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,100
Consort Rou

117
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,620
is not a fool

118
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,740
and she's always maintained
a good reputation

119
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,220
in the palace.

120
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,300
Why would she...

121
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,340
Do you know

122
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,180
what's the scariest thing
about wielding power?

123
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,620
It's when it corrodes one's heart,

124
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,980
the person whose heart
is almost corroded to the core

125
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,980
cannot feel anything at all.

126
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,340
In most people's life,
they may experience

127
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,460
wielding some degree of power,

128
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,820
which leads to reckless
behavior and speech.

129
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,100
Therefore, the easiest way
to destroy someone

130
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,500
is to suddenly give them

131
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,620
something beyond their reach.

132
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,500
That way,

133
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,300
even if you do nothing,

134
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,620
they would destroy
themselves eventually.

135
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,580
Mr. Pei, you have been working hard
and running around recently

136
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,220
and you've lost quite some weight.

137
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,020
Thank you, Your Highness.

138
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,300
It is my duty

139
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,380
to work for you.

140
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,780
I called you here today

141
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,700
to discuss something with you.

142
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,060
Please go ahead, Your Highness.

143
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,380
Too many people are involved
in the imperial examination fraud.

144
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,940
I'm afraid it won't be solved
anytime soon.

145
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,700
It'd be bad if the imperial examination
got delayed because of this.

146
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,180
That's why I would like you to help me

147
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,220
talk to the other candidates.

148
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,220
Let them take the examination first.

149
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,820
We'll resolve

150
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,180
part of the case

151
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,460
and slowly deal with the rest.

152
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,660
Of course,

153
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,980
they have wasted much time in Huajing.

154
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,540
So as compensation,

155
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,500
they can receive 50 silver taels each.

156
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,140
What do you think?

157
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,420
We'll do as you say, Your Highness.

158
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,140
I will talk to the candidates tomorrow.

159
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,780
That would be good.

160
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,060
Thank you for your help
over the past few days.

161
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,100
Let me show you my gratitude

162
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,740
with a cup of tea.

163
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,820
That would be my honor.

164
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,460
But now,

165
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,620
I also need your help to catch
another big fish for me.

166
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,140
[Wang's Mansion]
By order of Consort Rou,

167
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,900
I am here to arrest Wang Houwen.

168
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,500
Hand him over.

169
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,540
Stall them.

170
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,420
I'm going to see Mr. Wang.

171
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,180
Shut the gates.

172
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,700
If you want to get promoted...

173
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,700
Spend money! Spend money!

174
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,700
What a clever bird.

175
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,340
You're such sensible creatures.

176
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,380
Mr. Wang.

177
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,220
Not so loud.

178
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,580
Pei Wenxuan and his men
are here to arrest you.

179
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:56,980
Wait.

180
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,620
Didn't you give Consort Rou the money?

181
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,660
I did.

182
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,500
How could they go back
on their word, then?

183
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,300
I knew these commoners
could not be trusted.

184
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,820
They're so greedy.

185
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,420
They have no regard for our promise.

186
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,300
Exactly.

187
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,100
What should we do now, then?

188
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,820
Well,

189
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,900
go to the Ministry of Justice
to see Mr. Su.

190
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,100
Tell him

191
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,420
that Pei Wenxuan
is overstepping his boundaries

192
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,420
by trespassing on my mansion.

193
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,340
Wait.

194
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,540
Tell him this as well

195
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,260
that Pei Wenxuan hit a court official.

196
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,540
Ask him to arrest Pei Wenxuan.

197
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,020
Mr. Wang.

198
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,900
Will you see Pei Wenxuan, then?

199
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,020
Is he even worthy of meeting me?

200
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,020
No way! No way!

201
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,380
Listen to that.
Even a bird knows better than you.

202
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,060
Why am I even keeping you here?

203
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,540
What's his rank compared to mine?

204
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,740
He thinks he can see me
when he wants to?

205
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,780
Just tell him

206
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,220
that I'm sleeping

207
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,940
and that we can talk when I'm up.

208
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,700
Go!

209
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,220
Yes, sir.

210
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,460
Mr. Wang is sleeping.

211
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,660
Sleeping?

212
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,940
As the Minister of Personnel,

213
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,340
he ordered other officials
to accept bribes

214
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,060
and replace the candidates' names
on the scripts randomly.

215
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,380
Do you know

216
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,380
many commoners
have spent their whole lives studying,

217
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,900
but their endeavors have been destroyed
due to his word?

218
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,020
And he can still sleep.

219
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,380
You need to prove
your words with evidence.

220
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:27,780
Evi...

221
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,940
You want evidence?

222
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,540
Tell Mr. Wang to come out

223
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,900
and follow me
to the Inspectorate Office.

224
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,460
Consort Rou will judge him justly there.

225
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,700
Otherwise,

226
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,180
don't blame me for being rude.

227
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,540
I'd love to see how rude you can be.

228
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,020
Are you going to trespass
on our mansion?

229
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:50,820
Rush in.

230
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,740
Storm the gates! Arrest him!

231
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,700
Let's see who's bold enough to stop us.

232
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,220
Clear the path!

233
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:00,740
Don't move!

234
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:02,980
What are you doing?

235
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,500
Mr. Wang.

236
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,700
Don't you have any regard for the law?

237
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,900
Time to wake up.

238
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,540
You are having a good life, aren't you?

239
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,340
Even birds

240
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,380
in a noble family
would have a better life, right?

241
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,180
Noble families are better!
Noble families are better!

242
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,340
How dare you!

243
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,420
Who let you in?

244
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,700
I am the Minister of Personnel.

245
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,140
What are you trying to do?

246
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,220
What do you think, Mr. Wang?

247
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,220
Take him.

248
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,380
You dare?

249
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:25,980
Pei Wenxuan!

250
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,300
You've gone too far.

251
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,180
I'm three ranks higher
than you, after all.

252
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,900
You can't force your way in.

253
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:32,700
Mr. Wang,

254
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,180
I am here at the order of Consort Rou

255
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,180
to fulfill my duties.

256
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,140
Consort Rou has said

257
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,740
that you're the Minister of Personnel,

258
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,500
so we have to investigate you.

259
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,700
You did a terrible job

260
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,300
handling the imperial examination fraud,

261
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,380
even worse than her second uncle.

262
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,300
Nonsense!

263
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,940
Her second uncle is just
a broad bean seller!

264
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,700
How could you compare me...

265
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,300
Mr. Wang, keep your
grievances to yourself now.

266
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,460
We can seek justice for you
in the Inspectorate Office later.

267
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,580
Take him.

268
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,700
Mr. Pei!

269
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,900
What are you doing?

270
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,100
- Let go of my master!
- Let go.

271
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,140
Mr. Wang.

272
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:05,980
Where were you earlier?

273
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,100
They barged in just like that.

274
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,460
We couldn't stop them.

275
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,100
Mr. Pei, whom are you taking
to the Inspectorate Office?

276
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,340
Mr. Su, you're finally here.

277
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,540
Pei Wenxuan

278
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,820
overstepped his boundaries
and trespassed on my property.

279
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,900
Had you been here one step later,

280
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,780
he would have beaten me up.

281
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,420
Mr. Wang.

282
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,340
Get some rest elsewhere.

283
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,260
Very well.

284
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:24,860
Mr. Wang.

285
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:25,820
He...

286
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,820
I knew that under such circumstances,

287
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,620
you would come sooner or later.

288
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,460
You've overstepped your boundaries,
trespassed on private property,

289
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,020
and tried to hit a court official.

290
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,140
Pei Wenxuan.

291
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,500
These are all serious offenses.

292
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,100
Mr. Su.

293
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,300
I am here at the order of Consort Rou

294
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,340
to fulfill her commands.

295
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,660
Are you going to disobey

296
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,900
Consort Rou's order?

297
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,020
Mu Hong.

298
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,500
Yes, sir.

299
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,140
Take him.

300
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,540
How dare you!

301
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,540
Mr. Pei.

302
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,580
Are you resisting arrest brazenly?

303
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,460
You're over-exaggerating.

304
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,140
I am just doing my job as instructed.

305
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:06,980
There's nothing wrong with that.

306
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,700
If there's something wrong with that,

307
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,020
you should be heading to the palace

308
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,940
and throwing Consort Rou
into prison instead.

309
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,380
What do I have to do with this?

310
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,260
Take him!

311
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,180
How dare you? Who...

312
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:15,700
Stop.

313
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,740
I will go to the Ministry of Justice
with you.

314
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,020
But Prince Su

315
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,300
would never let anything happen to me.

316
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,020
I'd love to see

317
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,300
how long you can lock me up.

318
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,940
That depends on my mood,

319
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,540
Mr. Pei.

320
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,780
Young Master, the...

321
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,300
That's enough.

322
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,540
When Pei Wenxuan climbs over here,

323
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,540
what kind of unreasonable request
should I make?

324
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:00,940
Your Highness!

325
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,340
Bad news!

326
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,980
The Prince Consort
has been arrested by Mr. Su!

327
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,940
Why would Su Rongqing
suddenly arrest him?

328
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,340
The Prince Consort and his men
barged into Wang's Mansion

329
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,780
to arrest Mr. Wang,

330
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,580
so Mr. Wang sent someone to the Ministry
of Justice to lodge a case.

331
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,740
Then Mr. Su went there
and arrested the Prince Consort.

332
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,620
Let's enter the palace now.

333
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:22,820
Wait.

334
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,540
I can't.

335
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,700
Get someone to find
where Pei Wenxuan is.

336
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,620
Keep him guarded
while we make our way there.

337
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,860
But Mr. Su wouldn't...

338
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,660
You don't understand.

339
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,580
He may look like a gentle soul,

340
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,940
but if someone gets in his way,

341
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,380
he would turn

342
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,020
into a venomous and murderous snake.

343
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,340
Mu Hong, get some plasters.

344
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,820
Mr. Pei may have been injured

345
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,620
in our scuffle earlier.

346
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,180
I'm fine. It's just a slight injury.

347
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,740
Mu Hong, you may leave now.

348
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:04,980
Yes, sir.

349
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:09,980
Mr. Pei.

350
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,380
You don't seem worried at all.

351
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,500
Why should I?

352
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,940
You've offended a lot of people lately.

353
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,500
I'm sure you've offended

354
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,180
even more people
at the Ministry of Justice.

355
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,540
What's making you so happy?

356
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,980
It's been a really long time

357
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,300
since we talked to each other

358
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,820
face-to-face with such honesty.

359
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,140
You barged into Wang's Mansion today

360
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,420
and willingly followed me back here.

361
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,460
I guess you're doing this

362
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,260
to intensify the dispute

363
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,180
between Consort Rou and Mr. Wang.

364
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,940
Consort Rou has never been able
to see the situation clearly.

365
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,820
So, you caused a huge scene

366
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,700
and arrested me back there

367
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,700
to give them a warning, I reckon?

368
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,260
Looks like you've built relationships
with lots of people in the palace.

369
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,740
But, I should remind you
that it's a disreputable thing

370
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,780
to form a clique
to pursue selfish interests.

371
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,900
I have a piece of reminder
for you as well.

372
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,540
Today,

373
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,820
I can release you.

374
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,220
But if there's a next time,

375
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,580
I'll get you killed.

376
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,300
When it comes to dirty tricks
like clearing obstacles,

377
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,940
I'm sure you can do everything.

378
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,860
But, before that,

379
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,980
I'd like to ask you something.

380
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,460
If I'm gone, what about the Princess?

381
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:08,860
Mr. Su.

382
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,620
I have another question

383
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,740
that I'd like to ask.

384
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:16,820
Go ahead.

385
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,540
When did you travel back?

386
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,340
It was a month before the spring banquet
held by the Princess.

387
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,500
When I woke up,

388
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,260
it felt like I had a long dream.

389
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,780
This is my study during my younger days.

390
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,700
Am I dreaming?

391
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,100
Is Heaven

392
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,460
giving me a second chance?

393
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,180
Rong.

394
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,100
Are you here too?

395
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,260
Since you were back,

396
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,580
why did you...

397
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,300
Why did I let you marry her?

398
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,700
What if I said...

399
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,980
that I hoped you two would be happy?

400
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,220
Would you believe me?

401
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,500
Only if Li Chuan doesn't
ascend the throne, right?

402
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,300
Young Master.

403
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,780
The Princess is here for Mr. Pei.

404
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:03,780
Where is he?

405
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,060
Your Highness,
how come you came here personally?

406
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:09,940
Where is Pei Wenxuan?

407
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,820
Mr. Pei is fine.

408
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,340
I just brought him here
for a few questions

409
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,740
and I would release him afterward.

410
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,220
But I didn't expect you
to come so early.

411
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,100
You probably didn't expect

412
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,780
that I would think of you
as a villain, did you?

413
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,980
You must have thought

414
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,700
I would head to the palace first.

415
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,260
Your Highness, you know me well.

416
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,820
Yet you've never understood me.

417
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,740
Su Rongqing.

418
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,300
Actually, I have never hated you...

419
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,580
even though you killed me.

420
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,460
I know

421
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,340
you had your reasons.

422
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,020
But let me tell you this,

423
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,580
if you kill Pei Wenxuan,

424
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,340
I will hate you.

425
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,900
I will hate you forever.

426
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,340
Is everything fine?

427
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,540
Are you hurt?

428
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,060
Rest assured.

429
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,420
It's just a slight contusion.

430
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,220
On your arm? Can you move your arm?

431
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:38,860
Don't worry.

432
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,620
You frightened me.

433
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:48,740
Careful.

434
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,380
Does it hurt?

435
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,780
No, it's just a minor injury.

436
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,300
I'll be fine after a few days' rest.

437
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,860
Besides, getting injured
can put us at an advantage.

438
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,860
What do you mean?

439
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,100
It's Su Rongqing's fault

440
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,620
that I got injured,

441
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:15,860
so that means

442
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,940
he'll be losing his position
as the Minister of Justice.

443
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,820
You...

444
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,860
You're still thinking of this
when you're injured?

445
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,180
But I was about to ask you this.

446
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,940
What were you thinking today?

447
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,260
Why did you go to Wang Houwen?

448
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,980
Consort Rou ordered me
to tell the candidates

449
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,340
to stop pursuing their cases of someone
stealing their exam candidatures

450
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,700
and if they agree to it,

451
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,740
they can take
the imperial examination normally

452
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,540
and receive a substantial sum of money.

453
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,020
If they don't agree,

454
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,340
then Consort Rou...

455
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,220
Consort Rou is trying
to benefit from both sides.

456
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,300
She wants to gain a good reputation
for pleading for the people

457
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,500
while trying not to offend
the noble families.

458
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,980
That's why you went to Wang's Mansion

459
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,940
and caused a scene there

460
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,180
so that he would antagonize Consort Rou.

461
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:06,980
Yes.

462
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,580
What's more, I even prepared
a beautiful poem for Consort Rou.

463
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:12,780
What poem?

464
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,620
You will know when the time comes.

465
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,180
I had everything planned out,

466
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,260
but I didn't expect Su Rongqing to come.

467
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,820
Back at the Ministry of Justice today,

468
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,260
why did you seem flustered
when you saw Su Rongqing?

469
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,500
I keep having this feeling
that he'd do something to you.

470
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,420
I'm scared.

471
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,460
Think about it.

472
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,500
We just found out his true identity,

473
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,860
and right now,

474
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,860
the imperial examination
is about to begin.

475
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,660
You're a dangerous threat to him.

476
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,140
And him?

477
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,380
He's a gentleman on the surface,
but he uses powerful tactics.

478
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,700
I'm just afraid
something would go wrong.

479
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,660
Rest assured.

480
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,100
Are you getting me home?

481
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,300
What home?

482
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,180
You're in my carriage, and you think
you're going back to your place?

483
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,460
Back to the Princess's Mansion with me,
Mr. Pei.

484
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,260
No, not now.

485
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,180
Consort Rou is searching for evidence

486
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,700
to prove that you bought
a house next to mine.

487
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,220
If His Majesty finds out,

488
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,100
he will lose his trust in me.

489
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:18,540
I...

490
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,780
How about this?

491
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,820
It's me who's crazy over Mr. Pei

492
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,060
and even though we're divorced,

493
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,060
I just wouldn't let him off.

494
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,020
So, when I heard

495
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,940
that Mr. Pei was meeting
another lady tonight,

496
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,260
I planned to go out
to catch them red-handed,

497
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,940
but instead, I saw you in danger,

498
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,220
so I rescued you

499
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,140
and tied you up to return
to the Princess's Mansion.

500
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,460
I have to put on a convincing image

501
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,100
of a lovesick girl.

502
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,260
Details, you know?

503
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:45,900
Fine.

504
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,370
[Princess's Mansion]

505
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,780
Your Highness.

506
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,660
It's Consort Rou's men.

507
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,420
Your Highness.

508
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,100
You disobeyed the order and left
your mansion without permission.

509
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:16,580
Yes.

510
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:18,740
So what?

511
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:19,940
I...

512
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,380
If you have time to interrogate me,

513
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,060
why don't you go ask your master

514
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,380
what's taking her so long
with Chen Houzhao's case?

515
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,420
Has she even found out anything?

516
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,180
I agreed to the confinement

517
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,620
because I respect my father,

518
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,020
but she'd better not assume
any unwarranted authority

519
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,940
and bully me instead.

520
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,780
Go back and tell her

521
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,220
that if she asks any dubious woman

522
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,580
to approach
the former Prince Consort again,

523
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,540
I might just declare war against her.

524
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,460
Invite the Prince Consort in.

525
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,340
Yes, Your Highness.

526
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,860
Your Highness, he's a court official...

527
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,180
He is my former Prince Consort.

528
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,980
Since we had been married,

529
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,220
he will be mine for his whole life.

530
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,940
Even when he dies,
he will have to die here, understood?

531
00:27:59,180 --> 00:27:59,980
If you keep blocking my way,

532
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,060
I'll make sure you die here as well.

533
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,780
Let's go inside.

534
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,780
What dubious woman?

535
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,980
Why is she so obsessed over a man
who divorced her?

536
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,020
Does she have any shame?

537
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,020
What gives her the right
to be so arrogant?

538
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,460
Mother,

539
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,020
I will tell Father immediately
that she left her mansion

540
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,540
without permission
to rescue Pei Wenxuan.

541
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,300
No.

542
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,140
The fact that she
accepted her confinement

543
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,540
shows that your father

544
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,060
has done enough to make her yield to us.

545
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,260
You should be thankful
that she didn't make any scene.

546
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,100
Don't start any more trouble.

547
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,500
Why would Pei Wenxuan

548
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,060
mess with Wang Houwen like that?

549
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,300
I think

550
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,660
he's setting us up
instead of helping us.

551
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,020
I asked him to do that.

552
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,020
Now that we've taken
over the Inspectorate Office,

553
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,180
your father would want us to take action

554
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,260
against the noble families.

555
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,180
I'm making an example of Wang Houwen.

556
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,660
I can have him arrested

557
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,140
or released,

558
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,740
but this will warn the noble families

559
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:11,380
that we are a force to be reckoned with.

560
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,660
Now that Pei Wenxuan is in trouble,

561
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,260
who will deal with those candidates?

562
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,300
What should we do now?

563
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,500
We still have to apologize
to him in person.

564
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,140
How about you write an apology letter

565
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,900
and attach some money to him?

566
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,900
Tell him that it's a misunderstanding.

567
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,580
Fine.

568
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,260
Why are we still getting pushed around?

569
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:38,980
I'm off.

570
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:44,980
Your Highness,

571
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,260
here's a letter from Wang's Mansion.

572
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,460
There lived a sparrow
that fed on pigswill in the alleys,

573
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,940
until it landed on a tall branch
and called itself a phoenix.

574
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,260
Clad in hues of gold and emerald
with a pearl in its mouth,

575
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,260
its filth and stench
still linger nevertheless.

576
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,740
How bold of Wang Houwen!

577
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,780
How could he insult you like this?

578
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,140
I must make an example of you now.

579
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,780
Mr. Su really knows
how to get the job done.

580
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:25,940
Eat up.

581
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,060
It's a tribute. It's awesome.

582
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,780
Hand Wang Houwen over!

583
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,260
They're here again? What a nuisance.

584
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,660
Prince Su, Consort Rou?

585
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,980
What's going on here?

586
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,740
What's wrong with you, Wang Houwen?

587
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,340
I didn't do anything.

588
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:49,900
Take him!

589
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,740
How dare you!

590
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,100
I am the Minister of Personnel,

591
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,100
from the Wang Family of Donghai...

592
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,020
How dare you slap me?

593
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,380
Remember this.

594
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,140
I may be a consort's son,

595
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,340
but I'm a prince all the same.

596
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,420
Remember this.

597
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,420
I can slap you

598
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,820
whenever I like.

599
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,900
You're not worthy
of disputing my status.

600
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,100
Is there any regard for the law here?

601
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:11,740
Take him!

602
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,340
Xiao Rou, I'll tell His Majesty
what you've done!

603
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,820
[Inspectorate Office]
Consort Rou, Prince Su.

604
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,820
You've slapped and arrested me.

605
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,300
You've already completed
the standard procedure.

606
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,020
Time to release me.

607
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:27,100
My birds are waiting for me at home.

608
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,780
Mr. Wang, you do have
a penchant for birds.

609
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,340
They're in your paintings, writings,

610
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,620
and even poetry.

611
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,620
Maybe you should think about
how you should confess.

612
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,340
Do you want to do it yourself

613
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,820
or let me get someone to help you?

614
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,660
Your Highness, stop freaking me out.

615
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:48,820
Why don't we talk about this privately?

616
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,140
Speak.

617
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,540
I sent Wang Quan to deliver
the money, didn't I?

618
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,860
If you need more,

619
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,100
I can gather more.

620
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,620
I still have

621
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,100
a fief in Donghai.

622
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,780
I planned to save it for Dun Min,

623
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,980
but I can...

624
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,260
Trying to bribe me?

625
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,100
Write this down.
Mr. Wang tried to bribe me.

626
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,180
Your Highness.

627
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,100
Mr. Wang,

628
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,060
you don't have to worry
about my finances.

629
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,740
However, you could help me
with another thing now.

630
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,500
I heard that you are talented
and knowledgeable,

631
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,180
and I received a poem

632
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,780
that's a bit hard for me to understand.

633
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:35,260
Perhaps you can explain it to me.

634
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,820
Your Highness,

635
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,340
you could have said so.

636
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,860
"There lived a sparrow
that fed on pigswill in the alleys,

637
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:45,260
until it landed on a tall branch
and called itself a phoenix."

638
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,380
These two lines mean

639
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,580
that there was a sparrow

640
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,820
that lived

641
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,340
in a terrible environment,

642
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,100
until it got lucky

643
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,540
and became a phoenix.

644
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,340
What's next?

645
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,740
"Clad in hues of gold and emerald
with a pearl in its mouth,

646
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,820
its filth and stench
still linger nevertheless."

647
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,500
That's a little bit more complicated.

648
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,900
But, to put it simply,

649
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,740
if someone is born into a humble family,

650
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,540
even if they manage to go
from rags to riches,

651
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,540
they could never hide their...

652
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,140
Wang Houwen, you abhorrent old jerk!

653
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,300
As a high-ranked and powerful minister,

654
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,100
you probably have never
been tortured before.

655
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,420
If you don't confess today,

656
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,100
you'll have a taste of everything
at our disposal.

657
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,420
Mother, let's go.

658
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,260
Mr. Wang, a word of advice.

659
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,260
Confess quickly,

660
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,820
or else even the Dragon King
of the East Sea can't save you.

661
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,060
Treat him properly.

662
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:36,900
Wait, Your Highness.

663
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,180
You told me to analyze the poem.

664
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,780
Are uneducated people

665
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,780
emotionally unstable as well?

666
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,140
The Vice Minister of Justice,
Su Rongqing, didn't take good care

667
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:49,380
of the Vice Minister of Personnel,
Pei Wenxuan,

668
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,180
which caused Pei Wenxuan injured.

669
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,580
Therefore, three months of his salary
will be deducted.

670
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,500
In addition,

671
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,780
the Left Minister of Justice,
Pei Liming,

672
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,820
will be promoted
to the Minister of Justice.

673
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,860
I accept your decree, Your Majesty.

674
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,940
Do you two have anything to say?

675
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,900
Your Majesty, I have received news

676
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:18,100
that Consort Rou and Prince Su
showed no regard for the law

677
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,780
and arrested the Minister of Personnel,

678
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,100
Wang Houwen, even when they don't
have substantial evidence.

679
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,620
All the officials feel threatened
by this outcome.

680
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,980
I hope you will investigate
this issue thoroughly

681
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,620
and not let all the officials down.

682
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,100
I agree.

683
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,900
Consort Rou and Prince Su are now above

684
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,300
Six Ministries

685
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,660
with no regard for the law, so...

686
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,540
Father.

687
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,380
This is the money that Wang Houwen
sent to my mother as a bribe.

688
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,620
You can find
the Wang Family's emblem under it.

689
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,260
He also wrote a letter to her.

690
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,060
If you don't believe me,

691
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,420
you may check the evidence.

692
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,860
The evidence is clear.

693
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,940
If the Crown Prince broke the law,

694
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,820
he would be punished
just as a common person.

695
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,660
Now, Wang Houwen
is involved in embezzlement.

696
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,900
The Inspectorate Office is investigating
this case under my order.

697
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,140
So what if they arrest him?

698
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,780
Mr. Wang, take a look again.

699
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,860
Isn't this a well-written poem?

700
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,700
Your Highness.

701
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:40,340
What if I said
the handwriting looks like mine,

702
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,820
but I didn't write it?

703
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,860
Would you believe me?

704
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,180
Should I?

705
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,580
That depends on you.

706
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,620
Mr. Wang,

707
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,940
why don't you give me a few names,

708
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,860
and I'll ask His Majesty

709
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,300
to spare your life?

710
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,780
Your Highness, even until now,

711
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,260
you don't know
what the noble families truly are.

712
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,900
It may seem

713
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,620
that there are numerous noble families
in our country,

714
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,100
but in reality,

715
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,100
they've already combined
into one single entity.

716
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:23,740
We are bound together for good or ill.

717
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,860
If I betray one noble family,

718
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,900
I would be betraying
all the noble families.

719
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,140
As someone born into a noble family,

720
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,100
if I betray the noble families,

721
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,260
only death will await me.

722
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:39,980
That's why

723
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,780
I cannot tell you anything.

724
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,420
Likewise,

725
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,260
the moment you arrested me,

726
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,500
you have already chosen

727
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,580
to antagonize all the noble families.

728
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:00,340
Mr. Wang, is that a threat or advice?

729
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,580
Neither.

730
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,620
I know

731
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,060
that from now onward,

732
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,020
I won't be leaving
the Inspectorate Office anymore.

733
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,060
Have you really made your decision?

734
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,460
Yes.

735
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,340
I will tell His Majesty
what you've just said.

736
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,260
Any more requests, Mr. Wang?

737
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,140
I have one final request.

738
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,300
Can you...

739
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,620
release my birds?

740
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:56,220
Thank you, Consort Rou!

741
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,820
[Hanqiu Palace]

742
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,420
I think we can close the case
of imperial examination fraud now.

743
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,340
It's clear that Wang Houwen and eight
other officials abused their positions

744
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,980
to undermine the imperial examination's
credibility and embezzle funds.

745
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,020
I suggest that they should
be sentenced to death,

746
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,180
and as for the others involved,

747
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,660
I suggest that they be imprisoned,

748
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,860
of which its duration will be determined
by the Ministry of Justice.

749
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,260
Official Pei, what do you think?

750
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,580
Your Majesty,

751
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,300
I agree

752
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,460
with Prince Su's suggestions.

753
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,220
Father,

754
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,460
upon further investigation,

755
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,380
we have determined

756
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,020
that 123 eligible candidates

757
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,260
have had their exam candidatures stolen.

758
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,100
I suggest that we hold
another examination

759
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,860
to return them
the opportunities they deserve.

760
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:43,180
Does anyone have other objections?

761
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,660
Congratulations on employing
the right person, Your Majesty.

762
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,820
Prince Su's decisive manner

763
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,620
will prove to be a valuable asset
to you in the future.

764
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,700
I'm flattered, Mr. Shangguan.

765
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,060
Father, I would like to volunteer

766
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,060
to be the chief examiner
for the upcoming examination

767
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,220
and recruit talents for you.

768
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:03,820
Cheng,

769
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,940
I'm pleased that you would offer

770
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,620
to take on this responsibility,

771
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,900
but given your young age,
many people may not be convinced.

772
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,060
I have

773
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,180
other arrangements.

774
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:23,940
He's here.

775
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:26,900
What brings you all here?

776
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,780
- Mr. Pei.
- Mr. Pei.

777
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,060
- Mr. Pei.
- Mr. Pei.

778
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,300
Mr. Pei, how are you doing now?

779
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,660
My friend, you must have suffered.

780
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,020
Mr. Pei, while you were absent,

781
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,540
everyone has been thinking about you.

782
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:41,900
Yes.

783
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,740
Thank you, everyone.

784
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,660
I'm feeling much better now.

785
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,300
That's great.

786
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:47,740
Mr. Pei,

787
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,100
ever since Mr. Wang
was sentenced to death,

788
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,380
the Ministry of Personnel
has been lacking a leader.

789
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,300
Consort Rou even sent someone to ask

790
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,540
whether there was anyone

791
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,580
who could assume
the role of the chief examiner.

792
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,060
We think

793
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:05,100
that Consort Rou couldn't recommend
Prince Su for the position,

794
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,220
so she may recommend you instead.

795
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,620
That's why we're here

796
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,500
to inform you of this.

797
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,380
Yes.

798
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,540
I'm sorry for making all of you worry.

799
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,580
Mr. Pei, don't say so.

800
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,180
All of us here

801
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,420
come from humble clans in the capital.

802
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,220
We are nothing compared
to the noble families.

803
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,260
We need someone that we can rely on.

804
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:31,860
Mr. Pei, you're exactly the person
we'd like to follow.

805
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,460
Thank you for thinking so highly of me.

806
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,300
Tomorrow,

807
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,420
I'll return to the Ministry of Personnel

808
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,940
and discuss the future with you.

809
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,100
- Good.
- Good.

810
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,300
- That's great.
- That's great.

811
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,660
Fulai!

812
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:58,620
Your Majesty.

813
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,580
Your Majesty, I'm here.

814
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,620
What time is it?

815
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,140
Your Majesty, the sun has just risen.

816
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,140
I can't see again.

817
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,460
Your Majesty, let me summon
the imperial physician for you.

818
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,020
Wait.

819
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,260
Don't say a word of this to anyone else.

820
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,100
But, Your Majesty,

821
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,580
this is already the third time.

822
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,740
It's alright. I just need some rest.

823
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:27,860
Fulai.

824
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,580
Hurry up.

825
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,180
We're running out of time.

826
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,860
Pass this message to Consort Rou.

827
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,300
Tell her the imperial examination
is imperative, go!

828
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,260
Your Majesty...

829
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:37,980
Go!

830
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

831
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,980
[Taiji Hall]
The Inspectorate Office has already

832
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,420
closed the case
of the imperial examination fraud.

833
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,620
Consort Rou has done
an excellent job assisting Prince Su.

834
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,580
The metropolitan examination
has been delayed for months

835
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,180
and we should expedite it.

836
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:54,100
We have several vacancies
in the imperial court this year.

837
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,460
This is the opportunity

838
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,260
to recruit more talents for our country.

839
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,780
You're right, Your Majesty.

840
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,460
Mr. Pei is still recuperating.

841
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,900
He was supposed
to be the chief examiner.

842
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:07,860
Why don't we...

843
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,420
Your Majesty.

844
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,140
Greetings, Your Majesty.

845
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,140
Thank you for your concern,
Your Highness.

846
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,700
I have recovered from my injuries

847
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,700
and my peers have been updating me

848
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,540
on the various procedures
of the metropolitan examination,

849
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:37,020
The examination questions, examination
sites, and the evaluation system

850
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,500
are all in set order.

851
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,380
As soon as you give the command,

852
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,100
we can start right away.

853
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,900
Then, discuss with the Ministry of Rites
and choose a suitable date this month.

854
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:50,580
We can't put it off any longer.

855
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

856
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,420
Your Majesty, Mr. Pei is here.

857
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,060
Greetings, Your Majesty.

858
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:03,580
Skip the formalities.

859
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:10,780
Well?

860
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,980
Pingyue is finally releasing you
from her mansion?

861
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,900
Your Majesty,
please don't tease me anymore.

862
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,180
I'm finding myself

863
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,780
to be the subject of gossip everywhere.

864
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,980
Looks like Pingyue
does like you very much.

865
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,420
Her Highness is...

866
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,420
Her Highness is simple.

867
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:46,860
Make sure you uphold the credibility
of the metropolitan examination.

868
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,740
We need reliable people
in the imperial court.

869
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,060
Internally,

870
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,420
I need to maintain good governance.

871
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,420
Externally,

872
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,940
I've always wanted to suppress
the northern enemies

873
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,660
to keep our country safe
from constant skirmishes.

874
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:05,700
Official Pei,

875
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,460
do you have any useful suggestions?

876
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:09,580
Perhaps

877
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,740
we could hold
a military examination next year.

878
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,180
A military examination?

879
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,420
That's a brilliant idea.

880
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:17,900
Mr. Pei.

881
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,900
His Majesty has high hopes for you.

882
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,300
Has His Majesty been
experiencing health issues lately?

883
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,020
His Majesty has been experiencing

884
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,140
temporary blindness in the morning
for the past two days.

885
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,100
