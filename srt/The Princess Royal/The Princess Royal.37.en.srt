[Episode 37]

5
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,660
The Crown Prince got injured
the other day trying to save you.

6
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,500
When you go in later,
just treat it as a casual conversation.

7
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,540
Don't be nervous.

8
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,220
He got injured trying to save me?

9
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,380
Is Rong here?

10
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,340
Hurry. Tell Rong to come in.

11
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,500
Pei Wenxuan.

12
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,860
Your Highnesses.

13
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,740
His Highness has sustained
a sword wound.

14
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,180
He is worried you will be worried.

15
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,660
Set up a screen.

16
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:05,940
Yes.

17
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,100
Don't be nervous.

18
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,180
Go in.

19
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,620
Your Highness.

20
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,340
There are some paths
you must walk alone.

21
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,820
I will wait for you outside.

22
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,540
Your Highness.

23
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,100
I am sure you have a lot to talk about.

24
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,300
I shall leave you alone.

25
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,780
Do not fear.

26
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,020
I will be outside.

27
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,100
Rong.

28
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,940
I want to be willful once more.

29
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,540
I had a dream.

30
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,220
I dreamed that Zhenzhen was waiting
for me in heaven.

31
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,340
I must go and find her.

32
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,300
I've recently made friends
with an immortal cultivator

33
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,820
who can assist in my cultivation
and go to heaven soon.

34
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,740
Would you be willing
to help me govern the country?

35
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,420
Did you just say...

36
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,820
you want me to govern the country?

37
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,220
Yes, I wish
to entrust the country to you.

38
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,900
Are you all right, Rong?

39
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,420
Do you suffer from any injuries?

40
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,180
No, I am fine.

41
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,900
I am fine too.

42
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,700
It is just some minor injuries.

43
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,740
I will recover soon.

44
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,100
How did you get hurt?

45
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,380
I was afraid you were in danger.

46
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,460
So I followed you into the woods
when I got anxious.

47
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,980
I did not act impulsively.

48
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,260
I knew what I was doing.

49
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,940
Rong, what brings you here today?

50
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,540
It is nothing.

51
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,260
It's just...

52
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,980
I had a nightmare.

53
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,780
So I'm here to talk to you.

54
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,460
I am glad you are fine.

55
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,060
What did you dream about, Rong?

56
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,020
I dreamed...

57
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,660
I dreamed that you killed me.

58
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,940
Rong, how is that possible?

59
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,180
No matter what happens,

60
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,780
I will never hurt you.

61
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,060
If anyone tries to hurt you,

62
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,340
they have to walk over my dead body.

63
00:05:59,180 --> 00:05:59,940
I know.

64
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,740
Since we were young,
you always said you would protect me.

65
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,180
I remember that year

66
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,300
when that princess was sent to the North
for a marriage alliance,

67
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,260
I was so scared.

68
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,660
I was afraid that when I grew up,

69
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,140
I would also be sent away
for a marriage alliance.

70
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,020
You told me...

71
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,460
You said...

72
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:18,980
Rong,

73
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,780
don't worry.

74
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,140
When I grow up,

75
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,020
I'll drive the enemies

76
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,460
all the way into the cold bitter
far north.

77
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,940
I will never allow
such a marriage alliance to happen

78
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,140
to you.

79
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,780
Why are you bringing
up childhood memories now?

80
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,660
Are you saying
that I am not treating you well now?

81
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,220
I do not mean that.

82
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,860
It's just that you got injured
from saving me,

83
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,420
which reminds me how kind you were to me
when we were young.

84
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,340
Were you not good to me?

85
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,220
You have been good to me too.

86
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,460
Do you remember

87
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,580
Yuanbao and I shared peaches
when I was young?

88
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,100
Mother caught us

89
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,700
and grounded me.

90
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,100
You are the Crown Prince.

91
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,140
You must know there is a difference
between the superior and the inferior.

92
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,820
You are the superior
and the others are the inferior.

93
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,660
You should never share your food
with servants.

94
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,860
Do you know that?

95
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,220
I cannot finish it by myself.

96
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,060
Why can't I share it with others?

97
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,900
Didn't Father teach me to be thrifty?

98
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,460
It seems you still don't understand.

99
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,780
When you do,

100
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,220
I will let you out.

101
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,860
Mother, open the door! Mother!

102
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,740
Mother! Open the door!

103
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,660
Chuan.

104
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,180
Chuan.

105
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,180
Chuan, it's me.

106
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,020
Is it you, Rong?

107
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,140
Rong, it is dark in here.

108
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,140
Chuan, do not be scared.

109
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,300
I will be outside to keep you company.

110
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,740
If you're scared,

111
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,380
put the candy I gave you in your mouth.

112
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,300
Then you won't be scared anymore.

113
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,700
How is it?

114
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,020
It is very sweet.

115
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,700
Thank you, Rong.

116
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,660
I was grounded for three days

117
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,060
and you stayed outside with me
for three days.

118
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,460
Also,

119
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,220
I kept a big cat

120
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,620
in the palace back then.

121
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,580
That cat was so clever.

122
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,900
It didn't like anyone else, but me.

123
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,100
I always sneaked off to feed it.

124
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,580
But I was caught in the end.

125
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:42,780
Go

126
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,420
and bury this creature alive.

127
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,540
Yes, Your Majesty.

128
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,220
Mother, you cannot do this

129
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,340
unless you bury me too.

130
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,500
The more you protect it,
the faster it will die.

131
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,580
Remember.

132
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,980
As the Crown Prince,

133
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,940
you can't favor anything.

134
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,700
You must not let others know
what you like.

135
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,460
Moreover,

136
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,540
it is only a stray cat.

137
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,140
What are you waiting for?

138
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,300
Go and bury it.

139
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

140
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,740
No!

141
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,700
I can't even like anything.

142
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,540
What is the point
of being the Crown Prince?

143
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,420
What did you say?

144
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,460
You...

145
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,420
Rong, get up.

146
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,580
If you don't move aside,

147
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,900
I will beat you too!

148
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,500
Chuan. Chuan.

149
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,220
Mother, don't hit Rong.

150
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,420
I don't want the cat any more.

151
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,460
The cat was still buried alive
in the end.

152
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,700
That was because...

153
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,420
I didn't want you to be beaten
because of me anymore.

154
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,100
You came all the way here.

155
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,340
What is it that you want to ask me?

156
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,580
Have you thought about the future?

157
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,060
In the future...

158
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,540
What kind of emperor will you become
in the future?

159
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,540
I don't know.

160
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,260
Since I was little,
people always asked me about the future.

161
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,300
But I can't foresee it.

162
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,020
Rong.

163
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,820
To be honest,

164
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,700
I'm not suited to be an emperor.

165
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,540
I don't want to be an emperor either

166
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,660
I can only say that in this position,

167
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,900
I will do my best.

168
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,300
I want to be a good son
and a good brother

169
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,540
to protect you and Mother.

170
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,500
And then,

171
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,820
I want to be a good person,

172
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,180
doing everything I can

173
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:56,900
to ensure that every one
of the Great Xia

174
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,660
is well-fed, clothed,

175
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,900
and free from the ravages of war.

176
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,140
If there's something I want to do,

177
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,820
it's to go on an expedition
to the North.

178
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,540
An expedition to the North?

179
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,060
Rong, you have no idea.

180
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,940
Last year, I went to the North.

181
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,660
It was the first time
I saw war firsthand.

182
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,500
It is completely different

183
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,780
from reading war reports in Huajing.

184
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:21,780
When...

185
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,940
When I closed my eyes,

186
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,260
I could hear

187
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,500
the helpless screams
and pleas of the people.

188
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,540
Every time they saw me,

189
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,700
knowing I was the Crown Prince,

190
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,380
they would kneel and beg me

191
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,660
to send troops to pacify the North.

192
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,420
That's a good aspiration.

193
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,820
But what if it's fated

194
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,540
that one day

195
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,820
you will become an emperor like Father?

196
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,180
No.

197
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,420
You'll surpass him.

198
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,900
But

199
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,580
you will be as suspicious
and indifferent as he is.

200
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,820
You will kill many people,

201
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,540
plunging the world into turmoil.

202
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,820
Of course, you'll also succeed
in the northern expedition

203
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,500
and break free from the noble families.

204
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,420
Then, you'll imprison Mother,

205
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,900
kill Uncle,

206
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,180
execute your clansmen,

207
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,420
and finally poison me to death.

208
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,300
You will suffer the loss
of your beloved.

209
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,780
But you'll also become the noblest man
in the world.

210
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,660
If that day comes,

211
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,740
what should I do?

212
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,100
Rong, are you saying

213
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,020
that I will kill you?

214
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,220
I guess so.

215
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,460
Rong...

216
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,940
But that was just a dream.

217
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,660
Is it really just a dream?

218
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:10,940
It could also be...

219
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,420
the future.

220
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,300
My dreams...

221
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,380
seem to be in line with reality.

222
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:45,340
Every dream I've had before
has come true.

223
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,300
In that dream of mine...

224
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,580
you killed me.

225
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,340
Should I make you pay for it?

226
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,460
If

227
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,300
this is the future we must face,

228
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,100
then

229
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,220
please kill me now.

230
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,020
Do you think
I wouldn't dare to kill you?

231
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,860
It's not that you wouldn't dare.

232
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,380
But if I were to die by your hand,

233
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,180
I would have no regrets.

234
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,100
If I am truly destined for such a path

235
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,260
as you have said...

236
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,500
I would rather end my life now.

237
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,660
I consider it a fitting ending for me.

238
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,540
Forgive me.

239
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,740
It was I who forced Li Chuan to death
personally in the dream.

240
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,300
Qin Lin was killed by Cui Qinghe.

241
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,260
But I kept Xun Chuan in the Northwest.

242
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,820
The situation in the Northwest
is uncertain, so don't consider it.

243
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,060
Li Cheng is dead.

244
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,260
They arranged a fake Li Cheng

245
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,500
to deceive Father
and help him ascend the throne.

246
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,660
Su Rongqing may have
already secretly allied

247
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,980
with other noble families.

248
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,210
Outside Huajing,

249
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,100
the Su Family has ten thousand soldiers
at the closest pass.

250
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,100
They're able to arrive overnight.

251
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,740
Father may still allow you
to be Crown Prince,

252
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,500
but only if the Shangguan Family
and I are gone.

253
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,140
It all depends on you
whether to accept it or not.

254
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,860
All the forces
at the Inspectorate Office are yours

255
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,020
and so are those at Qingzhou.

256
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,100
I'll go back to Qingzhou.

257
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,820
In this life...

258
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,500
I won't return to Huajing.

259
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,340
Rong...

260
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,660
I've spared you.

261
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,420
If you stay alive...

262
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,020
I ask you to spare me...

263
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,220
in the future.

264
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,540
Do not let the dream become a reality.

265
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,180
Rong.

266
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,060
Why can't you

267
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,500
trust me more?

268
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,260
It is not that I do not trust you.

269
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,860
But rather that I cannot trust
people's hearts in this world.

270
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,780
Greetings, Your Majesty.

271
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,180
Cheng.

272
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:37,940
Cheng.

273
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,060
Are you feeling better?

274
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,700
Father, please don't kill me.

275
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,220
I will listen to you.

276
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,820
Cheng.

277
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,700
From today on,

278
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,460
I will grant you everything

279
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,820
that I promised you.

280
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,740
All you need to do
is focus on your recuperation.

281
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,180
Your Majesty,
Cheng has not fully recovered yet.

282
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,420
If you take good care of Cheng,

283
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,380
you will live.

284
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

285
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,780
I wish to return to Qingzhou.

286
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,020
All right.

287
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,380
You can stay in Huajing.

288
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:38,780
I know

289
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,780
he has always been an ideal ruler
in your mind.

290
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,660
With you assisting him,

291
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:44,900
I can rest assured

292
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,420
with you here.

293
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,500
That won't do.

294
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,540
Pei Wenxuan,

295
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,180
I don't want you
to sacrifice your future for me.

296
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,500
I do this for you,

297
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,700
my wife.

298
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,940
Of course, I do this

299
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,780
for our child too.

300
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,980
What are you doing?

301
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:09,820
Let's go back and celebrate.

302
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,140
No, wait. Put me down.

303
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:11,820
Stay still.

304
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,380
Don't hurt our child.

305
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,820
You did well just now.

306
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,020
Especially when you showed fear

307
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,660
and made him feel guilty.

308
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,980
Remember,

309
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,740
I am your mother.

310
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,260
You are my son, Cheng.

311
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,380
From now on,

312
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,580
you'll have endless glory and wealth.

313
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,580
Are you up to no good?

314
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,540
What could I do?

315
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,340
I only hope

316
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,500
that you won't let me

317
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,860
or our child affect your decisions

318
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,300
at the most crucial moment of your life.

319
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,980
You should know

320
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,420
what you truly desire.

321
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,940
You've been stubborn all your life.

322
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,940
It's time to stop.

323
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,220
Aren't you stubborn too?

324
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,700
When did you make peace with yourself?

325
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,620
Well...

326
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,820
I stopped being stubborn

327
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,780
when I admitted I liked you

328
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,300
and decided to take you back

329
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,340
from someone else's hands.

330
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,900
What do I have that's worth liking?

331
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,260
There's much more than you think.

332
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,940
Don't stand here. Sit down.

333
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:09,900
For instance?

334
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,980
You are like a mirror.

335
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,540
When I see you, I can clear my mind.

336
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,060
You say you care about power.

337
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,860
Yet you always treat Li Chuan
like a brother,

338
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,820
treat Shangguan Ya as a friend,

339
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,660
and even trust Su Rongqing.

340
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,940
You're loyal to the ruler

341
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,260
and your friends.

342
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,060
In the palace,

343
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,900
you always practice

344
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,940
the way of a noble person.

345
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,820
Actually,

346
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,340
what you do is much harder
than what I do.

347
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,620
I'm just following you.

348
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,180
But you walk forward alone.

349
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,420
My perseverance is bound by you,

350
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,020
while your perseverance
is to pursue your heart.

351
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,540
With your unwavering clarity
of mind for twenty years,

352
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:09,060
you can become the best monarch
in my heart.

353
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,500
If you put it that way,

354
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,140
I could contend for the throne

355
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,700
if I were a prince.

356
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,660
If you were a prince

357
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,140
and I were not a girl,

358
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,180
that would be a problem.

359
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,180
It's indeed hard to imagine

360
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,620
what you would be like
if you were a girl.

361
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,740
Little girl.

362
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,420
Who is a little girl? I am not a girl.

363
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,020
Your Majesty.

364
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,140
His Majesty said

365
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,540
he would grant
whatever Prince Su wanted.

366
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,580
What a deep father-son bond.

367
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,660
Send a message to Pingyue and Chuan.

368
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,460
We need to act now.

369
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,660
Everyone,

370
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,580
did you know

371
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,260
how our unit came to be?

372
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,100
You know

373
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,660
that Xiao Su cannot tolerate us

374
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,620
and the noble families
cannot tolerate us either.

375
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,820
It is the Crown Prince

376
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,100
and Princess Pingyue
who have secretly funded

377
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,900
and built our unit over the years.

378
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,180
Now,

379
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,780
they are in trouble in Huajing.

380
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,300
We cannot be ungrateful.

381
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,780
We are an army of righteousness.

382
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,500
What they seek

383
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,180
is for the welfare
of most ordinary people like us.

384
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,060
Among them

385
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,660
are your siblings.

386
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,540
Among them are your parents,
wives, and children.

387
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,820
Protecting them is equivalent

388
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,700
to protecting our own families!

389
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,540
Your Majesty.

390
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,260
Why aren't you taking care of Cheng?

391
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,980
What are you doing here?

392
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,220
Your Majesty,
Cheng has narrowly escaped death

393
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,260
and is now recovering.

394
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,380
Li Chuan's rebellious intentions
are evident.

395
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,900
After this incident,

396
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,660
I only wish for Cheng's safety.

397
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,300
I beg you to send someone to escort us
back to the Northwest.

398
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,460
We don't want anything else.

399
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,940
We only want to stay alive.

400
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,620
I have plans

401
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,780
for Cheng's future path.

402
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,460
You should go back

403
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,580
and accompany him.

404
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,860
I promise him

405
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,740
I'll give him an explanation.

406
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,100
Thank you, Your Majesty.

407
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,100
Fulai.

408
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

409
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,180
Convey a message to the Crown Prince.

410
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,860
Tell him to come and see me
at Xu hour tonight.

411
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,820
I want to give him one last chance
to choose.

412
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

413
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,020
You should take your time going
to Qingzhou.

414
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,820
If the road is too bumpy,

415
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,300
find a small town to rest.

416
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,300
Don't wear yourself out.

417
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,340
I know.

418
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,260
I'll handle the Crown Prince's affairs
in Huajing

419
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,540
and ensure everything goes well
before coming to you.

420
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,220
Since when have you become a nagger?

421
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,740
I am going to be a mother.

422
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,740
I will be careful.

423
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,060
If you can't bear to leave it behind,
take it with you.

424
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,300
It might come in handy later.

425
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,140
But the journey is long

426
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,940
and I'm afraid it might get damaged
along the way.

427
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:12,860
I will just leave it here.

428
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,540
You are right about that.

429
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,580
After all, you'll be back eventually.

430
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,100
Just take some personal items with you.

431
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,260
I'm not coming back to Huajing
after going to Qingzhou.

432
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,500
You know what I am like.

433
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,580
If I stay in Huajing,

434
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,980
I'll want to meddle in these affairs.

435
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,390
Over time,

436
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,820
it will still cause trouble.

437
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,780
I will bring it to you

438
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,620
and pack myself along too.

439
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,300
He's such a boring person.

440
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,460
His Majesty plans to summon
the Crown Prince to the palace.

441
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,740
Then

442
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,900
you need to manage to inform Chuan
and Shangguan Ya immediately.

443
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,740
In that case,

444
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,500
I have to leave the city today.

445
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,900
Tonight at Xu hour,

446
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,380
I will take action in the palace.

447
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,300
If we get the support of the Su Family,

448
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,580
the Su Family and Li Family
will rule the world together.

449
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,980
Consort Rou is really bold.

450
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,940
Prince Su is alive and doing fine.

451
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,700
Why is she looking for trouble again?

452
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,820
What about the others?

453
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:25,980
What are their responses?

454
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,860
Consort Rou has made promises
of great benefits to several families.

455
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,740
Princess Pingyue is now the Supervisor
of the Inspectorate Office.

456
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,340
But she has been delaying
the release of prisoners.

457
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,580
In the military drill ground,

458
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,500
the Crown Prince showed great concern
for Princess Pingyue,

459
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,100
which has disappointed
many noble families.

460
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,060
From your lobbying earlier

461
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,060
and Consort Rou's willingness
to spare no expense,

462
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,700
the consensus among various families...

463
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,420
is to ask you to lead
and oversee these matters.

464
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,260
A group of cunning old foxes.

465
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,980
Your Highness,
Miss Shangguan has arrived.

466
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,140
Your Highness.

467
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,540
Pack this up too.

468
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,820
Are you leaving just like this?

469
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,340
Didn't you say you were going
to overthrow the Crown Prince together?

470
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,140
I've heard

471
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,820
that you are pregnant.

472
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,500
I just found out.

473
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,860
They all say
pregnant women are irritable.

474
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,580
Forgive me.

475
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,540
I am sorry.

476
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,980
What I said before was my fault.

477
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,500
Please forgive me.

478
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,780
There was someone

479
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,340
whom I had grievances against.

480
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,340
We were friends before.

481
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,580
But she betrayed me for power.

482
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,620
So I thought of you and Su Ronghua,

483
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,060
which triggered me and lashed at you.

484
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,780
I've thought about the things you said
when I am back.

485
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,820
You may not do it on purpose.

486
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,060
But my actions were indeed
inappropriate.

487
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,580
I came here today to ask you a question.

488
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,060
Do you really think it's wrong for me

489
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:46,980
to give up on Su Ronghua?

490
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,500
Do you remember

491
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,580
why you gave up on being
the Crown Princess

492
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,260
and came to the Inspectorate Office?

493
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,500
Because you told me

494
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,100
that as a young lady of a noble family,

495
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,340
the most important thing
is to wield power in my hands.

496
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,860
It's just a man...

497
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,060
Why are you afraid
of being with someone you like?

498
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,660
I mean to say,

499
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,820
I used to think

500
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,060
love might be

501
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,100
the most worthless thing in the world.

502
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,340
But now, I feel like

503
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,200
it is a person's most basic choice.

504
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,860
It is inhumane to live in a world

505
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,540
where one cannot even choose
to be with someone they like.

506
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:30,980
Your Highness,

507
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,660
you always talk to me
about these crooked theories.

508
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,740
I've been influenced by you
in a bad way.

509
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,660
Isn't it good to be influenced by me?

510
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,780
At least,

511
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,100
the present you won't offer me
a poisoned drink.

512
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,980
You sounded like
I've actually poisoned you before.

513
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,540
Enough said.

514
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,860
It is getting late.

515
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,500
You are pregnant.

516
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,260
Given the current situation,

517
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,100
you really should not stay in Huajing.

518
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:57,900
Get ready quickly.

519
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,100
I'll leave now.

520
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,300
Go.

521
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,820
Your Highness,
Xun Chuan sent me a letter.

522
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,820
She said she would return soon.

523
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,380
I will wait for your return here.

524
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,740
When the time comes,

525
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,660
the three of us
will drink together again.

526
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:25,860
All right.

527
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,140
Young Master.

528
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,900
The matter you requested
has been thoroughly investigated.

529
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,180
Our informant sent a message.

530
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,420
[Pei Lixian is the mastermind
behind the death of your father.]

531
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,980
I didn't expect Second Uncle

532
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,900
to be so evil.

533
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,340
Count our men.

534
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,860
Notify the uncles and cousins.

535
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:50,820
Tell them that I need

536
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,340
to acquire

537
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:53,740
the patriarch token

538
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,380
during today's ancestral hall assembly.

539
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,580
Yes, Young Master.

540
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,340
It's time to settle everything.

541
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,260
Your Highness,

542
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,820
Xun Chuan has brought
ten thousand soldiers and horses.

543
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,020
She is on her way now.

544
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,620
She sent someone to tell you

545
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,980
that she has not failed

546
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,660
your mission.

547
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,380
I really didn't expect

548
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,460
Xun Chuan to achieve this.

549
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,100
I don't know why.

550
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,100
But I'm quite moved.

551
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,300
Don't be too moved yet.

552
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,780
I'll count the troops first.

553
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,500
Today, the Crown Prince must enter
the palace.

554
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,900
The Shangguan Family
will attack the palace.

555
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,180
My family and the Inspectorate Office
will block reinforcements outside.

556
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:35,940
I won't...

557
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,620
see you off.

558
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,540
It's fine.

559
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:41,940
I'll go by myself.

560
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:50,780
Your Highness.

561
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,940
If I die

562
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,260
in the palace today,

563
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,340
what will you do?

564
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,460
If you die in Huajing,

565
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,340
I will gather the troops

566
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:11,980
and destroy them.

567
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,260
Do you understand, Mr. Pei?

568
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,900
Your Highness, I am very happy

569
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,900
to hear you say that.

570
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,620
I love you more than my life.

571
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,660
Wait for me.

572
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,020
I will light up the city

573
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,780
and give you lots of betrothal presents.

574
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,580
I will marry you again

575
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,740
with a grand procession.

576
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:51,780
All right.

577
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:53,940
I will wait for you.

578
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,180
I'm leaving now.

579
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,220
Go.

580
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,060
Father.

581
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,060
Did you know

582
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,620
why I called you here?

583
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,020
I know.

584
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,380
Ronghua has told me everything

585
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,260
about what you are doing.

586
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,660
You have always been

587
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,140
a sensible child in the past.

588
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,620
I cannot understand

589
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,700
why you are not even
as sensible as Ronghua.

590
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:03,220
I entrusted the entire Su Family to you

591
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,700
because you have always been prudent.

592
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,380
But you...

593
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,220
As the eldest legitimate son
in the palace,

594
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,100
the Crown Prince is the rightful heir
by seniority and legitimacy.

595
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,860
His temperament
and conduct are impeccable.

596
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,020
But what is Consort Rou's background?

597
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,060
And what kind of temperament
Prince Su possesses?

598
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,500
What are you even doing?

599
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,420
Before,

600
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,860
I noticed something amiss
in the disagreement

601
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,140
between you and Pei Wenxuan
in the court.

602
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,460
But at the time,

603
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,060
I thought you were just young
and impulsive.

604
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,540
I'm aware of your feelings
for Her Highness.

605
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,260
But she is married now.

606
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,860
What more can you do?

607
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,460
Father.

608
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,020
You've spent three years in the academy

609
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,660
and taken part in exams annually.

610
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,780
As long as Her Highness is there,

611
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,220
you always present yourself.

612
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,660
Every time you enter the palace,

613
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,380
you dress meticulously.

614
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,580
I have seen it all.

615
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,220
Rongqing.

616
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,060
I am your father.

617
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,900
A father knows his child best.

618
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,100
But you and Her Highness
really are not suitable.

619
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,340
Before, I thought

620
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,620
you wouldn't do anything out of line.

621
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,900
So I did not intervene.

622
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:30,820
But you...

623
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,420
What has got into you?

624
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,740
Now I really can't understand you.

625
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,140
I have failed...

626
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,620
your teaching.

627
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,980
I just thought...

628
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,260
Li Chuan was not suitable

629
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,460
to be an emperor.

630
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,940
Is Prince Su suitable, then?

631
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,660
Is there a perfect monarch
in this world?

632
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,580
A monarch is the pillar of the state.

633
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,580
It is not necessary to be strong,
but stable.

634
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,620
But he is not stable.

635
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,740
Everything Her Highness does

636
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,900
is at the Crown Prince's instructions.

637
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,540
A monarch should be stable
and the ministers should be talented.

638
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:26,140
Prince Su's temperament may be bad

639
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,340
and his background may be questionable.

640
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,300
But he won't cause upheaval.

641
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,660
But what about the Crown Prince?

642
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,580
Even before ascending,

643
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,980
he has turned the court upside down.

644
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,180
If he ascends,

645
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:42,020
who can control him?

646
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,140
This is not
something you should worry about.

647
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,420
If I do not worry,

648
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:55,340
the Su Family will face calamity.

649
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,740
All of this is nothing
but your speculation.

650
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,020
Father.

651
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,980
I want to help Li Cheng
ascend the throne.

652
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,500
What did you say?

653
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,820
I would like to ask for your opinion.

654
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,020
Impossible!

655
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,620
Don't even think about it!

656
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,540
Get out! Get out now!

657
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,980
Go and take your punishment.

658
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,700
The Su Family is so noble.

659
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,980
