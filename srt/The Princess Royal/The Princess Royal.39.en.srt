[Adapted from Mo Shu Bai's novel,
The Princess Royal on jjwxc.net]

00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 39]

5
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,100
Your Highness, did His Majesty
give this jade seal to you?

6
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,980
Why the sudden sigh of relief?

7
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,660
I am naturally happy for His Majesty.

8
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,740
If His Majesty has entrusted
this jade seal to you,

9
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,900
it means

10
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,460
His Majesty has let go of some concerns.

11
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,180
How so?

12
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,580
Actually...

13
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,140
His Majesty has always cared for you.

14
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,940
Though he hasn't shown

15
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,660
his feelings that much,

16
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,460
it has always been there.

17
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,180
He's always cared for you as a father.

18
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,180
Your Highness,
this was just written by His Majesty.

19
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,060
He ordered me to give it to you.

20
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:12,920
[Princess Pingyue,
Li Rong, will be Regent Princess Royal.]

21
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,060
What does he mean by this?

22
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,700
He trusts me?

23
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,700
Your Highness.

24
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,820
If it were any other day,

25
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,500
His Majesty wouldn't
naturally trust you.

26
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,180
But perhaps His Majesty is willing

27
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,020
to trust the current you a bit.

28
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,260
Who

29
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,580
are you siding with?

30
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,420
Your Highness,

31
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,180
I am naturally loyal to His Majesty.

32
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,940
But if there are words that benefit you,

33
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,140
I will naturally tell you.

34
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,740
I want to be alone for a while.

35
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,460
Yes, Your Highness.

36
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,860
I shall take my leave.

37
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,060
It is quite high.

38
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,740
It is also a little cold.

39
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,520
[Changhe Gate]

40
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,060
They have concentrated their forces
in the inner palace.

41
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,140
It seems they intend
to start a battle in the inner palace.

42
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,140
Your Highness.

43
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:25,860
Mr. Su,

44
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,260
we shall be counting on you today.

45
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,060
Rest assured, Your Highness.

46
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,860
As long as the Xiao Family's troops are
at our disposal.

47
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,980
Mr. Su,

48
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,660
as long as you ensure
the throne belongs to Prince Su,

49
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,740
the Xiao Family's troops will
follow your orders.

50
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,380
[Taiji Hall]

51
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,340
Kneel.

52
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,740
Li Rong, what are you doing?

53
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,980
Are you mad?

54
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,380
Father is seriously ill.

55
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,420
The Crown Prince is still injured.

56
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,140
Therefore, I am appointed as Regent.

57
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,420
Fulai,

58
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,580
announce the imperial decree.

59
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,940
Yes, Your Highness.

60
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,540
"I have recently fallen ill,
with my limbs failing. The Crown Prince

61
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,300
is still recovering from injuries
he got during the Winter Festivity..."

62
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,300
Charge!

63
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,420
"But the country cannot be
without a ruler for a day.

64
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,660
Princess Pingyue, Li Rong,

65
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,820
known for her virtue
and adeptness in court affairs,

66
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,700
is appointed as Regent Princess Royal

to oversee the state affairs
in my stead.

68
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,300
Treat her as you would treat me."

69
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,860
Respected officials,
the decree has been announced.

70
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,340
Please pay your respects.

71
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,140
Why are you standing there?

72
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,660
Go and take her down.

73
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,380
Your Highness, calm down.

74
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,180
You didn't kneel when hearing
the decree. Are you rebelling?

75
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,460
Last night there was a palace coup.
Without seeing His Majesty,

76
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,180
I dare not kneel.

77
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,900
Why not?

78
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,540
I'm afraid of kneeling to a traitor
and dishonoring His Majesty.

79
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,900
The Crown Prince, Li Chuan,

80
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,900
brazenly led troops to surround
the Imperial Palace last night,

81
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,180
deceiving you
and holding His Majesty hostage.

82
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,460
I have come to His Majesty's rescue.

83
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,620
Please do not interfere, Your Highness.

84
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,700
Someone,

85
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,140
Her Highness is startled.

86
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,220
Bring her to take some rest.

87
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,060
Insolence!

88
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,220
The Crown Prince never entered
the palace last night.

89
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,220
His Majesty is currently safe and sound.

90
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,740
You all are committing
the crime of treason

91
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,340
by forcibly attacking the city.

92
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,060
Withdraw and accept your punishment!

93
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,820
The Crown Prince was not
in the palace last night?

94
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,460
The Crown Prince went out of the city
to recuperate from injuries.

95
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,740
Therefore,
I was ordered to act as Regent.

96
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,260
Everyone, your whole families and clans

97
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,940
will be eliminated
if you plot against His Majesty.

98
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,180
We may not pursue this crime today.

99
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,780
But you will be punished one day.

100
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,580
Li Chuan is not in the palace now.

101
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,020
His Majesty is even still alive.

102
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,460
Could our attack

103
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,140
on the Imperial Palace be ridiculous?

104
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,380
The charge of killing the Emperor

105
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,700
is questionable

106
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,780
when power is at its peak.

107
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,260
If power diminishes one day...

108
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:02,700
Mother.

109
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,700
it becomes the cause
of one's family's annihilation.

110
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,180
Everyone,

111
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,540
I wish to speak
with Princess Pingyue in private.

112
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,300
Could you make a room for us?

113
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,500
Since you have matters
to discuss with Princess Pingyue,

114
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,300
we won't disturb you.

115
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,060
Everyone,

116
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,260
let's wait outside.

117
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,060
Cheng.

118
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,780
Your Highness.

119
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,300
Your Highness, Su Rongqing is,
after all, a man.

120
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,780
What if he harbors ill intentions

121
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,020
towards you...

122
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,300
Prepare a pot of tea. And you may leave.

123
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,260
Yes, Your Highness.

124
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,180
Rou, the Crown Prince didn't
make his move.

125
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,940
Now these noble families may have
a change of heart.

126
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:05,820
No, they won't.

127
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,140
Once troops enter the palace,

128
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,660
no one can escape.

129
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,380
Mr. Su is inside

130
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,020
to buy us time to act.

131
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:16,900
Your Highness.

132
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,540
It seems there has been
a misunderstanding.

133
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,420
Since His Majesty is unharmed,

134
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,300
the Crown Prince may not be rebelling.

135
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,140
So we just discussed

136
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,140
that everyone should

137
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,260
dismiss.

138
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,660
If there is indeed a misunderstanding,

139
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,300
we naturally should withdraw,

140
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,660
admit our error,
and ask for punishment from His Majesty.

141
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,570
But we haven't seen His Majesty.

142
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,540
We don't know
if what Pingyue said is true.

143
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,580
Now that we are in the palace,

144
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,660
why not let me go to Hanqiu Palace

145
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,660
to find out whether His Majesty is safe

146
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,060
or has met with misfortune.

147
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,420
What do you think, Mr. Gu?

148
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,780
Confirming His Majesty's safety
is indeed necessary.

149
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,300
We will assist you
in entering Hanqiu Palace.

150
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,580
Thank you.

151
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,700
Qian, guard the palace gate.

152
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,180
Prevent unauthorized entry and exit.

153
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,300
Yes, Your Highness.

154
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,300
Follow me.

155
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:19,780
Mother.

156
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,500
What do we do if Father is still alive?

157
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,540
He won't be alive.

158
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,020
Once we see him,

159
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,260
we'll fabricate that he has
already been killed by Li Chuan.

160
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,580
What are you trying to do?

161
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,380
The Gu Family is not involved.

162
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,580
We do not know anything.

163
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,220
We really don't know anything.

164
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,860
You'd better watch your manners

165
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,900
or else the Su Family's master
won't let you off.

166
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,140
Everyone, calm down.

167
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,260
As long as you cooperate,

168
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,300
we will not give you a hard time.

169
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,100
Let us go now.

170
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,060
Don't use any violence.

171
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,100
Close the door.

172
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,940
Let us go!

173
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,500
Young Master,

174
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,260
the Su and Gu Families' relatives are
all inside.

175
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,420
What about the Wang Family?

176
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,660
They haven't been breached.

177
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,580
Did anyone escape?

178
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,900
The Wang Family has closed their doors
and no one has come out.

179
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,060
What about the situation at the palace?

180
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,900
The palace gate has
already been breached.

181
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,260
Troops from the Su and Xiao Families
and several other noble families

182
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,580
have entered the Imperial Palace.

183
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,420
Su Rongqing,

184
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,140
along with Gu Zidao, Wang Dunmin,
and others,

185
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,140
have also entered.

186
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,180
It's said the morning court
has not been canceled.

187
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,500
How long did it take
to breach the palace gate?

188
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,940
Less than an hour.

189
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,900
They breached the Imperial City
in less than an hour?

190
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,300
It seems Li Rong didn't deploy defenses
outside the city

191
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,060
but withdrew all forces back
to the inner palace.

192
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,300
Given her temperament, such a move

193
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,980
only signifies one thing.

194
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,660
His Majesty isn't dead at all.

195
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,300
If so, the Princess withdrew

196
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,020
the troops back to the inner palace

197
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,020
to safeguard them.

198
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,260
She's waiting for the Crown Prince

199
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,020
to have a chance to coordinate with her

200
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,220
to launch a counterattack.

201
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,220
She is buying time for us.

202
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,020
Yes.

203
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,460
We can win this.

204
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,940
And we must win.

205
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,060
Mr. Pei, Xun Chuan's troops have arrived

206
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,140
and are going to attack the city.

207
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,020
Yuan Feiyu,

208
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,100
immediately take a thousand soldiers
to the city tower

209
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,900
and coordinate with Xun Chuan
to open the city gate.

210
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,580
You must act fast.

211
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,060
Also, inform Pei Xiao

212
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,020
that after taking the Wang Family's
relatives to the Princess's Mansion,

213
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,060
guard the Princess's Mansion.

214
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:21,980
Await my orders.

215
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:22,940
Yes.

216
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,060
Tong Ye,

217
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,060
release all sky lanterns in the mansion.

218
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,340
The Crown Prince will understand
my message.

219
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:27,980
Yes.

220
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:28,900
Also,

221
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,340
prepare incense and water
and get the carriage ready.

222
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,740
I'm going into the palace.

223
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,180
Young Master, you are...

224
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,820
I'm going to fetch Her Highness.

225
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,700
Your Highness!

226
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,860
Shangguan Ya entrusted me

227
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,340
to come here to fetch you.

228
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,220
Her Majesty has been safely sent

229
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,660
to the camp by Shangguan Ya
and Lin Feibai,

230
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,620
with strong guards ensuring her safety.

231
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,260
You don't need to worry.

232
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,420
It has been a while. How are you?

233
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,860
With it here,

234
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,820
I'm fine.

235
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,340
I'll take this mask from you.

236
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,220
Rong has been completely exonerated
for the Qin Family.

237
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,820
You no longer need it.

238
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,420
She specifically instructed me

239
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,780
that Huajing is your home.

240
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,550
You should return openly

241
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,060
without needing to hide anymore.

242
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,740
Hongyu has finally returned

243
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,100
to Zhilan's side riding the wind.

244
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,300
Today is the time

245
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,380
for these two swords
to fulfill their mission.

246
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,500
Let's go and join Shangguan Ya

247
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,700
and the fellow soldiers

248
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,740
to attack the city together.

249
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,900
Prepare for battle.

250
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,300
Let's return home safely together.

251
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,900
It's been a long time
since I brewed tea for you.

252
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,900
It's a pity your favorite,
Yinjian tea, isn't available today.

253
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,820
It's a pity.

254
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,660
Did you intentionally separate us
from the others

255
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,660
just to catch up with me?

256
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,180
There are several questions
I naturally want to ask you.

257
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,060
Your Highness,

258
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,900
is it still comfortable up there?

259
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,980
What do you mean?

260
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,820
You know...

261
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,340
that I only want to stop Li Chuan.

262
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,140
Since you are
the Regent Princess Royal now,

263
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,260
is it necessary for Li Chuan
to be the Crown Prince?

264
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:51,940
Your Highness,

265
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,540
I did not come for revenge.

266
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,460
Li Chuan can live.

267
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,060
But he cannot live
under his own identity.

268
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,180
As the Regent Princess Royal,

269
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,580
once Li Cheng ascends the throne,

270
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,820
you can convict Li Chuan
of plotting a rebellion

271
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,860
and ask him to live
under a different identity.

272
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,220
I remember the first time I met you.

273
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,700
It was in the Imperial Study.

274
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,860
You and Chancellor Su knelt together
at the door of the Imperial Study

275
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,780
to dissuade my father
from the Northern expedition.

276
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,820
You said

277
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,180
that members of the Su Family

278
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,940
devote all their lives
to the people and the state.

279
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,700
Then, let me ask you,

280
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,020
are the nobble families today

281
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,300
a good thing or a bad thing

282
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,700
for the people?

283
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,620
The Northern expedition
back then was indeed an impulsive move.

284
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,180
But back then, if it wasn't

285
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,780
for the exploitation and corruption
by the noble families,

286
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,820
the military provisions and funds would
have been enough for the expedition.

287
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,380
The southern floods were indeed caused
by the Northern expedition,

288
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,540
which depleted the national treasury.

289
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,580
But if it wasn't for the prosperity
of the noble families

290
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,900
and their exemption from taxes,

291
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,460
allowing local officials backed up
by the noble families

292
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,460
to evade taxes,

293
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,620
the treasury wouldn't
have been so empty.

294
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,860
You said that as an emperor,

295
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,860
Li Chuan shouldn't
exclusively favor one woman.

296
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,900
But Su Rongqing,

297
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,780
if you truly love someone,

298
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,020
wouldn't you feel hurt

299
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,420
being with someone else?

300
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,180
But he is a ruler.

301
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,300
All pain must be endured.

302
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,900
Even so, it must be meaningful.

303
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,380
If his endurance
pleases the noble families

304
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,460
rather than the people,

305
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,780
what's the point?

306
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,100
You've always blamed everything
on Li Chuan.

307
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,540
But today's situation isn't solely

308
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,940
one person's fault.

309
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,220
According to you,

310
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,100
is it all the fault
of the noble families?

311
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,220
But are there no corrupt
and greedy people

312
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,140
among the commoners?

313
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,980
Are there no factional struggles
among them?

314
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,500
This is human nature.

315
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,940
What does it have to do
with the noble families?

316
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,780
You all say
that the noble families are at fault.

317
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,460
During years of disasters,

318
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,860
the Su Family provided relief.

319
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,740
The Su Family's descendants fought
on the battlefield during times of war.

320
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,980
What did the Su Family do wrong?

321
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,500
You said that in the harem struggles,
Li Chuan was not at fault.

322
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,060
Does that mean Shangguan Ya is wrong?

323
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,140
Does that mean
my elder brother is wrong?

324
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,780
Their entire lives had been ruined
in this palace.

325
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,500
Li Chuan treated them like this

326
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,940
just for his own selfish desires.

327
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,820
Why can Li Chuan act willfully

328
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,580
while they have to live in despair
for a lifetime?

329
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,020
Just because they are not the Emperor?

330
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,780
Your Highness.

331
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,940
If the noble families are at fault,

332
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:08,020
does the imperial family have no guilt?

333
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,700
But who exactly brought them
into the palace?

334
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,540
Actually, you just don't want
to admit it.

335
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,940
We were born sinful.

336
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,580
How can there be such a thing
as being born sinful?

337
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,460
Good or evil,

338
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,260
crime or punishment,

339
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,060
it depends on what one person does.

340
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,220
The Su Family, a prestigious family
for a hundred years...

341
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,740
What is your so-called
prestigious family

342
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,860
based on?

343
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,060
People in the world love fox fur coats.

344
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,500
But foxes wouldn't appreciate it.

345
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,580
They only give a little food to the fox

346
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,100
and claim they're doing it a favor.

347
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,780
That's a lie.

348
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,540
Let's not deceive ourselves
or others anymore.

349
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,060
I understand your stubbornness.

350
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,860
Your heart is with the light,

351
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,860
yet you dwell in darkness.

352
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,060
You refuse to acknowledge your identity,

353
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,380
so you can only distort the truth.

354
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,540
Rongqing.

355
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,740
I also went through so much
to finally understand

356
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,220
that my whole life should be dedicated

357
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,820
to my righteousness.

358
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,300

359
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,340

we found the Princess.

The Crown Prince is leading an attack
on the city.

403
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,220
Your Highness.

404
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:50,820
Mr. Su.

405
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,260
Li Chuan's men have
already started attacking the city

406
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,300
before we manage
to take over the palace.

407
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,260
What should we do now?

408
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,580
Someone! Tie Li Rong up

409
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,620
and hang her up at the city gate.

410
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,100
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

411
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,780
Stop!

412
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,660
Mr. Wang.

413
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,100
She is Princess Pingyue.

Su Rongqing,

415
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,260
at a time like this,

416
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,820
do you still want to engage
in these romantic pursuits?

417
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,660
Do not forget.

418
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,060
It was you who urged us
to collaborate with Consort Rou.

419
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,660
If we fail this time,

420
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,660
both our families and clans
will be executed.

421
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,740
Do not lose your senses.

422
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,540
Mr. Wang, there is no need to be angry.

423
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,180
I will go with you.

424
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:27,980
Your Highness.

425
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,940
The enemy soldiers are nearly occupying
the Imperial City.

426
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,380
Consort Rou has led
the Xiao Family's troops

427
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,780
to the inner palace.

428
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,220
We are outnumbered.

429
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,100
So we are not their match.

430
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,140
So long as we are still alive,

431
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,620
we've still got a chance to win.

432
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,340
Your Highness, we are willing to die...

433
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,260
Yes, Your Highness.

434
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,460
Your Highness,

435
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,660
do not go outside.

436
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,100
Li Chuan won't give up
on attacking the city now.

437
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,100
He doesn't have many troops.

438
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,380
He can't spare anyone to rescue you.

439
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,420
If you become their hostage,

440
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,940
you will definitely die.

441
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,540

442
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,060

443
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,820
I do not want to owe you.

00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,220

you refuse to take it

00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,180
Everyone,

518
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,500
speak frankly.

519
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,820
The reason the Crown Prince
left the palace earlier today

520
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,500
and I have held
your families hostages

521
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,700
is because someone leaked your plans

522
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,060
to me beforehand.

523
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:03,900

524
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,460
Su Ronghua,
the young master of the Su Family.

525
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,460
Pei Wenxuan.

526
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,900
You're lying.

527
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,180
Am I lying?

528
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,980
The Su Family is a noble clan.

529
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,540
For a hundred years,
they've never meddled in royal disputes.

530
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,820
Would he participate in such things?

531
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,060
Everyone,

532
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,380
do you really believe
Su Rongqing can represent

533
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,500
the Su Family?

534
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,580
He absolutely cannot.

535
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,300
You're struggling in desperation

536
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,500

537
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,100

539
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,740
Su Rongqing poisoned Mr. Su
and obtained the patriarch token.

540
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,260
Su Ronghua hurried
to Tianshou Pass overnight

541
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,660
and persuaded the Su Family's general

542
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:50,820
to assist the Crown Prince in clearing
out the rebels to show loyalty.

543
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,380
Today's rebellion

544
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,580
is only Su Rongqing's intention alone.

545
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:56,900
Everyone,

546
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,580
do you really want
to risk the entire clan's lives

547
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,540
to listen to him?

548
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,660
Why don't you listen

549
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,540
to me?

550
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,980
Surrendering now is still possible.

551
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,860
How do we surrender?
Withdraw from the palace?

552
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,020
If by simply withdrawing
from the palace can avoid punishment,

553
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,020
won't everyone in the world follow suit?

554
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,580
So, what are you suggesting?

555
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,860
Consort Rou previously issued an edict,

556
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,660
which was also His Majesty's wish.

557
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,780
I think,

558
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,580
why don't you follow
His Majesty's wishes

559
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,740
to pay taxes and tribute

560
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,220
and completely abolish
the system of Royal Selection,

561
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,700
relying only on the imperial examination
to select officials?

562
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,460
This would also give
His Majesty a way out,

563
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,700
not punishing all of you.

564
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,260
Wouldn't everyone be happy, then?

565
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,460
Mr. Su, earlier you said

566
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,580
Consort Rou was deceived

567
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,900
by the Crown Prince
and Pei Wenxuan's plot.

568
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,420
I have always harbored doubts.

569
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,620
Now it seems

570
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,780
you have a sharp and cunning foresight,

571
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,340
with deep and far-reaching plans.

572
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,460
Pei Wenxuan,

573
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,780
you are indeed eloquent.

574
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,100
Mr. Su,

575
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,100
what exactly is
the Su Family's stance?

576
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,700
Shouldn't you clarify?

577
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,820
My brother did not flee overnight

578
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,740
as Pei Wenxuan claimed.

579
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,260
On the contrary,

580
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,540
he is currently on his way
with troops to support us.

581
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,340
What is the Su Family's stance?

582
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,980
Have you all not known this
after so many years?

583
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,180
Instead of listening
to his one-sided words here,

584
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,780
why not go out of the city gates
to see what's going on?

585
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,060
I will stay here

586
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,980
and meet everyone
after obtaining the posthumous decree.

587
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,140
By then,

588
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,500
I will surely give you all
a satisfactory explanation.

589
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,260
That would be ideal.

590
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,180
Let's go.

591
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,740
Someone!

592
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,220
Take Pei Wenxuan down!

593
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:54,900
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

594
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,180
I dare you!

595
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,500
Believe it when I say this.

596
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,420
If Her Highness and I perish here,

597
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,380
I'll have you all buried

598
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,050
with us.

599
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,620
You won't ignite the fireworks

600
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,780
in your hands.

601
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,540
Is that so?

602
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,060
Because you're not that kind of person.

603
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,900
Well, you've misjudged me.

604
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,140
For Her Highness,

605
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,660
I can do anything.

606
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,380
You have family.

607
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,180
So do I.

608
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:31,940
All right.

609
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,100
Please keep your word, then.

610
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:37,860
Attack!

611
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,580
Protect Her Highness!

612
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,300
Pei Wenxuan.

613
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,860
Pei Wenxuan, let me out!

614
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:56,740
Pei Wenxuan!

615
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,040
Su Rongqing!

616
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,700
Su Rongqing, stop this madness!

617
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,580
Su Rongqing,

618
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,740
the Su Family troops won't come.

619
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:03,980
Stop now.

620
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,260
I can spare your life.

621
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:05,860
Your Highness.

622
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,300
Please remember what I said.

623
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,100
As long as Li Chuan doesn't
ascend the throne,

624
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,380
the posthumous decree
will never be presented.

625
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,420
If Li Chuan does ascend the throne,
he will surely reform.

626
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,180
Your Highness, stay still

627
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,180
and avoid getting hurt
from this conflict.

628
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,060
When I speak of reform,

629
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,500
it is for the stability of the nation
to prevent unrest.

630
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,900
But if you support
Prince Su's ascension,

631
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,660
the chaos in the Great Xia
will never cease.

632
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,220
Your Highness, you must not reform.

633
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,060
Your Highness,

634
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,580
as long as you reform,

635
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,700
there will be thousands of people
like me in this world.

636
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,580
Su Rongqing.

637
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,140
Do you know what you're doing?

638
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,940
You are the root of chaos
in the Great Xia.

639
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,860
You are the evilest one in this world.

640
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,420
You can still turn back.

641
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,180
You just...

642
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,940
You just can't face it.

643
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,300
The past is the past
and a new life is a new life.

644
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,670
Why do you keep dwelling on the past?

645
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:08,980
Su Rongqing.

646
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,020
This is a new world now.

647
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,460
I am the new Li Rong.

648
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,700
Why can't you be

649
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,980
the new Su Rongqing?

650
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,100
Su Rongqing.

651
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,620
Pei Wenxuan!

652
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,540
Pei Wenxuan will be fine.

653
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,820
He will live well.

654
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,260
He will definitely live well.

655
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,060
Everyone,

656
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,500
what are you doing?

657
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,260
General Xiao,

658
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,860
we only need
to get the posthumous decree now.

659
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,420
We would like to return home first
to check on our families.

660
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,980
After Mr. Su gets the posthumous decree,

661
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,620
we'll meet again.

662
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,180
I think you are abandoning my sister

663
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,460
and running off yourself.

664
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,620
What are you saying?

665
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:53,940
If you're sincere,

666
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,060
then you should live and die
together with us.

667
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,620
You mean to say

668
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,660
that you plan to imprison us
in the palace

669
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,100
and tie us together with Consort Rou?

670
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:03,820
Yes!

671
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,460
If you want to leave today,

672
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,780
there are only two ways.

673
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,620
Leave with the Xiao Family alive

674
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,500
or be carried out from here as corpses.

675
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,100
You should know what is good for you.

676
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,020
I don't believe he dares kill anyone.

677
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:19,860
Charge!

678
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,460
I dare!

679
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,260
Report!

680
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,020
Ms. Shangguan,

681
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,420
a large number of troops are coming.

682
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,860
Could it be reinforcements
from the Wang Family?

683
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,060
Shouldn't we withdraw first?

684
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:29,740
No,

685
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,300
those who retreat will be executed.

686
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,340
Prepare to fight.

687
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,020
Yes!

688
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:46,780
Don't worry.

689
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,980
I've already explained it to my cousin.

690
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,580
I'll lead the troops to reinforce first.

691
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,700
He'll inform the family
to let Qin Lin through.

692
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,230
[Taiji Hall]

693
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:16,780
Your Highness.

694
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:17,820
Where is Rong?

695
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,220
Please rest assured.
Her Highness is all right.

696
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,540
I will go and check on her.

697
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,500
Guard here.

698
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,140
Yes, sir.

699
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,700
