[Adapted from Mo Shubai's novel,
The Princess Royal]

[Episode 2]

00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,620
[Yang]

7
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,340
[Cui]
Young Master Zhang, you are here too.

8
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,820
It's really been a while.

9
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,460
I've heard that the princess
is using the Spring Banquet as a pretext

10
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,940
for selecting a husband.

11
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,700
No wonder my young master

12
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,020
is paying so much attention
to his appearance today.

13
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,580
It's the Su Family's carriage.

14
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,700
It's Second Young Master Su's carriage.

15
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,380
The Su Family's carriage?

16
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,260
It's said he's strikingly handsome
and extraordinarily charming.

17
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,740
[Su]
We'll get to feast our eyes this time.

18
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,980
He is Second Young Master
of the Su Family,

19
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,340
the second most prominent family
in the capital.

20
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,250
[Pei]

21
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,860
Is this the Su Family's carriage?

22
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,940
Yes, it is.

23
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,060
Second Young Master Su

24
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,020
is indeed handsome
and has an extraordinary temperament.

25
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,500
Please come down.

26
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,620
How do I look?

27
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,780
You look great.

28
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,340
- Young Master Su.
- Young Master Su.

29
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,420
Greetings, everyone.

30
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,620
- Greetings, Young Master Su.
- Greetings, Young Master Su.

31
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,300
Greetings.

32
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,740
Why is he here?

33
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,180
Look at his appearance, temperament,

34
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,580
and that carriage.

35
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,380
He truly is the finest Young Master
in the world.

36
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,460
The finest Young Master in the world?

37
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,140
He's nothing.

38
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,050
[Tong Meng]

39
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,660
Your Highness.

40
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,980
Your Highness, wake up.

41
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,540
All the young masters have arrived.

42
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,060
Ask them to wait.

43
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,580
I want to sleep a little longer.

44
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,740
Second Young Master of the Su Family,

45
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,780
Su Rongqing, has also arrived.

46
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,780
Su Rongqing?

47
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,540
The Su Family has not provided
a definite response.

48
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,980
I thought he might not come.

49
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,700
Since it's an invitation
from Your Highness,

50
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,940
of course, those young masters
will show some respect.

51
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,500
Hurry up

52
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,020
and help me get dressed.

53
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:11,660
Also,

54
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,980
keep a close eye on everything today.

55
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,300
This Spring Banquet
isn't just held for me.

56
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,180
Many people are eagerly waiting
to see what unfolds.

57
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,060
Please rest assured.

58
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,180
Hurry.

59
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,540
Please wait here, Young Master.

60
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:30,900
It's okay.

61
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,740
I will wait here for Her Highness.

62
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:34,900
Yes.

63
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,500
Rongqing.

64
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,060
Back then, you were eighteen

65
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,540
and I was twenty.

66
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,460
That year

67
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,340
is the most beautiful memory of my life.

68
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,740
From this day forth,

69
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,060
Su Rongqing is an honored guest
of the Princess's Mansion

70
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,900
and should be treated accordingly.

71
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,460
Since we are seemingly in harmony
but actually at variance,

72
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,820
let's set each other free.

73
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,940
We should request an audience
with His Majesty

74
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,380
and seek his permission
for our divorce.

75
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,740
Your best ally can only be me.

76
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,700
You want a divorce?

77
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,540
Only if I die.

78
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,060
If this is a dream,

79
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,460
then what has changed

80
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,220
and what hasn't?

81
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,140
Previously, there was no Su Rongqing

82
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,700
among the candidates
for the Prince Consort.

83
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,340
Greetings, Your Highness.

84
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,020
Greetings, Your Highness.

85
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,620
Rumor has it you are
the finest young master in Huajing.

86
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,180
As I've seen for myself,

87
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,500
you truly deserve the reputation.

88
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,620
Your Highness, I'm flattered.

89
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,860
I appreciate the flattering words,

90
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,700
but it's all just playful banter.

91
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,420
How is it just banter?

92
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,580
Upon meeting you today,

93
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,340
I've found that you have
an extraordinary temperament.

94
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,260
I don't think there's no one else
in Huajing who deserves the reputation

95
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,260
of the finest
young master other than you.

96
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,620
You didn't reply to me

97
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,860
which made me think you wouldn't come.

98
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,820
I'm honored

99
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,740
to receive your invitation,
Your Highness.

100
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,540
It's just that I was hesitant.

101
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,180
He mentioned hesitancy.

102
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:17,900
So,

103
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,940
by this time,
Rongqing is already...?

104
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,700
I was worried that I might disturb you,
Your Highness.

105
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,380
Since it's the Spring Banquet,

106
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,300
why would I worry about being disturbed?

107
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,540
I simply wish to enjoy
the festivities with everyone.

108
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,140
While young,
you know no grief you could not bear.

109
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Do you realize His Majesty
already has someone in mind?

110
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,380
If you choose a Noble House
like the Su Family,

111
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,420
what awaits you

112
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,140
is either a marriage alliance
in a faraway land

113
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,660
or worse, being executed.

114
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,860
You've got some nerve showing up here,

115
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,700
you rascal.

116
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,340
Greetings, Your Highness.

117
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,660
I wish you

118
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,020
a year as bright as the moon

119
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,620
and an appearance as radiant
as spring blossoms, Your Highness.

120
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,020
Spare the formalities.

121
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,100
Thank you, Young Master Su,
for your gracious presence.

122
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,180
How about we have a private conversation
in the inner courtyard?

123
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,800
I originally planned to leave

124
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,300
after just one glance
at the eighteen-year-old you,

125
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,780
but I never expected

126
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,380
that you, at eighteen, would be
so easily swayed by appearances.

127
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,740
Rongqing.

128
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,660
The Rongqing in front of me

129
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,900
has no knowledge

130
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,260
of our past.

131
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,860
I saw an insect on your cuff.

132
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,420
It has already flown away.

133
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,220
Thank you, Your Highness.

134
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,940
Young Master Su,

135
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,900
are you aware that I'm holding
this Spring Banquet

136
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,180
for another purpose?

137
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,660
The young Rongqing is actually so shy.

138
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,420
Back then, due to our status,

139
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,140
we had little interaction.

140
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,900
I never imagined
he could be so charming in this way.

141
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,860
Young Master Su, you seem a bit nervous.

142
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,660
How come I didn't know

143
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,780
you were so proactive back then?

144
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:01,940
Meeting Rongqing

145
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,780
in advance this time

146
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,260
is really great.

147
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,780
Your Highness. Young Master Su.

148
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,420
The auspicious time
for the Spring Banquet is approaching.

149
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,980
You should go change now.

150
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,900
Young Master Su,
please wait in the garden.

151
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,260
I'll be back after I get changed.

152
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,860
Yes, Your Highness.

153
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,780
Young Master,

154
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,500
that's the princess.

155
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,700
No matter how attractive she is,
you shouldn't look at her like that.

156
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,460
It could cost you your life.

157
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,220
Shut up.

158
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,900
Who said I was looking at the princess?

159
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,580
Are you suggesting
that you admire Young Master Su?

160
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,260
Get lost.

161
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,140
The Spring Banquet starts now.

162
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,780
Please welcome Her Highness.

163
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,660
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

164
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,740
- Long live the Princess.
- Long live the Princess.

165
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,180
You may rise.

166
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,980
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

167
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,180
Please be seated.

168
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,980
Her Highness says

169
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,780
that she wants to play

170
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,820
a different version
of the traditional game,

171
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,820
passing the parcel.

172
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,860
In a moment, a hibiscus cup

173
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,340
will float down the winding stream
in front of you.

174
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,700
When the drum starts,

175
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,260
Her Highness will call out when to stop.

176
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,420
Whomever the hibiscus cup
stops in front of

177
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,980
must drink

178
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,700
and then have a talent show.

179
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,860
Any of the Six Arts are acceptable.

180
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,340
Stop.

181
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,150
[Lu Yu, son of Marquis Ningguo]

182
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,860
What talents do you possess,
Young Master Lu?

183
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,500
I... I'm good at...

184
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,060
I'm good at eating eggs.

185
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,420
Young Master Lu's talent
is indeed unique.

186
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,220
Bring over the eggs.

187
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,220
[Mingyue Palace]

188
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,460
[Huayue, daughter of Concubine Rou]
It's so funny.

189
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,020
[Xiao Rou, Concubine Rou]

190
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,900
Mother, what kind of people

191
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,060
is Father choosing for Pingyue?

192
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,380
If she ends up picking
that fool, Lu Yu...

193
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,380
Huayue,

194
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,820
regarding Pingyue's marriage,

195
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,820
your father has his own considerations.

196
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,020
If she marries a fool,

197
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,260
I'm really afraid that when I see her,

198
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,580
I won't be able to help
but laugh out loud.

199
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,140
Behave yourself.

200
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,740
With Pingyue's temper,

201
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,340
if you annoy her,

202
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,940
she'll definitely have a row with you.

203
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,380
That's exactly the point.
I want to make her angry.

204
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,700
When people get angry,
they tend to make mistakes.

205
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,740
Once she makes a mistake,

206
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,940
it'll be easier to deal with her.

207
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:09,700
Your Majesty,

208
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,620
these are all urgent memorials.

209
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,620
Inside,

210
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,620
they are either proposals
for marriage to Princess Pingyue

211
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,060
or related to affairs
of the border regions.

212
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,540
Please give written instructions
or comments.

213
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,480
Is the Yang Family
on the northwest border

214
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,900
demanding military funds again?

215
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,740
When was the last time this happened?

216
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:27,940
His Majesty,

217
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,420
it's been less than a month.

218
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,060
The Noble Houses
all have their own fiefdoms,

219
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,380
and now that there's a war,

220
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,660
they're all coming to ask me for money.

221
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,420
I might as well
not read at this memorial.

222
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,540
Let me guess what else is
on the memorials.

223
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,940
These candidates

224
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,740
probably all come
from the seven major Noble Houses.

225
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,780
What if Pingyue

226
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,660
doesn't make her decision
according to my arrangements?

227
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,220
If I recall correctly,

228
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,460
the late Emperor

229
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,520
did the following

230
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,380
with two disobedient princesses
back then:

231
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,740
one was sent far away for marriage,

232
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,100
and the other was executed.

233
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,020
The Young Master of the Su Family
still went to attend the banquet.

234
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,140
Was Pingyue acting innocently

235
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,900
or intentionally?

236
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,780
Stop.

237
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,660
Please bring a bow and arrows.

238
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,820
Your Highness,
I apologize for any offense.

239
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,300
He's nothing but a pretty face.

240
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,660
Reward him.

241
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,100
This is carefully selected
by Her Highness.

242
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,300
Thank you, Your Highness.

243
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,260
Li Rong,

244
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,940
you are playing with fire here.

245
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,780
[Hanqiu Palace]
Your Highness, His Majesty says

246
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,260
that he is preoccupied
with state affairs

247
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,220
and cannot meet you.

248
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,620
Thank you.

249
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,020
Wait.

250
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,500
Your clothes seem a bit old.

251
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,380
I have some fine fabric at my place.

252
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,100
I'll send it over to you another day.

253
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,020
[Yang Wan, Concubine Ning]
Serving His Majesty

254
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,700
means you should be concerned
about appearances all the time.

255
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,940
Yes, Your Highness.

256
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,620
I just want to see His Majesty briefly.

257
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,580
I won't cause any trouble for you.

258
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,340
Then please go back, Your Highness,
and wait for my message.

259
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,140
Thank you.

260
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,980
Find a way to send a message
to the young master.

261
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,060
Ask him to win the favor
of the princess at all costs.

262
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,260
Yes, Your Highness.

263
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,180
It's a disgrace to the educated class.

264
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,870
[Cui Shuyun]
It's no different

265
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:19,540
[Bureau Director]
from those male escorts

266
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,660
[in the Ministry of Justice]
in those pleasure houses.

267
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,250
[Yang Quan,
Concubine Ning's younger brother]

268
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,500
It seems like Li Rong

269
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,880
wants to test all the candidates

270
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,580
for the Prince Consort

271
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,140
selected by His Majesty.

272
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,820
The game continues.

273
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,060
Stop.

274
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,860
I'm done here.

275
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,500
Let's go.

276
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,900
She's intentionally trying to prevent me
from showcasing my abilities.

277
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,660
Her Highness wants to see you.

278
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,580
Li Rong intends to meet
with Su Rongqing alone.

279
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,060
No, this is absolutely not allowed.

280
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,020
May I ask, Miss,

281
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,180
what Her Highness
has summoned me here for?

282
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,100
Her Highness has heard
that you love reading.

283
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,940
Here are rare volumes
from the royal collection.

284
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,060
If you are willing
to join the Princess's Mansion,

285
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,460
these will belong to you.

286
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,980
You don't need to answer immediately.

287
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,660
I have brought some refreshments.

288
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,340
When you have decided,

289
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,740
you can go to the pavilion in the lake
to meet Her Highness.

290
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,060
That was quite some fun I had today.

291
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,860
Normally,

292
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,140
it's women who go to great lengths

293
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,620
to please men.

294
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,900
But today, watching those men
down there,

295
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,700
trying their best to win my favor

296
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,940
and showing off in front of me,
is quite entertaining.

297
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,780
Your Highness,

298
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,020
what are you talking about?

299
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,780
You see that Yang Quan?

300
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,700
It's as if 'Pick me'

301
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,060
is written on his forehead.

302
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,860
Go make a pot of tea for me.

303
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,580
Yes, Your Highness.

304
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,620
What's wrong?

305
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,500
Earlier, Young Master Pei stopped me

306
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,140
and said something.

307
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,420
What did he

308
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,100
say to you?

309
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,620
He said

310
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,900
if you insist on choosing
Young Master Su,

311
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,220
you'll end up
in either of the following endings.

312
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,540
One is to marry to a distant land,

313
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,260
and the other is...

314
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,900
The other is execution.

315
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,100
Does Pei Wenxuan think I'm stupid?

316
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,020
But it's unexpected

317
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,260
that at such a young age,

318
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,020
he has such insight.

319
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,500
He's quite talented,

320
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,460
but it's a pity

321
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,740
that he offended me.

322
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,460
Young Master Lu,

323
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,340
Her Highness wants to see you.

324
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,420
She summoned Lu Yu.

325
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,260
It seems she's heeded my advice.

326
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,140
Cui Yulang is lascivious by nature

327
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,380
and won't catch Li Rong's eye.

328
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,220
How wonderful!

329
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,780
Your Highness's husband-to-be
will be a handsome scholar.

330
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,140
But

331
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,060
if she really chooses Lu Yu,

332
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,660
how will the people
in the palace think of her?

333
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,500
She's such a proud person.

334
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,660
It's almost like
sentencing her to death.

335
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,500
Greetings, Your Highness.

336
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,540
Why are you here, Lu Ting?

337
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,500
Young Master.

338
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,020
Master asked me to send you a message.

339
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:08,860
It's...

340
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,980
It's all wet.

341
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:11,820
What...

342
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,500
What should I do now?

343
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,340
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

344
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,220
Please forgive me.

345
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,020
Do you mind if I go help

346
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,660
my young master get changed first?

347
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,300
Go ahead.

348
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,780
Thank you, Your Highness.

349
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,180
Your Highness, bad news.

350
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,340
Major General Yang

351
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,020
and the young lord

352
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,140
of the Shangguan Family, Shangguan Yu,

353
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,980
got into a fight.

354
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,340
They're forcing me to show up.

355
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,540
Your Highness,

356
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,780
I heard that Young Master Lu
fainted as soon as he left.

357
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,340
I guess he won't come back then.

358
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:45,940
Rong.

359
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,100
Rong.

360
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,300
- Your Highness.
- Rong.

361
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,940
You have to get justice for me.

362
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,300
Only Young Master Yang
would dare to hit him.

363
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,140
Take the young lord away
for treatment first.

364
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,940
Yes, Your Highness.

365
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,140
You... you ignoramus!

366
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,580
Major General Yang,

367
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,420
are you implying
that my hospitality is inadequate?

368
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,300
Your Highness's hospitality is,
of course, impeccable.

369
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,540
Since it's impeccable,

370
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,780
why are you causing such trouble?

371
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,780
I just wish to have a few words
with Your Highness.

372
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,060
Go ahead.

373
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,860
I come from a military background

374
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,380
and am not skilled in fancy words,

375
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,260
but heaven bears witness,

376
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,180
my desire to marry
Your Highness is sincere.

377
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,660
Did you say "Heaven bears witness"?

378
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,820
And you say you don't use fancy words?

379
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,140
They are such fancy words

380
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,940
that I don't even know
if I'd ever use them.

381
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,300
If you agree to marry me,

382
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,860
I'll grant you

383
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,820
whatever you desire in this world.

384
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,620
I give you my word.

385
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,580
I didn't know that you were so capable.

386
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,780
I command thirty thousand soldiers
from the northwest troop.

387
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,700
They are at Your Highness's disposal.

388
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,660
How dare you!

389
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,460
Your Highness.

390
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,980
You have quite the nerve, Yang Quan.

391
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,460
Do you think
the thirty thousand soldiers stationed

392
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,260
in the northwest
are your family's soldiers?

393
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,700
I wouldn't dare. I...

394
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,580
Major General Yang,

395
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,660
you may go back.

396
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,980
Major General Yang,

397
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:20,860
please.

398
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,020
Ask Young Master Su
to head to the pavilion in the lake.

399
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,260
He's probably finished
reading the books.

400
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,340
Yes, Your Highness.

401
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,780
Tell that rascal Pei Wenxuan
to go there too.

402
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,740
I noticed that you don't seem
to like Young Master Pei.

403
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,140
You haven't even glanced at him today.

404
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,380
So why...

405
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,620
Pei Wenxuan,

406
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,580
wait to see what I'm going to do to you.

407
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,220
Back then, you claimed
that you were forced to marry me.

408
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,580
Seems like you've calculated
everything meticulously.

409
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,420
Your Highness,
Young Master Pei has arrived.

410
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,780
Greetings,

411
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,700
Your Highness.

412
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,220
What's the meaning of this,
Your Highness?

413
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,380
It's rare

414
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,060
to meet a kindred spirit.

415
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,660
When we were outside just now,

416
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,900
I didn't get enough
of Young Master Su's show.

417
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,140
So I invited him
to play the guqin here.

418
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,180
Young Master Pei, why don't you also
immerse yourself in the music?

419
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,300
Jingmei,

420
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,020
bring him a futon.

421
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,140
Yes, Your Highness.

422
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,260
Young Master Su, your guqin skills
are indeed remarkable.

423
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,540
I'm flattered, Your Highness.

424
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,980
Your Highness, it's getting late.

425
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,260
I'll take my leave now.

426
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,580
Young Master Su, please stay.

427
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,460
I have something more
to discuss with you.

428
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,020
Pei Wenxuan,

429
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,820
I won't allow you
to slander Rongqing in the slightest!

430
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,380
Li Rong,

431
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,260
I also hope you can live a happy life,

432
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,300
but you mustn't choose

433
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,620
Su Rongqing.

434
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,460
You may leave now.

435
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,780
Mr. Pei, I have heard

436
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,060
that you are the youngest
and most favored candidate

437
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,660
in the Royal Selection
in our dynasty's history,

438
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,980
with unparalleled wit and strategies.

439
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,500
Today,

440
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,620
I have truly known
your capabilities.

441
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,860
I'm flattered, Your Highness.

442
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,580
Jump into the lake.

443
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,100
Your Highness,

444
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,980
I don't quite understand.

445
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,220
You tricked Yang Quan
to hit Shangguan Yu.

446
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,540
What's wrong with you?

447
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,580
Give it back.

448
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,220
That jade pendant is from my mother.

449
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,500
Give my jade pendant back!

450
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,740
Then you lured Lu Yu away.

451
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,260
When you go in
and see your young master,

452
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,220
ask him to pretend to faint.

453
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,020
You did all this

454
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,460
just to become my husband, didn't you?

455
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,020
If you want to be my husband,

456
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,220
how come

457
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,700
you can't bear
even this little grievance?

458
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,020
How does Your Highness know

459
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,700
that I want to be the Prince Consort?

460
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,820
Drop the act.

461
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,580
Why else would you be here?

462
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,060
I've already investigated

463
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,180
your background and the situation

464
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,540
with the Pei Family thoroughly.

465
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,300
Becoming my husband

466
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,940
is precisely a great opportunity

467
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,580
for you and your family
to turn things around, isn't it?

468
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,500
It seems Your Highness
has misunderstood.

469
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,260
I just want to help...

470
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,660
Right,

471
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,140
I seem to be meddling too much.

472
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,180
Even if you wanted to,

473
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,780
there would be no chance now.

474
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,700
I already have someone I fancy.

475
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,260
Who are you referring to, Your Highness?

476
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,100
He's right in front of you.

477
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,820
Young Master Su,

478
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,380
do you like those books?

479
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,420
Would you like to have them?

480
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,020
Please think twice, Your Highness.

481
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:06,940
Mr. Pei.

482
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,740
I'm talking to Young Master Su here.

483
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,140
It's not your place to interrupt.

484
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,500
Your Highness,

485
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,260
I just don't want you

486
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,540
to ruin your own future
due to a sudden impulse.

487
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,180
That's quite audacious of you

488
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,980
to meddle in my affairs.

489
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,180
I'll do whatever I like.

490
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,380
It's my own path

491
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,740
and my own choice.

492
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,740
Young Master Su.

493
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,500
If Your Highness doesn't mind,

494
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,340
I would like to request to marry you.

495
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,500
Guards.

496
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,500
I'm astonished at how scheming you are

497
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,100
at such a young age.

498
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,420
Throw him into the lake.

499
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:51,940
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

500
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,580
Your Highness.

501
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,420
So you were picking
the spot in the lake to fall into?

502
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,300
How about

503
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,460
we talk like this?

504
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,100
I quite enjoy the position

505
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,420
where you're lower than me.

506
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,140
Pei Wenxuan,

507
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,740
you'd better know your place.

508
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,500
Right now,
I can throw you into the lake,

509
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,380
and later, if I wish,

510
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,100
I can make you drown here.

511
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,180
From now on,

512
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,700
whether you get to live or not
depends entirely on my mood.

513
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,420
So think carefully about what you say

514
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,980
and do.

515
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,620
Do you understand?

516
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,100
Pei Wenxuan is just a young kid,

517
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,740
who's just 20 years old.

518
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,020
There's no difference
between bullying him

519
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,500
and bullying a child.

520
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,540
Enough of this.

521
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:15,900
Fish him out.

522
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,540
Yes, Your Highness.

523
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,180
Young Master Su,

524
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,020
about what I just said...

525
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,260
Your Highness, please don't.

526
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,580
Rongqing, here you are.

527
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,140
What's the matter?

528
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,140
Rongqing, if you're really unhappy,

529
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,980
I can divorce Pei Wenxuan.

530
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,580
Your Highness is of noble status,

531
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,900
while I am but a humble sinner.
I dare not request your favor.

532
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,580
What is it?

533
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,460
You don't like

534
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,860
those books?

535
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,140
Your Highness, please forgive me.

536
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,540
Before leaving, my father
repeatedly instructed me

537
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,060
to only attend the Spring Banquet

538
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,100
and not get involved in anything else.

539
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,580
If you don't want those books,

540
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:56,020
they will become
someone else's tomorrow.

541
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,340
Your Highness,

542
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,460
those books are too precious.

543
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,020
I am but a humble man
with little influence...

544
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,980
♪It's like standing on the edge
of a bottomless abyss♪

545
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,980
I'm unworthy
of possessing them just yet.

546
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,940
I should have realized earlier.

547
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,740
The Su Family has always been neutral

548
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,220
and avoids marrying the royal family.

549
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,940
Su Rongqing currently has no choice.

550
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:25,820

I'm bullying you with my power.

566
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,340
I'm teaching you how to behave properly.

567
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,260
You're lucky it's me
you're running into.

568
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,820
If you had encountered anyone else
from the royal family,

569
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,540
with your behavior today,

570
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,820
you would have been thrown out

571
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,900
Thank you, Your Highness.

572
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,300
You've achieved your goal.

573
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,300
You're the only candidate left

574
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:12,900
for the Prince Consort.

575
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,220
Get Young Master Pei a change of clothes

576
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,620
and have him cleaned up properly.

577
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,300
Yes, Your Highness.

578
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,380
Your Majesty.

579
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,660
Your Majesty.

580
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,900
What do you want? Tell me.

581
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,060
I have heard

582
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,700
that Princess Pingyue
is holding a Spring Banquet

583
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,340
with the intention
of selecting a husband.

584
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,300
My younger brother, Yang Quan,

585
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,460
has followed my father
into battle since childhood

586
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,500
and has earned numerous merits.

587
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,300
He might be a suitable match
for the princess.

588
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,980
Your Yang family
is a lineage of generals.

589
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,980
Instead of focusing
on how to win battles at the border,

590
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,220
you're now concerned
with the princess's marriage.

591
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,780
You're right, Your Majesty,

592
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,700
but as for my brother Quan...

593
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,540
I've said it before,

594
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,220
the princess's marriage
is her own decision.

595
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,660
Whomever she chooses
will be her husband.

596
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,740
Your Majesty.

597
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,740
My family may have made
numerous mistakes.

598
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,420
But I hope Your Majesty can consider

599
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,100
the years of service I have rendered.

600
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,180
Could you give the Yang Family
another chance?

601
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:25,980
What?

602
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,500
Have I ever said I would do anything
against your Yang Family?

603
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,580
Sit down then talk to me.

604
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,140
Whatever you want to say,

605
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:10,940
just say it.

606
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,260
Your Highness, I think

607
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,540
you already know what I want to say.

608
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,940
What's with your attitude?

609
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,060
What?

610
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,340
Does marrying into the royal family

611
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,420
make you feel uncomfortable?

612
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,340
Not at all.

613
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,740
I come from humble beginnings,

614
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,060
and initially,
I may rely on Your Highness.

615
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,980
However, as a dignified man,

616
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,540
I also aspire to be the one

617
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,540
who can match you, Your Highness.

618
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,140
This way,

619
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,660
when Your Highness is weary,

620
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,860
you can have someone to lean on,

621
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,420
and I won't be just a burden

622
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,420
living off you.

623
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,780
You're just trying
to leverage my influence

624
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,620
to strengthen yourself.

625
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,900
There's no need
to say these high-sounding words.

626
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,620
Men like you

627
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,420
will say anything

628
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,940
when seeking power and favor.

629
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,460
Mr. Pei,

630
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,540
you are the Prince Consort,

631
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,500
yet now you are holding
the Crown Prince's concubine like this.

632
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,900
Do you know what punishment you'll face?

633
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,020
I heard Concubine Qin got into trouble,

634
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,020
so I came to help her. I...

635
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,500
The Prince Consort
came here following my order.

636
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,860
How can anyone despise him

637
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,820
and slander him?

638
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:52,700
You have feelings for her?

639
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:53,980
I...

640
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,540
I am a bit worried about her.

641
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,060
What's your relationship with her?

642
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,460
Childhood friends.

643
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,300
Did she know
that you still care for her?

644
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,500
If she did,

645
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,100
why did she call off the engagement?

646
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,420
My father passed away
because of illness.

647
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,660
Back then,

648
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,080
I was pushed aside by my uncle

649
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,340
and not given much importance.

650
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,420
It was her relatives
who canceled the marriage,

651
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:29,980
which is why we...

652
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,860
So you two

653
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,780
loved each other
but couldn't be together,

654
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,540
and I ended up being a hindrance?

655
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,340
Your Highness.

656
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,740
Bring over the citrons.

657
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,380
Your Highness,

658
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,380
citrons will give me rashes
if I eat them.

659
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,780
Is it that bad?

660
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,740
Take this dish away.

661
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,020
And tell the chefs

662
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,140
to avoid cooking anything
that contains citrons.

663
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:12,940
Yes, Your Highness.

664
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:13,940
Eat it.

665
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,540
Your Highness, if I consume citrons,

666
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,300
I'll get rashes all over my body.

667
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,140
You still have to eat it.

668
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,300
That's my order.

669
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,220
I've just eaten something,

670
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,780
so I'll eat it later.

671
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,180
Eat it later then.

672
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,260
Since I have plenty of time,

673
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,100
let's play a game of weiqi.

674
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,420
Get the weiqi board.

675
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,380
Yes, Your Highness.

676
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,580
Playing as black,
the star point opening.

677
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,900
She hasn't changed for decades.

678
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,860
So his weiqi strategy
has always been like this.

679
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,460
Dealing with
the twenty-year-old Pei Wenxuan,

680
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,540
I don't need to give full play
to my abilities.

681
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,540
Oh well.

682
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,500
I'll give him a little leeway,

683
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,980
so he won't be as embarrassed.

684
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,460
The eighteen-year-old Li Rong
still plays poorly,

685
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,940
but she's always been arrogant

686
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,540
and mischievous.

687
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,260
How come her tactics

688
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,780
are the same as the ones she used
when she was thirty-eight.

689
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,100
How come his strategies

690
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:46,780
are the same as when he was forty?

691
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,460
Li Rong may seem arrogant and spoiled,

692
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:56,060
but she actually acts very methodically.

693
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,340
She doesn't pick a fight for no reason.

694
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,300
However, when I first met Li Rong,

695
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,820
she humiliated me
in front of Su Rongqing.

696
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,180
Guards. Throw him into the lake.

697
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:08,980
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

698
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:09,660
Your Highness.

699
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,180
Back then,

700
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,620
the eighteen-year-old Li Rong
wasn't like this.

701
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,540
I remember
the twenty-year-old Pei Wenxuan

702
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,740
is more or less immature.

703
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:18,900
On the day of the wedding,

704
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,300
although he appeared calm
on the surface,

705
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,220
I could see from his eyes

706
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,420
that he was already in a state of panic.

707
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,460
Your Highness.

708
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,460
But now, when Pei Wenxuan sees me,

709
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,900
he's not just calm and composed,

710
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,380
he looks at me like an old acquaintance.

711
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,020
This weiqi game

712
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,940
turns out to be the final one we played

713
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:15,260
before living apart

714
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:16,900
and it was unfinished.

715
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:19,220
That unfinished game

716
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,420
is a stalemate.

717
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,060
I just don't want you

718
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,140
to ruin your own future
due to a sudden impulse.

719
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,380
No wonder he dares

720
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:29,060
to talk back to me like this now.

721
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,460
No wonder she knows
that citrons will give me rashes.

722
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,220
It's either him being truly audacious...

723
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:35,820
Or...

724
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:36,940
Or...

725
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,180
- He has lived an extra 20 years.
- She has lived an extra 20 years.

726
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,380
- If so,
- If so,

727
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,900
- everything would make sense.
- everything would make sense.

728
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:59,460
Li Rong hated me to the core before.

729
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:01,460
Last time, it was her order
that had me killed.

730
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,390
The fact that she
can still control the urge

731
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:04,220
to kill me immediately

00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,900
shows her extreme forbearance.

733
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,380
Fortunately, I have no intention

734
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,260
of entangling with her again
in this lifetime.

735
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:10,980
I will ask you one more time.

736
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,100
Why did you stop me

737
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,060
from choosing other people?

738
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:19,660
I...

739
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:23,660
I...

740
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,380
Because you felt guilty
about what you had done to me.
