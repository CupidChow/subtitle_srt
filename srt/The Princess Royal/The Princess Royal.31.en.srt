[Adapted from Mo Shu Bai's novel,

00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 31]

5
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,260
I've always wanted to suppress
the northern enemies

6
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,940
to keep our country safe
from constant skirmishes.

7
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:41,980
Official Pei,

8
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,660
do you have any useful suggestions?

9
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:45,900
Perhaps

10
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,260
we could hold
a military examination next year.

11
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,460
A military examination?

12
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,540
That's a brilliant idea.

13
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,020
I have always wanted to build

14
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,820
an army that truly belongs
to the royal family.

15
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,380
It's a good idea
to hold a military examination.

16
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,820
After we suppress the northern enemies,

17
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,020
I plan to station an army
of 100,000 men in the South

18
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,300
permanently

19
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,420
to spread our culture

20
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,700
and influence foreign enemies

21
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,860
so that 100 years from now,

22
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,500
the southern lands
will be unified as one.

23
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,580
Your Majesty, your exceptional foresight

24
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,140
will make your plans
come to fruition eventually.

25
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,580
Besides,

26
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,820
the southern lands have been
plagued by floods for years.

27
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,060
Instead of repairing the dam
all the time,

28
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,460
we should build another channel
to divert the water flow.

29
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,100
Unfortunately,

30
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,990
the elite troops, money, and food
in the country

31
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,460
all belong to the noble families.

32
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,340
But the noble families

33
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,060
only care for their self-preservation.

34
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,980
Let alone start wars at the borders,

35
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,060
even if there is a war in the capital,

36
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,980
they will only try to negotiate
rather than fight.

37
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,540
Those cowards.

38
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,180
What do you think of what I said?

39
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,620
You are a wise emperor.

40
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,500
I dare not say anything otherwise.

41
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,140
Just speak your mind.

42
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,780
My clan came from a humble background.

43
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,060
We gained our reputation
for your appreciation.

44
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,340
My father has always been
your loyal supporter

45
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,300
and I will follow in his footsteps.

46
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,300
Very well.

47
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,460
Your family
and Cheng's mother's kinsfolk

48
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,580
may have been commoners,

49
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,460
unlike those from the noble families,

50
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,420
but you have a heart of gold.

51
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,180
In the future, I hope you'll continue
assisting me in the state affairs.

52
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,380
Especially Cheng.

53
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,780
He's still young.

54
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,980
You should guide him on his journey

55
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,140
on my behalf to share my burdens,

56
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,300
understood?

57
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,580
I understand.

58
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:03,980
Mr. Pei.

59
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,940
His Majesty has high expectations for you.

60
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,140
Has His Majesty been
experiencing health issues lately?

61
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,300
His Majesty has been experiencing

62
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,460
temporary blindness in the morning
for the past two days.

63
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,020
We are secretly searching
for famous physicians.

64
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,460
Mr. Pei,

65
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,900
you have to plan ahead.

66
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,460
His Majesty wanted me to remind you

67
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,700
that only the commoners
will truly support you.

68
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,260
I have conveyed His Majesty's message.

69
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,540
I'll take my leave.

70
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,180
Looks like chaos is drawing near.

71
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,860
Mr. Pei, Consort Rou
wants to see you now.

72
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,620
Mr. Pei, a moment, please.

73
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,380
Your Highness.

74
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,380
Mr. Pei, come in, please.

75
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,180
Greetings, Your Highnesses.

76
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,620
This time, we've got ourselves
into huge trouble

77
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,580
for taking down Wang Houwen.

78
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,060
I have something to tell you.

79
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,300
Privately, if possible.

80
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,420
All of you may leave now.

81
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,940
I'll take my leave.

82
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,060
It's a fact that no one would dare
to offend the noble families.

83
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,380
However,

84
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,620
we can't simply do nothing.

85
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,620
After all, His Majesty is watching.

86
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,180
Now that Wang Houwen
has been gotten rid of,

87
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,860
you have taken your stand.

88
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,780
When you release the others afterward,

89
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,580
the noble families would think

90
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,540
that you're doing them a favor.

91
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,380
If you release them from the beginning,

92
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,380
would the noble families still think

93
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,420
that you're showing them grace?

94
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,180
Besides, this is the only way

95
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,660
to create

96
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,340
an opportunity for Prince Su
to recruit talents.

97
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,780
Had I not done all that,

98
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,340
the noble families might have assumed
that you're scared of them.

99
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,300
You spoke my mind.

100
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,140
Mr. Pei,

101
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,940
as the chief examiner
for the metropolitan examination,

102
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,860
I'm sure it won't be hard for you

103
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,100
to put a few names
on the primary list of candidates.

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,420
[Yang Xu, Wang Zhao, Wen Tong,
Tian Xiwen, Liu Li, Chen Qing]

105
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,740
Aren't these people
all from noble families?

106
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,380
Why don't they just follow
the Royal Selection route?

107
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,260
Their names are not included
in the noble families' pedigrees.

108
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,860
They're only related to them somehow.

109
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,620
Your Highness,

110
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,180
there are some things
that I'm not sure if I should say.

111
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,460
Pray tell.

112
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:38,220
What do you want, Your Highness?
It's getting a large amount of money

113
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,300
and live a peaceful life in the palace,

114
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,700
or

115
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,060
making Prince Su

116
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,020
ascend the throne?

117
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,620
Sorry for my abruptness.

118
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,140
But there are limited positions

119
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,620
in the imperial court.

120
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,980
Having more people
from the noble families

121
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,220
means there will be fewer opportunities
for real commoners.

122
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,460
You should know better than I do

123
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,460
who can be of value to Prince Su.

124
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,180
The metropolitan examination
will commence

125
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,600
[Notice of Metropolitan Examination]
on the 10th day of the 10th month

126
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,860
in the 25th year of the Yongning Era.

127
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,500
There will be two categories
of passing candidates.

128
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,460
Those on the Primary List will be
appointed directly in the capital

129
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,140
and those on the Secondary List will be
appointed in regional governments.

130
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,260
That doesn't sound very appealing.

131
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,780
I heard those regional positions
are posts with very little to do.

132
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,500
We'd better study harder.

133
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,660
After all, those on the Primary List
can work directly in the capital.

134
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,300
That depends on whether we can pass.

135
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,700
Yeah.

136
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:42,820
[Examination Hall]

137
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,100
Your Majesty,

138
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,780
these are the candidates
for the palace examination.

139
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,420
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

140
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,740
- Long live Your Majesty!
- Long live Your Majesty!

141
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,300
You may rise.

142
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,700
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

143
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,780
Please set a question
for the candidates, Your Majesty.

144
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,820
How can a ruler ensure
that his officials

145
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,300
are free from corruption,
that his people harbor no greed,

146
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,940
and that every family
can sustain themselves?

147
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,220
How can the ruler maintain the country's
traditions and culture,

148
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,980
create an education system
that is accessible to all,

149
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,620
and build a competitive
agricultural industry?

150
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,580
A good strategist knows
how to win a battle without fighting.

151
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,660
A good general knows
how to quash his enemy's plans

152
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,180
to end a battle

153
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,540
even before it starts.

154
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,300
Discuss the topics above.

155
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,700
I shall read your answers myself.

156
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,060
Out of the seven major noble families
in the capital,

157
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,420
other than the four main ones
who have lasted for nine generations,

158
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,780
I see we have representatives
from the other three noble families.

159
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,300
I'm greatly honored
by your gracious presence.

160
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,540
Your Highness, we're here
to congratulate you in advance

161
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,180
for taking back the Inspectorate Office
from Consort Rou

162
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,260
and being reinstated as the Supervisor
of the Inspectorate Office.

163
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,540
You jest, Mr. Wang.

164
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,060
The Inspectorate Office

165
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,260
is doing fine under the leadership
of Consort Rou and Prince Su.

166
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,780
What do I have to do with this?

167
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,540
We're here today

168
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,540
to discuss with you

169
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,580
how we can help you

170
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,540
regain the Inspectorate Office's
leadership.

171
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,540
Your Highness, if you have any request,

172
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,140
pray tell.

173
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,700
Mr. Zheng, you're a sensible one.

174
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,940
Actually, I know why exactly

175
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,060
you're here today.

176
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,900
Instead of putting it as helping me,

177
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,420
I'd say that you're helping yourselves.

178
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,540
The fall season is ending soon.

179
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,700
The officials that Consort Rou
has dealt with

180
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,780
will all be executed by then.

181
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,660
You want me to take over
and change the original sentence

182
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,580
so that your family members
won't be executed,

183
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,540
especially Mr. Wang's.

184
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,060
Let me guess what's on your mind.

185
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,180
Consort Rou is ambitious and bears
a grudge against the noble families.

186
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,660
If no one stops her,

187
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,580
she will become

188
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,500
a threat in the long term.

189
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,020
While she's reforming the system
of the imperial examination today,

190
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,140
in the future, she might be targeting

191
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,300
your military forces, power,
and supplies.

192
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,500
You see everything clearly,
Your Highness.

193
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,660
Right now,

194
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,500
Consort Rou
is under my father's protection,

195
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,500
so if you take action
against Consort Rou,

196
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,540
you would be taking action
against my father.

197
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,940
Yet, you wouldn't want to confront
my father directly,

198
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,500
so you're trying to make me

199
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,900
a puppet of yours

200
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,900
and manipulate me
to start a war against my father.

201
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,060
However,

202
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,620
why would I want

203
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,340
to become someone's puppet?

204
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,580
You've misunderstood us, Your Highness.

205
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,220
We're here to assist you,

206
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,660
not to manipulate you.

207
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,820
So, you're willing to follow my orders?

208
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,620
Inform the Prince Consort

209
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,180
that I will ask Chen Houzhao
to enter the capital tonight

210
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,660
to lodge a case
at the Ministry of Justice.

211
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,340
Tell him to order Pei Liming to act.

212
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,860
Make sure Su Rongqing doesn't intercept.

213
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,460
Also,

214
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,140
prepare the testimonies provided

215
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,300
by the candidates which shows
that they were coerced by Consort Rou

216
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,300
to drop their cases.

217
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,260
I want to read them tonight.

218
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,420
You also need to inform Miss Shangguan

219
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,020
to prepare the evidence

220
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,220
showing they used torture
to force a confession.

221
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,740
Also, prepare a nice set
of clothes for me.

222
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,180
Tomorrow,

223
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,020
I must look pretty
when I attend the morning audience.

224
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:25,980
Understood.

225
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,940
[Taiji Hall]
Your Majesty,

226
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,020
Wang Houwen and his accomplices
should be executed according to the law.

227
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,140
Please decide on a date
for their execution.

228
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,620
I hope you can reconsider
your decision, Your Majesty.

229
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,180
My father was the Minister of Personnel.

230
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,060
We have only listened
to Consort Rou's side of the story.

231
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,500
That's not enough to prove his guilt.

232
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,620
Therefore, I implore you
to postpone the execution.

233
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,380
The execution dates have always been set
by the Bureau of Astronomy.

234
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,540
Since when is this
a topic of discussion in the court?

235
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,140
You've been working here for years.

236
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,900
Don't you know the rules?

237
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,860
You have a point, Mr. Shangguan.

238
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,380
A woman usurps a man's power,
which will destabilize the country.

239
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,540
What are you implying, Mr. Gu?

240
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:11,940
Your Highness.

241
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,340
I am just fulfilling my duties
as a censor.

242
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,940
You're calling me
a woman usurping a man's power.

243
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,220
Why didn't you say the same thing

244
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,300
when Princess Pingyue was here?

245
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,020
At least, Rong didn't make

246
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,500
that many wrongful convictions.

247
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,580
Why are the officials
unsatisfied with you?

248
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,220
Consort Rou, shouldn't you
do some self-reflection?

249
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,940
You're all ganging up against me!

250
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,180
Your Highness,

251
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,100
you said that I've made
wrongful convictions.

252
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,460
Do you have any evidence?

253
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,900
If not,

254
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:48,860
then you...

255
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,540
I do.

256
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,220
Greetings, Father.

257
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,380
Long live Your Majesty.

258
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,740
I didn't summon you.

259
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,780
What are you doing here?

260
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,260
For myself,

261
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,580
for officials,

262
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,620
and for all scholars of humble roots,

263
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,100
I'd like to seek justice
from Consort Xiao Rou.

264
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,140
I hope you can give us justice, Father.

265
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:26,820
Pingyue,

266
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,740
you should be

267
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,780
resting in your mansion today.

268
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,380
Father, please summon the plaintiffs.

269
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,380
You know I'm your father,

270
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,220
yet you dare order me around!

271
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,340
Your Majesty,

272
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,460
since the Princess is filing
a complaint against Consort Rou,

273
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,260
as the wise ruler of this country,

274
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,180
you should resolve this case first.

275
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,900
Your Majesty,

276
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,700
please summon the plaintiffs involved
in the case handled by Consort Rou.

277
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,220
Summon them.

278
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,780
Summon them.

279
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,140
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

280
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,300
- Long live Your Majesty.
- Long live Your Majesty.

281
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,980
These plaintiffs...

282
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,780
have already been found guilty.

283
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,340
Your Highness, you think
someone is framing you?

284
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,060
What about him?

285
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,820
He is?

286
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,780
I am Chen Houzhao,

287
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,620
one of last year's candidates
from Qingcheng, Yuzhou.

288
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,260
It's you.

289
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,820
I tried searching for you,
but you were nowhere to be seen.

290
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:10,180
Are you here today
under someone's coercion?

291
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:13,860
Your Highness.

292
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,940
Why would anyone coerce me?

293
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,700
Even if someone
did coerce me into coming here,

294
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,540
I wonder who coerced your cousin,
Xiao Shunwen,

295
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,780
into stealing my exam candidature
in the spring examination.

296
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,660
I couldn't find you

297
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,100
when I was investigating
the imperial examination fraud.

298
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,260
If you truly have grievances,

299
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,700
why didn't you lodge a complaint earlier

300
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,300
instead of coming here today
and making these stories up?

301
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,660
Making stories up?

302
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,220
Do you know how much I've suffered

303
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,460
while studying
for the past dozen years?

304
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,620
Do you know how many clothes
my mother had washed

305
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,860
to earn my tuition?

306
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,340
She even overstrained her eyes
since she worked too hard embroidering.

307
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,340
My family had pinned
all their hopes on me,

308
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,860
yet those scoundrels,
Xiao Shunwen and Xiao Pingzhang,

309
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,300
stole my identity,

310
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,500
my examination script,

311
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,380
and my endeavors
over the past dozen years!

312
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,900
And you're saying
that I'm making stories up?

313
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,900
Mr. Chen, calm down.

314
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,140
I just wanted to confirm the truth.

315
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,780
If you have grievances,
you don't have to yell.

316
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,780
Just tell us what happened.

317
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,340
I will remain impartial

318
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,100
and seek justice for you.

319
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,460
Justice?

320
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,940
The justice you mentioned

321
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,300
was sending your men to search for me

322
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,180
and hunt me down,

323
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,820
hoping that I'd never return alive,

324
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,740
and that this case remains forgotten?

325
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,580
What nonsense is that?

326
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,460
Don't you even know what you've done?

327
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,820
You lied that I died of illness
in the capital

328
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,660
and threatened my mother
with my brother's future

329
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,540
so that she wouldn't come to Huajing

330
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,140
and pursue my case further.

331
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,820
I even have a letter from you

332
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,220
that promised you would arrange
a position for my brother.

333
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,020
Your Highness,

334
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,140
is there anything else you have to say?

335
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,540
Now I know.

336
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,780
Your Majesty,

337
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,860
this is a set-up!

338
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,020
All the evidence they're presenting

339
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,220
is fabricated

340
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,340
just to set me up!

341
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,420
Chen Houzhao went missing

342
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,420
after he lodged his case with Pingyue.

343
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,940
If I really wanted to harm him,

344
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,020
why would I search for him

345
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,180
and argue with
Princess Pingyue over him?

346
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,580
Your Majesty.

347
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,420
Your Majesty.

348
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,900
Why don't you dismiss these people
who are kneeling here first?

349
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,340
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

350
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,740
Next up,

351
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,380
I'm going to show you
the next batch of plaintiffs.

352
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,100
The second batch of plaintiffs

353
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,860
are the victims
of the imperial examination fraud case

354
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,900
[Wen Xingzhi, Wen Lunhai, Wen Zhaoke...]
that was investigated by you.

355
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,820
You said you made painstaking efforts
to deal with this case

356
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,180
so justice could be served.

357
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,900
Then, Your Highness,

358
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,860
since you've claimed to uphold justice,

359
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,660
why did you threaten
to bar these candidates

360
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,700
from the metropolitan examination

361
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,420
unless they drop their cases?

362
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,460
While those who stole their candidatures
can go unpunished,

363
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,020
all you're doing is just returning
these candidates' rights

364
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,020
that were theirs all along.

365
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:08,380
Was this what you meant
by upholding justice?

366
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,660
Your Majesty.

367
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,940
Consort Rou abused her authority
in the Inspectorate Office

368
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,220
to demand bribes from our Gu Family.

369
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,420
Here is the ledger that proves it.

370
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,100
Please check it, Your Majesty.

371
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,140
The Zheng Family also has the ledger
proving she demanded bribes from us.

372
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,780
So does the Wang Family.

373
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,700
So does the Lian Family.

374
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,060
So does the Peng Family.

375
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,100
So does the Sun Family.

376
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,540
So does the Chen Family.

377
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,180
So does the Hu Family.

378
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,140
And the Zeng Family as well.

379
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,140
Your Majesty, they're framing me...

380
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:43,900
Your Majesty.

381
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,460
Consort Rou engaged in corrupt practices
and bent the law for personal gain.

382
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,940
She deliberately attempted murder
and framed innocent loyal people.

383
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,340
Therefore, I implore you to take
Consort Rou into custody, investigate her,

384
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,820
and punish her according to the law.

385
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:03,100
Your Majesty, we implore you to take
Consort Rou into custody, investigate her,

386
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,660
and punish her according to the law.

387
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,460
Official Pei.

388
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,620
Official Su.

389
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,940
Why aren't you two kneeling?

390
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,700
Your Majesty, I implore you to take
Consort Rou into custody, investigate her,

391
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,780
and punish her according to the law.

392
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,500
Your Majesty, I implore you to take
Consort Rou into custody, investigate her,

393
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,820
and punish her according to the law.

394
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,260
Very well.

395
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,300
Very well.

396
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,940
You're all trying to pressurize me.

397
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,220
You're all colluding to pressurize me!

398
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,780
Your Majesty.

399
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,380
We are not pressurizing you.

400
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,580
If Consort Rou did not do all that,

401
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,900
no one would do anything to her.

402
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,580
But since Consort Rou did all that,
then she should know

403
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,740
that justice has long arms.

404
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,620
This day had to come sooner or later.

405
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,180
You are the Emperor,

406
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,100
the ruler of this country.

407
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,500
As the people's leader,

408
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,780
you should set an example.

409
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,820
You can't bend the law to your liking.

410
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,180
I understand

411
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,420
that you favor Consort Rou,

412
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,220
but you've put your heart and soul
into the imperial examination.

413
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,940
Are you sure that you,
just to protect her,

414
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,700
want to ruin the justice that hundreds
of upright scholars deserve,

415
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,860
destroy our country's
laws and principles,

416
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,620
and sully your reputation that will be
recorded in historical records?

417
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,100
If you still show favoritism towards her,

418
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,060
how would our Li Family's ancestors
think of you?

419
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,220
How would the officials think of you?

420
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,460
How would the people think of you?

421
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,740
Centuries ahead of now,

422
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,100
how would historical records
describe you?

423
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,860
Your Majesty,

424
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,300
as your child and your official,

425
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,500
I do not wish to see
your reputation tainted.

426
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,060
Therefore, I ask you
to enforce the law impartially

427
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,140
by taking her into custody

428
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,140
and investigating her thoroughly.

429
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,260
Your Majesty.

430
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,700
Someone!

431
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:29,780
Your Majesty.

432
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,900
You don't trust me?

433
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,460
Throw Consort Rou into prison.

434
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,340
The Ministry of Justice

435
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,380
will take over this case.

436
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,220
Your Majesty.

437
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,220
Princess Pingyue had worked tirelessly
to establish

438
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,420
the Inspectorate Office,

439
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,900
yet she was then
maligned by Consort Rou,

440
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,380
saying that she killed Chen Houzhao.

441
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,820
However, it is clear
that Chen Houzhao is not dead,

442
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,100
which proves the Princess is innocent.

443
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,580
Therefore, I request
that Princess Pingyue be reinstated

444
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,380
so she can investigate
Consort Rou's case.

445
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,100
Does everyone else here

446
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,260
hold the same opinion?

447
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,700
- We do!
- We do!

448
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,460
Fine.

449
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,300
I have a fine daughter.

450
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,180
A fine one, indeed.

451
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,060
I did not misjudge you, after all.

452
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,140
Thank you, Your Majesty.

453
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,900
Since all of you...

454
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,100
have already come to this agreement,

455
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,060
why am I even here?

456
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,340
Before Consort Rou was sent to prison,

457
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,700
I want to meet her
at the Imperial Study.

458
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

459
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,860
Court dismissed!

460
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,220
- Take care, Your Majesty.
- Take care, Your Majesty.

461
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,340
Someone.

462
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,340
Take the suspect, Xiao Rou, away.

463
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,300
Don't touch me.

464
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,580
I can walk myself.

465
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,980
It's not too late

466
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,300
to give up now.

467
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,700
Thank you for your kind reminder.

468
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,500
I appreciate it.

469
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:32,300
[Taiji Hall]

470
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:37,860
Rong.

471
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,580
I've always been by your side.

472
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,020
I thought

473
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,660
you would assume that I'm happy.

474
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,820
Then are you happy?

475
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,940
What's there to be happy

476
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,340
about all this in-fighting?

477
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,060
Perhaps

478
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,380
the past me would feel happy.

479
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,180
But after going through so much,

480
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,700
I no longer feel any joy

481
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,500
in bringing down someone

482
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,740
like Consort Rou.

483
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,860
The only thing that would elicit joy

484
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,580
is when no one like her exists anymore.

485
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,020
No one is nobler than anyone else.

486
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,660
I was just born

487
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,220
into a nobler family than she was.

488
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,180
You are kind enough

489
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,100
to feel pity for her.

490
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,820
In this world,

491
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,980
there are lots of victims and sufferers.

492
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,300
However, there are only

493
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,940
a few evil-doers.

494
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,580
If everyone

495
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,220
uses their tragic backgrounds

496
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,340
to justify their wrongdoings,

497
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,980
then there is nothing

498
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,340
to restrain evil anymore.

499
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,380
Your Highness.

500
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,140
Detesting evil

501
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,620
is the only way to celebrate kindness.

502
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,060
Am I kind, though?

503
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,140
You can be kind.

504
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,820
Be someone who slays evil.

505
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,380
Actually...

506
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,300
I've been thinking of something.

507
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,620
Be it the noble families or commoners,

508
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,940
why do we separate them
into different classes?

509
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,300
If there comes a day

510
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,380
when we no longer talk

511
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,100
about noble families and commoners,

512
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,060
and everyone gets to be treated
the same way,

513
00:29:59,380 --> 00:29:59,980
that can be called

514
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,740
true fairness.

515
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,700
That's an immense act of kindness.

516
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,100
If it is an immense act of kindness...

517
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,300
then we have to stay on this path.

518
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,860
Rong, I'm glad

519
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,980
that you're truly on my side this time.

520
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,660
Your Majesty, Consort Rou is here.

521
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,220
Your Majesty.

522
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,380
I knew

523
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,220
you wouldn't abandon me.

524
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,420
Your Majesty.

525
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,340
You useless woman!

526
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,860
I plotted so hard

527
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,820
to wrestle the authority
of the Inspectorate Office for you

528
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,380
and I kept reminding you

529
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,540
that other than the certain
noble families I told you,

530
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,340
you were to do nothing to anyone else.

531
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,420
Look what you've done.

532
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,780
Just for a few chests of silver taels,

533
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,460
you've ruined half my life's work!

534
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:41,980
I...

535
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,420
You've dug your own grave!

536
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,100
I was framed.

537
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,980
I was set up.

538
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:47,900
Pei Wenxuan...

539
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,540
Enough!

540
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,220
Even if what you said were true,

541
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,660
who would believe you?

542
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,740
If you had at least half
of Shangguan Yue's composure,

543
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,140
Cheng would have been
the Crown Prince by now!

544
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:01,980
Your Majesty.

545
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,380
I'm too foolish. I'm wrong.

546
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,980
Don't be angry with me, please.

547
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,060
Take care of your health, Your Majesty.

548
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:13,500
I only have you left.

549
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,220
But I

550
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,100
only have myself left.

551
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,700
The only thing you can do now...

552
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,940
is to find a suitable time

553
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,100
to write a letter.

554
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,380
You can say

555
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,820
that the Crown Prince framed you

556
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,340
and that you would prove
your innocence by death.

557
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:49,980
When you die,

558
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,300
all this will come to an end.

559
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,540
This is the only way

560
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,420
to keep Cheng's reputation untainted.

561
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,420
Your Majesty!

562
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,420
Don't blame me.

563
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,060
Given how things are now,

564
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,100
I can no longer help you.

565
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,420
Your Majesty.

566
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,940
You're the Emperor

567
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,020
and you can't help me?

568
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,500
You can't even protect your woman?

569
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,540
In the end, it's all because
of your cowardice and incompetence!

570
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,020
You're scared of the noble families.

571
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,580
You're scared
that they would overthrow you anytime,

572
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,340
- and that you have to do...
- Silence!

573
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,060
I will show you some mercy
on the account

574
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,660
that you're Cheng's mother,

575
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,780
so stop spouting nonsense!

576
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,100
Am I spouting nonsense?

577
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,740
All I did was expose your weakness.

578
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,060
I'm going to die anyway,

579
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,700
so what else can you do to me?

580
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,860
Say that again, and I will
remove Cheng's title as a prince!

581
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,500
Go ahead!

582
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,980
If you want to free your family

583
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,100
from the Shangguans' clutches,

584
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,220
Cheng is your only choice.

585
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,060
You won't have another son anyway!

586
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,060
What did you say?

587
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,900
After I gave birth to Cheng,

588
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,220
you've never had any children.

589
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,220
Haven't you thought about why?

590
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,980
What did you do to me?

591
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,580
The soothing soup you drink every day

592
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,780
is made by me.

593
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,660
I'm going to kill you,

594
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,140
you evil woman!

595
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,140
You can't bear to do it?

596
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,500
You can't bear to kill me?

597
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,740
Li Ming, why are you such a coward?

598
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,700
You're neither kind

599
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,020
nor ruthless enough.

600
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,140
You fail to be a benevolent ruler.

601
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,540
You fail to be a filial son.

602
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,100
You fail to be a loving father.

603
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,380
You fail to be a worthy husband!

604
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,420
You're a selfish man, after all,

605
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,180
yet you were born with some conscience.

606
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,780
You could have enjoyed your life

607
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,580
as a cowardly emperor,

608
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,820
and the Shangguan Family could
ensure you're well taken care of.

609
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,220
Yet, you are unwilling to do so.

610
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,820
Now you're halfway through your life,
but what have you achieved?

611
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,860
You're left with nothing,
not even a real family!

612
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,340
Even I find you pathetic!

613
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,740
Li Ming.

614
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,660
Wait till you reach the end...

615
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,540
and die alone.

616
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:53,780
Your Majesty.

617
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,540
Consort Rou has been sent to prison.

618
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,500
Should I summon
the imperial physician here?

619
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:08,780
Fulai.

620
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

621
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,460
I remember that when I first met you...

622
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,500
you were only 11 years old, right?

623
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:19,940
Your Majesty,

624
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,380
I had just turned 11 back then.

625
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,420
Have we...

626
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,620
all grown old?

627
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,540
Your Majesty.

628
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:41,420
I have been serving you
for almost 40 years.

629
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,580
Ever since I was ten years old,

630
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:55,220
I swore I would be a good emperor.

631
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,460
I worked diligently for decades,

632
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,380
but now...

633
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,460
everything seems
to be back to square one.

634
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,060
I am all alone.

635
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,220
I finally understand

636
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,220
why people

637
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,900
call an emperor a loner.

638
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,700
Many years ago,

639
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,460
I was pretty happy

640
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,940
when I sent people
to build Beiyan Pagoda.

641
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,540
Come on.

642
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,060
Summon Consort Rou's nephew, Xiao Wen.

643
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,020
I need to talk to him.

644
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

645
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,420
Consort Rou has fallen.

646
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,500
It's time to clean house.

647
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:54,900
Mother!

648
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,660
Huayue.

649
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,700
Why are you here?

650
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,740
Are you doing well?

651
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,740
I didn't implicate you, did I?

652
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,420
As soon as I heard
that you were in trouble,

653
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,220
I sent someone to ask
my third uncle for help.

654
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,780
He used his connections

655
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,060
and finally managed to get me in.

656
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,540
What about Cheng?

657
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,780
He's doing fine.

658
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,900
He's in the mansion now.

659
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,620
Mother, what should we do now?

660
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:24,100
We fell deep
into the enemy's trap this time.

661
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:25,700
Remember,

662
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:29,260
in the future, trust no one else

663
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,500
other than our own family.

664
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,420
Do not ever use Cui Yulang again.

665
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:40,700
Mother, what should I do?

666
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,380
What can I do to save you?

667
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,140
I'll get married.

668
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,940
I'll marry someone powerful...

669
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,580
Huayue.

670
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,940
Stop having such impractical thoughts.

671
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,060
Stop thinking about how you can save me.

672
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:58,700
I'm afraid I can't escape death
this time.

673
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,780
What you should do now

674
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,980
is take care of yourself and Cheng.

675
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:11,180
There are two paths

676
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,380
that you can choose.

677
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,860
The first path is...

678
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,820
don't come to visit me
in prison anymore.

679
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,420
Sever all ties with me.

680
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,980
Beg your father

681
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:29,300
to allow you and Cheng to move to stay
with your uncle,

682
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,300
stay away from the royal family,

683
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,180
and lead a peaceful life.

684
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,740
No, I don't want this path.

685
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,460
The second path is...

686
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,300
You need to take a gamble
and risk everything you have.

687
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,860
It will be very difficult, though.

688
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,780
Mother, just tell me what to do.

689
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,180
Kill Li Chuan.

690
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,340
Better yet,

691
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,980
kill Li Rong as well.

692
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,460
That would make Cheng
the only remaining prince

693
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:05,500
and your father would protect
you and Cheng from any harm.

694
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,180
When Cheng ascends the throne,

695
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:11,020
you will become the Princess Royal.

696
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,220
Take this token.

697
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,740
Go to your uncle.

698
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,780
He can mobilize troops.

699
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:27,700
Huayue.

700
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,900
No matter which path you choose,

701
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,940
I will write a confession

702
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,460
to take all the blame

703
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:45,020
so that you and Cheng will remain safe.

704
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,020
Huayue.

705
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:52,900
There's nothing else
I can do to help you.

706
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,860
You will have to rely on yourself
in the future.

707
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:05,620
[Xiao's Mansion]

708
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,420
Don't panic.

709
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:07,980
Don't panic.

710
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,260
I can't let people laugh at me.

711
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,460
Don't panic.

712
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,780
I can't let other people think

713
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,500
that without my mother,
I'm totally vulnerable.

714
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:25,500
Uncle!

715
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:27,700
Uncle, it's me, Huayue!

716
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,300
Calm down.

717
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,340
Did your mother leave any messages?

718
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,700
[Rou]
Mother handed this token to me.

719
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,060
She told me to kill Li Chuan
at the soonest.
