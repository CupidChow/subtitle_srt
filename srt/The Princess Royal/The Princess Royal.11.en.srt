[Adapted from Mo Shu Bai's novel,
The Princess Royal on jjwxc.net]

00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 11]

5
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,700
Your Highness.

6
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,500
Miss Qin.

7
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,860
You're here so early.

8
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,060
Is something the matter, Your Highness?

9
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,140
Not at all.

10
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,780
I was taking a stroll,

11
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,820
and before I knew it,
I found myself here.

12
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,420
So I thought I should visit you.

13
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,220
Jiulu Mountain and the capital

14
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,940
are at least an hour apart by horse.

15
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,060
A mere stroll cannot take you here.

16
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,180
I see dark circles around your eyes,

17
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,740
and your gait is weak.

18
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,460
You didn't sleep well at all.

19
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,660
Tell me. What's the matter?

20
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,460
None.

21
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,100
Did something happen to my brother
by the border?

22
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,900
Not at all, Miss Qin.

23
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,020
Don't worry.

24
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,700
It's something more private.

25
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,300
The phoenix landed
in the houses of noble.

26
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,220
And the flowers blossomed
for four generations.

27
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,620
Your Highness, you are worried
about the consort selection?

28
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,740
Are you overwhelmed by choices?

29
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,100
Quit mocking me.

30
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,940
I received
an invitation missive several days ago.

31
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,900
It says Her Majesty will hold
a banquet during the Qixi Festival,

32
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,900
where all noble maidens are invited.

33
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,020
Is this your concern?

34
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,180
Will you be there?

35
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,140
Far be it for me to defy a royal edict.

36
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,260
However, I do not want to.

37
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,460
While life in the palace
might be harsh on a woman,

38
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,620
I believe

39
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,540
that someone is willing

40
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,380
to traverse the rocky path ahead

41
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,540
with you, Miss Qin.

42
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,620
Together, you overcome difficulties

43
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,060
and devote yourself to each other

44
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,020
like any ordinary couple does.

45
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,020
That only exists in novels.

46
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,460
In reality, life is long
and humans are treacherous.

47
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,780
Women in the palace
are like the flowers in four seasons.

48
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,060
One wilts as the other blooms.
They get replaced often.

49
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,500
Who's to say the flower
won't lose its charm?

50
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,260
Who's to say the man won't lose
himself amidst the temptations.

51
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,860
Besides,

52
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,500
some flowers choose to live
in the nature.

53
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,700
The sky and earth are their home,
and they enjoy the freedom.

54
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,140
Your Highness, you are the Crown Prince.

55
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,780
You mustn't let romance distract you.

56
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:32,740
Come.

57
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,740
Let me see
if your swordsmanship has improved.

58
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,700

59
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,020
The banquet is near.
You should head back, Your Highness.

61
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,940

I was worried

111
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,380
you'd become maladjusted

112
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,020
and start screaming.

113
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,220

Have you listened to the song?

118
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,020
Yet you

119
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,500
still want to enter the palace?

120
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,940
You can lie to me

121
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,260
but not to yourself.

122
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,420
If you wish to know my stance,

123
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,180
I can tell you here

124
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,860
that I don't want to stand there

125
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,220
and compete with

126
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,220
other women

127
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,140
for the affection of one sole man
on the throne.

128
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,020
Here presides Her Majesty.

129
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,220
Today is the Qixi Festival.

130
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,380
By right, you should
celebrate it with your family.

131
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,260
However,

132
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,500
I like the merriment of a crowd,

133
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,900
so I invited all of you here.

134
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,860
Please have fun.

135
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,380
Yes, Your Majesty.

136
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,020
Worry not, Queen Mother.

137
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,460
Young maidens are fond of festivities.

138
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,300
It is our honor to be invited

139
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,540
by you, Your Majesty.

140
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,740
I have discussed with Her Majesty.

141
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,340
We will introduce a new game today,

142
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,460
a perfume-making contest.

143
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,420
Since it's a contest,

144
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,780
I'd like to suggest something,
Your Majesty.

145
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,220
Pray tell.

146
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,020
The perfume concocted
by the maidens here

147
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,540
will be submitted.

148
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,140
The top three

149
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,020
will be awarded. What do you think?

150
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,100
I am married.

151
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,780
If I participate in this,

152
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,060
the nature of the contest will change.

153
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,820
Its outcome cannot be used
to select future consorts.

154
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,820
I beg to differ.

155
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,700
We're all attending this banquet.

156
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,060
How come they can
concoct perfumes and win prizes

157
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,220
but I can't?

158
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,780
I want to join too.

159
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,020
Rong,

160
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,060
today is the Qixi Festival.

161
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,780
You're married.

162
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,180
You cannot join in.

163
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,220
Consort Rou proposed the contest,

164
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,580
which means that she must
have persuaded Father

165
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,740
that the top three candidates

166
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,380
would be Chuan's
primary and secondary consorts.

167
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,060
Mother is planning

168
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,900
to play along.

169
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,540
Everyone is participating in it.

170
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,940
I won't make
that much of an addition, will I?

171
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,540
Miss Qin.

172
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,380
Do you not make perfumes?

173
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:20,140
It doesn't matter to me.

174
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,900
What a unique lady, you are.

175
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,540
It seems like

176
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,540
Qin Zhenzhen doesn't want
to enter the palace at all.

177
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,700
What a contented lady.

178
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,060
The banquet

179
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,300
is attended by important ministers
and young officials.

180
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,540
Forsake the formalities.

181
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,900
Let's assess the perfume

182
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,700
and share ideas and insights

183
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,500
about governance.

184
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,140
Feel free to speak your mind.

185
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,580
Your Majesty,

186
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,820
a nation only has a future

187
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,580
if it has an heir.

188
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,700
The Crown Prince is old enough

189
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,540
to select his consort.

190
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,780
Official Xie is right.

191
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,420
I've been thinking about this too.

192
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,300
Any suitable candidates?

193
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,900
Feel free to suggest anyone.

194
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,700
What is Her Majesty's plan?

195
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,060
Winner of the perfume-making contest
will be the Crown Prince Consort.

196
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,380
Don't worry.

197
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,260
Her Highness will help you.

198
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,900
I appreciate that.

199
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,300
Your Highness.

200
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,580
Official Shangguan.

201
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,020
You grew up under my nose.

202
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,700
Please know

203
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,140
that no matter what,

204
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:49,140
your mother and I mean you well.

205
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,900
I believe you know who to pick today.

206
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,540
Consort Rou wants Xiao Wei to win.

207
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,300
Queen Mother wants Shangguan Ya to win.

208
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,060
[Three]
This chest

209
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,660
contains the numbers of the
perfume pouches, and their owners.

210
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,900
If I were Consort Rou...

211
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,300
Time's up.

212
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,340
Miss Qin,

213
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,300
my jade pendant fell on your seat.

214
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,580
Can you get it for me?

215
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,820
[Eight]

216
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,380
Why did you swap our perfume pouches?

217
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,500
You said
you didn't care about the result.

218
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,940
You don't mind

219
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,420
saving a life here, do you?

220
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,460
Uhm...

221
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,060
Miss Qin, what perfume is that?

222
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,500
It smells so unique.

223
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,140
Don't worry. I'm not trying to harm you.

224
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,540
You shouldn't take my pouch.

225
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,100
Will you believe me

226
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,900
if I say I don't want to fight
the same women

227
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,140
for a man?

228
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,900
But the perfume you made...

229
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,700
Don't worry.

230
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,980
My perfume will not be under my name.

231
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,980
Your perfume will not be
under your name.

232
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,260
Okay. I trust you.

233
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,200
[Six]

234
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,660
Father doesn't care who Chuan marries

235
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,980
as long as it's not someone
from a prestigious family

236
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,420
like Shangguan Ya or Su Rongwen.

237
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,020
He will mandate the marriage

238
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,420
if Chuan picks a woman

239
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,060
from a less prestigious family.

240
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,620
Qin Zhenzhen is the best candidate.

241
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,100
[Sandalwood Perfume Pouch Three]
No, I have to stop this.

242
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,380
Send this to the consort.

243
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,820
Tell him to ask the Crown Prince
to pick my perfume pouch.

244
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,780
She insisted
on participating in the contest.

245
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,820
I knew it was odd.

246
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,260
Li Rong, you are shrewd.

247
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,700
The banquet is not over.

248
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,740
Where are you going, Miss Jinglan?

249
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,620
Pingyue.

250
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,820
You know your brother very well.

251
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,100
Whose perfume
do you think he will choose?

252
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,740
Turn around.

253
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:23,980
Lift it.

254
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:43,050
[Eight]

255
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,250
[Five]

256
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,140
Since it's a banquet for the young,

257
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,380
in my opinion, to select the winner,

258
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,540
we should remove their names

259
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,940
and replace them with numbers.

260
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,740
The Crown Prince will select
the winner of the contest.

261
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,740
The runners-up

262
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,260
will be chosen by everyone here.
What do you think?

263
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,550
[Nine]

264
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,180
This soothing perfume pouch
has a very elegant scent.

265
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,900
How remarkable.

266
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,540
What do you think, Your Highness?

267
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,050
[Six]

268
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,980
I wonder who made Pouch Six.

269
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,620
She mixed
lilies and roseleaf raspberries.

270
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,220
It's fragrant and calming.

271
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,100
This must be one of the winners.

272
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,980
I might even hazard a proposal

273
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,740
that its owner

274
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,540
must be the winner.

275
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,820
Watch your mouth, Ronghua.

276
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,500
Ronghua, just write your opinion
on the paper.

277
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,780
His Highness will decide the winner.

278
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,420
Worry not.

279
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,380
We can all express
and exchange our opinions.

280
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,220
Chuan,

281
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,060
who do you think should be the winner?

282
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,660
Ya will make
a lily perfume pouch tomorrow.

283
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,540
She will mix lily flowers
with roseleaf raspberry wine.

284
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,300
Upon mixing it,
the floral scent will invade your nose.

285
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,140
Remember now.

286
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,300
She must be the Crown Prince Consort.

287
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,540
All perfume pouches

288
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,540
are unique in their own right.

289
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,340
Why haven't I heard
anything from Li Rong?

290
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,140
Did something bad happen?

291
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,600
[Sandalwood]

292
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,700
[Three]

293
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,660
White sandalwood?

294
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,940
This must be Li Rong.

295
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,540
It's been so many years,

296
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,420
and she never forgets it.

297
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,900
I knew she would do something

298
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,900
for the consort selection.

299
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,900
F-Father.

300
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,220
I...

301
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:07,980
I...

302
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,540
I'd select

303
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,220
Three.

304
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,420
[Eight]
Third place, Pouch Eight.

305
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,660
[Shangguan Ya]
Soothing perfume by Shangguan Ya.

306
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,300
Second place, Pouch Six.

307
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,820
[Qin Zhenzhen]
Lily perfume by Qin Zhenzhen.

308
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,740
Miss Qin made the lily perfume?

309
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,060
First place, Pouch Three.

310
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,660
[Li Rong]
Princess Pingyue, Li Rong.

311
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,660
Where is Pingyue in there?

312
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,420
Father, while Rong wasn't good
at perfume-making,

313
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,900
she has done an excellent job this time.

314
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
I hope that you can discard

315
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,340
your prejudice against her.

316
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,140
You're right, Chuan.

317
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,300
I shouldn't doubt her.

318
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,580
She should be awarded.

319
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,940
Bring them here.

320
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,580
Pingyue won?

321
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,100
Mother,

322
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,420
I should claim my award from Father.

323
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,980
How can this be, Mother?

324
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,300
Xiao Wei is not within the top three.

325
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,060
My goal

326
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,460
is to show His Majesty
through this banquet

327
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,060
who is coveting
the Crown Prince Consort position.

328
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,380
They all show themselves now.

329
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,140
Please wait here, Your Highness.

330
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,620
Do you know she replaced
your pouch with hers?

331
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,380
Yes.

332
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,500
You didn't tell anyone?

333
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,540
No.

334
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:29,900
Why not?

335
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,820
My perfume pouch is empty.

336
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,820
If she wants to harm me,

337
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,260
I can prove that the pouch is not mine.

338
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,220
She said

339
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,180
she didn't want to fight
other women for one man.

340
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,100
I am of the same opinion too.

341
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,580
You're lucky today

342
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,340
because you met me.

343
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,820
If it weren't for you, Miss Shangguan,

344
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,860
I might not have lent assistance at all.

345
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,060
Why are you so certain
that she didn't lie?

346
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,620
Father told me

347
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,660
that to ascertain
if someone was telling the truth,

348
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,100
it sufficed to look into her eyes.

349
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,100
What about me?

350
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,340
You are a kind person, Your Highness.

351
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,620
You're wrong.

352
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,140
Her Highness

353
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,020
is a cunning person.

354
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,580
Insolence.

355
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,620
You've seen the worst of me.

356
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,980
What more is there for me
to be afraid of?

357
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,580
If you like, Your Highness,

358
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,460
let's hang out
at the poetry society one day.

359
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,740
Sure.

360
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,420
We should bring some taels with us

361
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,100
to gamble.

362
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,780
We're in the palace.

363
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,540
Don't make me look bad.

364
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,060
Gamble what?

365
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,860
Your Highness, follow me.

366
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,460
Greetings, Father.

367
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,580
Greetings, Your Majesty.

368
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,660
At ease.

369
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,740
- Thanks, Your Majesty.
- Thanks, Father.

370
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,780
I was of the impression
that you were bad

371
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,020
at making perfumes.

372
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,900
Somehow, you impressed everyone today.

373
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,940
It's all thanks to the prince consort.

374
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,380
He taught me

375
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,180
the recipe.

376
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,300
I knew it.

377
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,860
I know perfectly well

378
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,500
what Rong is capable of.

379
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,580
I have heard of Ya's talent,

380
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,460
but Miss Qin here

381
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,340
is a new face.

382
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,380
Come closer.

383
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,020
Let me take a look.

384
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,780
I need to know the face of the lady

385
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,380
who concocted such a perfume.

386
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

387
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,300
What defiant, heroic features.

388
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,900
Is Father mandating the marriage now?

389
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,180
Zhenzhen is never
interested in perfume-making.

390
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,740
Why is she here?

391
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,700
She doesn't admit it

392
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,780
but her intense gaze says it all.

393
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,580
Whether it's for Pei Wenxuan

394
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,540
or Chuan,

395
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,140
I have to stop this.

396
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,300
Your Majesty,

397
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,700
the ladies must be tired
from standing this long.

398
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,060
Perhaps you should award them

399
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,420
so they can get some rest.

400
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,540
Rongqing!

401
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,180
You're right, Official Su.

402
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,180
Award them.

403
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:18,940
Chuan,

404
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,460
help me

405
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,420
award them.

406
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,180
Yes, Father.

407
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,780
Rong.

408
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,220
Thank you.

409
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,180
Congratulations, Miss Qin.

410
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,020
Thank you, Your Highness.

411
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,180
Thank you, Your Highness.

412
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:09,900
Congratulations.

413
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,300
I am tired now.

414
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,060
You young ones should have fun.

415
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,380
I owe my father an explanation

416
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,540
so I must go now.

417
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,980
What about you, Your Highness?

418
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,900
I'm waiting for Pei Wenxuan.

419
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,500
Like I said previously,

420
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,060
you two are close.

421
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,780
Go back
and face your father's wrath already.

422
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,260
By your leave, Your Highness.

423
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,420
Miss Qin, can we talk?

424
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,740
Shangguan Ya took your pouch

425
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,500
so that you can become

426
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,340
the Crown Prince Consort in her stead.

427
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,060
I helped you at someone's behest.

428
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,980
Pei Wenxuan and I
do not love each other.

429
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,700
We agreed

430
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,100
to divorce each other
once we freed ourselves

431
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,460
from these impositions.

432
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,020
The palace is a chaotic place.

433
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,500
If you decide to stay here,

434
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,060
you have to be cautious.

435
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,340
Farewell.

436
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,700
Your Highness.

437
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,500
Mr. Su.

438
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,700
Your Highness.

439
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,420
Thank you so much for today.

440
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,300
Whatever for?

441
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,420
For your timely intervention just now.

442
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,580
Never mind.

443
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,780
Thank you.

444
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:11,860
Let's go.

445
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,780
Let's go.

446
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,700
I must go now.

447
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,060
Miss Qin.

448
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,340
Your Highness, we're at the palace.

449
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,420
You can risk it but I cannot
afford the risk.

450
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,660
I just want to tell you

451
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,100
that I like the perfume you made.

452
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,500
It makes me happy.

453
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,420
I don't like it.

454
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,540
Why not?

455
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,500
I don't like the perfume

456
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,140
or the palace.

457
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,620
Someone swapped her pouch with mine.

458
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,180
That was how I won.

459
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,700
Do not have the wrong idea.

460
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,580
Please write to me in time

461
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,420
if you have news of my brother.

462
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,820
You thanked Su Rongqing today

463
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,260
because Qin Zhenzhen
went to see His Majesty?

464
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:02,900
Yes.

465
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,140
I can't believe Su Rongqing

466
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,220
can read my mind already.

467
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,020
We won today.

468
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,420
You must be very happy, Your Highness.

469
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,300
Aren't you the same, Mr. Pei?

470
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,540
Other than when you bully me,

471
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,700
I do feel upset too.

472
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,180
Tell me.

473
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,980
What do you
plan to do after our divorce?

474
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,260
Why do you ask?

475
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,300
Qin Zhenzhen's death

476
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,500
must have filled you with regrets.

477
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,940
I know you still love her.

478
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,860
She died very early,

479
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,940
so you felt indebted to her.

480
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,340
For her sake, you must work harder

481
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,860
in this life.

482
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,100
Work harder on what?

483
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,620
Qin Zhenzhen is old enough
to get married.

484
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,980
If all goes well, it takes us
three years to get the divorce.

485
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,140
If you don't make a vow with her now,

486
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,300
she might give her heart away.

487
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,020
I came clean to her today.

488
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,380
I told her I helped her because of you,

489
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,540
and that we would get a divorce later.

490
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,140
You grew up with her.

491
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,860
Hang out with her more.

492
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,260
And once you two settle down
in the relationship,

493
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,620
I'll ask Qin Lin
to send her to the North.

494
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,700
Once everything's done
and we get the divorce,

495
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,620
I'll mandate the marriage
between you two.

496
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,620
What do you think?

497
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,660
Why the silence?

498
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,620
You think she'll be miserable

499
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,620
in the North?

500
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,620
If you have any issues,

501
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,500
you can tell me.

502
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,620
What's there to complain about?

503
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,540
What else can I add?

504
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,540
You planned everything.

505
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,140
Everyone has

506
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,260
a clear role to play.

507
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,940
What else do you want me to say?

508
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,220
Halt.

509
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,220
Your Highness,
what happened to the Prince Consort?

510
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,740
Who knows?

511
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,100
Have someone follow him

512
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,220
in case he gets into trouble.

513
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,420
Yes, Your Highness.

514
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,540
What is wrong with him?

515
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,660
Let's go home.

516
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,540
Resume.

517
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,620
This isn't fair.

518
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,180
Stop.

519
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,300
Stop.

520
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,260
Stop!

521
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,900
What now?

522
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,060
Li Rong, I'm telling you now.

523
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:55,780
From now on,

524
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,500
before you ask me to do something,

525
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,420
you have to ask for my consent.

526
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,140
What kind of person do you think I am?

527
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,620
What do you think I want?

528
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,940
What do you think I should do?

529
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,380
You need to consult me first.

530
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,540
So you're confronting me.

531
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,060
Sure.

532
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,380
Tell me.

533
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,860
What is the misunderstanding

534
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,980
that upsets you so?

535
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,460
I do not like Qin Zhenzhen.

536
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,580
I know

537
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:27,860
you're still stung

538
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,420
by her rejection.

539
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,420
It's been many years,

540
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,620
so perhaps you don't love her
like you did.

541
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:34,740
However...

542
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,620
Stop.

543
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,940
Whether in the past or present,

544
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,820
I never like Qin Zhenzhen.

545
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,220
I do not miss her.

546
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,340
I do not care about her.

547
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,220
Everyone tells me

548
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,300
that she's meant to be my wife,

549
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,820
that I have to treat her well.

550
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,860
Therefore, I...

551
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,180
I assume I must like her.

552
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,460
Until I met someone.

553
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,140
When she's sad,

554
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,020
I become nervous.

555
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,300
When she smiles,

556
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:29,660
it feels like winter doesn't exist.

557
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,460
If she fancies a hairpin,

558
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,860
I'll make sure
I remember what it's like.

559
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,980
If the weather changes,

560
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:44,820
I'll be worried if
she is soaked under the rain.

561
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,220
If she goes away for a few days,

562
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,980
I'll pine for her.

563
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,100
I want to write her a missive every day.

564
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,180
I will wonder

565
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,540
how many kids we should have.

566
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,180
I will wonder

567
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,100
if we can spend the rest
of our lives together.

568
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,540
Li Rong,

569
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,140
I do not have any regrets
toward Qin Zhenzhen.

570
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:24,740
My regret, if anything,

571
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,500
is you.

572
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,620
I loved

573
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,860
and lost

574
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,940
Li Rong.

575
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,180
I know you used to love me.

576
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,020
But...

577
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,740
You don't like Qin Zhenzhen?

578
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,940
Because you never tried
to understand what I want.

579
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,500
Once you make up your mind,

580
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,460
no one can persuade you otherwise.

581
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,740
Shangguan Ya is meek and obedient,

582
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,980
yet you never discern her duplicity.

583
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,580
Su Rongqing's family was murdered,

584
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,940
yet you never discern his thirst
for revenge.

585
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,420
Li Chuan lost his father and wife,

586
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:16,100
yet you never discern his heartbreak.

587
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,420
What about me?

588
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,060
Li Rong,

589
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,300
I loved you.

590
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,580
And I lost you.

591
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,860
Can you see now

592
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,260
what I want?

593
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,380
What I desire?

594
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,540
I will

595
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,580
think about it.

596
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,260
It's raining heavily. Come back in.

597
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,100
You could have scolded me,

598
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,540
given me your advice,

599
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,620
loved me, hated me,

600
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,260
or...

601
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,140
But it shouldn't have been this way.

602
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,940
You shouldn't have been indifferent
toward me.

603
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,460
You should go back.

604
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,740
I'll return to the bureau.

605
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,660
Why are you doing this?

606
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,140
Why am I doing this?

607
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,860
When faced with anything,

608
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,580
you keep emotions to yourself.

609
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,620
You believe your rationality

610
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,860
provides a solution for everything.

611
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,500
But remember this, Li Rong.

612
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,980
Behind power is a human being.

613
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,620
If you cannot empathize
with a human being,

614
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,700
your pursuits

615
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,660
will be in vain.

616
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,140
I'm tired.

617
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,940
Let's live separately now.

618
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,700
Your Highness!

619
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,380
Let's go back.

620
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:08,940
Let's go.

621
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,500
What a jerk.

622
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,860
He gets emotional
and he starts saying hurtful things.

623
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,900
Behind power is a human being.

624
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,620
If you cannot empathize
with a human being,

625
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,660
your pursuits

626
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,380
will be in vain.

627
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,220
Fine.

628
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,580
If you're that upset,

629
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,700
let's not stay together anymore.

630
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,900
Why did I say I didn't want us
to be together?

631
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,780
You mean it.

632
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,060

I should have asked you

659
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,380
before I made a decision

660
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,180
for you and Qin Zhenzhen.

661
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,220
But I truly meant well.

662
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,740
Back then, I asked

663
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,180
what she was to you.

664
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,380
You said you were worried about her.

665
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,660
I thought

666
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,100
you not only loved me,

667
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,060
but also her.

668
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,060
I did not want a relationship like that

669
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,500
so I quit.

670
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:03,060
Qin Zhenzhen does not like the palace.

671
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,580
I thought you still loved her,

672
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,020
and that as long as she was with you,

673
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,300
you two could lead a peaceful life.

674
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,660
Then, you wouldn't have any regrets.

675
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,180
That was the best solution

676
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,780
I could come up with.

677
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,060
Also,

678
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,140
power isn't all I care about.

679
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,460
If someone treats me with kindness,

680
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,620
I want to return the same favor.

681
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,940
I'm not using you
to solve Chuan's predicament.

682
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,140
I did care about you.

683
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,020
Besides,

684
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,060
didn't you decide that I should

685
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,900
be together with Su Rongqing too?

686
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:36,860
Li Rong.

687
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,980
I match-made Su Rongqing and you

688
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,580
so that you could face your heart.

689
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,420
You never tell me the truth.

690
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,140
You bury your emotions
under rationality.

691
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,740
I'm always left with confusion.

692
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,500
I'm sorry.

693
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,420
I'm so used to my way.

694
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:04,940
Li Rong.

695
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,700
I know what I want.

696
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,780
Do you?

697
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:11,700
Do you know what you want?

698
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,540
Do you understand what I said

699
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,340
to you today?

700
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:33,660
Yes.

701
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,340
Are you happy?

702
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,020
I'm glad.

703
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,540
But...

00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,220
Pei Wenxuan,

705
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,780
those were in the past.

706
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,620
I do not know

707
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,500
how to answer you now.

708
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,220
It was my regret back then,

709
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,700
and it was yours too.

710
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,700
You can be rational
but you're still a mortal.

711
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,860
Mortals have emotions.

712
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,020
There's nothing wrong about it.

713
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,380
If back then, we

714
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,100
had told each other

715
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,020
about our feelings,

716
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,540
perhaps

717
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,500
we would have had a better ending.
