[Adapted from Mo Shu Bai's novel,
The Princess Royal on jjwxc.net]

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,020
[This is a work of fiction.]

4
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 28]

5
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,420
You're dressing in very
plain clothing today, Your Highness.

6
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,220
You look amazing.

7
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,100
Please.

8
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,180
I'm being followed. Make it brief.

9
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,060
As for the case
you mentioned to me previously,

10
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,340
is it a local squire
who took your friend's

11
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,540
examination candidature?

12
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:55,860
Yes.

13
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,620
Where did that happen?

14
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,380
Zhangping County. In Wangzhou.

15
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,140
Your hometown?

16
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:02,820
Yes.

17
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,660
You work for the Ministry of Rites,

18
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,340
and you can't handle it?

19
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,180
You must be jesting, Your Highness.

20
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,700
It's just a powerless position.

21
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,620
What can I do?

22
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,460
You have complaints?

23
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,300
You were offering yourself

24
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,420
back then.

25
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,900
What do you say?

26
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,180
Come here.

27
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,620
Are you doing this
for your friend or yourself?

28
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,900
What do you mean?

29
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,540
Haven't you ever thought

30
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,500
about making some achievements in court?

31
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,260
In the past, he was
being dissipated and unrestrained,

32
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,620
often lingered in brothels,
and showed no interest in politics.

33
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,740
However, I've read his poems.

34
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,540
From his words, I can tell

35
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,020
he is concerned

36
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,380
with politics.

37
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,980
I know what you mean.

38
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,020
Filing a complaint is just an excuse.

39
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,180
Your real goal
is a marriage of convenience.

40
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,940
You do that

41
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,780
because you want a strong ally.

42
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,900
You've aroused my curiosity.

43
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,180
Since you want to find a strong ally,

44
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,740
what's taking you so long to act?

45
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,700
Also...

46
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,620
why me?

47
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,620
It'll be no fun

48
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,060
when you lay everything bare.

49
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,980
But yes, you're right.

50
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,340
I do want to pledge loyalty to you.

51
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,020
And I'm giving you

52
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,420
this case as a gift.

53
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,660
A gift?

54
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:16,820
How so?

55
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,180
I know Consort Rou is your enemy.

56
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,820
The individual who took
the candidature is Xiao Pingzhang,

57
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,060
a relative of hers.

58
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,580
You jest, Mr. Cui.

59
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,500
What does Consort Rou

60
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,380
have anything to do with me?

61
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,020
Right.

62
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,980
I know you're suspecting

63
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,420
why I'm helping you.

64
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,860
You just need to know

65
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,180
that I want to be your ally,

66
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,660
so I don't mind making minor sacrifices.

67
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,060
How can I trust you

68
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,740
if you don't make everything clear?

69
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,580
If I tell you

70
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,180
it's because you're very pretty,

71
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,740
will it be enough?

72
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,060
So it's because of my beauty?

73
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,340
Yes.

74
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,300
Think about it.

75
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,140
My father was just a teacher

76
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,460
but he could become an official.

77
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,660
Why? Because when I first
came to Huajing,

78
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,820
my poetry was outstanding.

79
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,380
I was also appreciated
by several noble people.

80
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,620
I'm poor and not very talented.

81
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,380
All I can rely on is my face.

82
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,900
If you don't want
to tell me the truth, so be it.

83
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,260
It's because you handled
the Qin Family's case.

84
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,100
It makes me think

85
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,380
that you're someone
who cares for people.

86
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,380
I knew you wouldn't believe that.

87
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,580
What makes you think so?

88
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,100
I understand now.

89
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,940
I shall be frank.

90
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,660
I will not take you under my wings.

91
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,020
But I can plant you around Consort Rou.

92
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,620
You want me to be your informant?

93
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,940
Yes or no? Answer me.

94
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,820
Yes, of course, since this is your wish.

95
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,860
To reassure me,

96
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,020
you have to take this.

97
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,300
It's a chronic poison.

98
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,780
On this day every month, we will meet

99
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,100
and I'll give you the antidote that can
temporarily suppress the toxicity.

100
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,380
Once Consort Rou is eliminated,

101
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,660
I'll give you the antidote
that can completely detoxify you.

102
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,500
Remember now.

103
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,620
This is a test of your fidelity.

104
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,580
If you're truly capable,

105
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,940
regardless of your background

106
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,900
or physical appearance,

107
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,860
you can even
be the Secretariat Director.

108
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,580
As expected of women,

109
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,940
you are skeptical.

110
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,620
If you need me,

111
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,940
just come to my mansion.

112
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:48,820
Sure.

113
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,820
Well, Mr. Su,

114
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,900
you and Chancellor Su
indeed put me in a difficult situation.

115
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,860
The plan regarding the examinations

116
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,020
seems simple enough.

117
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,380
But there are many hidden details
to take care of.

118
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,220
His Majesty is supervising it,

119
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,220
so I can't afford to make any mistakes.

120
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:10,980
Come on, Mr. Wang.

121
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,740
No. I'm drinking no more.

122
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,100
Mr. Wang,

123
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,900
you will get much more benefits
from this in the future.

124
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,340
They are poor scholars.

125
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,580
They don't have money.

126
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,060
What can I get from them?

127
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,060
Mr. Wang, don't...

128
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,460
Well, Mr. Su,

129
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,500
I have tried my best.

130
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,300
But I still need to hand over the rest

131
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,820
to the others.

132
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,660
So I'm not failing the tasks that you
and Chancellor Su asked me to do.

133
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,780
What do you think, Mr. Su?

134
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,180
Listen to me, Mr. Wang.

135
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,700
You have to do this yourself.

136
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,660
I suddenly remember

137
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,340
that I have yet to feed my birds.

138
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,660
It's an emergency.

139
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,900
Mr. Su, let's have a chat next time.

140
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,500
Okay?

141
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,300
I'll take my leave.

142
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,420
No wonder you'll be kicked out soon.

143
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,140
Because you can't see
the incoming change in this country.

144
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:29,740
Young Master.

145
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,620
What are you doing here?

146
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,420
It's none of your business.

147
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,420
Tell me.

148
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,300
How did Cui Yulang come here?

149
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,340
He rented a carriage.

150
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,140
The coachman

151
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,660
told me

152
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,980
that while he looked fancy,

153
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,300
he

154
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,220
haggled

155
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,220
with the coachman

156
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,660
for more than an hour.

157
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,780
Mr. Cui sure is very frugal.

158
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,740
Frugal?

159
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,260
He's not frugal. He's poor.

160
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,500
Right. Poor.

161
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,260
Leave two silver taels on his carriage.

162
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,140
Then, remove the wheels for me.

163
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,140
You want me

164
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,180
to steal the wheels?

165
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:06,820
You can't do it?

166
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,540
No.

167
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,660
I can do that.

168
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,260
But it's not something

169
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,820
a gentleman should do.

170
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,140
Gentleman?

171
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,300
I've been a gentleman
for more than 20 years.

172
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,580
Can't I be a despicable man for once?

173
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,500
When you said that,

174
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,540
you truly looked like a despicable man.

175
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,060
Go now.

176
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,780
Sure.

177
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,420
Take care, Your Highness.

178
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,260
You should return too.

179
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:35,900
Your Highness.

180
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,300
Perhaps you can reconsider me?

181
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,540
You and the Prince Consort
have already divorced.

182
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,180
When it comes to romance,

183
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,940
I'm as good as him.

184
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,180
Don't ever say that in public again.

185
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,420
You'll provoke others.

186
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,060
It's worth it

187
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,780
as long as I can get your attention.

188
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,260
Enough with your flattery.

189
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,380
Let's go.

190
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,380
What are you doing?

191
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,020
You asked me to steal the wheels.

192
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,300
Where should I hide them?

193
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,380
Why did you carry them here?

194
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,540
Put them back.

195
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,180
Wait...

196
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,500
Forget it.

197
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,540
Put them back tomorrow.

198
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,900
Leave them an extra silver tael

199
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,380
to compensate
for their accommodation and time.

200
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,420
Young Master,
why are you doing this to me?

201
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,300
Go now.

202
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,900
Sir, what should we do?

203
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,060
This is...

204
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,300
Do you have an extra carriage?

205
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,060
No.

206
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,380
At this time, they are all gone.

207
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,300
That's right.

208
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,660
Mister,

209
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,900
can you help us?

210
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,300
Can you find me another carriage?

211
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,780
I have to attend
the morning court tomorrow.

212
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,140
Even a donkey cart will do.

213
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,300
You're a court official,

214
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,140
yet you spent such a long time
haggling with me.

215
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,540
I hold a lowly position.

216
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,060
Can you please help me?

217
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,940
I can pay you double the price.

218
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,500
I walked around

219
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,660
and found nothing.

220
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,540
Perhaps

221
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,820
you can try outside.

222
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,780
I'm so unlucky.

223
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,580
I'll refund you the payment
for the return journey.

224
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,740
Come on.

225
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,860
Help me fix the cart.

226
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,620
I should have

227
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,380
asked Her Highness to give me a lift.

228
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,060
Why am I so unlucky?

229
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,740
Young Master, Cui Yulang is there.

230
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,220
Mister.

231
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,060
Hurry.

232
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:51,740
Mister.

233
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,100
Mister.

234
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,740
Mister.

235
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,500
Mr. Pei?

236
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,100
Sorry, Mr. Cui.

237
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,820
I didn't see you.

238
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,660
I'm in a rush. See you.

239
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,820
Wait. Why did you pour water out?

240
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,260
To water the plants?

241
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,140
Wait for me!

242
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,460
Wait for me!

243
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,860
Wait for me.

244
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,140
Today's tea is so good.

245
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,340
It's delicious.

246
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,540
It's the tea we've been drinking
for a long time.

247
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,020
Besides, you didn't even take a sip.

248
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:40,980
Your Highness.

249
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,580
What is it?

250
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,180
Someone in your family got into trouble.

251
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,060
He stole someone else's
examination candidature.

252
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,380
The victim is filing complaints

253
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,060
all the way
from his hometown to Huajing.

254
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,020
Sooner or later,

255
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,340
they'll drag me down with them.

256
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,820
Perhaps

257
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,540
you can ignore them

258
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,540
and cut ties with them.

259
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,140
My brother's soldiers in the Northwest

260
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,580
still need their support.

261
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,620
I cannot cut them off.

262
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,300
Oh, right.

263
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,620
Anything new about Pingyue?

264
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,260
Anything unusual?

265
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,500
Not at the moment.

266
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,180
But Second Young Master Su

267
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,060
is waiting for your reply,
Your Highness.

268
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,260
I need a capable man like him.

269
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,140
But his previous failure
made me doubt his fidelity.

270
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,260
We'll put that aside first.

271
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,980
You asked to see me later

272
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,980
because of Cui Yulang.

273
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,180
And now, when you see me
you're like nothing has happened?

274
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,420
Li Rong.

275
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,660
You are heartless.

276
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,900
Pei Wenxuan is so good
at putting up an act.

277
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,820
Greetings, Your Highness.

278
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,820
Your first mission

279
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,060
is to impeach the Crown Prince.

280
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,060
Isn't that too risky?

281
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,300
You're scared?

282
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,300
Forget about our alliance, then.

283
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:30,900
No...

284
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,420
Your Majesty,
I'd like to report something.

285
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,900
What is it?

286
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:49,260
It's about the Crown Prince.

287
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,060
Official Cui,

288
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,700
I remember you work
for the Ministry of Rites.

289
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,180
Why are you doing the job
of an official from the Censorate?

290
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,580
While I'm a powerless official
in the Ministry of Rites,

291
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,300
the issue concerns
the welfare of our country,

292
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,580
so I must report it.

293
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,020
Did Cui Yulang

294
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,700
obtain some solid evidence on Chuan?

295
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,660
He sounds so confident.

296
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,180
I don't think

297
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,660
I have made any grave mistakes.

298
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,540
If the problem is that serious,

299
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,940
pray tell, Official Cui.

300
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,300
Your Highness,

301
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,300
our country has been suffering
from natural disasters in recent years.

302
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,580
Let alone last year,

303
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,180
this year, the blizzard made people
suffer and they all complained about it.

304
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,300
I believe disasters befell us because...

305
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,660
Because the Crown Prince has no morals.

306
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,060
Nonsense!

307
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,580
What nonsense is that?

308
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,940
Are you implying

309
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,300
that I've failed

310
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,660
to raise my child properly,
so I also have no morals?

311
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,660
Take him out and flop him.

312
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,740
The imperial court

313
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,620
is no place for your superstition.

314
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,780
Your Majesty, during
the autumn ritual we held last year,

315
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,940
His Highness sneezed

316
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,020
during the procedure.

317
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,340
His action might have offended

318
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,220
the heavens,
which committed great irreverence.

319
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,620
What stupid accusation is that?

320
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,100
Your Majesty,

321
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,780
His Highness caught a cold last year.

322
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,700
Nevertheless, he made sure

323
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:34,740
he attended the ritual
despite his frailty.

324
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,500
His devotion is palpable.

325
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,060
The benevolent higher beings

326
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,300
will not

327
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,700
punish the sagacious Crown Prince

328
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,260
for a mere sneeze.

329
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,620
While certain counties

330
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,300
did suffer
from natural disasters in recent years,

331
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,700
it wasn't serious.

332
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,820
Our country spans a vast land.

333
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,860
It is normal that we have
natural disasters every year.

334
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,380
It is far-fetched to regard it

335
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,540
as some sort of divine retribution.

336
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,820
To make such a blatant claim
is to be deserving of punishment.

337
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,980
I agree with Mr. Gu.

338
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,300
- I agree with Mr. Gu.
- I agree with Mr. Gu.

339
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,540
While Mr. Cui's allegation
might sound ridiculous,

340
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,140
it is not utterly baseless.

341
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,780
How about this?

342
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,300
I shall just withhold
Cui Yulang's wage for two months.

343
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,540
Crown Prince, you will kneel
at the ancestral shrine tonight

344
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,380
to apologize for your mistake
in the previous autumn ritual.

345
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,820
Father is deliberately targeting Chuan.

346
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,780
Yes, Father.

347
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,020
Dismissed.

348
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,860
Court dismissed!

349
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,780
- Take care, Your Majesty.
- Take care, Your Majesty.

350
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,740
Mr. Cui.

351
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:09,740
Your Highness.

352
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,940
You should proceed with caution
in the imperial court.

353
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,700
You just assumed your office
not long ago.

354
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,460
Make sure you consult your seniors

355
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,260
for anything regarding your work.

356
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,780
I appreciate your advice, Your Highness.

357
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,860
Cui Yulang.

358
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,260
You sure picked a wonderful excuse.

359
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,220
But it's okay. Don't worry about it.

360
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,060
See you.

361
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,260
Your Highness, I'm even poorer now.

362
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,780
You're too soft-hearted.

363
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,780
How could you fail
in such a simple matter?

364
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,260
How will Rong and I
rely on you in the future?

365
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,060
If one Cui Yulang
can make you get punished,

366
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,060
what's going to happen in the future?

367
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,140
You'll watch as more powerful ministers

368
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,340
bully you?

369
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,860
What now?

370
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,100
Every time I come,

371
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,820
I see Chuan's scolded by you.

372
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,220
You too.

373
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,620
Why didn't you discuss it with me

374
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,980
before you got divorced?

375
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,340
And it took you this long
to show up here.

376
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,500
Do you even care about my feelings?

377
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,340
Mother,

378
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,780
Rong is also very upset.

379
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,700
Don't scold her.

380
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,220
Silence! Reflect upon yourself.

381
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,780
Calm down, Mother.

382
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,060
Or your health will be affected.

383
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,580
Let's speak calmly.

384
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,100
Why are you arguing?

385
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,820
I was told

386
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,380
that Cui Yulang
had complained about him.

387
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,780
I want him

388
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,740
to teach Cui Yulang a lesson,

389
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,740
but he doesn't want to do it.

390
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,260
Can't you see what your father is doing?

391
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,300
Cui Yulang set up a precedence.

392
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,100
If Chuan doesn't retaliate,

393
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,620
many more people

394
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,260
will bully him.

395
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,220
Even though we both
hold a high position,

396
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,620
we're both women.

397
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,020
Our honor and pride
are contingent upon Chuan.

398
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,380
If something happens to him,
what do we do?

399
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,220
I'm doing this for his own good,

400
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,300
but he won't listen.

401
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,820
He doesn't behave

402
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,620
like a crown prince at all.

403
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,780
If I had another son, I'd...

404
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,340
Mother.

405
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,740
Have some tea.

406
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,540
Chuan. Stand up.

407
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,540
I came

408
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,500
to talk about Cui Yulang.

409
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,100
Rong, even though
Cui Yulang complained about me in court,

410
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,700
he didn't do anything wrong.

411
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:27,700
No need to...

412
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,940
Cui Yulang works for me.

413
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,340
I asked him to complain about you.

414
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,500
Don't lay your fingers on him.

415
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,860
Rong, what are you...

416
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:43,780
Mother.

417
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,060
Chuan is old enough now.

418
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,780
We can't sit around and do nothing
as Consort Rou becomes

419
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,540
more powerful, right?

420
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,700
You want to remove her?

421
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,700
But what does Cui Yulang have anything

422
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,100
to do with this?

423
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,780
Besides, your father is
very protective of her.

424
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,860
You want to get rid of her?

425
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,380
[Qianqiu Gate]

426
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,620
If I may have your time, Mr. Cui.

427
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,100
You are...

428
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,540
I am Consort Rou's maid.

429
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,780
How may I help you, miss?

430
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,380
Prince Su's art teacher cannot come here

431
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,860
due to sickness.

432
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,580
Her Highness asked me to ask

433
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,380
if you could tutor Prince Su

434
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,700
since it was said that
you were an expert in painting.

435
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,300
Please ask
for Her Highness's forgiveness.

436
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,980
I have made plans for today.

437
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,020
Think it carefully, Mr. Cui.

438
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,820
It's Consort Rou and Prince Su
who are inviting you.

439
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,620
I'll take my leave.

440
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,540
After arguing with Mother,

441
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,300
you won't speak to me either?

442
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,700
No.

443
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,540
I'm just tired.

444
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,500
I want to rest.

445
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,340
Mother said those words

446
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,940
in the heat of the moment.

447
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,820
Don't take it to heart.

448
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,300
I'm fine.

449
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,940
Actually...

450
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,220
Mother was right.

451
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,140
If she had another son,

452
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,780
perhaps all of us would be happy.

453
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,060
I wouldn't have to be the Crown Prince.

454
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,780
Mother wouldn't
have to rely on me solely.

455
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,580
If you were a boy,

456
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,580
I wouldn't be this exhausted either.

457
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,300
Chuan.

458
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,620
I know...

459
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,780
you won't be mad at me.

460
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,700
I'm just saying.

461
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,860
You and Mother did many things for me.

462
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,700
As the receiver of this glory,

463
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,460
I will not back off.

464
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:16,980
Don't worry, Rong.

465
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,860
Do you know

466
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,740
why I'm supporting you unconditionally?

467
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,580
Because I hate
to see you forcing yourself

468
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,100
like this.

469
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,580
Well.

470
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,060
I might have found someone to rely on.

471
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,180
I have Pei Wenxuan now.

472
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,380
Once I resolve the conflict
between the noble families

473
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,100
and the imperial family,
I'll have power, love,

474
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,300
and freedom.

475
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,500
But you would spend
the rest of your life...

476
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,860
in this palace.

477
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,020
As if you're caged here

478
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,860
forever.

479
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,020
You work for Mother,

480
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,860
for me,

481
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,060
for the Shangguan Family,

482
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,500
for our people, for our country,

483
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,380
but not for yourself.

484
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,220
Oftentimes,

485
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,900
I want to do something for you.

486
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,460
I know

487
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,940
you worry about me as a younger brother,

488
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,660
not as the Crown Prince.

489
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,380
Yes.

490
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,300
You're not just the Crown Prince.

491
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,700
You're Li Chuan too.

492
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,780
He really said that?

493
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,420
Yes, Your Highness.

494
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,540
What if Cui Yulang is a useful pawn

495
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,780
that will do your bidding?

496
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,740
Perhaps his open criticism
toward the Crown Prince

497
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,300
is just a way to attract attention.

498
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,620
We don't know what he wants yet.

499
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,780
I can't wait to see
what he will do next.

500
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,340
And what Shangguan Yue will do too.

501
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,340
Have our people spy on Cui Yulang.

502
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,620
Knowing Shangguan Yue,

503
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,300
she'll either draw him over to her side

504
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,940
or find an excuse to get rid of him.

505
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,620
She is not dumb enough to kill him

506
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,900
now that he just
impeached the Crown Prince.

507
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,940
I guess they will want
to draw him over to their side.

508
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,860
Let's...

509
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,740
observe for now.

510
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,940
Yes, Your Highness.

511
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,020
Miss, who are you?

512
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,940
Fengming, an imperial guard
in the Eastern Palace.

513
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,340
The Crown Prince would like
to have a talk with you.

514
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,140
Mr. Cui,

515
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,260
if His Highness wanted you dead,

516
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,100
he wouldn't have sent me here.

517
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,420
Please lead the way.

518
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:49,740
Your Highness,

519
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,660
it's as you anticipated.

520
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,580
The Crown Prince met with Cui Yulang.

521
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,660
Go to see Cui Yulang and tell him

522
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,260
that I want to see him

523
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,420
and that Prince Su will give him double

524
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,860
what the Crown Prince offers.

525
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,580
Yes, Your Highness.

526
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,260
Thank you.

527
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,340
You're welcome. Everyone will have some.

528
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,780
Thank you, Mr. Su.

529
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,020
You're welcome.

530
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,620
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

531
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,100
Let's find a place.

532
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,050
[Recruiting talents]

533
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,660
Thank you, Mr. Su.

534
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,580
You're welcome.

535
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,020
Your Highness, why did you

536
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,180
buy this all of a sudden?

537
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,980
He loves it.
What if he comes over tonight?

538
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,060
My family is providing convenience
for the scholars in the capital.

539
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,660
I look forward to your assistance.

540
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,540
Mr. Su.

541
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:46,900
Ronghua.

542
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,020
Come on.

543
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,020
Everyone will have some.

544
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,100
Not bad.

545
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,580
Wait for me at Su's Perfumery.

546
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,660
Come on.

547
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,660
Who would've thought

548
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,820
that I'd run into you here, Mr. Su?

549
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,500
My family
has several establishments here

550
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,500
that accommodate exam candidates
who can't afford a place to live.

551
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,540
Would you like
to have a visit, Your Highness?

552
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,100
Sure.

553
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,340
This way, please, Your Highness.

554
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,740
Aren't you leading the way?

555
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:14,820
Walk before me.

556
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,100
Your Highness, that is inappropriate.

557
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,340
You're leading the way.
How is that inappropriate?

558
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,820
Besides, you're a young master
of the Su Family,

559
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,260
the Right Minister of Justice.

560
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,420
You're not a servant.

561
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,740
Don't stand on ceremony.

562
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,780
Don't you have something else to ask?

563
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,940
Don't you have something else to say?

564
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,380
I have no questions.

565
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,860
If I want to find the truth,
I can investigate it.

566
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,980
It's not hard
to deduce your goal either.

567
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,380
You're as candid as ever, Your Highness.

568
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,820
I might only ask you a question

569
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,260
when that specific moment arrives.

570
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,340
It's when one of us will fall.

571
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,580
I won't visit your establishments.

572
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,100
Let's go, Jinglan.

573
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,180
Your Highness.

574
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,700
Take care.

575
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,500
Are you done gawking?

576
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,500
No.

577
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,540
I just

578
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,540
ran into Su Rongqing.

579
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,380
He's giving accommodations
to exam candidates in Huajing.

580
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,300
Earlier on, I've heard

581
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,580
that he's just taking in candidates,

582
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,260
but also people
who're trying to file complaints.

583
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,060
I don't know what he wants.

584
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,980
If he's taking care of exam candidates,

585
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,140
I can assume that he wants

586
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,380
to get into their good graces.

587
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,020
But why someone
who wants to file complaints?

588
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,100
How is Cui Yulang?

589
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,540
What's the plan
between Cui Yulang and you?

590
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,060
Why did he complain about His Highness
in court?

591
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,620
If he did that,

592
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,260
Consort Rou would come to him.

593
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,460
He comes from a humble background,

594
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,420
which is the opposite
of Su Rongqing's.

595
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,620
I'll just have
to put up a few acts with him

596
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,860
to earn Consort Rou's trust.

597
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,460
That way, the alliance
between Consort Rou

598
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,620
and Su Rongqing will fail.

599
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,660
What an ingenious plan.

600
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,140
Of course.

601
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,980
Without Su Rongqing,

602
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,420
Consort Rou is barely a threat.

603
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,060
If Prince Su and she are gone,

604
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,380
Su Rongqing will never

605
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,540
defeat His Highness on his own

606
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,660
unless he's committing treason.

607
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,980
That's what I'm thinking.

608
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,180
All right.
There are so many people here.

609
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,220
I should go. This is for you.

610
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,180
Rong.

611
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,060
What?

612
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,060
Go.

613
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:03,660
All right.

614
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,700
Mr. Cui, Her Highness said

615
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,820
Prince Su would give you double

616
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,220
what the Crown Prince offered.

617
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,060
Please lead the way, miss.

618
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:59,660
Consort Rou must be sitting behind him.

619
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:05,340
Greetings, Your Highness.

620
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,460
Long Live Your Highness.

621
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,380
You may rise.

622
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,380
Greetings, Your Highness.

623
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,580
You may rise, Mr. Cui.

624
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,580
Thank you, Your Highness.

625
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,060
I heard

626
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,340
after the incident at the court today,

627
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,460
the Crown Prince tried to recruit you.

628
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:33,860
Yes.

629
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:39,530
So, why are you here, Mr. Cui?

630
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,540
His Highness offered me
a fifth-ranked position.

631
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,500
But your messenger told me

632
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,220
that Prince Su would double the offer.

633
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,380
Therefore, I'm here.

634
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,940
Everyone wants power.

635
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,380
I like your honesty

636
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,500
as well as the strategic alliance
we share here.

637
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:05,820
Tell me.

638
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,540
What can you do for me?

639
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,140
How far will you go for me?

640
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,740
Since you're so candid, Your Highness,

641
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,060
I shall be frank.

642
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,620
Your Highness,

643
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,980
would you like
to have the Inspectorate Office?

644
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,420
I know very well that you have

645
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,260
many advisors by your side.

646
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,660
As such, I do not come empty-handed.

647
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,100
Complaining about the Crown Prince

648
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,140
is just the stepping stone.

649
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,060
The Inspectorate Office

650
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,180
will be my real gift, Your Highness.

651
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,340
Would you like

652
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,460
to receive this gift, Your Highness?

653
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,500
I found out

654
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,620
that since early this year,

655
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,140
Su Rongqing has been taking care

656
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,260
of scholars who came
to Huajing to attend the examination.

657
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:06,260
Ordinary candidates will stay
at the yard you've seen.

658
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,940
Those who wish to remedy injustices

659
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,060
will be given another yard.

660
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,740
Why is he...

661
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,260
doing this?

662
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,060
I don't know yet.

663
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,660
Interestingly,

664
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,340
Mr. Pei's men are among them.

665
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,340
Tell Cui Yulang

666
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,620
to speed up

667
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,540
the plan with Consort Rou.

668
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:43,660
Yes, Your Highness.

669
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:50,820
Your Highness.

670
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,460
A scholar came to the office

671
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,740
and claimed that someone had taken
his examination candidature.

672
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,020
I brought him here.

673
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,260
Greetings, Your Highness.

674
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,060
Are you Chen Houzhao?

675
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,540
Yes.

676
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,540
Do you have the written complaint?

677
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,140
I have written it.

678
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,060
I did go to the Su Family,

679
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,980
but when I was there,

680
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:24,980
they tried

681
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,020
to buy me off.

682
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,820
What

683
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,020
did they do?

684
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,220
They tried to silence me.

685
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,340
Why did you come to me, then?

686
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,180
A friend of mine

687
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,420
told me that you could be trusted.

688
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,620
You are willing to trust me?

689
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,060
Yes, I am.

690
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,140
Su Rongqing
has taken in aggrieved individuals

691
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,020
but has forbidden them
from filing complaints.

692
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,460
What is he trying to do?

693
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,220
Take the money and leave Huajing.

694
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,140
By Huajing Moat,

695
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,980
there is an old man called San.

696
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,060
Board his boat and leave.

697
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,700
The boat will sink
when approaching Zhang County.

698
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,380
You will swim to the shore with San.

699
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,660
Someone will take you to safety.

700
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,540
Lay low for a while

701
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,620
and wait for my order.

702
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,540
Yes, Your Highness.

703
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,940
Thank you.

704
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:38,220
Your Highness,
what are you trying to do?

705
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,060
You will serve someone else soon.

706
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,980
Get ready.

707
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,060
You're giving up on the office for now?

708
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,950
[Mingyue Palace]

709
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,540
Your Highness, Prince Su,

710
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,060
please seek justice for me.

711
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,060
What is the problem?

712
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,140
Tell us.

713
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:09,380
Your Highness, I have a friend
from my hometown

714
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,900
called Chen Houzhao.

715
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,860
A local squire took

716
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:15,540
his candidature
for the spring examination,

717
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,660
so he came to me in Huajing
to seek help.

718
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,860
I redirected him

719
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,980
to Princess Pingyue.

720
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,260
Just as I expected,

721
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,980
after Her Highness received
the written complaint,

722
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,060
she sent him out of Huajing.

723
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,940
And now,

724
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,580
I can't even locate the boat
they used to send him out.

725
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,420
Is this true?

726
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,140
Chen Houzhao

727
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,060
left this written complaint to me.

728
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,340
Please take a look.

729
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,500
I believe

730
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,540
you can summon Princess Pingyue

731
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,940
here tomorrow

732
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,940
and show her the written complaint.

733
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:03,860
After that,

734
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,660
we can expose this in court.

735
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,660
Your Highness,

736
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:16,500
do you know why Princess Pingyue
wanted to kill Chen Houzhao?

737
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,940
Pray tell.

738
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,620
Stand up and speak.

739
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,060
Thank you, Your Highness.

740
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:29,260
Pei, brew some tea for Mr. Cui.

741
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,340
Yes, Your Highness.

742
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,220
Your Highness,

743
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:40,500
Princess Pingyue
is the Crown Prince's sister, after all.

744
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,580
While they are against
the noble families on the surface,

745
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,380
they are one of them.

746
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:45,810
Thus,

747
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,740
she could investigate
the Qin Family's case

748
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,260
and the military provisions
and funds case,

749
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,380
but she cannot harm the foundation
of the noble families.

750
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,180
His Majesty implemented

751
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:56,660
the imperial examination
to balance noble families.

752
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,700
There are so many people involved
in this case

753
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,180
and she is in a precarious position.

754
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,980
Therefore, she will not take the case.

755
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,460
Not only will she reject it,

756
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,020
but she also has to protect the position
of noble families.

757
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,540
If those noble families fall,
so will the Crown Prince.

758
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:17,540
Thus, she must kill Chen Houzhao.

759
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,700
You already knew
that she'd kill Chen Houzhao

760
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,540
before you sent him to her?

761
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,540
I said I'd give you and Prince Su

762
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,580
the Inspectorate Office.

763
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,220
Did you think

764
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,220
I was joking?

765
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,380
We lured her into killing Chen Houzhao.

766
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,940
With that, we got something on her.

767
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,100
Then,

768
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,380
we can force her to take
the wronged candidate case.

769
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,020
She doesn't want to handle the case.

770
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,260
Besides, we got something on her.

771
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,620
Leaving the Inspectorate Office

772
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,580
is her best option.

773
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,060
Once she's gone,

774
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,100
someone has to run the office.

775
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,460
Whoever is willing
to investigate this case

776
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:00,620
is the new leader
of the Inspectorate Office.

777
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,020
Your Highness,

778
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:08,820
His Majesty appreciates your background
as a commoner.

779
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,260
That is Prince Su's foundation.

780
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,340
The harsher you are toward
those noble families,

781
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:17,820
the more His Majesty is fond of you.

782
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:21,580
Princess Pingyue was investigating
the noble families.

783
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,140
Thus, she was allowed
to establish the Inspectorate Office.

784
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:26,660
If you want to earn His Majesty's favor,

785
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:31,540
you'll have to be more ruthless
than Princess Pingyue.

786
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,100
Your Highness.

787
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,500
I'm Consort Rou's maid.

788
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:57,900
Her Highness said

789
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,740
that she hadn't seen you in a while

790
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,020
and would like to talk to you.

791
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,740
Sure. Lead the way.

792
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,860
Why is Consort Rou
