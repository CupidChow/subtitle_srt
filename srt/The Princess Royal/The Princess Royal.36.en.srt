[Adapted from Mo Shu Bai's novel,
The Princess Royal on jjwxc.net]

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,020
[This is a work of fiction.]

4
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 36]

5
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,940
When the Ministry of Personnel
wanted to promote any official,

6
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,980
it was done based on their merit scores.

7
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,220
As for the grading process,

8
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,020
ten marks would be deducted
if the one was from a noble family,

9
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,900
and ten marks would be awarded
if the one was a commoner.

10
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,180
He was being too impatient.

11
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,140
Actually, I understood his policies.

12
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,740
I knew what he was trying to do.

13
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,180
However, it could not be implemented

14
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,820
with just a good policy alone.

15
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,460
He just ascended the throne
not long ago.

16
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,780
And he was making such a huge move
immediately.

17
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,740
Many local prestigious families
naturally disagreed with him.

18
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,620
Although he issued the order,

19
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,420
his subjects didn't proceed with it.

20
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,700
Or,

21
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,660
they might twist his policy on purpose

22
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,100
and increase the people's burden.

23
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,100
He wanted to establish his authority
by killing those who disobeyed him.

24
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,860
But after that, he realized

25
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,500
that he couldn't even take
down a second-rate noble family.

26
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,740
In the late winter
during the third year of Dexu Era,

27
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,740
he ignored Pei Wenxuan's advice

28
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,460
and ordered Qin Lin to kill

29
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,900
the leader of a small local clan.

30
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,700
This led to rebellions in that area
for three consecutive years.

31
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,180
Initially, that place wasn't that bad.

32
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,540
But in the end...

33
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,260
it became a desolate place.

34
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,260
Under such circumstances,

35
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,820
there's no other way
but to change the system.

36
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,100
By abolishing the noble families,

37
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,300
millions of common people
could be saved.

38
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,900
Your Highness, what if it were you?

39
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,580
What would you do by then?

40
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,620
But are you capable enough
to kill someone from the noble families?

41
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:07,780
Your Highness!

42
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:09,940
Your Majesty...

43
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,900
You may leave as well.

44
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,940
Your Highness, you might not know,

45
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,060
but Li Chuan would

46
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,420
lock himself up
in the Imperial Study overnight

47
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,940
right after you questioned him
every time.

48
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,220
I had no idea indeed.

49
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,420
It's because you always
took him for a boy.

50
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,300
But you need to know something.

51
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,060
If an emperor

52
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,500
realized that he was incompetent,

53
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,180
the sense of shame would drive him mad.

54
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,060
The conflict between Li Chuan
and the noble families

55
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,380
could never be resolved.

56
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,060
And, it'd only be further intensified.

57
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,540
Shangguan Ya would be caught
in a dilemma between them.

58
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,140
Li Chuan told me this before.

59
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,140
Whenever he saw Shangguan Ya

60
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,380
and her valuable accessories,

61
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,740
he would be reminded
of the people who were starving.

62
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,780
Your Majesty.

63
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,180
However, Shangguan Ya

64
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,460
only thought
that she was inferior to Qin Zhenzhen.

65
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,540
The more she dolled herself up
and tried to be gentle and considerate,

66
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,260
the more Li Chuan hated her.

67
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,540
In the end,

68
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,540
they even started sleeping
in different rooms.

69
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,740
Your Majesty.

70
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,460
Therefore, Shangguan Ya sought my aid.

71
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,020
Since it has come to this,

72
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,980
I'm not expecting him
to develop any feelings for me.

73
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,300
But my family has been pressuring me.

74
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,020
They hoped that I could
give birth to an heir apparent.

75
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,820
But now, they have no idea

76
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,860
that I don't even have the chance

77
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,980
to sleep with him.

78
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,180
As the Emperor,

79
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,980
you shouldn't favor Qin Zhenzhen alone.

80
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,140
Shangguan Ya is the Empress after all.

81
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,420
If people find out

82
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,860
that you haven't
slept with her in a long time,

83
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,740
you'll receive many memorials
complaining about you.

84
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,260
I don't like her.

85
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,180
Don't I even have the right

86
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,140
to choose?

87
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,180
You don't have the right to choose

88
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,300
until after she gives birth
to an heir apparent.

89
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,740
You're the ruler of the state.

90
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,060
Shangguan Ya is the Empress.

91
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,860
Heading to Qionghua Palace
and getting yourself an heir apparent

92
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,700
is one of your duties as well.

93
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,060
Rong.

94
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,260
Tell me what's the difference between me

95
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,260
and the courtesans in the brothels.

96
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:47,940
Your Majesty!

97
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,300
Summon the imperial physician!

98
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,180
No need for that.

99
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,380
I visited the Empress
after leaving my palace.

100
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,860
I just took some aphrodisiacs.

101
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:57,740
I'm fine.

102
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,220
Your Majesty, you...

103
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,540
I've already completed

104
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,420
the task assigned to me
by Princess Royal.

105
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,460
Did Shangguan Ya know about this?

106
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,660
She should know about this.

107
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,740
Actually, Shangguan Ya
took some aphrodisiacs as well.

108
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,100
Shangguan Ya was a proud person.

109
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,140
But she was trapped
within the palace like livestock

110
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,580
just because she had to give birth
to an heir apparent.

111
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,820
Even so, she could
only suffer in silence.

112
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,700
What happened after that?

113
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,820
Your Majesty!

114
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,300
All of you may leave.

115
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,220
No need for formalities. You may rise.

116
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,660
Thank you, Your Majesty.

117
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,100
I know

118
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,140
that you are taking aphrodisiacs
before you come to see me every time.

119
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,340
From now on,

120
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,380
let's be honest with each other.

121
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,780
You can be an empress all you like.

122
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,580
I can provide you
with all the power you want.

123
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,740
Let's drop

124
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,300
the act.

125
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,340
For some matters,

126
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,820
we can discuss
and resolve them together.

127
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,300
We shouldn't be trapped by the palace.

128
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,260
In the future,

129
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,220
you can stay out of my affairs.
What do you think?

130
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,700
But Your Majesty...

131
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,060
I abandoned myself

132
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,740
and the love
that was supposed to be mine

133
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,220
not to hear you

134
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,580
telling me
that we should mind our own business

135
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,580
in this place.

136
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,140
Your Majesty, I'm not here
to fulfill your wish either.

137
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,380
I'm not here to fulfill your wish

138
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,900
of obtaining the love you want.

139
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,180
Don't you desire to leave the palace?

140
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,740
What do you desire, then?

141
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:39,820
I...

142
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,180
I desire a child.

143
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,140
Someone!

144
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,620
Bring us the liquor.

145
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,660
Your Majesty.

146
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,580
Your Majesty,
it was my fault before this.

147
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,060
From now on, I won't care
about who you'll visit at night.

148
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,300
But I need you to make me a promise.

149
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,740
What else do you desire

150
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,180
besides having a child?

151
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,940
The position of Empress.

152
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,700
No problem.

153
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,660
You'll be the Empress

154
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,460
as long as I'm the Emperor.

155
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,340
Thank you, Your Majesty.

156
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,820
As for the child,

157
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,340
I shall assist you
in completing the task.

158
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,180
If so, Your Majesty,

159
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,460
I hope you can spare some time
for our next intimate session.

160
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,420
All right. I understand.

161
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,740
Your Majesties,

162
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,260
the Imperial Medical Bureau
has sent us a piece of news.

163
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,940
They said that Consort Qin was pregnant.

164
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,460
She's pregnant?

165
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,300
Hurry. I'm going to see her now.

166
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,780
Your Majesty, you should hurry
and check on Consort Qin.

167
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,140
Hurry!

168
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,660
What's with the urgent meeting?

169
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,820
His Majesty has decided

170
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,100
that he would never be intimate
with another woman

171
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,900
in the harem besides Consort Qin.

172
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,660
This morning, Consort Qin
has been confirmed to be pregnant.

173
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,260
Therefore...

174
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,180
I need a man.

175
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,060
Anyone is fine.

176
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,940
I need to have a child.

177
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,140
A child?

178
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,260
What happened after that?

179
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,220
Back then...

180
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,020
you were intending to leave the capital.

181
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,380
Li Chuan's evil intentions
are obvious to all.

182
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,100
If he truly aided a commoner prince
to ascend the throne,

183
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,060
by then..

184
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,180
it shall be the end
of the noble families.

185
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,700
Mr. Shangguan,

186
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,820
I'm sure you know this as well.

187
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,700
I'm just an idle wanderer.

188
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,300
This has nothing to do with me.

189
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,660
I'll take my leave.

190
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,660
Ya is having a rough time in the palace.

191
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,980
She needs someone.

192
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,660
She needs a man.

193
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:09,980
Greetings, Your Majesty.

194
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,300
What are you doing here?

195
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,180
I'm here to keep you company.

196
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,740
Leave.

197
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,540
I don't want you to be here.

198
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,380
But you don't have a choice.

199
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,740
It's too late for me
to turn back either.

200
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,460
I don't want you...

201
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,740
to see me in such a pathetic state.

202
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,780
In this life...

203
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,340
I'm willing to descend
into hell with you.

204
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,220
I'm willing to descend
into the underworld with you.

205
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,140
Two months later,

206
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,140
Shangguan Ya
was confirmed to be pregnant.

207
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,620
But the date of her child's birth
was awkward.

208
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,420
Even now, I don't know

209
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,220
who's the father of that child.

210
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,380
Did Chuan know about that?

211
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,580
Back then, Li Chuan didn't even know

212
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,420
that Su Ronghua and Shangguan Ya
had an affair.

213
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,340
When the commoners

214
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,900
saw that Li Chuan favored Qin Zhenzhen

215
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,900
and that she was pregnant,

216
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,180
they started spreading rumors

217
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,180
and fabricated miracles.

218
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,620
Some of the commoner officials
even submitted memorials

219
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,500
saying that her child would be
the Emperor's eldest son.

220
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,180
They said he would be the Crown Prince
after his birth.

221
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,820
They were actually cornering
Qin Zhenzhen by doing so.

222
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,540
Most of the commoners
came from humble families.

223
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,980
They had no idea about the dirty tricks
within the palace.

224
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,980
And, Qin Zhenzhen

225
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,140
also knew that she was in danger.

226
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,780
In order to express
that she and her child

227
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,860
had no intention of usurping the throne,

228
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,220
she even submitted a memorial,

229
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,020
hoping Li Xin would be selected
as the Crown Prince instead.

230
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,980
I only found out what he felt like

231
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,540
by today.

232
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,860
Back then, Li Chuan

233
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,580
didn't wish to start a conflict
with the noble families.

234
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,620
He felt guilty
toward Shangguan Ya as well.

235
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,780
Therefore,

236
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,740
he instructed me
to draft an imperial edict.

237
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,020
He intended to select Li Xin
as the Crown Prince.

238
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,260
But all of a sudden, rumors started
spreading among the people.

239
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,420
They said a strange bird

240
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,100
alighted at the entrance
of Qingfeng Taoist Temple.

241
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,780
They said it was a phoenix

242
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,460
and that it was a sign
that the Empress would be dethroned.

243
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,460
The noble families couldn't tolerate it
any longer after hearing that.

244
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,940
Therefore, Su Ronghua poisoned

245
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,900
Qin Zhenzhen to death personally.

246
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,820
Initially, you wanted
to take Li Ping's life.

247
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,180
But Qin Zhenzhen was
protecting Li Ping all the time.

248
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,020
She lived and ate together with him.

249
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,820
She tried every piece of food,
every medicine,

250
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,860
and every drop of water
before she fed him.

251
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,460
In the end,

252
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,460
Qin Zhenzhen was poisoned.

253
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,980
She managed to protect Li Ping.

254
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,180
I actually tried to take a child's life?

255
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,460
Ronghua, you don't need
to blame yourself for this.

256
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,300
You were just bewitched by Shangguan Xu.

257
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,020
After Qin Zhenzhen's death,

258
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,260
Li Chuan could no longer tolerate

259
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,580
the noble families.

260
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,100
It wasn't only
because of the death of his beloved.

261
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,660
It was also because he recognized

262
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,540
how incompetent he was.

263
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,060
It was driving him crazy.

264
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,420
When he was keeping vigil
beside Qin Zhenzhen's coffin...

265
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,180
[Memorial Tablet
of Noble Consort Zhenjing]

266
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:08,940
[of the Qin Clan]

267
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,580
The Crown Prince hasn't been selected.

268
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,500
Your Majesty, please select your heir
as soon as possible.

269
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:18,460
Please select Li Xin, the son born
by the Empress, as the Crown Prince

270
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,500
to set the record straight.

271
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,260
When you deal with devils,

272
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,180
you have to be a devil yourself.

273
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,260
Only then will you
stand a chance to win.

274
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,180
Transmit my edict.

275
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,300
To stabilize
the foundation of the state,

276
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,420
I shall select Li Xin
as the Crown Prince.

277
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,060
Hurry and return with me.

278
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,220
Come with me.

279
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,340
All of the officials are waiting...

280
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,260
All of the officials
are waiting for you.

281
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,780
They're waiting for you
to make a decision.

282
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,380
You have plenty of memorials to review.

283
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,780
Look at what you're doing right now.

284
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,300
Are you truly going
to disregard the state affairs

285
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,020
for a woman?

286
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,100
Do you forget
what you are supposed to do?

287
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,820
Do you forget who you are?

288
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,740
Who am I?

289
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,140
You're the Emperor.

290
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,380
No. I'm Li Chuan.

291
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,700
Li Chuan.

292
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,980
I'm Li Chuan!

293
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,740
Back then, I thought

294
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,340
Chuan was the one who had changed.

295
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,980
The noble families also thought

296
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:53,940
that Li Chuan compromised with them

297
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,660
by selecting
their preferred heir apparent.

298
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,620
But in reality,

299
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,620
Li Chuan

300
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,860
turned into
a tyrannical ruler after that.

301
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,020
His emotions were unstable
and increased heavy and onerous taxes.

302
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,580
He favored the commoners and killed
the noble families randomly.

303
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,420
He couldn't care less
about the ongoing war,

304
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,100
the people, and justice.

305
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,540
He only wanted to topple

306
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,260
[Wang's Mansion]
the noble families.

307
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,540
In those years,
the Great Xia endured turbulent storms

308
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,940
and widespread conflicts.

309
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,340
He favored the commoners
and killed the noble families randomly.

310
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,980
Many of the commoner officials
turned out to be corrupt and greedy.

311
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,180
No one lived in peace.

312
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,300
Our family tried everything we could

313
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,460
to persuade the new ruler
and comfort the people.

314
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,260
We expended countless wealth
to relieve the people,

315
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,460
using up all our troops and food.

316
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,860
He supported Qin Lin's troops
with tax money.

317
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,980
He even approached
Shangguan Ya on purpose

318
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,100
to make people believe

319
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,700
that he adored Li Xin.

320
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,620
But in reality,

321
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,020
he was using Shangguan Ya
as his protective charm.

322
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,540
Therefore, back then,

323
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,740
he was depleting the forces
of the Shangguan Family

324
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,500
by taking advantage of the local troops.

325
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,660
In the end, it turned out

326
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,300
that those were all parts
of Li Chuan's plot.

327
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,780
He wanted to suppress the noble families

328
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,700
through rebellions.

329
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,340
Through my investigation,

330
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,660
I also found out the culprit
who killed Qin Zhenzhen.

331
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,100
It's actually him?

332
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,100
Your Majesty, what do you plan to do?

333
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,260
Why did His Majesty summon us here?

334
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,300
I have no idea either.

335
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,380
Aunt.

336
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,020
Ya?

337
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,820
Aunt, did you summon us here?

338
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,460
This is...

339
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,140
This is bad!

340
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,220
Run!

341
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,620
Run!

342
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,900
Chuan, what are you up to?

343
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,460
How did Qin Zhenzhen die?

344
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,140
Whose son is he?

345
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,460
Your Majesty, I don't know
what you're talking about.

346
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,660
Your Majesty, this is
your biological son.

347
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,820
Chuan, your offspring concerns
the foundation of the state.

348
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,260
You mustn't spout nonsense
without any evidence.

349
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,820
None of you want
to tell me the truth, right?

350
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,180
Father!

351
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,340
Father!

352
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,700
If you intend to kill them,

353
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,620
you must kill me first!

354
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,380
Tell me!

355
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,100
Whose son is he?

356
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,860
He's your son!

357
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,860
Your Majesty, if you don't believe me,

358
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,420
why don't we do a blood test?

359
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,420
Fine.

360
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,420
Someone!

361
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,420
Your Majesty.

362
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,460
Do you have anything else to say?

363
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,700
You made me a promise.

364
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,180
You said you wouldn't

365
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,740
depose me as the Empress
as long as you're the Emperor.

366
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,860
I was partly responsible

367
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,540
for Qin Zhenzhen's death as well.

368
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,780
What if I trade my life...

369
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,540
for Ya and Xin?

370
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,100
Will you be satisfied with that?

371
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,340
Why did you kill her?

372
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,540
For the sake of the Shangguan Family.

373
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:35,700
All right.

374
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,860
I'll grant you your wish.

375
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:10,460
Aunt! Aunt!

376
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,260
Father!

377
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,300
Father!

378
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,380
Father!

379
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,220
Why?

380
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,780
Li Chuan, why did you do so?

381
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,300
I intend to go on
another expedition to the North.

382
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,420
Make preparations for it.

383
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,220
Your Majesty, you mustn't do so!

384
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:46,940
Your Majesty.

385
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:48,900
Our country has been

386
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,860
on various expeditions
for the past few years.

387
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,860
The national treasury is empty now.

388
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,700
We can't afford such expenditures.

389
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,100
We can't afford it?

390
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,660
Have we truly run out of money?

391
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,580
But they didn't understand
His Majesty's intentions.

392
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,820
The expedition wasn't
His Majesty's true goal at all.

393
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,900
His Majesty merely wanted to use
their military power

394
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,220
to suffocate
and choke the noble families.

395
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,780
During the eighth year of Dexu Era,

396
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,620
Li Chuan gathered
a substantial number of forces.

397
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,860
He wanted to slander Prince Su
for plotting a rebellion.

398
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,460
He requested our family to send
our troops and quell the rebellion.

399
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,340
Prince Su intends to plot a rebellion.

400
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,420
After giving it some thought,

401
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,700
I realize that
only your Su Family can be trusted.

402
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,500
Are you willing
to send your troops for me?

403
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,860
His Majesty has wanted to get rid
of Prince Su long ago.

404
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:45,140
However, he wishes to eliminate him
using our power.

405
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,780
Father, Rongqing,

406
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,220
just sacrifice me.

407
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,580
You knew that those were all excuses.

408
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,580
Even so,
you still stood up for Prince Su.

409
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,500
I was once Prince Su's tutor.

410
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,140
I'm willing to swear upon my life

411
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,540
that Prince Su has no intention
of betraying you at all.

412
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,860
Swear upon your life?

413
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,220
All right. I'll grant you your wish.

414
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,340
He convicted you
of conspiring with enemies.

415
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,140
Our entire clan was taken into custody.

416
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:24,460
He intended to execute our entire clan.

417
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,300
Someone.

418
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,140
The Su Family is treasonous and immoral
who intends to rebel.

419
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,300
They're conspiring with Prince Su.

420
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,220
Transmit my edict.

421
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:32,900
The entire Su Family

422
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,780
is to be executed.

423
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

424
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,860
Your Majesty, I'm innocent!
Your Majesty!

425
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,340
Our entire family was executed?

426
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,140
What we face today
is what you will face tomorrow!

427
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,020
Back then,

428
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,460
I had no idea that you had
an affair with Shangguan Ya.

429
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,700
I just felt we were wronged.

430
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,620
Princess Pingyue

431
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,300
knew that our family was maligned.

432
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,260
She wanted to rescue us.

433
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,260
Your Majesty,

434
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,940
the Su Family has been a renowned clan
for a century.

435
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,460
They contributed
to the foundation of the state.

436
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,180
If you execute their entire clan,

437
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,940
you'll make all the people
feel bitterly disappointed.

438
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,700
Your Majesty, as the Princess Royal,
I implore you

439
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,420
to spare the Su Family.

440
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:11,740
Forget it.

441
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,620
They might be spared from execution,

442
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,780
but they will still be punished.

443
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,580
Castrate Su Rongqing.

444
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,380
Your Majesty,

445
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,820
Su Ronghua already took his own life
with this jade hairpin.

446
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,340
Ronghua!

447
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,140
Even so, he still needs to be castrated.

448
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,100
What do you think...

449
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,580
about this hairpin?

450
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,420
It looks nice.

451
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,540
But it looks like

452
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,380
it was used before.

453
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,380
I wonder

454
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,460
who the owner of this hairpin is.

455
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,740
I got this from Su Ronghua.

456
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,180
I heard that you two were very close.

457
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,460
Therefore, I was thinking

458
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,420
of giving it to you as a keepsake.

459
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,940
But he's quite gutsy too.

460
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,140
He could have survived
if he endured the castration.

461
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,300
But he used this hairpin

462
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,140
to stab his own neck instead.

463
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,260
He's dead.

464
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:49,780
He's dead!

465
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,780
Back then, I missed you very much,
Your Highness.

466
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,660
You were like
the only light in the entire palace.

467
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,700
All lights
would be extinguished eventually.

468
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,220
Only you

469
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,420
could move forward forever.

470
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,220
Due to the various wars,

471
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,860
the people could no longer
tolerate the situation.

472
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,420
And the noble families
were running out of patience.

473
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,180
According to my knowledge,

474
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,620
there were no
less than 20 noble families

475
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,220
who wanted to start a rebellion.

476
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,740
During those eight years,
the commoners rose from their ranks

477
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,260
while the noble families
fell from grace.

478
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,100
The state was already a spent force.

479
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,500
He couldn't just corner all of them.

480
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,340
If not, they'd perish together.

481
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,540
Therefore, he chose
to cultivate immortality

482
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,860
and make you the Regent Princess Royal,

483
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,340
supervising the state on his behalf.

484
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,660
It's his way of telling
the noble families

485
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,140
that he's calling for a truce.

486
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,740
He wanted the noble families
to have peace of mind.

487
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,140
Because of that,

488
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,660
he couldn't do anything to Shangguan Ya
even if he wanted to.

489
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,900
He dared not do so.

490
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,740
Therefore, he could only wait
for another opportunity before he acted.

491
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,620
I was the head of the commoners

492
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,300
while you represented
the noble families.

493
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,460
We balanced each other out
and formed an alliance.

494
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,420
The next decade in the Great Xia

495
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,180
was spent recuperating
from its old wounds,

496
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,140
finally ushering in a new golden era.

497
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,100
However, a decade...

498
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,980
A decade was too long.

499
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,820
The decade after that

500
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,100
was so long that everything had changed.

501
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,860
It was so long that people forgot
how it looked like originally.

502
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,660
It was so long that they could
no longer see the path ahead.

503
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,900
They also forgot the way home.

504
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,540
The fate has started changing
once again.

505
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,340
It was another decisive moment.

506
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,220
Your Highness,

507
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,460
since you already know about the past,

508
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,500
will you abandon

509
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,580
the Crown Prince?

510
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,380
Ronghua.

511
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,020
The story is over.

512
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,060
Will you still stop me...

513
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,540
from stopping the Crown Prince?

514
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,300
I understand what you're saying.

515
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,180
Yes. He does have his own difficulties.

516
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,860
However, even so,
I can't just forgive him

517
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,300
for what he did.

518
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,660
When it comes to suffering,

519
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,460
everyone is the same.

520
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,700
I understand.

521
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:41,860
If so, tomorrow,

522
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,900
I'll take you to visit the Crown Prince.

523
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,420
After that, I'll take you
to see Su Rongqing.

524
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:52,660
Well...

525
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,140
Are you willing to let me
join hands with Su Rongqing?

526
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,500
Your Highness,
no matter what you wish to do,

527
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,140
I will follow.

528
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,420
It's fine as long as you understand

529
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,940
what you truly desire

530
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,220
and don't regret your decision.

531
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:23,860
Rongqing.

532
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,340
Is that dream

533
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,660
true or false?

534
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,540
I've tested it.

535
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,460
It's true.

536
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:37,780
Was that the reason

537
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,620
why you joined hands with Consort Rou?

538
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,780
Were you trying to stop the Crown Prince
from ascending the throne?

539
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,340
That's right.

540
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,180
If you kill the Crown Prince,

541
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,860
you're destined
to be Princess Pingyue's foe.

542
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,260
Have you given up on Princess Pingyue?

543
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,300
That's right.

544
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,020
Don't you think it's a shame?

545
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,900
Why haven't you tried to change it then?

546
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,540
Change it?

547
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:16,380
Ronghua, how can I change it?

548
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,460
Did our family let down Li Chuan?

549
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,620
Or did we have too much influence
and power?

550
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,700
As the ruler, Li Chuan

551
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,740
only had wild ambitions.

552
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,540
He was utterly ignorant.

553
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,020
He acted out recklessly, started wars,

554
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,420
burdened the people,
damaged the economy,

555
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,380
made blind reformations,
and suppressed the noble families.

556
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,460
He favored the commoners
and corrupt officials

557
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,100
and disregarded the people
of the Great Xia.

558
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,180
Do you think his deeds
weren't absurd enough?

559
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,020
When he ascended the throne,

560
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,500
the population of the Great Xia
was about 90 million.

561
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,380
After eight years,

562
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,460
only eight years,

563
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,220
the population became
less than 70 million.

564
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,700
Those 20 million people...

565
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,140
Even if I want to change it,
where should I begin?

566
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,860
That was what his temperament was
back then.

567
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,820
He just looked virtuous on the surface.

568
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,540
Ronghua.

569
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,100
I do love Princess Pingyue.

570
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,380
However, I have my own boundaries.

571
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,140
Rongqing.

572
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,380
We don't need to justify ourselves

573
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,940
so grandiosely.

574
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,300
We should just admit it.

575
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,540
The noble families are the tumors
of the Great Xia.

576
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,300
So, Ronghua...

577
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,100
do you still intend to help Li Chuan
ascend the throne?

578
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,140
Is that so?

579
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,180
I'm not helping anyone.

580
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,220
Rongqing, rest well.

581
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,940
I'll discuss this with Father.

582
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,100
Can you tell Father about this
in two more days?

583
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,620
I'm still wounded.

584
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,580
I'm worried
that Father might lose his temper.

585
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,620
I might not be able
to endure his punishment.

586
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:17,940
Don't worry.

587
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,420
Just rest and recuperate.

588
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,220
Take good care of yourself.

589
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:55,980
Zhenzhen.

590
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,460
Lin, how are you?

591
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:05,980
Come with me.

592
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,260
Let's talk over here.

593
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:07,780
All right.

594
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,340
Lin, I've been inquiring
about your whereabouts

595
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,420
ever since I escaped
from the military camp.

596
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,260
They didn't find your body.

597
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,540
I knew

598
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,660
that you were still alive.

599
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,060
Sorry for making you worried.

600
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,300
I've been hiding here

601
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,780
as I am wounded.

602
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,780
Lin, I've got you some ointment.

603
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,860
Your wound will heal faster

604
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,460
if you use this.

605
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,380
What do you plan to do next?

606
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,660
Our foundation is in the Northwest.

607
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,700
We have to retrieve our military power.

608
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,540
How dare you two return?

609
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,580
You're pretty careless, aren't you?

610
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,260
Were you so certain

611
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,660
that I was already dead?

612
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,820
You shouldn't have betrayed yourself.

613
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,700
Retrieve the tiger tally.

614
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,500
Yes.

615
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,500
I have the tiger tally!
Warriors, heed my order!

616
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,940
I've slain the traitor, Cui Qinghe!

617
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,660
Those who are willing to follow me,
come out!

618
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,820
Those who aren't willing to follow me,

619
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,020
you may leave.

620
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,580
I won't make things difficult for you.

621
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,660
General Qin,

622
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,540
you've taken great care of us.

623
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,060
General Qin, all of us

624
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,380
know your character well.

625
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,340
General Qin,
we're willing to follow you.

626
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,340
General Qin,
we're willing to follow you.

627
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,900
Your Highness,
we've received news from the palace.

628
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,340
They say
that Prince Su is out of danger.

629
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,780
He's fine now.

630
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,780
If that's the case,

631
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,820
at most, by tonight,

632
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,540
His Majesty will take action.

633
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:40,740
Should we visit the Crown Prince now?

634
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,060
If we don't go now,

635
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,540
we might not have the chance
to do so in the future.

636
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,020
Since you already said so,

637
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,580
I don't think I have a choice here.

638
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,540
Su Ronghua.

639
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,620
Su Rongqing lost his mind long ago.

640
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,660
He formed an alliance
with Consort Rou long ago

641
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,060
and supported Prince Su.

642
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,380
He framed Pei Wenxuan by using Hongde.

643
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,780
For the military provisions
and funds case,

644
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,540
the imperial examination fraud case,
and the assassination

645
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,620
on Winter Festivity,
he was involved in all of them.

646
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,660
He won't allow the Crown Prince
to ascend the throne.

647
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:26,740
And now, the Crown Prince
will no longer tolerate him.

648
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,380
Initially,

649
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,220
I thought His Majesty was
the only major obstacle

650
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,140
between us.

651
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,220
I thought we could be together

652
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,580
once the Crown Prince
ascended the throne.

653
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,060
Actually, you were right.

654
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,500
I drew the same conclusion as well.

655
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,940
But later, I gradually realized

656
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,700
that Su Rongqing couldn't
tolerate the Crown Prince.

657
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,540
And you

658
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,540
couldn't give up on Su Rongqing.

659
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,660
I once asked you

660
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,500
if you were willing to be
the master of the Su Family.

661
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,620
Now,

662
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,660
I'll ask you again.

663
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,260
Are you willing to do so?

664
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,580
Seems like you're not willing to do so.

665
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,940
The Crown Prince is the foundation
of my Shangguan Family.

666
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,980
It's impossible for me
to give up on the Crown Prince.

667
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,580
I can't betray my family either.

668
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,020
Therefore, you see,

669
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,380
our relationship will only end up

670
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:05,940
in a deadlock.

671
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,500
Ronghua.

672
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,140
Let me call you this way that once.

673
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,060
I'm very grateful to you.

674
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,740
Thanks for showing me

675
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,620
