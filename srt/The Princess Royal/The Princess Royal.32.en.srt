00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,030
[The Princess Royal]

2
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,950
[Adapted from Mo Shu Bai's novel,
The Princess Royal on jjwxc.net]

3
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,020
[This is a work of fiction.]

4
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 32]

5
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,620
Mother handed this token to me.

6
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,060
She told me to kill Li Chuan
at the soonest.

7
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,540
It would be better
if we could get Li Rong killed.

8
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,220
Kill the Crown Prince?

9
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,060
Uncle,

10
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,940
Mother can't be saved now.

11
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,620
The only way out now

12
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,980
is to kill Li Chuan as soon as possible.

13
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,140
In this way,

14
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,620
Cheng will be the only prince.

15
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,820
He will also be the only successor.

16
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,540
Father is near death.

17
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,100
Once he dies,

18
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,180
Cheng can ascend the throne immediately.

19
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,460
When that time comes,

20
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,860
you will be the Emperor's uncle

21
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,380
and I will be the Princess Royal.

22
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,060
Look how prestigious
the Shangguan Family is now.

23
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,020
Uncle.

24
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,460
This is the only way
to save Cheng and Mother.

25
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,620
When Li Chuan ascends the throne,

26
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,260
do you think
he and Li Rong will let us go?

27
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,980
The Shangguan Family
has long been hostile to us.

28
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,260
Are you going to sit idly by
and wait for our demise?

29
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,420
Are you just going to

30
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,340
watch Mother die and do nothing?

31
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,180
Even if we kill Li Chuan,
we can't save your mother.

32
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,620
It's not that I refuse to help you.

33
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,100
I'm just thinking of a foolproof plan.

34
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,180
How about this?

35
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,780
Go back and have some rest.

36
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,180
Let me think it over.

37
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,340
But time is pressing.

38
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,660
I don't know if we can wait
until this year's Winter Festivity.

39
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,860
That would be a good opportunity.

40
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,060
All right. I'll wait for your decision.

41
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,860
But you must make haste.

42
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,900
See the Princess out.

43
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,180
Take a seat.

44
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,260
What was Her Highness thinking?

45
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,380
She actually told Princess Huayue
to assassinate the Crown Prince.

46
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,820
It's so ridiculous.

47
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,060
If the Crown Prince were that easy
to assassinate,

48
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,300
would he still be alive today?

49
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,820
Being hard to assassinate doesn't mean
there are no opportunities.

50
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,580
Opportunities are created by people.

51
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,100
They just fear the cost.

52
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,220
My sister has come this far,

53
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,140
which shows she isn't foolish.

54
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,140
Do you really think she believes
Huayue can kill Li Chuan?

55
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,900
She just found a scapegoat
for those who have the intention.

56
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,580
There are quite a few
who want Li Chuan dead.

57
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,140
If Huayue is willing

58
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,820
to take the fall for that,

59
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,060
I think

60
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,700
many would be willing to help her.

61
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:22,980
Then,

62
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,020
is Her Highness planning
to abandon Princess Huayue?

63
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,380
Sacrificing a daughter's life

64
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,340
to secure a son's throne

65
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,900
isn't a bad deal in her eyes.

66
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,380
After Prince Su ascends the throne
in the future,

67
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,820
he can confer a posthumous title
to Princess Huayue

68
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,740
as a comfort.

69
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,260
This family doesn't have

70
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,780
a single decent person.

71
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,380
Look at Huayue.

72
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,620
She constantly mentions
the position of Princess Royal.

73
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,260
The Princess Royal's title is far
more important than her mother's safety.

74
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
A daughter wants

75
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,620
her mother to die

76
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,820
so she can take
the position of Princess Royal.

77
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,180
A mother wants

78
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,100
her daughter to die

79
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,060
to secure the position
of Empress Dowager.

80
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,860
How interesting.

81
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,620
So,

82
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,540
are you going to sit by and watch?

83
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,980
After all, Consort Rou
and the Xiao Family

84
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,380
share their woes and fortunes.

85
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,060
Of course, I can't just do nothing.

86
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,340
Find someone to enter the palace

87
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,740
to pass a message to His Majesty.

88
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,380
Tell His Majesty

89
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,220
that Huayue is experiencing agitation

90
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,380
and intends to assassinate Li Chuan.

91
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,380
Remember.

92
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,780
This message must only reach
His Majesty.

93
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,660
No one else around him should hear it.

94
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,820
Who knows whose side they are on?

95
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,780
I'll take care of it right away.

96
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:54,780
Go.

97
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,700
Your Highness,

98
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,980
His Majesty is waiting for you there.

99
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,780
Do you know

100
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,140
why Father suddenly wants

101
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,620
to see me?

102
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,340
Your Highness,

103
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,900
I think you should

104
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,020
ask His Majesty this question yourself.

105
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,300
This way, please.

106
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,580
Your Highness,
I'll say something that I can say.

107
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,100
You and His Majesty are family by blood.

108
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,900
If you have kept things in your heart,

109
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,940
it would be better to speak openly.

110
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,660
Your Highness,
this is as far I can walk you.

111
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,780
Father.

112
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,500
Skip the formalities.

113
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:26,940
Chuan,

114
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,820
come forward

115
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,780
so I can get a good look at you.

116
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,620
Come on.

117
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,900
I never thought...

118
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,740
you were now

119
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,460
much taller than me.

120
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,860
It is

121
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,060
because I haven't been
this close to you for a long time.

122
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,940
That's why you didn't notice.

123
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,340
Are you willing...

124
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,220
to get close to me?

125
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,420
I never thought
of keeping a distance from you.

126
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,180
After all, you're my only father.

127
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,620
But

128
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,140
I am not your only son.

129
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,380
I never thought

130
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,300
you would think this way.

131
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,700
Do you always think

132
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,260
that I've been
seizing the throne from you?

133
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,420
Isn't that so?

134
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,260
I never thought of that.

135
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,700
I have no interest

136
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,620
in the throne.

137
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,820
It's just that there are some people
I want to protect.

138
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,740
It's Rong and Mother.

139
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,340
Do you know your mother

140
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,220
has always prioritized the interests
of the Shangguan Family?

141
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,540
She is not just your mother.

142
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,260
She also represents

143
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,140
the Shangguan Family's interests
in the entire Great Xia.

144
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,340
Can't you and Mother be of one mind?

145
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,060
No.

146
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,020
Why?

147
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,020
Because I am the ruler
of all the people on this land,

148
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,540
not just the ruler
of the noble families.

149
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,020
Those noble families

150
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,980
rely on their immense power

151
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,180
and don't care about the lives
of the common people.

152
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,260
Even if you inherit the throne,

153
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,580
you will be nothing more
than a puppet of the noble families.

154
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,540
This is not what I wish for.

155
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,300
Then why did you summon me

156
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,700
today?

157
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,300
I just need to know your stance.

158
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,780
Will you choose me

159
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,540
or your mother?

160
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,660
Father.

161
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,660
I'm the only son my mother has.

162
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,900
She has no other choice.

163
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,060
Think about this carefully.

164
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,500
I am offering you

165
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,700
this whole country

166
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,900
and the rightful throne.

167
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,820
But I care more

168
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,060
about whether I can keep my sister

169
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,580
and mother safe.

170
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,780
Have you thought it through?

171
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:36,420
Father, thank you for raising me.

172
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,820
The Winter Festivity will take place
in ten days.

173
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,860
Why is this year's Winter Festivity

174
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,500
scheduled so hastily?

175
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,660
I fear that His Majesty has big plans.

176
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,060
You saw
His Majesty's attitude yesterday.

177
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,900
He is clearly very reluctant

178
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,380
to give the Inspectorate Office
back to you.

179
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,940
I fear he wants to get rid of you.

180
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,020
On the day of the Winter Festivity,

181
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,860
they will probably take action.

182
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,180
Have you made up your mind?

183
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,860
If Father truly intends to kill me,

184
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,540
then Huajing will certainly
face a mutiny.

185
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,940
Right now, Father can only rely

186
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,380
on Xiao Su's army.

187
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,180
Xiao Su comes from the Northwest.

188
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,420
Before he arrives in Huajing, he will
first meet the Sus and Xies.

189
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,740
If he brings the two families' armies

190
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,980
to Huajing,

191
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,420
Chuan will surely die.

192
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,340
If they join forces with Su Rongqing,

193
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,300
do you think...

194
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,580
Do you think Chuan will act
against Father

195
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,300
to protect me?

196
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,060
If he is unwilling
to risk his life for me,

197
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,900
I will die.

198
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,100
Like Consort Rou,

199
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,300
who will die for the position
of Crown Prince.

200
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,300
Sit down first.

201
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,620
Sit.

202
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,180
For now,

203
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,340
we can only have Lin Feibai
replace Xie Chunhe

204
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,500
as the master of the Xie Family

205
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,820
and take control
of the Xie Family's military forces.

206
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,260
Then we might stand a chance to fight.

207
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,020
There are two thousand soldiers
under my family's command in the city.

208
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,580
We have also a thousand mansion guards.

209
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,820
I also have my private forces
all over Huajing.

210
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,260
If the Crown Prince cannot protect you,

211
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,420
I can escort you out of the city.

212
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,500
Once you're out of the city,
you can head to Qingzhou

213
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,980
to join your stationed troops.

214
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,820
By then, people will focus on the fight
for the throne in Huajing.

215
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,980
No one will pay attention
to your whereabouts.

216
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,340
If the Crown Prince wins,
you can come back.

217
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,220
If the Crown Prince loses,

218
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,940
you should abandon Qingzhou

219
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,420
and head to Yamato or the South Sea.

220
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,740
You don't believe me either?

221
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,940
I...

222
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,420
I just

223
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,980
suddenly feel particularly insecure.

224
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,580
Forgive me.

225
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,500
It is all right. It is not your fault.

226
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,180
It's living in this turbulent world,

227
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,300
you have to trust no one.

228
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:46,780
No worries.

229
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,100
Whenever I close my eyes

230
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,140
these days,

231
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,820
I always think of something
that happened in the past.

232
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,380
I remember

233
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,340
the last time I met Chuan,

234
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,460
he invited me to play weiqi.

235
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,460
He didn't ask
about anything related to me

236
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,060
or care about my health.

237
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,220
He just said

238
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,700
he had obtained an elixir

239
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,100
that could grant eternal life.

240
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,180
He also talked
about the issue of the heir

241
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,580
and asked my opinion about Li Ping.

242
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,660
At that time, he cared about nothing.

243
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,980
Everyone was nothing but pawns to him.

244
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,060
Pei Wenxuan.

245
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,380
They are my family.

246
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,660
I love Chuan and Mother very much.

247
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,220
But deep down,

248
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,180
I am still very scared.

249
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,740
I'm scared...

250
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,860
they don't love me that much.

251
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,260
I'm also scared

252
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,860
I don't love them that much.

253
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,660
It is all right.

254
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,620
I understand.

255
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,620
Rong.

256
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,020
What you fear

257
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,180
is that they will disappoint you.

258
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,780
But you must know

259
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,780
if you don't give them a chance

260
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,020
to prove themselves,

261
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,020
you will never know

262
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,300
that you can still trust someone

263
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,500
in this world.

264
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,140
I know

265
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,500
you don't trust Li Chuan.

266
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,260
You also don't know what he will choose.

267
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,100
But, Rong, trust me.

268
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,220
As long as I am alive,

269
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,820
I will ensure you get out of the city.

270
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,740
We had

271
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,700
such a tough life in our past life.

272
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,340
This time,

273
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,340
I will not let you live
a life of despair.

274
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,820
It will be fine.

275
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,220
Do you think

276
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,900
we both had a bad time in our past life?

277
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,020
Yes.

278
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,540
So we must not live like that
in this life.

279
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,620
Are you really not afraid of death?

280
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,780
Yes.

281
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,180
I'm more afraid

282
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,180
of losing you than of dying.

283
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,300
[Qionghua Palace]

284
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,100
So after this,

285
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,420
we are bound

286
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,940
to face Father's wrath.

287
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,220
How do you plan to deal with it?

288
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,380
I am the Empress.

289
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,580
I can't leave.

290
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,340
When that happens,
I'll face imprisonment

291
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,460
or whatever comes my way.

292
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,220
As for you,

293
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,100
if something truly happens,

294
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,380
you can escape
through the secret passage in the city.

295
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:42,740
Secret passage?

296
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,540
Go to the owner of the rouge shop

297
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,500
in the east of the city.

298
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,580
Show her my token
and tell her your identity.

299
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,300
She will help you escape.

300
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,860
Once you are out of the city,

301
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,140
head straight to Qingzhou.

302
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,220
Wait until Chuan ascends the throne,

303
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,620
then come back.

304
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,540
What about you?

305
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,940
If I leave, what will you do?

306
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,500
So long as you and Chuan are safe,

307
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,300
I will be at ease.

308
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:24,700
Mother...

309
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,380
You don't have to worry about me.

310
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,060
After all, I am your mother.

311
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,380
I have my ways to save myself.

312
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,300
You will be fine.

313
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,700
[Inspectorate Office]
You haven't been back in a while.

314
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,740
How are you settling in?

315
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,820
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

316
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,820
Your Highness, everything is stable
in the Southwest.

317
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,300
Half of the troops are already
under my command.

318
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,580
That's excellent.

319
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,020
I knew I had chosen the right person.

320
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,540
You handle the coordination with him

321
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,100
for the matters in the capital.

322
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,020
Yes, Your Highness.

323
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,580
Take care, Your Highness.

324
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,740
I will leave everything to you.

325
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,540
Yes, Your Highness.

326
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,700
After staying in the military camp
for so long,

327
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,260
you seem to speak less after returning.

328
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,780
It seems military life is quite boring.

329
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,300
It's all right.

330
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,460
The wooden cards you gave to me

331
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,140
are quite interesting.

332
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,940
The Xie Family's rules are strict.

333
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,540
It would be too difficult

334
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,540
to gain their recognition
with just my military power.

Take advantage of your status

to help me.

338
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,540
I won't interfere
in any of your matters.

My military power

340
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,740
will be your military power.

Help me gain control of the Xie Family

342
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,620

If you don't ever want this marriage,

He told me

351
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,740
military power alone won't gain
the Xie Family's recognition.

00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,180
It gives me a backache.

557
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,860
I've suffered from it for a long time.

558
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,820
It's no big deal.

559
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,180
Young Master.

560
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,620
Listen to me.

561
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,180
Even though you and Her Highness
are divorced,

562
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,500
you used to be a married couple.

563
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,260
You should go to see her more often.

564
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,540
I know.

565
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,220
You know?

566
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,820
You know nothing.

567
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:04,380
I've been reading ancient books recently.

568
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,740
Like the touching poem
of "The Peacock Flies Southeast."

569
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,180
They even look back and forth
at each other every five li.

570
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,820
They look up and sing to each other.

571
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,580
They exchanged soft endearments
all night until dawn.

572
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,780
You did read some books.

573
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,180
Your language is getting more refined.

574
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:19,940
Of course.

575
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,460
That's because I'm by your side
every day.

576
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,540
It's called...

577
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,460
Uh...

578
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,020
Influenced by what you constantly
see and hear.

579
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,380
Yes, influenced by what you constantly
see and hear.

580
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:33,780
Come on, sit closer.

581
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,020
All right.

582
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,380
Come on.

583
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,300
Bear with it. Why are you laughing?

584
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,340
I'm not. I'm just ticklish

585
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,540
and you know that.

586
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,260
Just bear with it.

587
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,340
I can't help it.

588
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,060
Keep quiet.

589
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,500
Listen.

590
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,020
Besides Her Highness,

591
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,220
you're the second person
to enjoy my massage skills.

592
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,260
You're getting older.

593
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,700
You should leave

594
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,460
this kind of heavy work to the servants.

595
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,740
If it's really too much work,

596
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,340
I'll find a few more helpers.

597
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,900
Don't wear yourself out.

598
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,780
I'm talking to you.

599
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,300
Young Master, all right.

600
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:11,940
If you don't allow me to speak,

601
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,060
how can I speak?

602
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,340
Also,

603
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,980
when you give Her Highness a massage,

604
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,380
just use thirty percent
of your strength.

605
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,380
Of course I know.

606
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,140
Now, the other side.

607
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:23,900
No, no.

608
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,100
No, I really can't stand it.

609
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,300
I'm doing this for your own good.

610
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,380
- What's wrong with you?
- Come on.

611
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,780
How can I not feel ticklish
when you poke here?

612
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,780
- You keep poking me here.
- I...

613
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:32,860
No.

614
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,660
How about this?

615
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,940
Young Master. Young Master.

616
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,820
Please. I'm begging you.

617
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,020
Mother.

618
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,900
Huayue, why are you...

619
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,780
Mother, everything is ready.

620
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,180
After I kill Li Chuan tomorrow,

621
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,460
I'll rescue you out of here.

622
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,580
Good girl.

623
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,620
You've suffered.

624
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,300
Protecting Cheng
is the most important thing.

625
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,020
This suffering is nothing.

626
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,500
At the military drill ground tomorrow,

627
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,140
Li Chuan will be like a target.

628
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,220
Those protecting him
and those trying to kill him,

629
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,300
their eyes

630
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,100
will all be on him.

631
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,620
It means Li Rong can easily escape.

632
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,300
Focus all your elite forces on Li Rong

633
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,780
and force her into the forest.

634
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,900
Spread the word to Li Chuan

635
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,700
that Li Rong will be killed.

636
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,100
But will Li Chuan save her?

637
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,620
He's not stupid.

638
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,340
He will.

639
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,700
When he comes to her rescue,
kill them both.

640
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,860
People will be useless
when they are dead.

641
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,460
To die

642
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,260
before knowing life's hardships

643
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,220
is a kind of luck.

644
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,020
All right.

645
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,740
Mother, I will take my leave first.

646
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,340
Take good care of yourself.

647
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,420
You must also protect yourself.

648
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,340
Someone just reported

649
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,460
that Xiao Su has mobilized troops

650
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,220
and is heading toward Huajing tonight.

651
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,140
How many soldiers?

652
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,300
Thirty thousand,

653
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,220
leaving twenty thousand
garrisoning the Northwest.

654
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,500
Thirty thousand?

655
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,860
Are you really going
to intercept Xiao Su

656
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,060
as Princess Pingyue instructed?

657
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,780
Princess Pingyue has helped us a lot.

658
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,740
We must repay her.

659
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,660
But Xiao Su is acting
as His Majesty instructed.

660
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,020
If you intercept him,
you will be plotting a rebellion.

661
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,220
So what?

662
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,860
Lin, I am worried about you.

663
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,060
If you're truly concerned about me,

664
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,060
keep an eye

665
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,860
on the twenty thousand soldiers
he left in the Northwest.

666
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,260
Her Highness saved the Qin Family.

667
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,780
I cannot let her down.

668
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,060
Besides,

669
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,980
with the wisdom of Her Highness
and Pei Wenxuan,

670
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,380
I have faith in them.

671
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:04,820
Qinghe,

672
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:06,940
don't worry.

673
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,900
If things go wrong,

674
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,780
leave the Great Xia from the Northwest

675
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,340
and head west.

676
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,180
General Qin, forgive me.

677
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,740
- General!
- General!

678
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:28,740
General!

679
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,100
Don't let him escape!

680
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,220
Mr. Cui, what should we do next?

681
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,020
Return to the camp

682
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,460
and wipe out the traitors.

683
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:42,820
Yes, sir.

684
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,500
Report!

685
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,500
Ms. Xun, bad news.

686
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,100
General Qin was ambushed
and stabbed at the cliff.

687
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:51,980
Mr. Cui said

688
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,300
there was an informant
who injured the general.

689
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,540
They've locked down the camp

690
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,140
and are heading our way now.

691
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,780
Ms. Xun, we must leave quickly.

692
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,000
[Attempted assassination on Qin Lin]

693
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,740
Deliver this letter
to Her Highness urgently.

694
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,140
Yes, Ms. Xun.

695
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,660
Cui Qinghe, what is the meaning of this?

696
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,900
Ms. Xun, the general was ambushed.

697
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:18,700
I am ordered to supervise the army
and arrest the suspects.

698
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,580
Please cooperate with me.

699
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,860
Disarm, drop your sword,
and come with me.

700
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,020
Cui Qinghe, so it was you

701
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,740
who betrayed my brother.

702
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,420
Get her!

703
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,140
Quickly, bring her back here!

704
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:46,220
[Su's Mansion]

705
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:46,860
Ronghua.

706
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:51,020
You never attend those kinds of events.

707
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,780
How many years has it been

708
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,820
since we went out for fun together?

709
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,380
Look at you.

710
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,900
I don't know what happened to you.

711
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,420
You've been in low spirits
these several years.

712
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,740
There seems to be a lot
weighing on your heart.

713
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,500
Are you still thinking
about Princess Pingyue?

714

Ronghua.

715
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,180
Watch your words.

716
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,620
Are you upset because of Miss Shangguan?

717
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,180
If you like her,

718
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,460
why not tell Father

719
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,780
and ask him to propose marriage
to the Shangguan Family?

720
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,460
Between our families...

721
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,500
Ya and I...

722
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,740
There are too many family affairs
involved in our relationship.

723
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,820
Once the Crown Prince
ascends the throne...

724
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,180
I will propose.
