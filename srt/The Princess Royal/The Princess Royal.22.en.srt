00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 22]

5
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,020
What are you doing?

6
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,500
Why are you scared?

7
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,660
Don't you want to know the truth?

8
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,500
Mr. Xie, do you recognize it?

9
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,660
Where did you steal it from?

10
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,580
How did you get this?

11
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,140
I've seen this same pendant

12
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,820
on a young lady
from the Xie Family.

13
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,420
How did she know about this?

14
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,620
Father, with this pendant

15
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,380
and the resemblance
between the two of them,

16
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,100
as well as the red ink,

17
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,260
I started getting suspicious.

18
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,940
So I sent someone

19
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,740
to look into Mr. Xie's past.

20
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,300
Then something surprising
was discovered.

21
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,500
I found out

22
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,500
that Mr. Xie had a love affair

23
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,380
that was once the talk of the town.

24
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,780
It's said that when Mr. Xie was young,

25
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,780
he fell in love with a woman
from the martial world.

26
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,380
But they couldn't be together

27
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,420
due to his family's objection.

28
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,820
That woman left when she was pregnant

29
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,780
and gave birth to a child by herself,

30
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,740
named Lin Feibai.

31
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,460
Her Highness was able
to investigate it clearly

32
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,260
in such a short time.

33
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,380
And Mr. Xie...

34
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,020
Could it be that...

35
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,900
went to that woman after he was married.

36
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,900
But she didn't want to be his concubine

37
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,620
and didn't want her child
to return to the Xie Family.

38
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,820
For some reason,

39
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,980
Mr. Xie agreed to this.

40
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,820
He provided her with protection

41
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,460
and helped her found
today's Seven-star Sect.

42
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,780
After listening to this story,

43
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,060
do you think it is more likely

44
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,460
that I was so insane

45
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,340
that I kept directing a man

46
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,540
to kill his biological father?

47
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,380
Or is it more likely

48
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,620
that the father and son conspired
to falsely accuse me?

49
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,980
Nonsense.

50
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,420
Then we shall test your relationship
with a drop of blood

51
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,660
from both of you
to see if I'm talking nonsense.

52
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,540
Father.

53
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,060
Get a bowl of water.

54
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,300
Your Highness.

55
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,580
Mr. Xie,

56
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,620
you're the Minister of Justice.

57
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,900
You're familiar with testing
a relationship with blood drops, right?

58
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,660
She traveled thousands of li to Huajing,

59
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,260
got pregnant out of wedlock
but was abandoned,

60
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,420
and then was alone ever since.

61
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,180
Mr. Lin, as a child,

62
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,100
don't you feel sorry for your mother?

63
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,940
Mr. Xie, you're not moving.

64
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,620
Is it because you're not feeling well

65
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,340
or because you dare not do this?

66
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,740
Mr. Xie.

67
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,180
Xie Lanqing!

68
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:14,980
Impossible.

69
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,460
This is impossible.

70
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,580
Your Majesty, someone's framing me.

71
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,660
This result is false.

72
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,620
It can't prove

73
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,460
that this assassin and I
are father and son.

74
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,700
I don't know him.

75
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,660
Mr. Xie.

76
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,780
You tried
to assassinate Her Highness

77
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,300
and then colluded
with your son to frame her.

78
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,780
And even now,

79
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,820
you are still not willing
to confess to your crimes

80
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,980
to ask for forgiveness
from His Majesty and Her Highness.

81
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,340
Instead, you're still quibbling
and resisting the law.

82
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,220
I'd like to know

83
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,820
how come you dare

84
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,300
to disregard His Majesty,

85
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,900
the law,

86
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,220
the principle of moral conduct,

87
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,420
and the justice of the world.

88
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,340
Pei Wenxuan,

89
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,100
you're making irresponsible remarks.

90
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,380
Your Majesty.

91
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,260
I've been an official for 30 years.

92
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,860
I've spared no effort in the performance
of my duty for you and the country.

93
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:09,980
But now,

94
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,660
I'm being framed by these two kids.

95
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,340
Your Majesty, I hope
you will look into the matter.

96
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,580
Look into the matter?

97
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,700
Xie Lanqing.

98
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,460
As an official who has been working
for the court for so many years,

99
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,540
I should have trusted your words.

100
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,220
But now the solid evidence is here.

101
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,990
How else do you want me
to look into this?

102
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,300
You said Pingyue framed you
and set you up

103
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,510
again and again.

104
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,180
How can a young girl
who's not even twenty years old

105
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,420
be able to set a cunning man like you

106
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,580
who's worked for the court
for over 30 years up?

107
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,340
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

108
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,660
There are too many
misunderstandings, Your Majesty.

109
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,460
What misunderstandings?

110
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,620
In the past, there was no evidence.

111
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,380
Now the evidence is solid.

112
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,980
If there's any misunderstanding,
you can talk about it in prison.

113
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:00,660
Your Majesty...

114
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,580
Someone, drag this traitorous minister
out to the Censorate

115
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,660
for Pei Wenxuan to investigate
and deal with accordingly.

116
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,900
Please don't do this, Your Majesty!

117
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,780
Your Majesty.

118
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,700
Pei Wenxuan is the Prince Consort.

119
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,860
It's hard to convince people
without avoiding arousing suspicion.

120
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,980
Even if he's the Prince Consort,
so what?

121
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,660
When you work, you can allow yourself

122
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,020
to not make a clear distinction
between public and private interests.

123
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,420
But when it comes to me, I have to think
about avoiding arousing suspicion?

124
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,860
It's decided.

125
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,060
This case is assigned to Pei Wenxuan.

126
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,860
Anyone who says another word

127
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,540
will be put on trial too.

128
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,300
Your Majesty, I think

129
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,020
it's inappropriate for me
to be the Chief Judge of this case.

130
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,300
It should be handed back
to the Ministry of Justice.

131
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,480
Hand it back
to the Ministry of Justice?

132
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,380
Who in the Ministry of Justice
would dare to interrogate him?

133
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,860
I'd like to recommend someone.

134
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:52,650
Who is it?

135
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,940
Right Minister of Justice, Pei Liming.

136
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,860
He's my uncle.

137
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,140
He's a man of integrity and honesty.

138
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,030
He's been working
at the Ministry of Justice for years,

139
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,180
and he knows the law well.

140
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,820
I raise the virtuous
without avoiding relatives.

141
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,460
I would like to recommend this person
to investigate this case.

142
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,820
I second the recommendation.

143
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,900
I also think

144
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,700
that Minister Pei
is the most suitable candidate.

145
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,300
Since Official Su also said so,

146
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,860
just let Minister Pei
investigate the case.

147
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,500
Prepare the decree.

148
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,060
I'd like to test our blood again.

149
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,500
Get the water!

150
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,300
Take him away!

151
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,820
I'd like to test it again.

152
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,380
Your Majesty! Please get the water!

153
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,100
I'd like to test it again, Your Majesty!

154
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,900
I'm innocent!

155
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,660
Your Majesty!

156
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,620
I'd like to test it again!

157
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,820
Just once!

158
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,900
I'm tired.

159
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,740
You shall take your leave now.

160
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,340
Pei Wenxuan, you may stay.
I have something to talk to you.

161
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,380
Your actions today

162
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,500
have taken me by surprise.

163
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,220
Mr. Su, your actions today

164
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,780
have also greatly exceeded
my expectations.

165
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,780
What did you think I would do?

166
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,930
I thought you wouldn't let go

167
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,780
of Xie Lanqing's case.

168
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,300
He tried to assassinate you.

169
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,740
Of course, I won't cover up for him.

170
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,700
However, Your Highness...

171
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,700
why must you establish
the Inspectorate Office?

172
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:53,940
For the country.

173
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,100
For the people.

174
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,460
Also for justice.

175
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,060
Justice?

176
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,700
Is it that in your mind,

177
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,580
justice means making enemies
with the noble families?

178
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,300
Even if there are bad people
in the noble families,

179
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,660
it's still the foundation
of the Great Xia.

180
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,380
One should not demand absolute purity.

181
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,460
For a few bad people,

182
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,980
the very foundation
of the Great Xia will be affected.

183
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,540
Then war will break out
and the people will suffer.

184
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,980
How can there be any justice
and well-being that you mentioned

185
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,180
for the country

186
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,220
and the people?

187
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,100
Let's drop the subject.

188
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,540
Your Highness.

189
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,100
How have you been...

190
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,100
since you married Pei Wenxuan?

191
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,540
Mr. Su.

192
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,340
In fact, I really don't need you

193
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,660
to worry so much about my relationship.

194
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,540
Actually...

195
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,140
I have a small wish.

196
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,180
I hope that your relationship

197
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,580
will not be related
to power and politics.

198
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,580
I hope that it can be pure.

199
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,460
And you'll have no regrets.

200
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,140
Take care, Your Highness.

201
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,460
I hope you will proceed with caution
in the future.

202
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,220
I shall take my leave now.

203
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,700
You two had a good time chatting, huh?

204
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,780
What did Father say to you?

205
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,780
His Majesty asked me
why I recommended Pei Liming.

206
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,820
How did you answer?

207
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,140
For others, this opportunity
is the icing on the cake.

208
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,780
But for the Pei Family,

209
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,220
it's offering timely help.

210
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,020
There will be a big difference
in their mentality.

211
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,820
Well said.

212
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,540
Oh, right.

213
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,300
What were you and Mr. Su
exactly talking about?

214
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,820
I think you were touched by his words.

215
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,740
Feeling moved?

216
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,740
Yes.

217
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,380
He just told me something

218
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,660
very important

219
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,060
that made me feel touched

220
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,940
and had even more feelings for him.

221
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,220
Had even more feelings for him?

222
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,380
Don't you have enough feelings for him?

223
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,540
How much more do you want?

224
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,420
Why not put him
on the tip of your heart?

225
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,900
It's just that it'll be hard for Mr. Su.

226
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,140
Wait.

227
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,380
Why is it hard for him?

228
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,500
Your Highness, there's only a small spot
on the tip of your heart.

229
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,980
If Mr. Su is going to stand on it,

230
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,980
he'll have to stand on one leg.

231
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,220
He will need to make a switch

232
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,620
and stand on different legs
over and over again.

233
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,940
Don't you think Mr. Su will be tired?

234
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,780
Yes. He'll be exhausted.

235
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,860
If so, I don't think

236
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,020
you can do such a tiring job,

237
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,060
therefore, I'd better find someone else.

238
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,620
Your Highness.

239
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,420
That's not right.

240
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,060
You don't know

241
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,900
that my unique skill
is standing on one foot.

242
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,220
If you are willing,

243
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,460
I'm willing

244
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,620
to stand on one foot on the tip
of your heart for the rest of my life.

245
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,660
You weren't worried at all in there.

246
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,300
Especially during the blood drop test
for relationships.

247
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,460
You looked confident.

248
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,620
I worked on a shipwreck case before,

249
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,340
and many people
came to identify their families.

250
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,060
The blood drop test
for relationships was used.

251
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,780
After using it many times,
I found it strange.

252
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,140
Later, I learned

253
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,660
that the blood of any two people
can be fused.

254
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,340
There's no basis for the method

255
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,860
of blood drop test for relationships.

256
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,460
In that case,

257
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,980
does that mean that our blood drops
can fuse, too?

258
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,780
Li Rong, you're unbelievable.

259
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,700
[Ministry of Justice]

260
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,140
Your Highness.

261
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,380
Uncle.

262
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,780
Uncle, spare the formalities.

263
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,860
Uncle, has Lin Feibai arrived
at the Ministry of Justice?

264
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,660
Yes.

265
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,260
Miss Shangguan has just sent him here.

266
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,780
I'll go and see him then.

267
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,220
I'll be waiting for you here,
Your Highness.

268
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,980
Why did you recommend me?

269
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,780
With your help, we'll be able
to go to the prison

270
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,100
as we want now.

271
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,540
Although you recommended me,

272
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,860
I still have something to say.

273
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,260
You're being a little reckless.

274
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,460
You should have

275
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,620
told me about this earlier.

276
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,300
I didn't know this would happen today.

277
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,300
His Majesty needed someone
on short notice,

278
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,180
so I had to recommend you to help.

279
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,460
You call this help?

280
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,460
One dots, two dots, three dots.

281
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,180
Where's the four dots tile?

282
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,470
Where is it?

283
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,420
Your Highness.

284
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,980
Why are you still here?

285
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,620
I...

286
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,100
I guessed you would come
to interrogate him,

287
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,300
so I waited here.

288
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,780
Your Highness, I'm so curious.

289
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,340
Please enlighten me.

290
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,340
Mr. Lin, you...

291
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,620
Don't you have anything to say?

292
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,220
My mother never told me about him.

293
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,380
Two years ago,

294
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,540
my mother held this jade pendant
at the end of her life.

295
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,380
She said she wanted
to meet the owner of the pendant.

296
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,140
She told me to go
to the mountain gateway and wait

297
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,180
because at the gate,

298
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,460
I could see the incoming people
on the trail right away.

299
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,260
He'd be dressed in black.

300
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,260
It was snowing that day

301
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,300
and he didn't come.

302
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,780
When I arrived at my mother's side

303
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,780
in the early hours of the next morning,

304
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,620
she was already dead.

305
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,580
My mother had made many requests for me
before she died.

306
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,780
One of them

307
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,740
was that she owed Xie Lanqing
three things

308
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,700
and asked me to help her.

309
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,580
That's why when Xie Lanqing went
to Qinqu Mountain

310
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,820
to ask for help
from the Seven-star Sect,

311
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,060
I knew that getting involved in this

312
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,420
would bring the Seven-star Sect
to its doom,

313
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,940
but I still did it.

314
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,500
I just don't understand.

315
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,580
This man...

316
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,740
failed her,

317
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,500
humiliated her,

318
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,660
and never even acknowledged her.

319
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,780
She hated him so much.

320
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,780
But why did she ask me to help him?

321
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,060
She didn't honestly speak her mind.

322
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,100
Do you know why?

323
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,060
All I know

324
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,580
is that your mother wanted you
to stay alive.

325
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,620
And I'm here today

326
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,340
to give you a chance.

327
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,860
What chance?

328
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,940
A chance to live.

329
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,300
And a chance for revenge.

330
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,620
Now, Xie Lanqing

331
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,300
is bound to step down
from the position of

332
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,140
the Minister of Justice.

333
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,420
Whoever takes over
Xie Lanqing's case now

334
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,260
means to take over the position
of Minister of Justice.

335
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,100
You deserve to take this position.

336
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,700
Then,

337
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,820
we'll have to rely on you
to help us from now on.

338
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,820
Your words

339
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,260
are like a slap in my face.

340
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,100
No.

341
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,140
On the way here, I was thinking

342
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,820
about in the past,

343
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,620
I could have been

344
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,660
nicer to you.

345
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,660
But I...

346
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,140
Uncle, let bygones be bygones.

347
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,860
Let's move on.

348
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,500
Okay.

349
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,740
What's the condition?

350
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,980
No conditions this time.

351
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,060
All you have to do is tell the truth.

352
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,900
Xie Lanqing will get whatever punishment

353
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,580
he deserves.

354
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,620
As for your attempted assassination,

355
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,740
I'll report to Father

356
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,140
and ask him
to absolve you of your crime

357
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,860
for you making amends
for your fault by good deeds.

358
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,100
Your Highness, you're not
using me again, are you?

359
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,580
But I'm willing...

360
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:29,940
to identify Xie Lanqing.

361
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,380
That's good then.

362
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,860
I wish you can get out soon, Mr. Lin.

363
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,100
Mr. Lin, don't be too sad.

364
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,380
The days go by fast
when you're playing tiles.

365
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:56,220
There are plenty of things
that can bring you joy in this world.

366
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,740
I'll leave the tiles here for you.
I'm leaving now.

367
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,380
Let's go.

368
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,860
Your Highness, why do you think
Lin Feibai's mother

369
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,300
had such contradictory feelings?

370
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,820
She had been teaching Lin Feibai
to hate Xie Lanqing

371
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,340
in her whole life,

372
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,340
but she asked him to help Xie Lanqing

373
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,500
at the end of her life.

374
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,060
What did she want?

375
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,300
Do you know what it feels like

376
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,540
when you're dying?

377
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,980
Of course, I don't know.

378
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,060
I've never died.

379
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,300
Do you know?

380
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,980
I guess

381
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,540
it's true that Lin Xia had hated
Xie Lanqing all her life.

382
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,780
But hatred comes from love.

383
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,220
That's why she waited for him

384
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,580
when she was dying.

385
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,580
But it didn't really matter

386
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,820
if Xie Lanqing came or not.

387
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,260
When someone is dying,

388
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,980
what they think about
is not only regret,

389
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,540
but also the wonderful things
in their lives.

390
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,380
Why do you sound like

391
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,020
you've been dead before?

392
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,780
But Lin Feibai is really pathetic.

393
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,100
There are a lot of pitiful people.

394
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,700
He's not that pitiful.

395
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,540
That's true.

396
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,460
The greatest sorrow
in the world is poverty.

397
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,100
Birth, senility, illness, and death
are the order of nature.

398
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,060
Only poverty always
makes you doubt yourself.

399

the former Minister of Justice,
Xie Lanqing,

490
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,020
instructed an organization
in the martial world, Seven-stars Sect,

00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,900
to assassinate Princess Pingyue

The evidence is conclusive.

00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,820
According to the Great Xia's law,

the crimes of committing rebellion
and hiring someone to assassinate others

495
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,140

00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,620
You never went to see her
in the past 20 years.

550
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,180
Although I hadn't seen her,

551
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,140
I may still know

552
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,060
of what you want to know.

553
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,140
Xie Lanqing, that old man.

554
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,100
He's in charge of the Ministry
of Justice and he's gone too far.

555
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,700
Don't be angry.

556
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,940
I've found Xie Lanqing's weakness.

557
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,180
There's a swordswoman
named Lin Xia,

558
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,900
born into a famous martial family.

559
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,420
When she was young,
she went to Huajing accidentally.

560
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,500
In Huajing,

561
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,380
she accidentally met Xie Lanqing,
a childe back then.

562
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,740
They had a child

563
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,500
named Lin Feibai.

564
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,060
Lin Feibai?

565
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,700
Go ahead and ask me anything you want.

566
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,020
Is Lin Feibai...

567
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,660
really my child?

568
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:23,900
Yes.

569
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,900
You were in love with Lin Xia

570
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:30,100
but had to break up with her
due to pressure from your family.

571
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,300
She was pregnant
with Lin Feibai at that time.

572
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,180
But she didn't tell me.

573
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,580
Why would she tell you?

574
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,740
You couldn't marry her.

575
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,500
And she had no intention

576
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,700
of marrying anyone else.

577
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,060
So this child was her only hope.

578
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,940
Because of this child,

579
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:49,970
she could not be accepted
by her family and clan

580
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,260
and had to follow her junior sister
into hiding.

581
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,420
Finally, she had no choice
but to write to you

582
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,860
and ask for the money.

583
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,740
You should have been relieved

584
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,500
at the time, right?

585
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,180
You felt you would
no longer owe this woman.

586
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,020
So you gave her Qinqu Mountain

587
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,620
with a stroke of your pen.

588
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,420
Later, she established
the Seven-star Sect,

589
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,060
and was surrounded
by her right and left guardians.

590
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,780
Rumor in the martial world had it

591
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,500
that she was having an affair

592
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,660
with her right guardian,
her senior brother, Lin Fei.

593
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:23,820
So you thought Lin Feibai
was Lin Fei's child.

594
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,820
After all...

595
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,900
Lin Feibai's existence
was known to Xie Lanqing

596
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,300
a year later.

597
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,420
In other words,

598
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,340
Lin Feibai's real age is not 20,

599
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,860
but 21.

600
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,660
Lin Xia hid the exact time
she gave birth to her son.

601
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,540
When Xie Lanqing found out,
it was already a year later.

602
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,420
So he never thought

603
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,900
it would be his child.

604
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,980
Lin Xia spent her whole life
on Qinqu Mountain.

605
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,580
Lin Xia spent her whole life
on Qinqu Mountain,

606
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,740
and even when she was dying,
she thought of you

607
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,380
and asked people to get to you.

608
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,380
But you didn't want to go to see her.

609
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,500
Your Highness,

610
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,580
I'm sure you're back, too,

611
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:07,820
aren't you?

612
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,500
Mr. Xie, what else
would you like to ask?

613
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,180
If no,

614
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,340
I'll be leaving.

615
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,140
Did she hate me?

616
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,660
I don't know...

617
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,020
about this.

618
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,900
But there's one thing

619
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,780
I'm curious about.

620
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,300
Have you ever loved her?

621
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,140
I dare not to say it.

622
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,220
Love is nothing

623
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,660
to you.

624
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,300
But I pity Lin Xia

625
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,660
for her life
of wandering and loneliness,

626
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,660
being trapped by a man like you.

627
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,100
I wanted her

628
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,540
to have a good life.

629
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,380
I was young and ignorant.

630
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,620
I thought if I risked my life,

631
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,420
I could protect both of us.

632
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,260
Only then did I realize

633
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,940
that I was not qualified
to talk about love

634
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,820
when I was a member of my family.

635
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,820
If I married her,

636
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,780
my family's centuries-old reputation

637
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,140
would become a laughing stock.

638
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,260
My family couldn't tolerate me
being with her.

639
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,780
Death was nothing to me.

640
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,060
But what about her?

641
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,940
Why did a heavenly being...

642
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,060
end up in the mortal world?

643
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:50,340
Even though Lin Xia
was a respectable swordswoman,

644
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,420
she was also a foolish woman

645
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,620
infatuated with her feelings.

646
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,500
Why did a heavenly being...

647
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,940
end up in the mortal world?

648
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,540
I let her go

649
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,660
because I wanted her to stay alive.

650
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,540
I didn't go to see her

651
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,820
because I knew

652
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,780
it would be meaningless,
so why made her become more heartbroken?

653
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,780
It's not that I didn't love her.

654
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,540
It's just that I was not worthy of it

655
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,260
and I dared not love her.

656
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:36,780
That's because of your status.

657
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,660
I didn't expect you
to understand so much

658
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,180
at such a young age.

659
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,140
But I've spent my whole life
thinking these through.

660
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,780
I want to protect my family,

661
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,060
this noble name,

662
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,420
and this noble lineage.

663
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:00,060
You're a descendant of the royal family,

664
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,660
but you married a man who's a commoner.

665
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,620
It's fine that he's a commoner,

666
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,500
but you listened to him

667
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,780
and cut off the noble families
from the Crown Prince.

668
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,780
Your Highness, I'd like to ask you

669
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,500
why you're doing

670
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,180
all this.

671
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,500
For the sake of making the son
of that humble woman, Consort Rou,

672
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,020
ascend the throne?

673
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,900
All Her Highness has done

674
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,260
is to stop people like you

675
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,660
from asking why.

676
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,380
What she seeks in the world

677
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,780
is not for the family
to be the most important

678
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,820
but for all people to live a happy life

679
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,140
with hope.

680
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,260
It may not be realized today.

681
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,100
It may not be realized
in a hundred years or a thousand years.

682
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,500
But Her Highness still hopes

683
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,860
that one day

684
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,060
there will be no more people like you

685
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,020
asking what you did wrong,

686
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,780
and no more people like you

687
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,860
accusing Her Highness of being a royal
descendant married to a commoner.

688
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,460
Pei Wenxuan has already

689
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,420
answered your question.

690
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:35,060
You can leave in peace on your journey.

691
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,260
Mr. Su.

692
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,260
If there's nothing else,

693
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,820
we'll be going.

694
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:53,980
Your Highness.

695
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:55,660
Please.

696
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:13,540
The biggest mistake
in Mr. Xie's life

697
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,900
is that he shouldn't have allowed
himself to be carried away

698
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,060
even if he was deeply in love.

699
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,900
Are you the same?

700
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,260
In your world,

701
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,980
you can even

702
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,980
kill your beloved
for the sake of your family?

703
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,500
Why are you saying

704
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,100
such an unfortunate thing
out of the blue?

705
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,340
I'm just asking.

706
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,100
Mr. Su won't mind.

707
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,180
I do mind.

708
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,740
Mr. Pei,

709
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,060
