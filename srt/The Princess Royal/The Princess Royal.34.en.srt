[Adapted from Mo Shu Bai's novel,
The Princess Royal on jjwxc.net]

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,020
[This is a work of fiction.]

4
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 34]

5
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,020
Since it was discovered back then,

6
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,020
why wasn't I investigated at that time?

7
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,700
How could he investigate you?

8
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,700
You're the Princess Royal representing
the noble families,

9
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,300
the powerful regent Princess Royal.

10
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,980
If he were to make a move
against you openly,

11
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,390
how certain could he be of success?

12
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,580
So...

13
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,140
So...

14
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,380
he chose to poison you.

15
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,460
Later,

16
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,340
you went to the palace
once every seven days

17
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,780
and played weiqi with him.

18
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,060
The Poison of the Fragrant Beauty
was on the weiqi pieces.

19
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,740
Over time,

20
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,700
it penetrated your bones and organs.

21
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,860
After the eighteenth year of Dexu Era,

22
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,220
you started feeling unwell all the time.

23
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,580
That's the time

24
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,140
you knew...

25
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,420
I was poisoned?

26
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,180
Yes.

27
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,860
I put the antidote in sachets

28
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,900
and asked everyone to carry them

29
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,060
to slow the poison's effect.

30
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,020
Why didn't you save me?

31
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,940
Why didn't you save me?

32
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:04,700
Tell me.

33
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,300
Tell me.

34
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,620
At this point,
what else is there to hide?

35
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,580
Shangguan Ya...

36
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,860
and I made the decision together.

37
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,060
We knew

38
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,300
the noble families
never mattered to you.

39
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,100
Whenever we had a conflict
with Li Chuan,

40
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,420
you would certainly
switch sides immediately.

41
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,300
So we decided to wait and see.

42
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,380
With the antidote in my hand,

43
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,900
I could cure you at any time.

44
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,100
Killing you...

45
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,100
was with no difficulty as well.

46
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,420
And then?

47
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,540
Who finally decided

48
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,740
to kill me?

49
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,100
Later...

50
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,740
as Li Chuan's illness worsened,

51
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,220
on the morning of your death...

52
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,380
Your Majesty.

53
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,260
You're here.

54
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,540
Do you want to leave a message?

55
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,140
Depose the Crown Prince Li Xin

56
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,060
and let the Eldest Prince Li Ping
inherit the throne.

57
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,900
I have already prepared everything

58
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,460
on my way here.

59
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,020
[Depose him
from the position of Crown Prince]

60
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,820
Since the founding of the Xia,

61
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,660
power has always been in the hands
of the noble families.

62
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,580
Although my Li Family is royalty,

63
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,820
we are merely puppets
of the noble families.

64
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,940
My father tried

65
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,620
to break free from their control.

66
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,700
I've taken over his unfinished business
and fought until now.

67
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,740
It is only when facing death

68
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,060
that I realize my eldest sister,

69
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,060
Princess Royal Li Rong

70
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,860
is the most powerful one
among all the noble families.

71
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,020
After my demise,

72
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,620
if the Princess Royal plots a rebellion,

73
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,500
how should you, her nominal husband

74
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,380
and the representative of people
from humble backgrounds, respond,

75
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,500
Grand Chancellor Pei?

76
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,300
Your Majesty.

77
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,380
The Princess Royal is your sister.

78
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,620
She will never do such a thing.

79
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,060
Keep going.

80
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,180
Fengming.

81
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

82
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:24,940
Poison...

83
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,340
Poison the Princess Royal to death.

84
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,380
Yes, Your Majesty.

85
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,700
What is the situation in the palace?

86
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,380
He is dying.

87
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,580
Now is the best time
to get rid of Li Rong.

88
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:42,740
You can take the chance

89
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,500
to take control
of the Princess's Mansion.

90
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,660
Otherwise, if Pei Wenxuan
realizes what's going on,

91
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,420
both you and I will die.

92
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,880
Is there no other way?

93
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,660
Then tell me,

94
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,780
how should I choose?

95
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,180
You had supported
Pei Wenxuan wholeheartedly.

96
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,260
Pei Wenxuan and Qin Lin,
one in civil and one in military,

97
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,780
opposed you, supporting the commoners.

98
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,780
Think about it, Your Highness.

99
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,300
If Li Chuan died,

100
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,620
would this balance still hold?

101
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,260
Why not?

102
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,900
Pei Wenxuan was the head
of the commoners.

103
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,180
But what if you decided to kill him?

104
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,220
Your Highness.

105
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,900
For twenty years...

106
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,780
what had Pei Wenxuan felt towards you?

107
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,580
When he told Li Chuan

108
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,340
that you were Li Chuan's sister

109
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,580
and that you would never rebel,
you should know about his feelings.

110
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,660
He had disagreed with you on politics
for so many years.

111
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,100
Yet, never did he think

112
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,460
you would plot a rebellion.

113
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,980
Pei Wenxuan wouldn't kill you.

114
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,980
But Shangguan Ya and I

115
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,340
were behind you.

116
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,020
If you wanted to kill him,
it'd be so easy.

117
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,700
One weiqi piece against another.

118
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,340
In Li Chuan's mind,

119
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,020
keeping you in check
was never Pei Wenxuan's role.

120
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,940
It was his own role.

121
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,540
If he died yet you were still alive,

122
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,780
the game would be imbalanced.

123
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,300
He left Pei Wenxuan and Qin Lin
to support and assist Li Ping

124
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,780
to against the noble families
led by Li Xin.

125
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,860
Only being through the bloodshed
and struggle,

126
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,340
could this weiqi game be balanced.

127
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,940
The next emperor

128
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,380
wouldn't be hindered by any party

129
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,660
as he was when he ascended the throne.

130
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,940
As long as you were alive

131
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,780
and as long as you ordered
to kill Pei Wenxuan,

132
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,420
the commoners would be unable to resist.

133
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,340
As the Princess Royal
with high position and power...

134
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,860
the new emperor wouldn't tolerate you.

135
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,940
And you couldn't tolerate...

136
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,500
a new emperor
who would control you either.

137
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,580
So, Your Highness...

138
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,660
whether or not
the alchemist existed back then,

139
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,020
there would be no peace
between you and Li Chuan.

140
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,100
It was just a matter of time.

141
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,380
So...

142
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,660
You've returned

143
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,060
for revenge.

144
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,660
I just feel...

145
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,220
that even if everything starts over,

146
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,580
Li Chuan will repeat his mistakes.

147
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,420
He craves for greatness and success
and is reckless and stubborn.

148
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,860
Were we unkind to Li Chuan in the past?

149
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,620
He was deposed by Li Ming

150
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,860
and became a miserable crown prince.

151
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,300
It was the combined effort
of the noble families' military

152
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,860
that placed him on the throne.

153
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,100
But what happened next?

154
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,300
He immediately wanted to conquer
the North once he ascended the throne.

155
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,860
But the ministers disagreed.

156
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,900
He insisted,

157
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,900
depleting the treasury.

158
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,740
The next year, the South was plagued
by floods and the court could not offer

159
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,100
any relief funds, leading to famine
and unrest across the land.

160
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,020
He blamed it all on the noble families,

161
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,740
believing it was their fault.

162
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,020
He recklessly reformed the systems,

163
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,900
leading to uprisings

164
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,380
and wars everywhere.

165
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,020
Later,

166
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,860
to promote the commoners,

167
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,620
he exclusively favored Consort Qin
in the harem

168
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,620
and oppressed the ministers
from the noble families in the court.

169
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,620
He wrongly accused

170
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,260
and framed my Su Family.

171
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,860
In the end,

172
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,340
he didn't even spare you, his own sister

173
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,020
for power.

174
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,060
Your Highness.

175
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,660
How can he change?

176
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,900
I know...

177
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,900
Li Chuan isn't naturally cruel.

178
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,500
He's just ignorant, incompetent,

179
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,260
arbitrary, and authoritarian.

180
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,420
In the past, you couldn't persuade him.

181
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,420
Now,

182
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,900
how can you persuade him?

183
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,060
Since this ending is inevitable,

184
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,420
how can I just watch him

185
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,780
ascend the throne?

186
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,940
So, from the beginning...

187
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,540
your return was to try to depose him.

188
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,780
I've wanted to depose him
from the start.

189
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,900
I initially thought

190
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,300
I wouldn't need to do anything,

191
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,060
just like before.

192
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,300
After Li Chuan is deposed by Li Ming,

193
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,580
I'll prevent the noble families
from accepting Pei Wenxuan's persuasion.

194
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,140
I'll persuade Father

195
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,780
to accept Li Cheng's ascension.

196
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,780
Li Cheng is only fifteen now.

197
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,180
Xiao Su is weak and incompetent.

198
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,180
Consort Rou is greedy and short-sighted.

199
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,780
After Li Cheng ascends,

200
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,940
we can override him as a puppet.

201
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,780
When he has an heir, we'll kill him

202
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,420
and support the young emperor.

203
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,420
By then, I'll have the power.

204
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,060
Then...

205
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,300
we can get you back to the capital.

206
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,900
Since...

207
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,060
you knew all along
that Li Chuan killed me,

208
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,380
and this time

209
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,140
you've decided to depose him,

210
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,100
why didn't you tell me sooner?

211
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,460
Why admit it

212
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,420
only when I asked
if you were the murderer?

213
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,100
Were you afraid of hurting my feelings?

214
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,220
You've only had Li Chuan

215
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,500
as your family your whole life.

216
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,940
Whether I tell you or not,

217
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,500
you will not turn against him
for this reason.

218
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,340
If that's the case,
why would I say more?

219
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,620
If I succeed...

220
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,660
you will hate me.

221
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,020
If I fail...

222
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,380
your sibling bond won't be harmed.

223
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,460
Your Highness.

224
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,420
Is there anything else you want to ask?

225
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,660
Li Chuan doesn't trust me

226
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,420
because he thinks
I would kill him and his child

227
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,900
for the noble families.

228
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,180
But what about you and Shangguan Ya?

229
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,220
Why don't you trust me?

230
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,460
Why?

231
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,900
Why watch me die

232
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,860
and then take away my power?

233
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,860
Do you really want to know the answer...

234
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,140
to that question?

235
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,340
Tell me.

236
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,660
Because Li Xin...

237
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,620
isn't Li Chuan's child.

238
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,940
So...

239
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,100
So why did Su Ronghua kill Qin Zhenzhen?

240
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,780
Because he wanted to protect his child
and Shangguan Ya.

241
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,660
Why did Li Chuan use castration

242
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,500
to humiliate the Su Family?

243
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,540
Because he knew

244
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,060
about Shangguan Ya's affair
with Su Ronghua.

245
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,700
Why did you and Shangguan Ya
finally form an alliance?

246
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,020
Because you wanted
to protect your brother's lineage.

247
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,300
After Pei Wenxuan

248
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,540
and I died,

249
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,370
given your and Shangguan Ya's methods,

250
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,780
the throne would be almost
within easy reach for Li Xin.

251
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,660
You...

252
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,180
You...

253
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,660
All of you were really disgusting.

254
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,180
How evil.

255
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,580
Father and son
weren't real father and son,

256
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,180
siblings weren't real siblings,

257
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,420
couples weren't real couples,
and friends weren't real friends.

258
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,900
Everything in the past

259
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,420
was just a rotting swamp

260
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,780
filled with disgusting pus.

261
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,580
Well.

262
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,660
Very well.

263
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,500
The ruler

264
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,020
showed no mercy to his family.

265
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,420
The successor

266
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,940
wasn't loyal to human relations.

267
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,660
The officials plotted a rebellion.

268
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,060
People's lives were just pawns.

269
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,020
Su Rongqing.

270
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,780
You were willing to do whatever it took.

271
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,900
You outplayed everyone.

272
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,660
I'm impressed.

273
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,300
Since...

274
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,500
everything is clear now,

275
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,300
may I dare ask you this?

276
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,020
You'd already sacrificed
a lifetime for Li Chuan.

277
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,820
Are you going to sacrifice
in this life too?

278
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,300
You deserved to die.

279
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,020
I shouldn't have saved you...

280
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,900
back then.

281
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,500
You're right, Your Highness.

282
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,740
Back then...

283
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,100
you shouldn't have saved me.

284
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,780
After I help you reach that high place,

285
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,820
then I will give...

286
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,020
my life back to you, Your Highness.

287
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,260
So, Your Highness...

288
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,300
how will you choose?

289
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,380
Rong!

290
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,300
Rong!

291
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,860
Your Highness, you can
take your time to think about it.

292
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,860
Whether to leave or stay,

293
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,540
you can go to the Su's Perfumery

294
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,380
and have someone inform me.

295
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:02,700
I...

296
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,940
Since you have the upper hand,

297
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,220
why do you still give me a choice?

298
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,460
We've already come to this point,

299
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,460
so what's the point of asking about it?

300
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,060
Your Highness, take your time to think.

301
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,300
Farewell.

302
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:28,940
Rong.

303
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,300
You finally came.

304
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,940
The carriage is outside the cliff.

305
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,020
Let me carry you out, is that all right?

306
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,300
What's with your tone?

307
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,020
Do you think I'm a child?

308
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,700
I don't want you to act tough

309
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,100
and be stubborn with me.

310
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,460
I'm not a fool.

311
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,380
Why make things difficult for myself

312
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,620
when I can order you around?

313
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,620
Fine.

314
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,100
Keep these words in your heart.

315
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,580
Don't give the runaround.

316
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,580
You little liar.

317
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:16,940
Get on my back.

318
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,540
I'll carry you.

319
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,220
Come on.

320
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,300
Be careful.

321
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,100
Don't you want to ask me anything?

322
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,820
You'll tell me when you want to.

323
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,260
I won't force you.

324
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:57,540
[Mingyue Palace]

325
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,860
You useless things!

326
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,300
Mother...

327
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:07,780
It hurts.

328
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,060
Cheng.

329
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,740
It hurts.

330
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,860
Hurry, go and bring your mother here.

331
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,260
Fulai, hurry.

332
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,220
Cheng.

333
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,620
Cheng.

334
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,580
Cheng, hang in there.

335
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,260
It hurts.

336
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,500
Your Highness, you've finally returned.

337
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,540
Everyone was worried sick.

338
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,540
Come on, be careful.

339
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,340
Slowly.

340
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,620
Your Highness,
you have no idea about it.

341
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,140
The Crown Prince sent people
to check on you several times.

342
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,060
Should I quickly inform him

343
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,220
of this good news?

344
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,980
Go. I'll be here.

345
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,700
Yes.

346
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,940
If you want to cry, cry it out.

347
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,580
I'm here.

348
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,340
I'm fine.

349
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,860
I want to be alone for a while.

350
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,380
You don't need to accompany me.

351
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,260
I can manage alone.

352
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,500
Su Rongqing must have
said something to Her Highness.

353
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,980
I need to control Su Rongqing first

354
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,780
and prevent him from acting rashly.

355
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,540
You visited the palace
once every seven days

356
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,940
and played weiqi with him.

357
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,220
The Poison of the Fragrant Beauty was
on the weiqi pieces.

358
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,060
Cheng!

359
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,100
Cheng.

360
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,020
Cheng, how are you?

361
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,220
Mother.

362
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,300
I'm scared.

363
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,460
Cheng, don't be scared.

364
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,820
I am here.

365
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,300
I will accompany you.

366
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,940
Can you ask them all to leave?

367
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,540
I just want Mother to stay with me.

368
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:15,940
All right.

369
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,500
All of you, leave now.

370
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:19,980
You too!

371
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,620
Cheng, be strong.

372
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,580
I will find a way to save you.

373
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:32,860
Cheng.

374
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,820
Cheng, hold on.

375
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:37,980
Your Majesty,

376
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,980
we will find a way

377
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,300
to keep Prince Su alive.

378
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,620
But we can't delay it for long.

379
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,300
The Poison of the Fragrant Beauty
is dangerous

380
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,060
because in normal times,

381
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,820
it's colorless, odorless, and non-toxic.

382
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,740
Even a silver needle cannot detect it.

383
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,660
Only when it meets a specific catalyst
and the two medicines interact

384
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,460
with one another,
will the poison be acted up.

385
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,220
This poisonous substance has
always been strictly prohibited

386
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,220
in the palace.

387
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,020
It seems the catalyst
for the poison existed

388
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,500
on the hunting ground today.

389
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,660
And it was a very big dose.

390
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:13,660
Prince Su is in danger.

391
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,980
Send my secret decree to investigate

392
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,020
who brought the catalyst

393
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,660
to the hunting ground today.

394
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,340
This person must have the antidote.

395
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,820
Your Highness, Miss Shangguan is here.

396
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,980
How is Her Highness?

397
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,620
Miss Shangguan, you may go
and keep Her Highness company.

398
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,660
I'll go to the imperial physicians
to see what can be done.

399
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:39,900
Okay.

400
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,100
Mother.

401
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,220
It's cold.

402
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,740
You're cold?

403
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,580
Cheng.

404
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,420
I'll hold you tightly.

405
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,540
Does it make you feel a little better?

406
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,420
Are you less cold now?

407
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,140
Is it less cold now?

408
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,420
Huayue! Huayue!

409
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,860
Mother.

410
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,940
From this moment on,

411
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,980
no one is allowed
to enter Mingyue Palace.

412
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,140
Also, send someone to see your uncle

413
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,420
and ask him to come
to the capital immediately.

414
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,260
Mother, don't worry.

415
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,340
I just received an urgent report

416
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,620
that Uncle is already on his way back.

417
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,700
He needs to be faster.

418
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,540
Yes, Mother.

419
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,500
Wait a moment.

420
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,620
Go find Su Rongqing.

421
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,180
He is Cheng's future Prime Minister.

422
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,500
He might have a way.

423
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,100
Yes, Mother.

424
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,340
Make haste!

425
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,540
Cheng.

426
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,700
Cheng.

427
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,140
Cheng, hang in there.

428
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,940
Hang in there, Cheng.

429
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:39,900
Cheng.

430
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,780
Cheng!

431
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,820
Your Highness,
you really scared me this time.

432
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:49,980
Were you afraid I'd die?

433
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,100
At this time, you're still joking.

434
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,820
Your Highness,
Mr. Cui Yulang requests an audience.

435
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,540
Your Highness.

436
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,300
I inquired with some acquaintances
at Prince Su's Mansion.

437
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,700
Li Cheng

438
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,180
is almost dying.

439
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,940
He has been poisoned
by the Poison of the Fragrant Beauty.

440
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:22,340
The imperial physicians cannot
find an effective way to cure him.

441
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,740
Father must have known

442
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,460
about the situation at the time.

443
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,260
It's just unexpected

444
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,540
that Father also doesn't trust Li Cheng.

445
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,060
The one who poisoned him must be Father.

446
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,660
In this way,
the Crown Prince's position is secure.

447
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,740
However, on my way to your mansion,

448
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,340
I saw the Xiao Family's carriage going
to Prince Su's Mansion.

449
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,860
I suspect

450
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,740
there might be

451
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,060
a change of tide in this matter.

452
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,820
The person is already dead.

453
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,260
What more changes could there be?

454
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,340
With Su Rongqing behind the scenes,

455
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,740
Li Cheng won't

456
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,380
die.

457
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,140
I understand.

458
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,980
You may go and rest.

459
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,740
You can't go to Prince Su's Mansion

460
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,300
or return home now.

461
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,740
You come out at this time,

462
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,340
which has definitely aroused
Consort Rou's suspicion.

463
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,460
Just rest here.

464
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,500
Thank you, Your Highness.

465
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,380
Your Highness, with Li Cheng dead,

466
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,780
His Majesty will have only
one son, the Crown Prince, left.

467
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,700
No matter what,

468
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,100
he won't depose the Crown Prince.

469
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,580
Your Highness, what's wrong?

470
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,340
You're right.

471
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,260
No matter what,

472
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,020
the Crown Prince will ascend the throne.

473
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,980
If so, he no longer needs

474
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,620
to be tied to the Shangguan Family.

475
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,140
Your Highness,
what are you hesitating about?

476
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,500
Are you worried
that the Crown Prince will burn bridges

477
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,340
and betray us?

478
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,420
Aren't you worried?

479
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,300
Do you think

480
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,620
the Crown Prince will never betray
the Shangguan Family?

481
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,620
But he's your brother.

482
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,860
He is my brother.

483
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,380
But he is also an unpredictable person.

484
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,580
Don't you think so?

485
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,980
Why are you suddenly saying this?

486
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,300
I just suddenly feel...

487
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,460
that from the past until now,

488
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,820
I have never truly understood him.

489
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,980
Then what do you intend to do,
Your Highness?

490
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,580
The beast
in Li Chuan's heart could erupt

491
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,780
at any time,

492
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,140
devouring the Great Xia

493
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,740
and the people I want to protect.

494
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,540
He is too dangerous.

495
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,260
Su Rongqing is right.

496
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,860
Chuan is not suitable to be an emperor.

497
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:16,940
At present,

498
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,620
joining forces
with Su Rongqing to support

499
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,580
the prudent Prince Su
might be the wisest choice.

500
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,740
Let me ask you.

501
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,540
If the Crown Prince acts
against the Shangguan Family,

502
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,460
what will you do?

503
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,500
With your cautious nature,

504
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,940
you wouldn't tie the honor
and disgrace of your family

505
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,220
to the Crown Prince, would you?

506
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,700
I don't understand.

507
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,140
What are trying to say?

508
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,140
You may speak bluntly.

509
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,900
Why don't we join forces...

510
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,060
to put an obedient emperor
on the throne?

511
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,100
What do you think?

512
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,300
Well, who

513
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,020
do you plan to support?

514
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:13,820
Prince Su.

515
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:15,940
Li Cheng.

516
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,900
But the Prince Consort and the Princess
have already got divorced.

517
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,020
How do I even say this?

518
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,180
That's right.

519
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,060
Mr. Wang.

520
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:33,900
Mr. Pei.

521
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,060
How is Her Highness's health?

522
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,540
Her Highness only has minor bruises.

523
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,580
It is nothing serious.

524
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,500
There are no other issues, right?

525
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,100
Also,

526
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:50,980
Her Highness is...

527
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,780
pregnant.

528
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,660
Pregnant?

529
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:58,860
Yes.

530
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,260
Her Highness suffered severe jolting,

531
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,940
causing fetal instability.

532
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,980
Her Highness needs to rest well
and recuperate from pregnancy

533
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,740
to avoid any mishaps.

534
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,260
Mr. Pei...

535
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,340
Do not spread this news.

536
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,420
Do you understand?

537
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,460
- Yes.
- Yes.

538
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,620
Is there anything I need
to pay attention to?

539
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,700
She only has minor bruises.

540
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,980
It is nothing serious.

541
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,180
Write a prescription for her,

542
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,540
including the things she can't do

543
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,420
and the things that are beneficial

544
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,180
for a pregnant woman.

545
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,100
The more detailed, the better.

546
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,060
Yes, I understand.

547
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,580
You can leave now.

548
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,660
All right. Let's go.

549
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,500
Wait.

550
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,860
Is there really nothing I need
to pay special attention to?

551
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,620
She only has minor bruises.

552
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,780
It's nothing serious.

553
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:52,660
Then you may leave now.

554
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,300
All right.

555
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,100
Are you mad?

556
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,020
Think carefully about what I said.

557
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,580
Everyone is here
for their own interests.

558
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,460
No need to pretend.

559
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,500
Li Rong,

560
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,460
you're so disgusting.

561
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,300
I'm disgusting?

562
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,820
Aren't you disgusting as well?

563
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,340
Abandoning Li Chuan disgusts you,

564
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,180
but abandoning Su Ronghua doesn't?

565
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,580
You assist Li Chuan
because you want to gain power.

566
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,100
You approach me for power.

567
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,380
It's all for power.

568
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,900
What are you pretending
to be innocent for?

569
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,780
Miss Shangguan,

570
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,900
Her Highness is unwell today.

571
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,180
Please visit her another day.

572
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,940
You don't need to persuade me
or ask me anything.

573
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,940
I don't want to talk about it now.

574
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,220
I wasn't trying to persuade you.

575
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,300
Sit down first.

576
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,300
Sit down.

577
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,860
Eat something.

578
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,380
I don't want to eat.

579
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,140
I specifically asked someone
to make red date and lotus seed congee.

580
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,860
You didn't eat anything last night.

581
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,220
Just have some, all right?

582
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,620
Wait a moment.

583
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,300
Jinglan, take care of Her Highness here.

584
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,580
I'll go to the kitchen
to see if the congee is ready.

585
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,300
Your Highness.

586
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,500
Send someone

587
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,900
to go to Su Rongqing now

588
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,100
and bring him here safely.

589
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,620
Don't alarm the Prince Consort.

590
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,780
Even though

591
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,380
many things have changed

592
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,300
since coming back,

593
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,780
I still meet

594
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,500
the people I should meet

595
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,780
and fall in love with the one
I should fall in love with.

596
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,940
Could it be

597
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,790
that my destiny is predetermined?

598
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,020
Could it be
that no matter how hard I try,

599
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,460
I can't change it?

600
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:42,020
If the same thing happens again,

601
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,420
what should I do?

602
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,300
No.

603
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,580
I cannot place all my bets

604
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,340
on Chuan.

605
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,780
From now on,

606
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,380
you must oversee everything
in the kitchen yourself.

607
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,140
Ask me about what can
or cannot be eaten.

608
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,700
Never cook anything on this list.

609
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,540
You have to remember what I said.

610
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,140
These are foods

611
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,300
to be avoided during pregnancy.

612
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,420
Do not tell anyone about this.

613
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,500
If you are unsure about anything,

614
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,300
always ask me.

615
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,260
Do not make any decisions on your own.

616
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,220
Yes.

617
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,420
Go now.

618
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,700
Wait.

619
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,460
You have to remember what I said.

620
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,420
Yes.

621
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,820
Do not tell anyone.

622
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,540
Yes.

623
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,580
Go now.

624
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,700
Are there any other things
that cannot be eaten?

625
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,580
Let me think.

626
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,300
Hurry!

627
00:36:59,180 --> 00:36:59,900
Capture him alive.

628
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,660
Rongqing, you go first.
Leave them to me.

Go!
