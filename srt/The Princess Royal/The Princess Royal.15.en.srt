109

it will give me some peace of mind.

110
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,260
You said I didn't consider
others' difficulties,

111
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,700
but you, on the other hand,

112
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,300
care too much
about others' difficulties.

113
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,900

Your Highness.

114

I'm going to apply
the ointment for you now.

115
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,140
I used to hear you say

116
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,580
that you didn't want
to be like your father

117
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,730
and that he spoiled your mother too much

118
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,100
so she didn't understand anything.

119
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,460
If she can't learn to protect you,

120
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,460
why did she give birth to you?

121
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,820
Does she even deserve to be a mother,

122
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,060
leaving you to suffer out there
on your own?

123
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,780
Alright, I won't say any more.

124
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,860
Watching you act like this

125
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,500

126
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:39,940
Yes.

127
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,220

128
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,540
Ms. Wen is your mother.

129
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,580
Whether she is weak or incompetent,

130
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,020
she must fight for you at least once.

131
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,260
You can't always think of others

132
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,580
and make yourself suffer.

133
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,260
If you want something,
you have to fight for it yourself.

134
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,460
Do you understand?

135
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,300
What if she's unwilling?

136
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,100
Then she can refuse.

137
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,940
Whether she wants it or not,

138
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,380
you have to give her a choice, right?

139
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,220
But I already know

140
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,340

141
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,180
Pei Wenxuan,

142
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,460
only the person involved

143
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,140
knows which path is better.

144
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,900
I will carefully consider

145
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,820
your words.

146
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,020

that would be best.

Rongqing,

151
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,660
It seems I should take you out
for drinks more often.

152
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,180
You have been suppressing your emotions

153
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,220
and behaving yourself at home
for too long.

154
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,780
If it's what I experienced today,

155
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,060
then one time

156
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,700

157
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,060

158
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,260

161
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,660
what kind of a person do you think I am?

162
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,980
What do you mean by that?

163
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,700
Never mind.

164
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,740
I guess you are tired.

165
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,980
You just want me to praise you, right?

166
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,740
No.

167
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,820
You learn everything so quickly.

168
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,540
I remember the first time
you did my eyebrows,

169
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,380
it was all crooked.

170
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,180
But within a month,

171
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,940
you even knew how to do makeup.

172
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,700
The first time you did my hair,

173
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,020
you pulled so hard which was so painful,

174
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,460
but after that,

175
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,700
there wasn't a hairstyle
you couldn't do.

176
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,780
If I'm good to you in any way,

177
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,620
you respond
with ten times the gratitude and joy.

178
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,820
To be honest...

179
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,820
whether as a husband, a friend,

180
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,060
or a family member...

181
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,380
if everyone were like me,

182
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,140
nonchalant about everything,

183
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,500
and letting everything go easily...

184
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,020
life would be a bit boring.

185
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,420
Anyway,

00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,540

00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,180
You just don't realize it yourself.

188
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,780
Now, I know.

189
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,420
What is it?

190
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,420
My back hurts.

191
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:43,900
What should we do then?

192
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:49,940
What are you doing?

193
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,660
Your back hurts...

194
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,700
It hurts. Don't move.

195
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,580
I don't want to let go anymore.

Your Majesty,

224
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,700
here are the memorials
for you to go through.

225
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,180
The ones on top are from the Pei Family

226
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,020
who accuses

227
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,300
Her Highness of being overbearing

228
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,780
and the Inspectorate Office
of being unjust.

229
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,020
Down below are the memorials
from the noble families

230
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,820
stating

231
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,060
that Her Highness
did not respect her parents-in-law.

232
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,700
They have also

233
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,890
[The Classic of Filial Piety]
sent a carved copy

234
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,500
of the Classic of Filial Piety,

235
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,540
asking you to hand it over
to Her Highness.

236
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,300
They are kind of thoughtful.

237
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,780
Pingyue went to the Pei Family,

238
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,700
and now the entire Huajing
knows about it.

239
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,500
Your Highness.

240
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,260
Mr. Su.

241
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,500
Yesterday...

242
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,860
Yesterday, my brother and I left
right after we finished eating.

243
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,300
It was no big deal.

244
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,740
Don't worry.

245
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,020
Yesterday, I indeed
had an urgent matter come up.

246
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,300
I will treat you some other time.

247
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,060
Your Highness,

248
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,700
there's no need for that actually.

249
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,500
Given your sensitive status now,

250
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,940
it's best we limit our interactions

251
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,140
to avoid stirring up gossip
among the ministers.

252
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,380
When I agreed with my brother yesterday,

253
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,420
I didn't know you would also come.

254
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,780
So,

255
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,060
if I had known,
I wouldn't have agreed.

256
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,820
That's good then.

257
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,340
I won't keep you any longer.

258
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,420
I'll take my leave.

259
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,540
Take care, Your Highness.

260
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,620
Your Highness,

261
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,460
I didn't mean what I said just now.

262
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,100
Everyone,

263
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,140
do you have any important matters
to report today?

264
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,180
Father,

265
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,740
you must seek justice for me.

266
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,380
What justice do you want me
to seek for you?

267
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,780
Tell me about it.

268
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,660
Yesterday,

269
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,980
Mr. Pei sent for my husband
to return to Pei's Mansion,

270
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,500
claiming that my mother-in-law
was seriously sick.

271
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,780
My husband rushed back in worry,

272
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,420
but as soon as he got there,

273
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,380
Mr. Pei's men beat him up.

274
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,300
Your Majesty,

275
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,580
what Her Highness said
is far from the truth.

276
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,060
Since the Prince Consort
married Her Highness,

277
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,180
he has never returned home
to visit his mother.

278
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,220
Lately, my sister-in-law has been unwell

279
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,860
and asked the Prince Consort
to come back many times,

280
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,500
but he ignored her every time.

281
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,540
Initially, we hoped to persuade Wenxuan

282
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,660
to return to the right path

283
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,900
and carry out his filial duties
to his mother.

284
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,700
But Wenxuan not only refused to listen

285
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,100
but also injured some servants.

286
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,100
He even threatened
that he had Her Highness's support

287
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,580
and no one could touch him.

288
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,180
Later, Her Highness led troops
to barge into our Mansion

289
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,660
and took the Prince Consort away.

290
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,980
Before leaving, she even broke
the arms of two servants.

291
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,380
Her Highness
is so overbearing and arrogant.

292
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,780
She disregards all propriety.

293
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,380
Yet now she's here, falsely accusing us

294
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,660
and sullying our Pei Family's name...

295
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,620
Insolence.

296
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,500
From what I can tell,
it was you who started it first.

297
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,860
May I ask, Mr. Pei,

298
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,700
according to the etiquettes
of our dynasty,

299
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,820
you should get the imperial family's
and Princess Pingyue's permission

300
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,700
before punishing the Prince Consort.
But did you do that?

301
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,580
Enough!

302
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,380
This is all just your family's affair,

303
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,460
yet you bring it
to the court and argue here.

304
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,060
What about the imperial family's
reputation?

305
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,580
You hit the Prince Consort

306
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,940
and then Pingyue saved him.

307
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,060
What more is there to argue about?

308
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:57,980
Your Majesty,

309
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,980
Her Highness has just established
the Inspectorate Office...

310
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,020
Are you done yet?

311
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,260
Regardless,

312
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,860
Pei Wenxuan is my son-in-law

313
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,060
and part of the imperial family.

314
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,940
Do not mention this again.

315
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,980
I have heard
that three administrative divisions

316
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,260
have been dry for a long time,
possibly leading to a severe drought.

317
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,380
Everyone, quickly devise a solution.

318
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,660
Rou,

319
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,140
is it really appropriate for us

320
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,940
to head out like this?

321
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:28,900
Madam,

322
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,180
First Young Master is in need \
of your support right now.

323
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,660
Please think it over.

324
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,020
Okay.

325
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,300
Let's go.

326
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,220
Your Highness.

327
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,260
Do you have no qualms

328
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,660
about lying so blatantly today?

329
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,780
That's the question I want to ask you.

330
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,420
Whether it's a lie or not,

331
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,660
a mother teaching her son
is a matter of course.

332
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,700
But it's inappropriate for you

333
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,060
to break into a minister's mansion.

334
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,220
Why didn't you say this
to my father earlier?

335
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,780
You didn't dare utter a word
in the hall just now

336
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,900
and now you're here to criticize me.

337
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,420
If you're so justified,

338
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,420
go ahead and tell my father.

339
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,740
Your Highness,

340
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,300
you're being too overbearing.

341
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,380
Go and complain about me then.

342
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,940
If you really can't stand it...

343
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,460
then hit me too.

344
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,620
Your Highness, you are...

345
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,220
I really like your how you look

346
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,180
when you all can't stand me
but can't do anything about it.

347
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,740
I won't dwell on this matter today

348
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,820
but mark my words...

349
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,500
you'll apologize to me someday.

350
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,740
You may all leave now.

351
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,620
I have a case to handle.

352
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,300
Your Highness.

353
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,740
The court of Great Xia
won't allow you to act so insolently

354
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,220
without facing the consequences.

355
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,500
I will go to the Imperial Study
to see His Majesty now.

356
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,340
If you are not severely punished today,

357
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,620
I will throw myself to death
at the Shoulong Pillar

358
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,700
to protest.

359
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,660
I'm going too.

360
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,340
Me too.

361
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,580
We all will go.

362
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,060
Great,

363
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,700
I was planning to let it slide,

364
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,740
but you've all insisted
on challenging me.

365
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,020
The Imperial Study?

366
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:16,940
Fine.

Your Majesty, I urge you
to punish her severely.

374

and acts overbearingly and recklessly

375

in the Inspection Department.

376
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,740

378
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,500
They deceived their sister-in-law,

mistreated their late brother's son,

380
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,740
seized
their deceased brother's property,

381
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,380
and assaulted the Prince Consort,
thereby offending the sovereign.

382
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,660
Such shameless,

00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,340

sirs,

392
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,180
His Majesty has said

393
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,620
that this is a family matter of yours.

394
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,100
So please, everyone,
return to your duties.

395
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,300
How can it be a family matter
when Her Highness

396
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,020
is the head of the Inspectorate Office?

397
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,580
If Your Majesty
doesn't seek justice for me today,

398
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,820
I will kneel here

399
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,180

400
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,100
Didn't you say you would end your life?

401
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,580
Mr. Pei, you should stick to your word.

402
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,780
I'm not going to argue
with a woman like you.

403
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,500
You can't even win an argument
with a woman.

404
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,340
It seems you have no reason
on your side.

405
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,340
You might as well run headlong
into a pillar and save your reputation.

406
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,100
Eunuch Fu, please inform His Majesty

407

the princess,

408
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,780
we will not leave here today.

410
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,380

for my husband today,

About last night's incident,

426
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,340
you must be blaming me,

427
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,660
right?

428
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,100
Do you think your second uncle
wants to harm you

429
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,620
and treats you poorly?

430
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:54,740
Mother,

431
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,420
it's not what I think.

432
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,180
It's just the way things are.

433
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,580
Could there be
any misunderstanding here?

434
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,460
Your second uncle told me...

435
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,340
Mother,

436
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,980
it's not so much what he said,

437
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,420
but what he did.

438
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,380
I've never dared to tell you this.

439
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,740
When Father passed away years ago,

440
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,140
I was ambushed

441
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,900
on my way back from Luzhou.

442
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,460
Ambushed?

443
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,100
Yes.

444
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,060
I later found out

445
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,500
it was Second Uncle's doing.

446
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,020
You...

447
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,620
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

448
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,700
Because it wouldn't have helped.

449
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,140
I know you well.

450
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,900
When I returned that year,

451
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,500
there was no one by your side anymore.

452
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,820
If you had known about it
and tried to do something,

453
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,780
you would have been targeted by them.

454
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,460
Instead of that,

455
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,860
it's better

456
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,940
for you to not know anything

457
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,580
and live a peaceful life.

458
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,540
When Father was still alive,

459
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,380
he often reminded me

460
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,460
that as men...

461
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,460
we should shoulder

462
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,740
responsibilities

463
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,540
and strive to make those around us
live a better life.

464
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,820
If they are not living a good life...

465
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,060
we should be the ones to be blamed.

466
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,300
And it's evident

467
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,900
that Father fulfilled his duties.

468
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,180
He spent his whole life
taking care of you.

469
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,540
You didn't have to do

470
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,140
or think about anything.

471
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,700
Later, Father told me

472
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,740
to take on his responsibilities

473
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,940
and continue caring for you.

474
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,580
And I've always seen this

475
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,580
as my own battle.

476
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,980
Whether I win or lose...

477
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,300
I shouldn't disturb you.

478
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,980
Then why bring it up now?

479
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,580
Did I end up harming you...

480
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,500
and leaving you no way out?

481
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,900
That's not it.

482
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,140
It's because someone

483
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,940
told me...

484
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,060
that I should allow you
to make your own choice.

485
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,340
Father took all the responsibilities

486
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,060
upon himself

487
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,180
but never let you choose.

488
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,140
So, Mother,

489
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,860
this time...

490
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,700
I want you to make your own choice.

00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,580
Second Master led many ministers

496
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,340
to kneel at the door
of the Imperial Study,
demanding punishment for Her Highness.

497
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,660
She, in turn, knelt there too,

498
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,460
insisting on punishment
for Second and Third Masters.

499
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,380
They've been kneeling there,

638
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,940
there are exactly 150 of them in total

639
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,900
and they all request the removal
of the Inspectorate Office.

640
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,380

641
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,380
that if she can't find
solid evidence soon,

642
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,900

will cease to exist.

643

00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,300
Yesterday at the Pei's Mansion,

653
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,500
I was disrespectful towards you.

654
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,220
That wasn't my intention.

655
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,300

00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,700
Please forgive me.

657
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,020

658
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,780
In the future,
when there are no outsiders,

659
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:13,420
you can actually call me
Rong or Pingyue.

660
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,140
Rong.

661
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,340
You two have a seat too.

662
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,700
I thought about it carefully.

663
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,980
Over all these years,

664
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,740
I've indeed been kept in the dark,

665
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,380
being aware of nothing.

666
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,340
From now on,

667
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,020
whatever Wenxuan wishes to do,

668
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,780
feel free to proceed.

669
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,420
I'll give you my full support.

670
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:06,460
Mother, you are even stronger
than I imagined.

671
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,500
Over the years...

672
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,540
I've been incompetent.

673
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,620
I hope it's not too late for me...

674
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,340
to take on the responsibilities
of being a mother.

675
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,300
Mother,

676
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,740
it's never too late.

677
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,340

[Eastern Palace]

679
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,940
His Highness has gathered everyone here

680
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,900
to seek support
for the Inspectorate Office.

681
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:46,900
Your Highness,

682
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,940
I've served under you
since I was eighteen.

683
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,540
And it's been a decade.

684
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,980
My loyalty is beyond question,

685
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,220
as I'm sure you know.

686
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,660
Yet, I fear

687
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,260
the unchecked growth
of the Inspectorate Office

688
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,940
could someday threaten your reign.

689
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,820
What if I told you

690
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,700
that I initiated the establishment
of the Inspectorate Office

691
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,500
and it would make it work for me?

692
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,020
Your Highness,

693
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,700
can you truly guarantee
that Princess Pingyue

694
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,100
will obey your every command?

695
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,580
After all, even Mr. Shangguan Xu

696
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,100
doesn't seem to have her respect now.

697
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,100
Since I've chosen
Princess Pingyue as my ally,

698
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,740
I'm confident
she is fully aligned with me.

699
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,140
We must rely on the Inspectorate Office

700
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,140
to pave a new path forward.

701
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:33,900
Your Highness.

702
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,540
What exactly is this path?

703
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,020
Whether from humble origins
or noble families,

704
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,980
as long as they uphold fairness,

705
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,300
integrity, and justice,

706
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,940
ensuring that all people
have enough to live on

707
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,980
and depend on,

708
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,420
they are all with us on the same path.

709
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,060
We must unite these people

710
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,900
to forge a new path

711
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,220
for our generation.

712
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,220
But can we truly make

713
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,740
what you just said come true?

714
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,740
As long as it's in our hearts

715
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,620
and we strive for it,

716
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,780
I believe it will be realized someday

717
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,180
in the future.

718
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,340
- We pledge
- We pledge

719
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,380
- to follow you unto death.
- to follow you unto death.

720
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,140
Let's split up and go after him.

721
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:12,780
Yes.

722
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,180
Is it hurting again?

723
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,100
These people are really ruthless.

724
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:21,940
I'm fine.

725
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,620
Okay.

726
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,380
However,

727
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,220
enduring this beating was worth it.

728
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:27,980
Look,

729
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,180
you and Her Highness
are inseparable now.

730
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,300
That's so nice.

731
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,860
If they had beaten you harder,

732
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,260
wouldn't your relationship be even...

733
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,420
What are you saying?

734
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,620
Alright now.

735
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,100
Please focus on your work.

736
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,140
[Pei Wenxuan]
Be sure to protect my sister well.

737
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,580
I'll handle things

738
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,820
in court.

739
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,700
It's time for us to take action as well.

740
00:37:59,260 --> 00:37:59,860
Mother,

741
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,100
make sure to put on a good act later.

742
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,620
Mother,

743
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,260
follow my lead later

744
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:05,980
and be careful.

745
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:06,980
Okay.

746
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,500
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

747
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,580
- Greetings, Elders.
- Greetings, Elders.

748
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:21,940
What's going on?

749
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,220
The Prince Consort's greetings to you

750
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,060
are equivalent to my greetings to you.

751
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,180
You've forgotten what I said?

752
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,300
Mr. Pei,

753
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,140
aren't you going
to show greetings to my husband?

754
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:37,780
Your Highness,

755
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,260
Second Brother caught a cold yesterday.

756
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,140
Please forgive him.

757
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,500
So you've caught a cold.

758
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,820
Let me summon the Imperial Physician
to take a look at you.

759
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,580
Someone.

760
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,420
No need.

761
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,180
Wenxuan,

762
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:57,540
what are you trying to do today?

763
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,660
Grandfather,

764
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,780
my intentions are simple.

765
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,100
I have turned twenty

766
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,500
and started my own family and career.

767
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,860
I am considered an adult now,

768
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,460
so there's no reason for other elders

769
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,780
to continue
taking care of things for me.

770
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,100
Besides,

771
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,700
even if I can't manage the inheritance

772
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,780
left by my father,

773
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,220
it should be my mother
who can handle it on my behalf.

774
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,260
How could I trouble

775
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,140
other elders to do it?

776
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,780
Your father was the most promising child
in our family.

777
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:41,620
His legacy naturally belongs to you.

778
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,860
However, your recent actions...

779
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,020
have been impulsive.

780
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,860
You've caused so much trouble,

781
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,460
which has provoked many noble families.

782
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,460
You need to discipline yourself.

783
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,940
Indeed. What he said is right.

784
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,660
You're all right.

785
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,740
I haven't achieved much yet.

786
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,660
However, I do have some influence

787
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,140
in the Censorate.

788
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,220
In the future,

789
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,540
I hope you can all support me more
in the official circles.

790
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,420
Of course.

791
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,660
Today, I'd like to clarify my stance.

792
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,580
I am a member of the Pei Family,

793
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,540
no matter if it's in the past or future.

794
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,020
Moreover,

795
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,500
I am already married
to Princess Pingyue.

796
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,100
Our Pei Family

797
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,860
is firmly tied to Her Highness.

798
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,060
Elders,

799
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,860
instead of courting favor
with those noble families,

800
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:42,180
why not wholeheartedly follow
His Majesty and Her Highness?

801
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,300
If so, we don't need to fear
the threats from the noble families.

802
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,620
- Yes, that makes sense.
- Yes, that makes sense.

803
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,980
- Right.
- He does have a point.

804
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,460
Grandfather, please make a decision.

805
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,140
Initially...

806
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:15,300
Initially, when this matter
was entrusted to me to handle,

807
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,460
I mentioned to you

808
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:23,140
that there might be disagreements
in the future.

809
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,740
What did you say back then?

810
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,460
You said Wenxuan was just a child

811
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,140
and not that kind of person.

812
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,580
But what now?

813
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,580
Forget it.

814
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,020
Such utter nonsense.

815
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,380
Initially, you told me

816
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,580
that Wenxuan was still young

817
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,580
and needed to go back to his hometown
to mourn for his father.

818
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,060
I was in poor health

819
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,140
and you were afraid
I'd be tricked by others,

820
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,500
so you asked me to entrust the property

821
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,500
to you to manage.

822
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,740
I don't even want to mention

823
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,180
all the mess you've caused.

824
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,220
But now,

825
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,700
Wenxuan is the Prince Consort

826
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,020
and has returned.

827
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,500
It was so humiliating for me

828
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:07,100
to ask you for money,

829
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,460
and yet you refuse to repay me.

830
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,980
How can you be so shameless?

831
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:11,860
You...

832
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,580
Second Uncle.

833
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,260
My mother's intention

834
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,060
isn't to blame or doubt you.

835
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,620
I know you have
our best interests at heart.

836
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,620
But I really am in need of money.

837
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,980
You've been deceiving me all along.

838
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,060
I trusted you so much,

839
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,580
yet you lied to me like this.

840
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:33,100
How many wrongs have you done to my son?

841
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,900
I've treated you like a younger brother,

842
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,420
yet you've been so heartless.

843
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,100
It's not like that.

844
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:39,620
Please let me explain.

845
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,780
I don't want to hear your explanation.

846
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,900
I already know everything.

847
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,020
What do you know?

848
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,620
I know you actually tried
to kill him back then.

849
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,700
But that's not my focus today.

850
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,020
I'm only here

851
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,380
to ask for the money back.

852
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,020
What are you doing?

853
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,660
I'm telling you

854
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,100
that this is Wenxuan's money.

855
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,300
You must return it to us.

856
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,460
What a shrew!

857
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,940
How can you call me shrew?

858
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,060
You heartless and deceitful person.

859
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,740
If it weren't for Lizhi back then,

860
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,260
could you be who you are today?

861
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,700
Think carefully.

862
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,580
If it weren't for him pleading for you

863
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,700
at the Ministry of Revenue

864
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:11,700
and using his connections,

865
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,100
would you have this position today?

866
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,060
Have you forgotten
how you kneeled before him,

867
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,860
promising to treat Wenxuan
like your own son?

868
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,260
You despicable and ungrateful creature!

869
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,740
I didn't say I wouldn't return it...

870
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,020
That was a bit much.

871
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,180
I'm simply taking care of it
on his behalf.

872
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:25,860
A bit much?

873
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,260
But you've done well.

874
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,100
Pei Wenxuan

875
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,020
has so much on his plate right now.

876
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,060
Can he handle it all?

877
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,180
And you,

878
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,460
do you think you can take charge of it?

879
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,780
I'm genuinely trying to help,

880
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,620
so I take care of it on his behalf.

881
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,420
I don't care...

882
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,060
Mother.

883
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:45,660
