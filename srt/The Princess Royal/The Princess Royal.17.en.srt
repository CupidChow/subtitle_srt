[Episode 17]

5
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,940
Wait for me outside.

6
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,340
Father.

7
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,940
Come and sit here.

8
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,260
No need for the punishment of flogging.

9
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,740
Thank you, Father.

10
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,900
It has been years

11
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,700
since I came to Beiyan Pagoda last time.

12
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,140
I have heard from Mother

13
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,860
that you specifically asked people
to build Beiyan Pagoda for her.

14
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,620
When it was built,

15
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,460
your mother was just pregnant with you.

16
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,140
It was my first time being a father,

17
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,100
and I was very elated.

18
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,540
On her birthday,

19
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,340
I asked her what she liked,

20
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,020
and she said she liked
seeing the stars in the sky.

21
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,820
So, in my first year of reign,

22
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,060
I sent many people
to build Beiyan Pagoda.

23
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,420
It was later that I noticed

24
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,620
your mother loved standing here

25
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,340
to gaze at the lights of the city.

26
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,020
Sometimes, I wonder...

27
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,340
how nice it would be

28
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,980
if time could freeze

29
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,740
at that moment.

30
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:32,460
At least, your mother and I
would have been deeply in love.

31
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,820
And I would have been a good father.

32
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:40,940
Father.

33
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,300
You have always been a good father.

34
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,140
Rong.

35
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,660
You are a clever child.

36
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,140
You're cleverer than Chuan.

37
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,740
Chuan is still young.

38
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,220
So are you.

39
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,660
Yet, you are able to see things

40
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,860
in a clearer perspective than he can.

41
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,260
If only you were a boy.

42
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,460
Father, Chuan is actually
a capable person.

43
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,740
Perhaps you lack
much understanding of him.

44
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,540
Yes, Chuan is capable.

45
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,700
But he resembles me too much.

46
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,620
Rong.

47
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,820
There are many things
out of my control and wishes.

48
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,300
I don't expect you not to blame me.

49
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,300
All I ask is that one day

50
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,660
when I am no longer around,

51
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,660
you can understand

52
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,700
that I truly hope

53
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,660
for you and Chuan to lead a good life.

54
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,500
Has Pei Wenxuan left Huajing?

55
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:16,900
Yes.

56
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,620
He will bring you

57
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,820
what you want, Father.

58
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,140
Very well.

59
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,140
Have a good rest here.

60
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,620
If you need anything,

61
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,980
just tell Fulai.

62
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,420
I knew Princess Pingyue
would ask you to visit me.

63
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,100
So, what is it?

64
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,140
This list was written by General Qin.

65
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,380
They lost the battle at Huangping County

66
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,420
due to the lack of provisions
at the front lines.

67
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,840
[Luo Juan, Tian Zhong...]
These are the names

68
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,970
of the relevant officials involved.

69
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,420
The Princess wants their testimonies.

70
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,380
We can't do anything
about the higher-ranked officials here,

71
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,940
so we have to start
with the lower-ranked ones.

72
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,380
I'm at your service,
as the Princess ordered.

73
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,900
She sure knows how to slack off.

74
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,980
Let's start with this man
named Tian Zhong.

75
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,100
He's just a seventh-ranked official

76
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,420
in charge of the Ministry
of War's accounts.

77
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,300
Being the lustful man he is,

78
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,580
he loves visiting brothels.

79
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,060
Find a good time

80
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,660
to knock him out,
take him here, and tie him up.

81
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,300
Then, get another girl

82
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,300
to fake her own death

83
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,980
and make her lie down on his bed.

84
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,100
Are you going to set him up?

85
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,180
No, we're just scaring him.

86
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,260
I'll come with you by then.

87
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,340
We'll get his testimony

88
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,780
and promise to cover the murder up.

89
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,180
When we've got that on him,

90
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,100
it'll be easier for us
to conduct our future work.

91
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,460
What about the others?

92
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,420
Everyone has a weakness.

93
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,740
We have 19 days.

94
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,340
Let's take them out one by one.

95
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,020
Why are you sighing, Your Highness?

96
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,500
I wonder where Pei Wenxuan is now.

97
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,740
Your Highness.

98
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,100
What are you worrying about?

99
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,180
Your Highness?

100
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,340
Your Highness?

101
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,340
Is everything fine?

102
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,660
Your Majesty.

103
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,620
Rong, have you realized your mistake?

104
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,380
What have I done wrong?

105
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,340
Did I thwart your plans

106
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,260
or seize your power?

107
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,100
You haven't been here
in a long time, have you?

108
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,380
Father asked people to build
this Beiyan Pagoda for you.

109
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,540
You haven't been here
in some time, have you?

110
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,020
You used to be a loving couple,

111
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,980
yet you're both drifting apart.

112
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,300
Why?

113
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,580
That's because you only care
about the Shangguan Family.

114
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,940
You isolated yourself from Father.

115
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,500
Father dotes on Consort Rou so much now

116
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,980
because she has tied her interests

117
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,740
along with Father.

118
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,580
But, I also know...

119
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,740
that you will never take sides
against the Shangguan Family.

120
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,020
Still, please believe me when I say

121
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,780
that I wish my family
could lead a good life.

122
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,980
This has always been
something important to me.

123
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,860
Rong, you resemble your father too much.

124
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,460
Both of you like to mix
emotions and power together.

125
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,900
There are times

126
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,180
when I don't even know if what you say

127
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,220
is true or fake.

128
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,460
In the court, you said

129
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,380
that it's for the country,

130
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,540
and now you're saying it's for family.

131
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,180
I don't know which is true
and whether I should believe you.

132
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,580
I'm here today...

133
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,900
to pass a message from your uncle.

134
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,180
Pei Wenxuan...

135
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,140
He's dead.

136
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,580
Rong.

137
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,300
When you go against the stream,

138
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,780
you'll have to pay the price.

139
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,820
Stop being willful from now on.

140
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,380
Did you say...

141
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,660
that Pei Wenxuan is dead?

142
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,060
Was it you?

143
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,060
Even if it weren't us,

144
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,660
someone else would kill him.

145
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,580
Was it you?

146
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,420
No.

147
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,540
No?

148
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,900
Have you seen his dead body then?

149
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,140
I heard

150
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,380
that he fell into an abyss
with no remains to be found.

151
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,580
That means you haven't seen
his dead body.

152
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,380
Unless you bring his dead body to me,

153
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,180
I will never believe this.

154
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:48,060
Rong, as your mother,

155
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,780
I do not wish to see you
widowed at a young age.

156
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,940
I'm going back.

157
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,060
Rong, a woman in the palace

158
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,140
should never pin her destiny

159
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,140
on a man.

160
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,420
Take care.

161
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,020
Your Highness.

162
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,820
Now that the Prince Consort is...

163
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,020
Nothing would happen to him.

164
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,260
They haven't found his body, right?

165
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,500
Find him first.

166
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,180
But...

167
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,500
But Her Majesty...

168
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,540
What is wrong with you?

169
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,420
Don't you know what kind of person
Pei Wenxuan is?

170
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,140
How could he ever die like this?

171
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:42,900
Yes, Your Highness.

172
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,820
I'll start a search now.

173
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,420
Impossible.

Go ahead.

212
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,940
According to the people inside,

213
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,900
when Princess Pingyue learned

214
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,580
about the Prince Consort's death,

215
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,060
she changed into plain clothes
and did not sleep for the night.

216
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,540
Pei Wenxuan wouldn't die that easily.

217
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,460
Since his body has not been found,

218
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,420
it's possible that he's still alive.

219
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,940
Get someone

220

to search for Pei Wenxuan now.

00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,020
Your Highness,
let me help you freshen up.

222
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,180
His Highness is here to visit you.

223
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,300
Why is he here?

224
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,420
Pei Wenxuan is not dead.

225
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,140
I don't need them to condole with me.

226
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,180
Yes, Your Highness.

227
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,660
Your Highness,

228
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,420
the Princess

229
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,900
does not want to see you.

230
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,140

232
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,260
Pass this letter to my uncle.

233
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,180
Your Highness,
if Princess Pingyue knows about this,

234
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,180
she would not allow you to do so either.

235
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,540
Just do as I say.

236
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:37,700
Yes, Your Highness.

237
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,300
I heard Pei Wenxuan is dead.

238
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,420
So did I.

239
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,660
So, this is a good opportunity

240
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,180
for you to get close
to Princess Pingyue.

241
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,500
But, I feel...

242
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,700
that Pei Wenxuan wouldn't die so easily.

243
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,420
Why don't you
send someone to verify then?

244
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,700
Ronghua, here you go.

245
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,140

246
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,780
In my opinion,

247
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,900
if Pei Wenxuan were dead,

248
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,420
His Majesty might not stop you
from marrying Princess Pingyue.

249
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,420
Why do you say so?

250
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,180
That's because he thinks

251
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,420
you may work for Consort Rou,

252
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,300
which means you may work
for him as well.

253
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,700
But, do you think

254
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,300
he would believe this?

255
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,660
That's not up to him to decide.

256
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,060
If Princess Pingyue lost,

257
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,540
he would need to win

258
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,260
over anyone who may work for him.

259
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,580

263

you have finally wised up.

264
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,060

00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,420

270
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,300
They all said you died

271
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,860
but I don't believe them.

272
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,460
That's why I'm writing a letter to you.

273
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,380
You'd love to know
what I'm writing, right?

274
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,020
If so,

275
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,780
please stay alive

276
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,380
so you can read my letter.

277
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,300
This is the first letter.

278
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,940
Speaking of which...

279
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,860
this is my first time
writing a letter formally.

280
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,260

hand over the records to them?

286

and the Inspectorate Office's tokens.

287
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,860
I simply couldn't say no.

288
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,300
Fortunately, Pei Wenxuan
fell off a cliff.

289
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,620

it's useless now.

and more like the Prince Consort's.

319
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,260

Please punish me.

Have you been well?

334
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,180
Today, they told me again that you died.

335
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,300
I know this is impossible.

336
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,900
Given your wits,

337
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,260
as soon as you left the capital,

338
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,940
you must have formulated a plan.

339
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,500
Maybe you've planned all this.

340
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,900

Then, why are you here?

344
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,300
I'm just here to take a look around.

were still around.

00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,100
What are you saying?

348
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,740
My young master must be still alive.

349

350
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,540
He'll be back in a few days.

351
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,660
Yes, that must be the case.

352
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,780
The Prince Consort has always

353
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,540
been blessed with good luck.

354
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,060
I'm sure he will be fine.

355
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,340
Let me help you with it.

356
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,700

Yes.

359
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,820
I watched my young master grew up.

360
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,740
Everyone describes him
as handsome and talented.

361
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,780
I've heard that a million times,
and it's nothing to me.

362
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,940
Still, there's one thing about him...

363
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,380
that impresses me the most.

364
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,540
What is it?

365
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,140
Well,

366
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,660
since his childhood,

367
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,300
he has always done what he has said.

368
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,780
He never broke his promise.

369
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,140
It's not easy for the Prince Consort...

370
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,540
to keep all his promises.

371
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,220
So, since he promised to return,

372
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,580
he would.

373
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,580
Moreover,

374
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,460
this was a promise
he made to the Princess.

375
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,420
Father, please make the call.

376
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,100
How should we deal
with Wenxuan's assets?

377
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,020
What do you think, Liming?

378
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,740
The Princess's Mansion
hasn't sent out an obituary.

379
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,020
Since they haven't sent out an obituary,

380
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,940
that means the news
has not been finalized.

381
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,180
Both the Shangguan Family
and the Su Family have spread the news.

382
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,220
They all said

383
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,100
that Wenxuan died.

384
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,260
He's not dead.

385
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,580
Even now,

386
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,220
do you still look forward to his death?

387
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,260
I'm here today with a message

388
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,820
that should put an end to your frenzy.

389
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,500
Even if Wenxuan were dead,

390
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,220
I myself

391
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,380
would do the needful.

392
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,580
Pei Wenxuan.

393
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:12,780
Jinglan.

394
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,180
Your Highness.

395
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,900
Any news about Pei Wenxuan yet?

396
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,620
Your Highness, the Qin Family's members
will be executed tomorrow.

397
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,980
General Qin Lin
will reach the capital today.

398
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,780
Pass a message to Xun Chuan.

399
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,060
Tell her to bring
General Qin Lin and the others

400
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,820
to the Princess's Mansion.

401
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,540
Yes, Your Highness.

402
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,140
- Long live His Majesty!
- Long live His Majesty!

403
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,300
His Majesty has ordered
that Princess Pingyue's Mansion

404
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:58,540
will be responsible for watching
over Qin Lin and the others.

405
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,900
Understood.

406
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,020
Release them.

407
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:20,620
Miss.

408
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,780
General Qin, it must have been
a tiring journey.

409
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,140
Please board the carriage.

410
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,150
[Princess's Mansion]

411
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,620
You may leave.

412
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,340
General Qin.

413
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,500
Princess Pingyue wants you to rest here

414
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,020
while she handles everything else.

415
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,540
Thank you, Miss.

416
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,300
If you need anything,
just tell the servants.

417
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,220
Okay.

418
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,420
Then, I'll take my leave.

419
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,100
Miss.

420
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,820
Princess Pingyue...

421
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,180
Do not worry, General Qin.

422
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,420
Her Highness has put her future
on the line.

423
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,900
I'm sure that the Qin Family

424
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,260
will have their names cleared tomorrow.

425
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,460
I wanted to ask...

426
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,180
that since you're
working for the Princess,

427
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,700
I heard that the last place
my sister visited

428
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,220
was Princess Pingyue's Mansion.

429
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,900
They said she died...

430
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,580
General Qin.

431
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,900
She's fine.

432
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,020
Rest assured.

433
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,940
Now that I recall,
when I left back then,

434
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,700
her stature looked just like yours.

435
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,580
Your sister is blessed
with good fortune.

436
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,820
Just rest assured, General Qin.

437
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,060
I'll take my leave.

438
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,980
Your Majesty, are you worried

439
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,580
about how Pingyue will clean up her mess

440
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,660
if she doesn't have any evidence?

441
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,540
So, in your opinion,

442
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,580
if Pei Wenxuan couldn't return,

443
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,300
how would this mess be cleaned up?

444
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,740
Your Majesty, you love throwing me
the hard questions.

445
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,900
I haven't figured it out yet.

446
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,740
But, I do know

447
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,540
that you wouldn't want Pingyue
to leave the capital.

448
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,980
You're not answering my question.

449
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,260
If the Prince Consort were really dead,

450
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,020
Pingyue would become a widow.

451
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,140
She can still stay in the capital
with her in-laws, though.

452
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:05,980
So, who else do you think

453
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,940
is still capable of protecting Pingyue?

454
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,100
There is someone,

455
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,660
but that depends on Pingyue's attitude.

456
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,380
Xu!

457
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,060
You may leave.

458
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

459
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,660
As the Empress,

460
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,020
you must never

461
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,700
allow anyone
to notice that you're anxious.

462
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,380
Sit down first.

463
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,020
How can I not be anxious?

464
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,460
Tomorrow is the day.

465
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,780
Pingyue is my daughter, after all.

466
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,060
I don't want her to leave the capital.

467
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,340
We tried to persuade

468
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,580
and stop her.

469
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:12,940
What happens eventually
is a result of her own choices.

470
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,260
Xu.

471
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,220
You need to do something.

472
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,380
Just wait.

473
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,900
Wait for the Qin Family's end

474
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,980
and Pingyue's end.

475
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,820
Did you know that the Crown Prince
sent me a letter?

476
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,060
He threatened me

477
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,100
that if Pingyue is exiled,

478
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,660
he will give up the position
as Crown Prince.

479
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,740
Does he lose his mind?

480
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,220
No, he can't do that.

481
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,260
He can't do that.

482
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:53,980
Xu!

483
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,500
Do not worry, Your Majesty.

484
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,620
The Crown Prince and you
are not the only ones

485
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,340
who don't want her to leave the capital.

486
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,900
There's only one day left.

487
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,580
Sirs, there is still hope.

488
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,380
You need to trust Mr. Pei.

489
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,620
The Princess wants all of you

490
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,420
to eat and rest well.

491
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,020
She will handle the rest.

492
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,620
Right.

493
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,860
We need to have faith
in Princess Pingyue and Mr. Pei.

494
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,740
Come on, let's dig in.

495
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,400
[Beiyan Pagoda]

496
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:01,620
I, Su Rongqing, would like to request
an audience with Princess Pingyue.

497
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:16,860
Your Highness.

498
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,020
Young Master Su is here.

499
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,140
Greetings, Your Highness.

500
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,700
The Qin Family will be executed today.

501
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,540
Why are you here

502
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,020
instead of watching the execution?

503
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,780
I've heard that you will be
leaving Huajing today,

504
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,780
so I'm here to visit you.

505
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,660
Before your departure,

506
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,580
may I play a game of weiqi
and have some tea

507
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:51,860
with you?

508
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,760
Mr. Su, you're bidding me farewell

509
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,740
so early in the morning.

510
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,900
I wonder why you're so certain

511
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,620
that I'd lose this time.

512
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,100
Your turn.

513
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,860
That person...

514
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,380
He's dead.

515
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,860
You must not show the evidence

516
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,380
that has been gathered by your men.

517
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,780
Why not?

518
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,700
There are too many people on the list.

519
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,540
If you show the evidence...

520
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,940
I'm afraid you'd die
before leaving the capital.

521
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,020
You know who are on the list?

522
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:39,860
Yes.

523
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:41,940
I thought...

524
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,260
you wouldn't tolerate such evil acts.

525
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,700
As for embezzling
military provisions and funds,

526
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,580
no matter whether it's me, my father,

527
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,340
or Mr. Shangguan,

528
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,380
none of us can tolerate it.

529
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,500
Is that so?

530
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,140
However, this is not something

531
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,980
that you should deal with.

532
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,860
It should be handled in-house.

533
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,260
If you were to investigate this,

534
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,020
you would be putting the noble families

535
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,100
at huge risk.

536
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,460
That's why the noble families
cannot authorize you

537
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,060
to handle this case.

538
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,780
I didn't expect you...

539
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,500
to tell me all that
so straightforwardly.

540
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:27,820
Even if I don't tell you,

541
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,060
you know all this, don't you?

542
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,060
So, you're here today

543
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,340
to show off.

544
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,700
You're showing off
that I have lost to you.

545
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,900
The Inspectorate Office
has died on the vine.

546
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,140
His Majesty has no reason

547
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,540
to establish
a second Inspectorate Office.

548
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:49,140
You're no longer at risk now.

549
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,820
Happy now, Mr. Su?

550
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:01,180
I'm here today with a question.

551
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,980
I hope you can give me an answer to it.

552
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,260
I wonder what other questions

553
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,140
I can answer for you.

554
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,020
Your Highness, you're making enemies
with the noble families.

555
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,660
Is it for...

556
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,540
Mr. Pei?

557
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,020
What a pity.

558
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,660
Here comes
the Supervisor of Decapitation!

559
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,540
I thought the Qin Family were wronged.

560
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,980
Why are they still going to be executed?

561
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,060
It's not just the Qin Family.

562
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,300
The Princess who was trying
to seek justice for the Qin Family

563
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,100
is being exiled from the capital today.

564
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,380
After all, no one can
go against the noble families.

565
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,820
Miss, when should we take action?

566
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,660
A while more.

567
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,900
The Princess has ordered

568
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,620
that we shouldn't take action
until we have to.

569
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,020
Your Majesty.

570
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,580
The criminals from the Qin Family
are at the execution site now.

571
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,740
We have solid evidence against them,

572
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,860
while Princess Pingyue

573
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,060
has not presented any rebuttal evidence.

574
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,260
Therefore, Your Majesty,
please give the command

575
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,500
to execute the Qin Family,
who have betrayed the country

576
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,020
and embezzled
the military provisions and funds

577
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,700
to serve as a warning to the others.

578
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,900
Your Majesty, I agree

579
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:42,460
that the Qin Family
should be executed immediately.

580
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,820
Your Majesty,
please give the execution command now

581
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,260
in accordance
with the court's principle.

582
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:57,920
- Your Majesty,
- Your Majesty,

583
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,580
- please give the execution command now
- please give the execution command now

584
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,200
- in accordance
- in accordance

585
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,340
- with the court's principle.
- with the court's principle.

586
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:09,180
- I agree!
- I agree!

587
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,300
Why do you ask that?

588
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,820
There's something
I'd like to discuss with you.

589
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:20,900
Go ahead.

590
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,260
The noble families
are directing their anger at you,

591
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,580
and they're aiming
to banish you from Huajing.

592
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,100
I have a plan

593
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,740
that would protect you.

594
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,860
I wonder

595
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,140
who is capable of turning the tide.

596
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,700
I...

597
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,540
I ask for your hand in marriage,
Your Highness.

598
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:08,700
Will you marry me?

599
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,060
Your Highness.

600
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,420
Over the past few days,

601
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,500
you kept sending gifts to me,

602
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:41,140
assuming that Pei Wenxuan is dead,

603
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,500
am I right?

604
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,460
What if I said

605
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,940
that Pei Wenxuan's death

606
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,820
gave me some courage and hope?

607
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:01,500
In the past, I'd been in love with you,

608
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,100
but because of my family's stance,

609
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,060
I dared not express my feelings for you.

610
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:13,580
His Majesty wouldn't have allowed you
to marry into my family either.

611
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,020
Until now, I've finally realized...

612
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,020
that if I miss this opportunity,

613
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,820
I will miss you forever.

614
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,020
I want to live for myself this once.

615
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:41,820
The biggest regret in my life

616
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:47,140
is missing you.

617
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,780
No matter whether we are a couple
or allies,

618
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,060
our destinies are intertwined.

619
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,100
Your Highness.

620
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,460
I missed you once,

621
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,540
and I don't wish to miss you again.

622
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,740
That's enough.

623
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,340
Fulai, prepare the decree.

624
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,220
I, Pei Wenxuan,
show my greetings to you, Your Majesty.

625
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,500
He's really hard to kill.

626
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:46,780
Pei Wenxuan?

627
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,740
Greetings, Your Majesty.

628
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,740
Long live Your Majesty.

629
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,020
That's enough. Get up.

630
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,620
Pei Wenxuan, aren't you sick?

631
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:00,780
Your Majesty,

632
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,180
Princess Pingyue must have told you

633
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,180
that I was feigning illness
while secretly leaving the capital

634
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,700
to thoroughly investigate
the Qin Family's case.

635
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,100
Continue.

636
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,820
I left the capital secretly,

637
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,060
but I found
that someone was following me,

638
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,460
so I set up a trap

639
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,740
to fake my own death

640
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,140
in order to fool them.

641
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,700
That's how I managed
to reach the Northwest

642
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:27,860
to thoroughly investigate the case.

643
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:28,860
Now,

644
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,940
I have obtained evidence
that can clear the Qin Family's name.

645
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,460
Therefore, Your Majesty,
please send someone

646
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,260
to the execution site
to halt the execution.

647
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,060
Fulai.

648
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,980
Send someone to the execution site

649
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,180
and stop the execution.

650
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,100
Your Highness!

651
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,140
Your Highness!

652
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,220
