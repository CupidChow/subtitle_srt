00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,140
Don't worry.

6
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,460
I'm fine.

7
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,500
Rest up somewhere safe.

8
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,700
I need to look for Su Rongqing.

9
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,260
I don't want to be
separated from you again.

10
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,540
I won't leave again.

12
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,380
Your Highness.

13
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,460
Are you alright?

14
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,500
Is everything well?

15
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,580
I'm fine, Your Highness.

16
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,620
And Qin Lin?

17
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,540
We've just received news

18
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,340
that General Qin has
successfully killed Xiao Su.

19
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,620
He is now taking over his troops

20
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,860
and he is on his way back to Huajing.

21
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,180
Before he started his journey,

22
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,940
General Qin ordered me
to come and save you.

23
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,300
Thank you.

24
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,460

Where's the imperial jade seal?
Where is it?

27
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,340
Tell me!

28
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,140
Aren't you going to pass
the throne to Cheng?

29
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,700
Give me the imperial jade seal!

30
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,020
After you take the seal,

31
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,660
what will you do?

32
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,300
I can give my throne away,

33
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,940
but you cannot demand it

34
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,860
nor deceive me.

35
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,140
To you,

36
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,220
we're just lowly
and despicable creatures,

37
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,780
like a bunch of pets
that demand your love.

38
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,100
You despise the noble families
for their lofty behavior,

39
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,340
but in your heart,

40
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,540
you also love how lofty they are.

41
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,220
Give me the seal!

42
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,460
You've been hoping to be lofty yourself

43
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,380
for many years, haven't you?

44
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,820
Yes, I have been longing for it
for many years,

45
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,380
even in my dreams.

46
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,060
Give me the seal!

47

The seal!

49
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,820
You wish.

50
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:08,740
No.

Cheng will ascend the throne.
I will be the Empress Dowager.

Give me the seal! Give it to me!

55

Even if I give you the seal,

56
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,500
do you think you can bear the weight

57
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,820
of the entire country?

58
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,060
Are you able to take the responsibility?

59

He's your father!

75
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,260
He is our father,

76
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,540
as well as Huayue and Li Cheng's father.

77
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,460
He's also your husband.

78

Put the blade down.

80

I'll let you go.

81
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,500
I don't believe you.

I'm begging you.

87
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,780
Since we're both related by blood,

88

please let us go.

89

We have done many terrible things.

90

I swear

91
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,820
that if you let us go,

92
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,060
I'll be your most loyal

93
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,340

96
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,100
It's our fault.

97

Rong, let us go.

98

Huayue, stand up!

99
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,820
Begging is the most useless thing to do!

100
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,500
Stand up, now!

101
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,460
Stand up, you hear me?

102
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,780
Xiao Rou.

103
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:09,860
I know...

104
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,900
you just want a way out.

105
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,980
You don't really intend to kill him.

106
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,420
You wouldn't kill someone
who truly loves you.

107
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:21,780
Right?

108
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,140
Wrong.

109
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,540
He has never loved me.

110
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,460
He has never thought
of building a pagoda for me

111
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,740
or given me any respect.

112
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,020
He hits me and yells at me
as he pleases.

113
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,820
All I am to him is a tool!

114
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,660
He uses me when he needs to,

115
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,060
simply because of my lowly background.

116
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,860
I'm unlike your mother

117
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,460
who was born into a noble family,

118
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,940
carrying the blood of
the Shangguan Family.

119
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,060
That's why she could never
do anything wrong

120
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,420
and she would always be respected.

121
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,980
But why?

122
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,020
Why are you born superior

123
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,100
while I have to be insulted
since I was born?

124
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,500
Is this fair?

125
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,900
No.

126
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,460
That's why you should fight.

127
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,860
I sympathize with you,

128
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,740
but this is no reason for you

129
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,420
to commit evil recklessly.

130
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,540
Xiao Rou...

131
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,980
You sympathize with me?

132
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,300
Do I need others to sympathize with me?

133
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,460
Yes, people like you

134
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,580
should sympathize with me.

135
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,900
Besides,

136
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,540
I should thank you for your sympathy!

137
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,580
Mother?

138
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,380
Mother!

139
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,140
Mother!

140
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,020
Father.

141
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,980
Get the imperial physician!

142
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,580
Hold this.

143
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,060
Slowly.

144
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,380
Keep an eye on Father here.

145
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,940
I need to look for Pei Wenxuan.

146
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,500
This belonged to my brother.

147
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,820
Stay away from me.

148

[Weiyang Palace]

149
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,380
You've always wanted to kill me,
haven't you?

150
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,180
Since the first time you held
the umbrella for Her Highness,

151
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,020
I started to have the intention
to kill you.

152
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,900
What a coincidence.

153
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,260
On the day the Princess got married,

154
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,460
I had the same thought.

155
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,820
That means

156
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,900
I should thank you
for sparing my life, shouldn't I?

157
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,180
Su Rongqing,
why are you still struggling?

158
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,500
You can't escape from this.

159
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,340
The fake Li Cheng is useless.

160
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,940
Her Highness has made her mind up.

161
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,100
A posthumous decree is not going
to make her give up.

162
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,820
Su Rongqing.

163
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,900
You could have chosen other paths,

164
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,980
yet you refuse to do so.

165
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,900
Since you had also
traveled back in time,

166
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,740
you could have proposed to her,

167
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,580
but you didn't.

168
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,500
You could have put the past behind

169
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,300
and assisted Li Chuan together with her.

170
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,460
But you refused to do so.

171
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,580
You knew that
the noble families were in the wrong

172
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,460
and that you could have
mended Li Chuan's ways,

173
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,420
but you were unwilling to do so.

174
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,100
In the end, you're left with nothing,

175
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,580
but you still insist
that you have no choice.

176
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,420
Su Rongqing.

177
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,500
Don't you find that hilarious?

178
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,740
Hilarious?

179
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,100
But, I am the young master
of the Su Family.

180
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,620
How could I abandon my family?

181
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,500
I have already lost Her Highness.

182
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,580
I have already lost everything.

183
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,700
I colluded with the noble families

184
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,900
and risk my life on the line.

185
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,820
Now, you're telling me

186
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,020
that I am wrong?

187
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,140
Then, what about everything I had lost?

188
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,260
Did I lose them for nothing?

189
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,940
I could have proposed to Her Highness

190
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,140
like my brother

191
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,540
who begged my father willfully

192
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,300
to marry the girl he loved.

193
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,140
But I didn't.

194
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,900
In the past,

195
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,340
I looked on as she married you.

196
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,940
On the day she got married,

197
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,540
I ran after the carriage

198
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,860
all the way to the Princess's Mansion.

199
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,740
This time, I was your groomsman.

200
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,060
I'll settle these scores with you later.

201
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,340
I handed her to you

202
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,420
because I have already chosen this path.

203
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,060
I have already lost
the most precious thing to me.

204
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,820
I can't be wrong.

205
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,140
I can't be wrong!

206
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,460
Su Rongqing, remember this.

207
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,780
You didn't give up on Her Highness.

208
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,060
It was me who fought for her.

209
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,740
Whether you fight for her or not,

210
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,580
Her Highness is mine.

211
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,100
Remember this.

212
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,220
Just admit your mistakes.

213
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,540
She loves me,

214
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,260
so you should scram.

215
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,060
Here, whether you're dead or alive,

216
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,620
don't even think
of getting near to Her Highness.

217
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:26,860
Your Highness.

218
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,300
We have Su Rongqing's men under control.

219
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,140
Where are they now?

220
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,900
I still lost after all.

221
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,140
Su Rongqing, why didn't you dodge?

222
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,380
I'm fine.

223
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,980
I'll wait for you outside.

224
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,660
You're here, Your Highness.

225
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,700
I'm glad.

226
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:51,980
Everything...

227
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,900
has come to an end.

228
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,700
Your Highness.

229
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,180
Must you reform the system?

230
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,540
I must.

231
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,940
I hope I don't have to use
high-sounding words

232
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,820
to conceal the country's
social disparities.

233
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,940
The noble families and the commoners
should be the same.

234
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,660
When such discrimination
no longer exists...

235
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,060
the world...

236
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,380
will finally be at peace.

237
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,740
I didn't know

238
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,420
you had such fantasies.

239
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,580
When will that day ever come, though?

240
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,580
Your Highness.

241
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,700
I have never wanted to harm you.

242
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,980
I have always hoped the best for you.

243
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,380
Even if you married Pei Wenxuan...

244
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,140
I still wished the best for you.

245
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,500
This time, I didn't propose to you

246
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,900
not because I was a coward,

247
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,460
but because I knew...

248
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,300
you liked him.

249
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,180
I also know

250
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,500
that I had harmed you,

251
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,180
and that

252
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,660
you would never forgive me

253
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,260
for trying to kill Li Chuan.

254
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,820
I tried to stop you from establishing
the Inspectorate Office

255
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,620
because the noble families
were too strong

256
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,260
and I didn't want to see you
being threatened.

257
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,500
I proposed to you at Beiyan Pagoda

258
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,500
because the noble families

259
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,420
tried to expel you from Huajing.

260
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,660
I thought Pei Wenxuan was dead,

261
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,940
and you lost your bet
with the imperial court.

262
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,820
So the only way to protect you

263
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:07,340
was to appeal for you
in the name of my family.

264
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,940
I did not mean to offend you

265
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,260
or take advantage of you.

266
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,540
I know.

267
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,660
This is yours.

268
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,380
You dropped this...

269
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,700
when we met for the first time

270
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,780
when we were young.

271
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,860
I wanted to keep it secretly,

272
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,660
but I still felt...

273
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,820
that I should return it to you.

274
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,620
I have always loved you.

275
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,780
When I was ten,

276
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,060
when we first met in the Imperial Study,

277
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,660
I had already fallen in love with you.

278
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,900
Be it in my dreams and reality...

279
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,500
I have always loved only you.

280
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,580
Your Highness.

281
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,860
This time...

282
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,900
have you lived a good life?

283
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,020
I've had a great life this time.

284
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,100
That's wonderful.

285
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,780
Your Highness.

286
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,980
Are you...

287
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,340
Yes, Rongqing.

288
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,260
I'm carrying a baby.

289
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,060
Well.

290
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,900
Congratulations.

291
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,980
Your Highness, did you know...

292
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,820
that it was once my greatest desire?

293
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,220
Sometimes, I thought...

294
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,060
that if we could

295
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,180
have our own children,

296
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,420
that would be lovely.

297
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,220
Unfortunately,

298
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,340
I was castrated...

299
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,900
in the past.

300
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,380
It was impossible for me
to achieve that.

301
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,180
But, the heavens took pity on me.

302
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,900
It gave me another chance to start over.

303
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,940
I cherished this opportunity...

304
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,300
more than any of you did.

305
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,060
Sometimes, I wondered

306
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,820
that perhaps

307
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,020
I should hold on a little longer

308
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,420
and tolerate a little more.

309
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,940
When everything settles,

310
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,100
I may just catch your attention.

311
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,340
The 17 years that we had spent together

312
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,780
motivated me to move forward this far.

313
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,540
Many times have I wanted
to shirk my family responsibilities...

314
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:24,220
just to have a family with you.

315
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,660
That would have been enough for me.

316
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,100
Unfortunately...

317
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,300
I no longer have this chance anymore.

318
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,460
Actually, it's all your choice.

319
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,820
We made one decision after another

320
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,820
based on our own will

321
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,940
and reached where we are now.

322
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:07,820
Rongqing.

323
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,900
My current life...

324
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,980
is pretty good.

325
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,460
Since you're doing good...

326
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,180
then that...

327
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,700
would be a relief for me.

328
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:48,820
I would like to play...

329
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,740
a final score for you.

330
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,340
Here are some medicines

331
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,620
that can save your life.

332
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,300
From now on,

333
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,860
Su Rongqing is dead.

334
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,700
You won't have to suffer anymore.

335
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,060
You will no longer be
the young master of the Su Family.

336
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,620
Get out there and be a normal person.

337
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,860
Once you experience
the vicissitudes of life,

338
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,500
benefit the world with your knowledge.

339
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,260
That's the only way
to atone for your mistakes.

340
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,300
I shall remember that.

341
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,220
He's playing

342
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:27,900
"A Happy Farewell".

343
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,660
Su Rongqing.

344
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:49,860
Your Highness.

345
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,300
Su Rongqing, stop this foolishness!

346
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,460
Rong.

347
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,660
Farewell.

348
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:09,620
Your Highness!

349
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,500
Get out of there, Su Rongqing!

350
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,100
It's dangerous!

351
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,180
You don't have to do this.
You can start over.

352
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,020
Your Highness!

353
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:14,860
Don't do this!

354
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,420
Go!

355
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,900
Go!

356
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,340
Go!

357
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,940
Su Rongqing!

358
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:30,620
Hurry.

359
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,660
Get another piece of clean cloth! Hurry.

360
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,540
Stop the bleeding!

361
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,980
Chuan.

362
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,260
Leave. Now!

363
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:48,980
All of you, leave!

364
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,860
Yes.

365
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,380
Chuan.

366
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,660
Chuan.

367
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,580
Remember.

368
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,380
Chuan.

369
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,820
Remember my words.

370
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,140
In the future...

371
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,500
don't be like me.

372
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:44,300
I was born with free will.

373
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,700
Yet...

374
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:54,980
I couldn't live freely.

375
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,780
I'm...

376
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,300
sorry.
