[Episode 5]

6
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,620
I heard you saved Pingyue last night.

7
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,900
Why aren't you saying anything?

8
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,020
Your Majesty.

9
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,260
Please save my life.

10
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,900
What's going on?

11
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,580
Why would you say that?

12
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,460
Your Majesty.

13
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,180
It's only a matter of time
before my head rolls.

14
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,780
Who'd want your head?

15
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,620
You must've heard

16
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,500
what happened last night.

17
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,900
While I saved Her Highness,

18
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,340
because of circumstances,

19
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,700
we spent the night alone together

20
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,540
and it taints her honor.

21
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,100
Please punish me with death.

22
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,660
Well...

23
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,060
That's not punishable by death.

24
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,660
No.

25
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,700
There's another reason
for my imminent death.

26
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:28,940
Explain.

27
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,300
The situation was urgent.

28
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,300
I should have come to you first,

29
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,740
but the Empress came to me first.

30
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,300
She wanted me

31
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,860
to hide the fact that I spent the night
with Her Highness

32
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,620
and even wanted me to vouch

33
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,740
it was Yang Quan who saved the princess.

34
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,980
You're worried about the Empress?

35
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,900
If I may make a daring guess,

36
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,580
Her Majesty has long decided to form

37
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,740
marital ties with the Yangs.

38
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,260
What happened last night

39
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,020
was an act put up for the princess

40
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,300
to be impressed by Yang Quan

41
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,300
who saved her in times of distress.

42
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,220
Yet I ruined their plans.

43
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,860
With how petty Yang Quan is

44
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,300
and how brazen the Yangs usually are,

45
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,380
the moment I exit the palace gates,

46
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,740
only death awaits.

47
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,220
Rest assured.

48
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,860
The Empress will not kill you

49
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,140
for something this insignificant.

50
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,700
Get up.

51
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,220
Your Majesty, do you really see
their potential alliance

52
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,860
as no cause for concern?

53
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,740
You may be young,

54
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,580
but you know plenty.

55
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,580
Say,

56
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,380
have you truly decided on Pei Wenxuan?

57
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,620
Well, Queen Mother

58
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,180
wants you to choose Yang Quan.

59
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,940
He has command over the troops.

60
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,660
But you must understand.

61
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,700
If the Yangs are seen as
aligning with the Crown Prince,

62
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,540
they military command they hold

63
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,220
will soon change hands.

64
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,300
Then why did you put Yang Quan's name

65
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,860
on the Consort list?

66
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,180
Lay it out for me.

67
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,500
Why is it a significant thing
if the Yangs ally with the Crown Prince?

68
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:18,660
Your Majesty.

69
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,020
They Yangs has guarded
the borders for years,

70
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:21,940
earning great renown.

71
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,860
Yet late last winter,

72
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,740
when the enemies attacked again,

73
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,540
the Yangs lost two cities in a row

74
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,140
losing against 20,000 enemies
with 50,000 troops.

75
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,540
Have you considered?

76
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,460
The Yangs have guarded
the borders for years.

77
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,020
Why would they crumble like that?

78
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,260
So you know?

79
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,500
If I dare assume,

80
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,940
you do, too.

81
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,700
Over the years,

82
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,140
the Yangs have been bribing the enemies
with army rations.

83
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,660
The yearly battles

84
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,060
was just a show

85
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,140
put up by the Yangs and the enemies.

86
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,620
Pei Wenxuan.

87
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,940
How many heads do you have?

88
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,620
You make bold claims.

89
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,380
Your Majesty.

90
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,580
These people are ruthless and ambitious.

91
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,020
If they cling to the Noble Houses

92
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,020
and mislead the Crown Prince,

93
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,620
the country will be compromised.

94
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,820
If I chose Yang Quan,

95
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,500
Father would learn

96
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,060
I'm after the Yang Family's
military command

97
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,740
and wants to betray him.

98
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,380
He may have secretly collected evidences

99
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,140
of the Yang Family's wrongdoings.

100
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,300
Then, when he deals with the Yangs,

101
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,940
he'll deal with us too.

102
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,380
I see.

103
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,380
I do not think
the Yangs account to much.

104
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:35,860
And now,

105
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,060
this is the best time
to deal with the Yangs.

106
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,940
Then what about the borders?

107
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,060
Force them into revolting?

108
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,740
In today's imperial court,

109
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,060
there aren't many who would dare
stand up against the Yangs.

110
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,420
Pei Wenxuan.

111
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,860
If I make you my blade

112
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,580
and tell you to kill Yang Quan

113
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,380
as your betrothal gift to marry Pingyue,

114
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,900
would you dare to do it?

115
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,580
I don't understand.

116
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,460
We're both his biological children.

117
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,340
Why is he doing this to us?

118
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,220
Would things have turned out differently

119
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,820
if I'm not the Crown Prince?

120
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,300
Chuan.

121
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,780
I hope you can maintain

122
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,180
this purity always.

123
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,660
As for the others,

124
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,180
leave it all to me.

125
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,620
Okay?

126
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,780
I've made you fret over my matters.

127
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,180
What pertains to you
pertains to the entire Yang family.

128
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,060
We cannot afford a single misstep.

129
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,500
How did the audience
with His Majesty go?

130
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,940
He said he'd consider

131
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,300
the waved me away.

132
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,300
However,

133
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,340
he then summoned Pei Wenxuan privately.

134
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,100
Her Majesty too summoned Pei Wenxuan.

135
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,700
I'm afraid

136
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,180
His Majesty, Li Rong, and the Empress

137
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,500
have all chosen Pei Wenxuan.

138
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,220
What should we do?

139
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,540
I did everything I could. Father, he...

140
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,260
Quan.

141
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,860
Over the years,

142
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,060
our father and brother
led our people to battle.

143
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,380
Meanwhile, I stayed in the palace
and painstakingly maneuvered

144
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,700
every careful move

145
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,820
before the Yang Family
could flourish like so,

146
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,180
earning our repute in the Northwest.

147
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,100
I cannot stand by and watch

148
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,860
everything fizzle into nothing.

149
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:56,940
Li Ming.

150
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,020
He has thoroughly humiliated me.

151
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:04,980
Sister.

152
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,540
What do we do now?

153
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,420
Since they'd like to choose Pei Wenxuan,

154
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,500
we'll just erase that man

155
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,740
from this world.

156
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,180
Why do you trust Pei Wenxuan?

157
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,940
Anyhow, I don't.

158
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,860
You don't need to trust him.

159
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,260
Just trust in me.

160
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,740
I won't harm you.

161
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,380
But...

162
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,380
I need your help.

163
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,060
Okay.

164
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,580
Everything you say.

165
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,420
Okay.

166
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,740
I should get going.

167
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,020
Pei Wenxuan should be almost done.

168
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,700
This is a nice sword.

169
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,460
I'll gift this to Pei Wenxuan
on your behalf.

170
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,900
When he succeeds,

171
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,260
he'd be your ally.

172
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:19,740
Halt.

173
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,820
Mr. Pei.

174
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,700
This is for you.

175
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,780
Consider a token of thanks
for saving my life.

176
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,420
I got it from the Crown prince for you.

177
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,620
Do you dare accept it?

178
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,220
You've dared to bring it.

179
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,700
Why wouldn't I dare to accept?

180
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,420
I've also sent you some men.

181
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,980
Good luck.

182
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,580
Thank you, Your Highness.

183
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,020
Let's go.

184
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:28,860
Fu Lai.

185
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,180
Your Majesty.

186
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,820
If Pei Wenxuan succeeds,

187
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,220
ensure that I can see him immediately.

188
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,900
If he fails,

189
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,100
get rid of him.

190
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,340
I've never seen him today.

191
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

192
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,420
[Ministry of Justice]
Su received intel.

193
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,660
There will be a disturbance
in the city today.

194
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,100
The Ministry of Justice

195
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,060
must bring in the culprit at once.

196
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,100
Yes, sir!

197
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,060
Young Master, didn't you say
it'd be dangerous?

198
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,100
Why did you come to such a remote place?

199
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:04,660
Shut it.

200
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,620
You can disappear now.

201
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,940
Disappear?

202
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,220
Hide well.

203
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,620
Your Highness!

204
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,100
Still no news from the hidden guards?

205
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,460
Yes, Your Highness.

206
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,060
You'd better survive.

207
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,700
How dare... you kill me!

208
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,100
Colluding with the enemy,
holding the princess hostage,

209
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,500
and killing important officials.

210
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,140
You Yangs dare to do it all.

211
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,620
Why wouldn't I

212
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,220
dare to kill you then?

213
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,780
Young Master! Are you alright?

214
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,700
I came under the princess's orders
to protect you, Mr. Pei.

215
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,900
For Her Highness to lend a hand,

216
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,180
I am grateful.

217
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,620
I will visit another time
to thank her personally.

218
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,700
No need, Mr. Pei.

219
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,020
Her Highness insisted
there is no need for such hassle.

220
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,940
She sure treats you well.

221
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,020
Her Highness said

222
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,060
you can simply kowtow
to her portrait three times

223
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,300
to thank her for saving your life.

224
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,860
That... wouldn't be appropriate.

225
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,420
She's making me

226
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,620
kowtow three times to a portrait?

227
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:10,940
Sure.

228
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,220
Young Master.

229
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:13,980
As the saying goes...

230
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,220
- Get me a brush.
- A man's knees...

231
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,340
Get me a brush.

232
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:17,860
Okay.

233
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,020
I'm done kowtowing.

234
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,950
[Pei Wenxuan kowtows thrice]

235
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,420
Mr. Yuan,

236
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,620
you can bring this back to Her Highness.

237
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,260
Good work, Mr. Pei.

238
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,460
Let's go.

239
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,460
Much thanks!

240
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,060
Alright, let's hurry.

241
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,820
To the palace.

242
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,020
What palace?

243
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,460
That Yang Quan gave me
quite the startle.

244
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,820
I'll lodge a formal complaint
to His Majesty.

245
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:50,820
Young Master.

246
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,420
After you got to know the princess,

247
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,540
you sure have been
getting ahead of yourself.

248
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,220
We should run.

249
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,260
Pei Wenxuan.

250
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,780
Ministry of Justice? Great timing.

251
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,900
I'd like to make a report.

252
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,740
Make a report?

253
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,580
Arrest them all!

254
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,380
Yes, sir!

255
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,420
He's arresting us!

256
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,180
Run!

257
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,260
Tong Ye.

258
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:11,980
Take this.

259
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,380
It's raining money!

260
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,180
Young Master!

261
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,460
It's raining money!

262
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,020
Young Master!

263
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,620
This won't do.

264
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,220
This won't do!

265
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:27,660
Move!

266
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,700
Freeze!

267
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,380
It's raining money!

268
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:30,780
Pei Wenxuan!

269
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,140
My salary for the year!

270
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,700
We're leaving!

271
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,900
Move, move!

272
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,780
Your Highness.

273
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,020
We have received word.

274
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,020
It is done.

275
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,860
Yang Quan is still too impatient.

276
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,780
Head to the Imperial Study first.

277
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,300
Just say

278
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,460
I'll be presenting
some flowers to father.

279
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,780
Yes, Your Highness.

280
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,740
How is it?

281
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,420
We chased Pei Wenxuan

282
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,580
all the way from the crime scene,

283
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,540
but we still lost him.

284
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,540
Intercept him at the palace gates.

285
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,820
Deepest condolences, Your Highness.

286
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,100
How dare you, Pei Wenxuan.

287
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,140
I'll bury you alongside my brother Quan!

288
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,060
Inform the family immediately.

289
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,460
Pull out of Huajing at once.

290
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,420
Also...

291
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,380
Send an urgent letter to my father
at the border.

292
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:26,780
In addition,

293
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,500
send someone to keep an eye
on His Majesty.

294
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,220
Report anything that happens

295
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,540
to me immediately.

296
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,420
Yes, Your Highness.

297
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,020
Eunuch Fu.

298
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,900
Your Highness.

299
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,620
[Hanqiu Palace]
His Majesty is still in discussion.

300
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,060
A moment, please.

301
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,020
No hurry.

302
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,660
Please get me a chair then.

303
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,620
I'll wait here.

304
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,940
I am familiar with your ways,
Your Highness.

305
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,340
Thank you, Eunuch Fu.

306
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,860
Not at all.

307
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,340
Pei Wenxuan has arrived.

308
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,540
Bring him over.

309
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,700
I'll inform His Majesty.

310
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,380
Yes, sir.

311
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,820
I'll get going then, Your Highness.

312
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,980
Please do.

313
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,740
Tell them to set down another chair

314
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,580
and a teacup.

315
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,220
Yes, Your Highness.

316
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:29,940
Young Master Pei.

317
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,420
I belong to the Hanqiu Palace.

318
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,460
You have been summoned.

319
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,460
I'll keep an eye out on my way back.

320
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,740
See if I can pick up some of my money.

321
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,780
What money?

322
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,340
Stay here and wait.

323
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,660
Please wait, Mr. Pei.

324
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,180
Mr. Pei.

325
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:12,940
Your Highness.

326
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,980
I just saw you leave the palace.

327
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,020
Why did you return?

328
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,860
Do you perhaps miss me?

329
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,660
You jest, Your Highness.

330
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,740
I wouldn't dare!

331
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,260
I simply ran into some matters
on the way

332
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,700
and came back to report it
to His Majesty.

333
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,380
That darned man.

334
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,860
He's not only acting naive,
but he's also acting pure!

335
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,820
My father is still in discussion.

336
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,940
Let's sit and wait.

337
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,540
Bring the tea, Jinglan.

338
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,580
That should calm Mr. Pei.

339
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,540
Yes, Your Highness.

340
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,580
So she likes to read
this kind of random books

341
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,260
long before she got married.

342
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,700
Your Highness.

343
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,660
Mr. Pei, His Majesty has summoned you.

344
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,020
Eunuch Fu.

345
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,340
I'm been sitting here for half a day.

346
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,500
Why does he get an audience first?

347
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,740
Mr. Pei said he had urgent matters.

348
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,420
What urgent matters could he have?

349
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,220
Bring them both in.

350
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,780
Your Highness, Mr. Pei.

351
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,500
This way.

352
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,060
Your Majesty.

353
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:51,900
Wenxuan.

354
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:54,940
- Your daughter,
- Your subject,

355
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,500
- hereby greets you, father.
- hereby greets you, Your Majesty.

356
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,740
Rise.

357
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,380
Why have you come, Pingyue?

358
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,260
I guess I'll come later then.

359
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,340
You're already here. Stay.

360
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,940
Come here first.

361
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,580
Pei Wenxuan,

362
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,900
haven't you left?

363
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,900
Why did you return?

364
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,620
Right after I left the palace,

365
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,380
I was ambushed
by Second Young Master Yang.

366
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,740
In panic,

367
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,220
I accidentally...

368
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,780
...killed him!

369
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,020
What did you say?

370
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,580
W...Who did you kill?

371
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,180
Mr. Shangguan.

372
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,500
Young Master Pei is just a young man.

373
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,460
He also went through such an ordeal.

374
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,700
If you scare him like that,

375
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,940
how can he explain what happened?

376
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,540
This...

377
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,420
Young Master Pei.

378
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,700
Don't be afraid. Recount it slowly.

379
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,340
Who did you kill?

380
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,140
Your Majesty.

381
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:29,740
I killed Yang Quan,
the Second Young Master of the Yangs!

382
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,380
You...

383
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,660
Just what exactly is going on?

384
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,180
Queen Mother.

385
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,500
Greetings, Queen Mother.

386
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,780
Do you know Yang Quan's been killed?

387
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,220
Yang Quan's been killed?

388
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,060
Good riddance.

389
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,300
Serves him right for coveting my sister!

390
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,220
If only I got my hands on him first.

391
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,620
Now's not the time.

392
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,860
I received information.

393
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,140
Your sister's hidden guards
were involved also.

394
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,300
Looks like...

395
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,500
She's chosen Pei Wenxuan as her consort.

396
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,140
That's...

397
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,620
Why didn't she discuss with my first?

398
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,420
Your sister has acted
without considering the greater picture.

399
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,220
It'll bode trouble.

400
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,180
But I have faith in her choice.

401
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,900
So long as she's happy.

402
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,140
Do you know about this?

403
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,020
Even if you did,

404
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,340
you must pretend you don't.

405
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,820
You must remember.

406
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,140
Your Highness.

407
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,420
I am well aware of my wrongdoing.

408
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,340
Although Second Young Master Yang

409
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,060
had ambushed me,

410
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,780
but I know

411
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,340
how much the Yangs
have contributed to Great Xia.

412
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,540
Moreover,

413
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,620
we are at the brink of war.

414
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,260
Even if Second Young Master Yang
wishes to kill me,

415
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,700
for the sake of the nation,

416
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,420
I should not have retaliated.

417
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,660
But Your Majesty,

418
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,460
it's true that I only committed
such a grave mistake

419
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,660
because I didn't want to get killed.

420
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,260
Your disgraced subject deserves death,
Your Majesty!

421
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,260
His life is worthless.

422
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,380
I just wanted to let you know

423
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,580
before disaster happens.

424
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,700
Disaster has fallen upon us Peis!

425
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,620
Pei Wenxuan,

426
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,580
you reckless fool!

427
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,780
The Yangs have long commanded
the border troops.

428
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,660
They garner immense power.

429
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,740
Even if he did commit a crime,

430
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,020
the punishment must be calibrated.

431
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,060
With the borders now strife with war,

432
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,660
if we aggravate the Yangs,

433
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,100
who could we send
to fend off our enemies?

434
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:42,860
Answer me!

435
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,100
Scoundrel.

436
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,900
You've caused great trouble!

437
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,620
Pei Lixian.

438
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,260
Please calm down.

439
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,860
This deed was done by Pei Wenxuan,

440
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,780
that ignorant fool, alone!

441
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,340
The Pei Family knows nothing
about this, Your Majesty!

442
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,100
Your Majesty!

443
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,260
Why are you so jittery?

444
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,380
You are an official of Great Xia.

445
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,740
Yang Quan tried to assassinate you
in broad daylight.

446
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,100
If he's killed, so be it.

447
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,100
There's nothing to fear.

448
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,580
But Your Majesty,

449
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,500
the borders...

450
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,700
Or would the Yangs revolt?

451
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,900
They hardly put up a fight

452
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,740
when the enemy invaded.

453
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,620
They've utterly shamed the Great Xia!

454
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,100
50,000 soldiers

455
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,500
failed to hold off 20,000 enemies.

456
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,340
Yet they dare kidnap the princess
in Jinghua,

457
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,180
and assassinate an imperial official!

458
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,020
The Yangs seem to think I'm dead!

459
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,060
Please calm down, You Majesty!

460
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,740
Your Majesty.

461
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,220
Wins and losses are commonplace in war.

462
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,700
With the enemy's sudden assault,

463
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,300
even the Yangs are taken by surprise

464
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,180
and was caught off guard.

465
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,260
With the Yangs still at the frontlines,

466
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,100
to deal with this...

467
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,900
Enough!

468
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,660
I have decided to pursue this.

469
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:24,220
The tyranny of the Yangs over us
have gone too far!

470
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,180
Not only will I pursue this,

471
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,580
but I will also pursue this thoroughly!

472
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,380
My subjects.

473
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,300
Who would be willing
to investigate this for me?

474
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,060
Very well.

475
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,700
Very well indeed!

476
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,660
All of you are intimidated by the Yangs.

477
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,420
In that case,

478
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,300
Pei Wenxuan.

479
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,220
You already have the guts to kill him.

480
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,020
I'll give these cases to you.

481
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,260
Do you dare accept them?

482
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,460
Your Majesty, no!

483
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,780
Wenxuan is still but a child.

484
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,580
He is not fit to take on
such a major case!

485
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,620
Did I ask you?

486
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,260
Answer.

487
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,980
I am willing to share your troubles,
Your Majesty.

488
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,420
Good. From this day on,

489
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,020
you'll be an Inspector Censor
at the Censorate.

490
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,940
Investigate the case of the Yangs
alongside the Ministry of Justice.

491
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

492
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,220
Your Majesty.

493
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,580
Please allow me.

494
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,060
Pei Wenxuan said it himself.

495
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,180
He is a victim of the case.

496
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,540
If you put him up
to investigate the case,

497
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,500
then we might as well give the case
to Mr. Shangguan.

498
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,380
How does that sound?

499
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,180
Father.

500
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,820
Why don't I be the Chief Judge?

501
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,380
Mr. Pei may assist instead.

502
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,780
After all, this started because of me.

503
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,060
If we wish to investigate the Yangs,

504
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,740
my rank

505
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,900
would be suitable as well.

506
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:10,940
Anyhow,

507
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,420
a suitable candidate
has not been selected.

508
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,300
Isn't that so?

509
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,260
But you're also a victim of this case,
Your Highness.

510
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,660
Then let's get Mr. Su Rongqing
to supervise the case.

511
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,340
Isn't he from the Ministry of Justice?

512
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,900
I've long heard Mr. Su
is a righteous and upstanding man.

513
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,340
If you're still worried,
Right Chancellor,

514
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,340
why not let Mr. Su be the Chief Judge?

515
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,740
You're too kind, Your Highness.

516
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,580
My son is still young.

517
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,220
This case is too huge for him.

518
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,340
That's why I'm asking him to supervise.

519
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,300
What do you think?

520
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,860
I think

521
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:10,260
Her Highness has a point.

522
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,020
Father.

523
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,500
At this juncture,

524
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,180
we are out of options.

525
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,660
Do as Pingyue said.

526
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,420
Affairs of the court
is no laughing matter.

527
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,260
Pingyue will stay.

528
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,740
the rest may go,

529
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,260
I shall take my leave.

530
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,780
Mr. Pei.

531
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,500
Your nephew is a good one.

532
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,740
Second Uncle, Third Uncle.

533
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,140
You've gotten bold!

534
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,100
You're fearless now!

535
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,740
You're pitting yourself
against all of the Noble Houses!

536
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,500
You're too rash.

537
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,300
You'll ruin the entire Pei Family!

538
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,260
Second brother.

539
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,980
This is no place to talk.

540
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,580
Let's continue at home.

541
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,820
Head home right after you tie up
the matters in palace.

542
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,180
This concerns the family's survival.

543
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,300
You will be punished accordingly!

544
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,180
Father.

545
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:40,860
Pingyue.

546
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,700
You examined four men this time.

547
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,620
No,

548
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,020
it's just three now.

549
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,860
How do you feel about Pei Wenxuan?

550
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:57,180
I... I feel that...

551
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:01,100
He's pretty decent.

552
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,780
He could be of use to you
in the future too, father.

553
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,180
It's just...

554
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,100
It's just that Queen Mother...

555
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,140
All you need to consider

556
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,940
if whether if you like this man.

557
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,980
Disregard everything else.

558
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,060
Why the tears?

559
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,260
Father.

560
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,100
I'm just wondering.

561
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:33,940
We're all family.

562
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,460
Why can't we just be simple and happy?

563
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,420
You and Queen Mother...

564
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,660
No need to ask about
your Queen Mother and I.

565
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,900
Treat it as you know nothing.

566
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,620
Pick someone you like.

567
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,980
I'll always respect your choice.

568
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,060
However,

569
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,060
Pei Wenxuan and you

570
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,860
spent a night alone together.

571
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,420
That pretty much

572
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,820
makes you his woman.

573
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,500
As I see it,

574
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,820
Pei Wenxuan is a good choice.

575
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,460
He has the brains

576
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,540
and the looks.

577
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,700
If you marry him,

578
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,420
you won't suffer.

579
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,860
Go back and think about my words.

580
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,540
After we close the case about Yang Quan,

581
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,940
I'll betroth you to him.

582
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,380
As you wish, father.

583
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,260
Your Highness.

584
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,100
There is something else I must see to.

585
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,420
I shall stop here.

586
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,820
As for the rest of the path,

587
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,020
Mr. Pei shall be escorting you.

588
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,180
His Majesty is much more committed
to the act than me.

589
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,100
His acting was convincing, I must say.

590
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,060
He ordered me to kill Yang Quan

591
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,060
as a betrothal gift to marry you,

592
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,660
but he looks like he knew nothing.

593
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,140
You dare gossip about my father?

594
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,620
Why?

595
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,260
Doing his bidding like so.

596
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,180
Do you hate it?

597
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,300
Do I have a choice?

598
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,620
Let's cut to the chase.

599
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,660
After we conclude the case,

600
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,260
I intend to propose

601
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,780
pushing the affairs of the Northwest
to the Crown Prince.

602
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,460
If he manage to find his foothold,

603
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,940
there's no need to worry about
the military.

604
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,220
But what if he fails?

605
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,260
You'd even bet something like that?

606
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,500
How brazen.

607
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,060
If I'm not that brazen,

608
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,140
would I dare to marry you?

609
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,340
I suppose.

610
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,140
Asking for my hand is no easy task.

611
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,100
It's perilous.

612
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,580
The task itself isn't.

613
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,620
You're the perilous one.

614
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,100
And you're the one
who begged to marry me!

615
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,260
Yes, yes, yes.

616
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,900
I was the one who begged.

617
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,380
There is something

618
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,700
I'd like to ask you.

619
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,540
Go on.

620
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,460
Just now, at the Imperial Study,

621
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:50,300
you requested for Su Rongqing
to supervise the case.

622
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,900
What's the meaning of that?

623
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,100
How would you like Su Rongqing

624
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,340
to supervise the case?

625
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,460
Do you summon him daily

626
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,940
and stare at his face
while he investigates?

627
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,340
Or do you keep him by your side

628
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,060
so you can be together always
while you investigate?

629
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,100
You...!

630
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,260
Do you see me as a hindrance

631
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,420
to your investigation?

632
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,860
Alright then.

633
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,460
You can investigate this case

634
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,060
alone with Young Master Su.

635
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,180
Why do I even need to be here?

636
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,780
Can you be more fake?

637
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,460
Look, what's that?

638
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,460
What?

639
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,740
Your pettiness.

640
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,100
I won't deny that I'm petty.

641
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,660
But you're plenty
thick-skinned yourself, Li Rong.

642
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,820
How old are you already?

643
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,620
Su Rongqing is at his best years.

644
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,700
Give up on netting yourself
a younger guy.

645
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,220
Why? Does being called old

646
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,460
make you upset?

647
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,660
I'm old. You're not.

648
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,180
Your mind is too muddied.

649
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,220
I don't want to talk to you.

650
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,900
It's just a friendly reminder.

651
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,340
Don't let him sabotage our plans.

652
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,740
He's ruined you before.

653
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,300
If you let him do it again in this life,

654
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,620
that's just foolishness.

655
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,460
Even so, it's none of your business.

656
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,020
We'll get divorced in two years anyway.

657
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,100
Pei Wenxuan, let's be clear.

658
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,340
If I kill you in this life,

659
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,700
it won't be because of someone's prying.

660
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,780
Head back on your own.

661
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,540
I won't see you off.

662
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,660
You...

663
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,460
The Yangs will probably
leave the city tonight.

664
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,460
I need more men.

665
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,780
Alright, alright, I know.

666
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,340
I'll arrange for it.

667
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,420
Why did Young Master Pei leave?

668
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,540
He's sick.

669
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,340
Let's head back too.

670
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,460
It's time for the cleansing.

671
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,020
[Su Mansion]
Wen Bo.

672
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,140
Master.

673
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,340
Is Rongqing around?

674
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,740
I haven't seen him.

675
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,460
Father.

676
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,340
Rongqing.

677
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,420
Great timing.

678
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,740
What happened the Imperial Study...

679
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,860
I've heard about it.

680
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,060
How do you feel about the Yangs, father?

681
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,020
We're not trying to save the Yangs,

682
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,540
but the Noble Houses.

683
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,020
Under the orders of His Majesty,

684
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,580
we are here to arrest
the Traitorous Yang Family!

685
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,460
Arrest them!

686
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,620
Yes, sir!

687
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,980
Your Highness, it's not like that!

688
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,940
It's not like that!

689
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,860
I'm wronged! I'm wronged!

690
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:00,820
Your Highness.

691
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,860
We found these ingots when searching her room.

692
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,340
They're not mine! They're not mine!

693
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,060
Your Highness!

694
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,020
You must not know it.

695
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,380
Ingots of the Noble Houses
have their own special mark.

696
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,860
Why did you betray me?

697
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,220
General Yang promised

698
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,100
he'll make me his concubine

699
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,460
after he marries the princess.

700
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,620
Please spare me,Your Highness!
Your Highness!

701
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:32,340
Please spare my life!
Please spare me, Your Highness!

702
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:35,260
The worst thing a woman could do

703
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,180
is to pin their hopes on men.

704
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,660
Spare me, Your Highness!
Please spare me!

705
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,340
Your Highness!

706
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,220
No need to kill her.

707
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,620
Send her to the nunnery

708
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,820
for the rest of her life.

709
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,540
Understood.

710
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,820
Your Highness.

711
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,340
Your Highness.

712
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,100
Your Highness.

713
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:01,900
Your Highness.

714
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,460
It's done.

715
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,780
Don't tell me you haven't slept?

716
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,020
Thanks to you,

717
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,980
I haven't slept at all, actually.

718
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,140
Looks like my men
needs to be more capable.

719
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,780
They spent so much time
arresting this little people.

720
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,100
Exactly. If this continues,

721
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,300
unless you offer to help,

722
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,980
I'd be breaking my back.

723
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,180
They left in batches.

724
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,460
It took some time to get all of them.

725
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,460
Why don't we round them up today?

726
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,380
It'll make the hearing easier.

727
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,220
You can decide.
But leave it to after the court session.

728
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,900
Just a word of reminder.

729
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,140
Don't say anything.

730
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,300
We don't know where he stands.

731
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:04,940
Greetings,

732
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,380
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

733
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,980
Mr. Su. Young Master Su.

734
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:10,820
I'll give you some space.

735
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,620
Enter the hall!

736
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,460
Young Master Pei,

737
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,220
I'll get going first.

738
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,380
See you after court.

739
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,980
Your Highness, please.

740
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,060
Please.

741
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,540
Li Rong.

742
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,740
One day, I will walk by your side

743
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,180
and protect you.

744
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,580
Your Highness.

745
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,140
An edict from His Majesty.

746
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,620
Your Highness is not a court official.

747
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,020
As such, please await to be summoned.

748
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,460
I can't enter,

749
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,940
and so does Your Highness.

750
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,620
Could it be that...

751
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,100
you're waiting specially for me?

752
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:41,860
That's right.

753
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,020
I am waiting specially for you.

754
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,980
We'll be partners
for a long time after all.

755
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,940
Since we're partners,

756
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,060
allow me to rest a little here.

757
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,980
Cover for me, won't you? Your Highness.

758
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,020
Give an inch and he takes a mile.

759
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,100
His Majesty arrives!

760
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,500
Boundless fortune to the Emperor!

761
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,100
Long live the Emperor!

762
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,660
Please rise.

763
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,740
Thank you, Your Majesty!

764
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,140
The Northwest sent a secret letter.

765
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,300
The Yangs have embezzled
army rations for years

766
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,100
and colluded with the enemy.

767
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,140
I wish to hold a thorough investigation.

768
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,900
What do you think, dear subjects?

769
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,100
Your Majesty.

770
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:38,380
The Yangs have protected
the borders for years.

771
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,780
They have won many battles.

772
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,500
If you trial and punish them

773
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,900
over some baseless rumors,

774
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,700
I fear it may devastate
our soldiers at the borders.

775
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,100
I implore you to consider it carefully.

776
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,500
Exactly.

777
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,380
You can lie against me.

778
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,300
That way, you won't fall.

779
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,500
They are valiant in battle
and illustrious in their contributions.

780
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,620
All the glory they gained in battle

781
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,500
are from being in cahoots
with our enemy!

782
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,100
They deceived and belittled the emperor,

783
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,460
kidnapped the princess,

784
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,020
and assassinated an official.

785
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,660
Is that enough to put them to trial?

786
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,660
Your Majesty, such severe crimes

787
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:58,180
require indisputable proof
before a case can be made.

788
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:02,220
Otherwise, it will be hard
to convince the people!

789
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,100
Convince the people? Sure.

790
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,220
Bring them in.

791
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:09,420
Summoning Princess Pingyue
and Pei Wenxuan!

792
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,020
Time to get up.

793
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,060
- Greetings, father!
- Greetings, Your Majesty!

794
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:29,860
You may rise.

795
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,980
- Thank you, father.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

796
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,100
Pei Wenxuan.

797
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,300
What do you have to report?

798
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,660
Just go ahead.

799
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,180
I, Pei Wenxuan, am lodging a case
against the Yangs!

800
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,700
After failing to win
the princess's hand, they kidnapped her

801
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:44,980
and when their plans fell through,

802
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,620
they tried to silence me.

803
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,580
Your Highness.

804
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,380
Would you be my witness?

805
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:51,780
Of course.

806
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,860
Your Majesty, the Yangs
are illustrious in war.

807
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,460
They might be haughty,

808
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:01,300
but you shouldn't hear
just from Mr. Pei alone.

809
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,580
You claim I provide a biased account.

810
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,260
Do you mean the princess's words

811
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,780
cannot be trusted as well?

812
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,940
I was there.

813
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,900
Mr. Pei spoke nothing but the truth.

814
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,500
Even if Yang Quan
did kidnap the princess

815
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,220
and assassinate Mr. Pei,

816
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,580
Yang Quan is Yang Quan,

817
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,100
he is not the Yang Family.

818
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,140
Mr. Pei,

819
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,740
how could you lump them together?

820
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,900
That is right. Yang Quan is Yang Quan,

821
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,020
while the Yangs are the Yangs.

822
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,580
How could we lump them together?

823
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,260
But if Yang Quan
wasn't backed by the Yangs,

824
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,780
would he dare commit such atrocities?

825
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,900
There's a song in the Northwest.

826
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,660
Xia has two emperors;
Yang of the North, Li of the South.

827
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,500
Rumors along the borders

828
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,980
say they sell weapons to our enemies.

829
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:47,620
Pei Wenxuan.

830
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,700
This is the imperial court.

831
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,300
How could you use a folk song

832
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,420
as court evidence?

833
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,740
If the rumors are indeed true,

834
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,580
would you let His Majesty be deceived?

835
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:00,980
If we let tyrants fill the streets

836
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,380
and be revered by the people,

837
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,300
we'd be a joke for millennia to come.
