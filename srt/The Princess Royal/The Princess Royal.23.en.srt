[This is a work of fiction.]

4
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 23]

5
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,380
Mr. Lin.

6
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,900
Miss Shangguan.

7
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,780
Have you talked to the guards
who will be escorting him?

8
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,140
Yes.

9
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,740
They can't uncuff him now
since they're still in the city,

10
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,340
but once they're out,

11
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,500
they will do so right away.

12
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,700
Her Highness said

13
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,740
that they would give you some decency.

14
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,540
Don't expect the Seven-star Sect

15
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,900
to send people to rescue you.

16
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,220
If they do so,

17
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,660
given His Majesty's temper,

18
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,700
and the fact that your sect

19
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,140
is involved both
in killing and abduction,

20
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,620
he would not spare you.

21
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,820
So, you're here today

22
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,860
just to tell me that?

23
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,140
Her Highness has an offer for you.

24
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,340
It has to do with killing and fighting,
like what you've been doing.

25
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,620
Would you like to utilize your talents
on the battlefield instead?

26
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,060
So?

27
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,300
You will be banished to an army post.

28
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,260
It's different from exile itself.

29
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,540
You will be sent off to a distant land,

30
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,460
but those who are exiled have no future.

31
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,650
As for being banished to an army post,
if you can get military merit,

32
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,180
you may atone for their sins

33
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,220
and even occupy an important position.

34
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,060
Mr. Lin, if you are willing,

35
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,540
Her Highness can work with you.

36
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,780
Once you earn military merit,

37
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,340
she will request His Majesty

38
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,460
to add your name
to the Xie Family's pedigree,

39
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,500
so that you will become a good citizen
instead of a criminal.

40
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,340
By then,

41
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,660
you can build a military career.

42
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,460
Do you prefer wandering around,
hiding from everyone,

43
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,540
or becoming
an accredited member of the Xie Family

44
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,060
and having a successful career?

45
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,540
Mr. Lin, give it some thought.

46
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,540
Does Her Highness trust me?

47
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,100
Whether she trusts you or not,

48
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,540
that is up to her consideration.

49
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,180
Mr. Lin.

50
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,700
You were bound by your mother's
last wishes in the past.

51
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,220
But now,

52
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,460
you can make a better choice.

53
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,140
By the way,

54
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,380
Her Highness wants me
to return this to you.

55
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,460
Miss Shangguan, please tell Her Highness

56
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:35,980
that I will accept

57
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,060
her offer.

58
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,620
Miss Shangguan, he needs to leave now.

59
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,140
Perhaps you can continue
this conversation someday.

60
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,620
The Southwest is far and remote.

61
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,260
Take care of yourself.

62
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,300
Miss Shangguan, don't worry.

63
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,060
With your wooden cards,

64
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,060
I'll never feel bored.

65
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,340
Mr. Lin, it's a misunderstanding.

66
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,340
The wooden cards aren't for you.

67
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,900
Her Highness was there that day,

68
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,340
and I couldn't take them with me,

69
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,220
so I gave them to you for safekeeping.

70
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,740
Can you return them now?

71
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,300
Miss Shangguan, didn't you say

72
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,780
that life in the southwestern borders
would be boring?

73
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,060
I'll keep them for now.

74
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,460
Don't worry.

75
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,100
I'll keep these wooden cards safe.

76
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,820
Set off!

77
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,140
Off we go!

78
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,540
Mr. Su.

79
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,020
Princess Huayue.

80
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,500
You're always busy with work,

81
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,900
but I heard you're taking the day off,

82
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,300
so I came to meet you.

83
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,580
You wouldn't be angry at me, would you?

84
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,060
Of course not.

85
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,300
I'm resting today,

86
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,260
so it's good to take a stroll.

87
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,180
I find the spring scenery pleasant

88
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,220
and comfortable.

89
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,980
I also need to practice
playing some scores,

90
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,620
so I asked someone
to prepare a guqin here.

91
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,420
But I just can't seem to get it right.

92
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,980
I've heard that you're good
at playing the guqin,

93
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,660
so I'd like to get some guidance
from you.

94
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,620
I'm flattered. I just have
a slight knowledge of playing the guqin.

95
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,020
Don't be modest, Mr. Su.

96
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,740
No wonder you find it hard

97
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,580
to play these scores.

98
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,180
Why do you say so?

99
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,660
These scores are mostly describing

100
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,460
the overwhelming atmosphere of a war.

101
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,220
If you want to play these scores well,

102
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,660
you need to immerse yourself
in the real situation.

103
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,820
Her Highness, you're an innocent lady
who has never experienced a war.

104
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,140
It's hard for you
to imagine such a scene.

105
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,020
What I meant was

106
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,060
that you've always been well protected.

107
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,820
You can cry and laugh
whenever you feel like it.

108
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,620
You can be who you truly are.

109
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,220
It's fortunate for you

110
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,580
to have such a genuine disposition.

111
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,340
You can do so as well, Mr. Su.

112
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,780
You look exceptionally good
when you smile,

113
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,460
but I rarely see you smile.

114
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,380
I'll ask my father
to reduce your workload.

115
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,900
Her Highness, you have a kind heart.

116
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,300
You're so pure like a blank paper.

117
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,740
That's why you have a bright smile.

118
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,780
I hope you can always

119
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,900
lead a simple life.

120
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,060
Hope you can always
enjoy such simple bliss.

121
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,740
I'm honored to receive

122
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,180
your blessing myself.

123
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,420
Besides...

124
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,500
I do think

125
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,500
that you're a really good man.

126
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,580
If you have time,

127
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,100
I hope

128
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,860
to learn more from you

129
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,820
so I won't be like a blank paper.

130
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,700
There's nothing wrong
with being a blank paper.

131
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,180
Many people

132
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,020
spend their lives longing for

133
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,420
the innocence they once had.

134
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,980
That's right, you should smile more.

135
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,580
The weather is beautiful today.

136
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,020
Let's not waste such good time.

137
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,300
Let's begin.

138
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:07,860
Young Master.

139
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,140
We're almost done decorating, look.

140
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,140
Pei Wenxuan.

141
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,020
Look what these are.

142
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:15,940
Dumplings?

143
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,900
I made them myself.

144
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,300
Listen,

145
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,620
this is my first time making dumplings.

146
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,900
They look good, don't they?

147
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,700
They do.

148
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,860
Look at you.

149
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,060
You're getting flour all over your face,
you little kitten.

150
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,100
Who's going to get me?

151
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,380
Slowly, Douya.

152
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,660
Don't make your sister trip and fall.

153
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,660
Time for dinner!

154
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,500
Mother, stop busying yourself.

155
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,580
Come and enjoy the reunion dinner.

156
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,380
Coming.

157
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,220
You've worked hard, my wife.

158
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,300
Not at all.

159
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,180
Here.

160
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,820
Come on, Father, Mother.

161
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,100
- Happy Spring Festival.
- Happy Spring Festival.

162
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,580
Here's a toast to both of you.

163
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,980
Wish you a long life
and a happy marriage!

164
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,340
- Very well.
- Very well.

165
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,100
I also wish you a long and healthy life,

166
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:28,980
Wish our family

167
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,460
to be blessed with prosperity,

168
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,580
harmony,

169
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,700
happiness,

170
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,300
and peace.

171
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,820
- Very well.
- There will be peace all year round.

172
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,700
So, I wish you

173
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,980
to be healthy and stay young forever.

174
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,860
Come on, Rongqing.

175
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,620
Come on, Ronghua.

176
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,740
You should always listen to your mother.

177
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,740
- Sure.
- Sure.

178
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,900
Both of you have grown
to be benevolent and loyal.

179
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,100
As your mother, I'm proud of you.

180
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,980
But when it comes to your marriages,

181
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,980
I've surveyed the unmarried ladies
from all noble families

182
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,540
in the capital,

183
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,460
yet none caught your eyes.

184
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,860
Why so?

185
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,260
That depends on Ronghua.

186
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,580
I can't get married

187
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,540
before him, after all.

188
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,940
Why are you dragging me into this?

189
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,060
I should respect for seniority.

190
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,140
Oh my.

191
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:27,940
This kid...

192
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,580
Don't make me wait too long.

193
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,340
Come on, Father, Mother.

194
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,660
There will be many things

195
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,580
worth celebrating in the new year.

196
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,140
Here's a toast to you again.

197
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,740
You'll be the next one to get killed.

198
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:43,780
Ronghua.

199
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,260
Here's a toast to you two.

200
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,220
All of us

201
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,980
must value the present moment

202
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,580
and make each day count

203
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,140
in the future.

204
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,820
Let's make every day a happy day!

205
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,300
Happy Spring Festival!

206
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,700
Make every day a happy day!

207
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,980
For the sake of my family,

208
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,860
I won't let Li Chuan ascend the throne

209
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,420
and repeat the tragedy.

210
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,740
What a splendid dinner!

211
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,540
- Sit down.
- Sit.

212
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,700
Skip the formalities today.

213
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,100
Let's all sit together and eat.

214
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,460
We're having dumplings

215
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,780
on this joyous day.

216
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,220
There are silver coins
inside some of the dumplings.

217
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,380
Anyone who finds it gets a reward.

218
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,180
- A reward?
- Really?

219
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:40,540
Dig in.

220
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,260
Let's eat.

221
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,460
Which dumpling is made by me? This one.

222
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,460
Eat this.

223
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,260
I want to eat the dumplings made by me.

224
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,980
I made this. Its stuffing tastes good.

225
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,020
Really, try it.

226
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,580
Fine.

227
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,500
Let me guess.

228
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,540
I'll have some beef.

229
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,540
Not mine.

230
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,500
Not this one.

231
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,860
Her Highness found one!

232
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,580
Congratulations, Your Highness!

233
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,820
What does this mean?

234
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,540
It means Her Highness
is blessed with luck, right?

235
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,580
- Yes.
- Yes.

236
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,740
What's wrong?

237
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,500
Give me some decency, please.

238
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,020
My teeth almost broke.

239
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,020
It's because you chomped down so hard.

240
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,300
And you even found the coin
in the first dumpling you had.

241
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,500
Where's my reward?

242
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,580
Be patient.

243
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,220
Let's see what it is.

244
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,500
Let's see.

245
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,380
Your Highness, you...

246
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,460
That's so stingy.

247
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,500
Stingy.

248
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,620
See? Everyone's saying

249
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,260
that you're so stingy,
only putting this little money in it.

250
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,180
You don't understand.

251
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,100
That's what they call fair and square.

252
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:56,820
That's how it is.

253
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,340
Besides, it's not so little

254
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,140
if you count the silver coin in your dumpling in.

255
00:12:59,260 --> 00:12:59,860
Yeah.

256
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,260
Don't worry.

257
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,500
How could I not prepare
a proper gift for you?

258
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,220
This is the real New Year gift

259
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,380
for you.

260
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,740
That's more like it.

261
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,260
Wait.

262
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,540
Since you're receiving a gift,

263
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,420
you need to say
something auspicious, right?

264
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,620
- Yes.
- Yes.

265
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:15,900
What auspicious words?

266
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,620
Stop it.

267
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,500
Well, Young Master,

268
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,660
this is not right.

269
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,460
You're not Her Highness's elder.

270
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,460
You don't have to give her that.

271
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,580
Come on, give it to me instead...

272
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,620
Are you saying that you are my elder?

273
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,900
Well, I was just saying...

274
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,860
Eat your dumplings.

275
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,860
Well...

276
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,940
Tong Ye is right.

277
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,620
You're not my elder.
Why should I say any auspicious words?

278
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,220
Of course, you should.

279
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:31,940
You're not my junior,

280
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,980
yet you're my wife.

281
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,740
There's nothing wrong with saying
some auspicious words, right?

282
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,140
- Yes.
- Your Highness, just say something.

283
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,300
Your Highness, don't be shy.

284
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,500
How about let me teach you some?

285
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,900
Just repeat after me.

286
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,220
My dear Prince Consort,
I love you so much.

287
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,810
I want to spend
every Spring Festival with you...

288
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:50,260
Enough.

289
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,580
That's all you need to say.

290
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,620
Eat up.

291
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,060
Tong Ye has already
taught you what to say.

292
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,580
Don't listen.

293
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,060
- Okay.
- Okay.

294
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,780
Well.

295
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,420
I heard it! She said it!

296
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,020
That's enough.

297
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,460
We have a lucky start for this year now.

298
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,700
Come on, raise your glasses.

299
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,420
Let's celebrate.

300
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,100
- Alright, then we together wish...
Wish everyone in the Princess's Mansion

301
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,740
can enjoy a lucky new year
and a healthy long life.

302
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,860
- Happy Spring Festival! Stay healthy!
- Happy Spring Festival! Stay healthy!

303
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,700
Come on.

304
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,900
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

305
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,260
They're setting off fireworks outside.

306
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,940
- Let's go and have a look.
- Let's go.

307
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,460
It's snowing.

308
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,700
Come on.

309
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,100
Look!

310
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,220
The fireworks look gorgeous in the snow!

311
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,660
They call this...

312
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,900
What a heavy snow！

313
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,380
A fall of seasonable snow
gives promise of a fruitful year.

314
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,140
We sure have a lucky start this year.

315
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,700
That's what I was trying to say.

316
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,060
♪Waking up to the warmth of the sun♪

317
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:01,820
- So beautiful.
- So beautiful.

318
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,980
♪Only wrinkles on one's sleeves♪

319
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,620
Rong.

320
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,700
I will give you a home.

321
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,260
It's not like the palace.

322
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,460
I will heal all the wounds
in your heart.

323
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,820
From now on,

324
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,460
no matter you are the Princess
or Li Rong,

325
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,620
you will always have me with you.

326
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:22,980
Pei Wenxuan.

327
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,180
I will try hard

328
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,620
to maintain this happiness forever.

329
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,820
♪I'm glad to have you in my world♪

330
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,100

334
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,540
Here you go.

335
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,380
Thank you.

336
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,980
Happy Spring Festival. See you.

337
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:51,940
Sir.

338
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,660
It's the Spring Festival.

339
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,780
Why are you walking around here alone?

340
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,900
I was with my family earlier,

341
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,420
and I felt happy
so I drank a few more glasses of liquor.

342
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,300
Perhaps I drank a little too much.

343
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,540
That's why I'm taking a stroll
to sober up.

344
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,260
You're a handsome man.

345
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,260
Are you married?

346
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,380
But there should be someone
you adore, right?

347
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,100
There is.

348
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,220
Fate brought us here to meet.

349
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,820
I'll give you a lantern.

350
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,300
I wonder what she's like.

351
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,460
She...

352
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,460
She's witty, cute, and assertive.

353
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,020
She's brave and persevering.

354
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,100
No matter what happens,

355
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,220
she will always stay on her path.

356
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,540
Then, I'll give you a lantern
with a rabbit pattern.

357
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:54,940
Here you go.

358
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,500
I hope that you and the lady you adore

359
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,980
can get married soon.

360
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,100
That sounds like an impossible wish.

361
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,180
You can't say that.

362
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,500
If you're serious about her,

363
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,340
you should fight for her.

364
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,700
When it comes to relationships,

365
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,100
the result is indeed important,

366
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,340
but more importantly,

367
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,340
don't leave any regrets.

368
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,500
Am I right?

369
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,020
You're right.

370
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,860
I'm not going to let anyone,

371
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,180
including myself, down.

372
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,180
That's right.

373
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:34,940
Thank you.

374
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,780
Wishing you a happy, lucky,
and safe year.

375
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,660
Happy Spring Festival.

376
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,900
How generous of you.

377
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,500
[Jucai House]
Small, small, small!

378
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,620
Place your bets!

379
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,180
- Small, small, small!
- Small!

380
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,580
It's small again.

381
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,940
Small, three...

382
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,540
Big, then small...

383
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,860
What are you...

384
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,620
Mr. Su.

385
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,300
How did you sneak out today?

386
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,340
And how did you sneak out?

387
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,140
How do you know I'm here?

388
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,220
I'll tell you when you win.
Small, all in!

389
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,300
Let's see.

390
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,060
Place your bets!

391
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:26,900
Look.

392
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,340
- Big, big!
- Small, small!

393
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,060
The Princess is here.

394
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,380
Let's go.

395
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,980
These scoundrels.

396
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,380
Just ignore them.

397
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,020
Thank you for your hospitality.

398
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,860
No worries.

399
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,780
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

400
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,340
His Majesty has arrived!

401
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,460
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

402
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,180
- Boundless fortune to Your Majesty.
- Boundless fortune to Your Majesty.

403
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,500
- Long live Your Majesty!
- Long live Your Majesty!

404
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,260
- Long live the Empress!
- Long live the Empress!

405
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,740
You may rise, everyone.

406
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,460
- Thank you, Your Majesty!
- Thank you, Your Majesty!

407
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,020
Do you know

408
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,260
why I hold this banquet

409
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,340
on the third day
of the first month of each year?

410
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,740
The sage came up with the idea
of self-cultivation

411
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,330
a well-managed family,
the ability to administer the state,

412
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,420
and to bring peace to the nation.

413
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,740
I believe

414
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,940
that the highest form
of governing a country

415
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,100
is the co-construction
of family and country.

416
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,460
That would dispel any selfish thoughts,

417
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,660
which will unite everyone.

418
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,020
On this auspicious day,

419
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,660
I wish everyone in the world
a bountiful year.

420
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,500
Wish everyone to live and work
in peace and contentment.

421
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,460
Wish peace could reign
throughout our lands and borders.

422
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,140
May our country enjoy
abundance and happiness!

423
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,430
- May our country enjoy
- May our country enjoy

424
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,700
- abundance and happiness!
- abundance and happiness!

425
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,340
Start the banquet!

426
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,700
Your Majesty,

427
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,500
Princess Huayue and Prince Su
would like to perform a score for you.

428
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,420
Young people do like showing off.

429
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,620
The dancers may leave now.

430
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,380
Fulai, summon Huayue here.

431
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,180
Princess Huayue,
His Majesty is summoning you.

432
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,100
Father.

433
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,140
I heard you've prepared
a score to perform

434
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,860
together with Prince Su

435
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,740
to wish all of us a happy new year.

436
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,660
For this occasion,
I have specially prepared

437
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,340
a performance featuring
the long-lost Battle Song of Pingchuan

438
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,900
for you and the ministers of the court.

439
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,180
It was Cheng's idea too.

440
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,180
He said we should

441
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,420
start the new year

442
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,660
by performing a sword dance

443
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:53,860
to celebrate

444
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,180
our last year's victories
in the wars happened in the Northwest.

445
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,020
It can also showcase

446
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:00,380
the manliness we men
of the Great Xia should have.

447
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:04,980
Great.

448
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,940
He's just 14 years old,

449
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,500
and he already wants to be a man.

450
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,420
Father, my swordsmanship
improved tremendously last year.

451
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,660
My master said that I might be young,

452
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,100
but I wouldn't lose to a grown man.

453
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:20,940
Well.

454
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:22,980
So, do you think

455
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,180
you can defeat your brother,
the Crown Prince?

456
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,220
My brother is good
at reading and studying.

457
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,140
I admit that I am no match
for him in this regard.

458
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,020
But when it comes to martial arts,

459
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,660
it's possible
that I might win after all.

460
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,180
Did you hear that?

461
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,820
If you don't practice harder,

462
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,100
your brother is going
to look down on you.

463
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,980
You're right, Father.

464
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,860
I'm sure that Cheng will grow up
to be a formidable warrior

465
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,740
to guard our country's borders
and dignity.

466
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,260
I will be playing the flute today.

467
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,460
This performance will be better

468
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,260
with the accompaniment of the guqin.

469
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,020
Mr. Su, if you don't mind,

470
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,220
can you play the guqin
to accompany my flute

471
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,460
and perform this score for my father?

472
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,420
What do you say, Official Su?

473
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,020
Mr. Su?

474
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,500
You don't have to bother Mr. Su, Huayue.

475
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:03,940
Li Rong.

476
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,660
Actually, the Battle Song of Pingchuan

477
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,340
is not a long-lost score.

478
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,940
It's just that some renowned instructors

479
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,740
may not be willing to teach it
to most of their mediocre students.

480
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,460
I once learned this score.

481
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,220
If you need an accompaniment,

482
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,420
I can help you with it.

483
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,660
Thank you, Rong. Please then.

484
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,020
Huayue, why don't you
stand forward a little more?

485
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,580
Still, if you do,

486
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,260
you might fall off the stage.

487
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,940
By then, I'd be performing alone.

488
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,420
I'm sorry. Let's start.

489
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,420
Now that Her Highness is on the stage,
Huayue is going to embarrass herself.

490
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,830
The enemy is relentless.
They've sworn to fight till the end.

491
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,820
It has been a long journey coming here.

492
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,740
Both sides have been
at a standstill for half a month.

493
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,620
Our attacks have not been successful.

494
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,340
The soldiers are getting exhausted.

495
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,580
What we need to do now
is to raise the soldiers' morale.

496
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,140
Your Highness.

497
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,780
I have an idea that can
improve the soldiers' morale,

498
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,540
but that would require you
to do something.

499
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,020
Your Highness.

500
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,620
This is the Battle Song of Pingchuan.

501
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,140
It is a famous ancient score

502
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,260
that can uplift the listeners' spirits.

503
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,220
If you can perform the score personally,

504
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,780
you'd be able to boost
the soldiers' morale.

505
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,380
Let's begin.

506
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,020
Soldiers!

507
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,580
Princess Pingyue is here!

508
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,020
She's here with a message
from your families,

509
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,780
your wives and children!

510
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,500
Our brave warriors
will enter this battle,

511
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,500
defeat the enemy,

512
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,940
fight till the end

513
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,780
and return with honor!

514
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:09,220
Fight till the end! Return with honor!

515
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,260
- Fight till the end! Return with honor!
- Fight till the end! Return with honor!

516
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,460
Your Highness.

517
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,140
You still remember the times
when we were together after all.

518
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,020
Fortunately, this jealous scoundrel
didn't get the suona.

519
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,580
Official Gu.

520
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,340
As the Minister of Rites,

521
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,020
do you know
whether the Battle Song of Pingchuan

522
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,380
is meant to be played like this?

523
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,140
Your Majesty.

524
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,100
The original score

525
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,660
is not played in such a way.

526
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,340
The earlier ensemble

527
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,380
with Princess Pingyue on the guqin,

528
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,100
Princess Huayue on the flute

529
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,460
and Official Su on the drums

530
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,140
is the traditional and proper way.

531
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,940
Now that the Prince Consort
is joining with the erhu,

532
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,140
this is an innovative performance.

533
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,300
It doesn't sound bad though.

534
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,580
The addition of the erhu

535
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,020
gives the score an exotic feel.

536
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,460
Brilliant.

537
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,380
Mr. Su.

538
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:35,020
Wenxuan's erhu performance
was truly amazing.

539
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,380
Indeed.

540
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,100
But Rongqing's drum performance
was awesome too.

541
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:45,460
Princess Pingyue's guqin skills
have greatly improved.

542
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,020
The Prince Consort's
erhu accompaniment was fantastic.

543
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:57,060
You played the flute well, Huayue.

544
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,700
That was a splendid guqin performance.

545
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,140
It was obvious
that you really wanted to show off.

546
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,500
So were you.

547
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,100
Had the musician
not held his suona tightly,

548
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,300
we might have been
playing funeral music.

549
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,300
If I do get a suona,

550
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,860
I'm going to play a score

551
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,300
to celebrate a happy marriage.

552
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,340
Brilliant!

553
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,780
Today, we have witnessed
a marvelous performance of the guqin,

554
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,460
the flute

555
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,540
and the drums.

556
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,660
As for the erhu,

557
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,900
it was exceptionally wonderful.

558
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,740
However, what delighted me the most

559
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,940
was Prince Su's sword dance.

560
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,660
He looked like a true warrior.

561
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,380
This is how our country's men should be.

562
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,540
What do you think, everyone?

563
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:06,900
Crown Prince.

564
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,020
Today, your siblings

565
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,980
played a score and danced

566
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,060
to celebrate the new year.

567
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,980
As the Crown Prince,

568
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,900
what do you have to say?

569
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,500
Unlike them, I am not well-versed
in performing arts.

570
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,900
All I can do is to focus
on the state's affairs

571
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,900
to share your burden

572
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,100
and improve the people's welfare.

573
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,340
How pleasing to the ears.
Sweet words indeed.

574
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,940
You may leave.

575
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,500
Yes, Your Highness.

576
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,220
Why are you sitting here all alone?

577
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,660
What brings you here, Rong?

578
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,420
It's getting stuffy in the hall.
I need some fresh air.

579
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,620
Did they pour you too much liquor?

580
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,620
Let me peel a tangerine for you.

581
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:25,980
Of course, they didn't.

582
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,340
No one would dare to make me drunk

583
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,500
if I don't feel like it.

584
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,460
I just didn't feel like staying there.

585
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,220
Chuan.

586
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,220
No matter what you do,

587
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,500
you have my support.

588
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,300
Don't make yourself upset.

589
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,060
Rong, tell me the truth.

590
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,020
Am I really unlikable?

591
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,860
It's the Spring Festival,
and he kept embarrassing me

592
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,780
in front of the ministers.

593
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,700
Rong, is this fair?

594
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,180
It's not.

595
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,420
Rong.

596
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,820
Honestly, I've considered giving up

597
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,020
on being the Crown Prince.

598
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,660
But since the Qin Family's decline,

599
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,260
I began to regret it.

600
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,140
You were right.

601
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:37,060
I need to be strong
to have the right to choose.

602
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,140
Don't worry, Rong.

603
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,740
The embarrassment I had today

604
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,180
won't stop me from growing stronger.

605
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,460
Rest assured, I know what to do.

606
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,940
Don't let anyone know
we've been talking here for so long.

607
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:57,820
I need to go.

608
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,740
This is the price of growing up.

609
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,660
Mr. Su.

610
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,500
I may need your help in the future,
so I would like to thank you in advance.

611
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,180
Mr. Su.

612
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,260
We'll take our leave, Mr. Su.

613
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:16,980
We'll take our leave.

614
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:20,260
Mr. Su, here's a toast to you.

615
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,500
Here's a toast to you, Mr. Su.

616
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,380
That's enough for today,

617
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,540
or else I'd get drunk.

618
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,460
Then we'll have a drink
on some other day.

619
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,820
Alright, I'll take my leave.

620
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,900
I'll take my leave.

621
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,420
Mr. Su.

622
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,940
Aren't you going to have
another cup of liquor?

623
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,420
Mr. Pei, I've had enough liquor.

624
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,740
I have other things to attend to.

625
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,100
Mr. Su.

626
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,060
It's rather inappropriate
to covet my wife

627
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,540
in front of everyone.

628
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,540
We're of the same age.

629
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,060
It's time for you to get married.

630
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,540
Besides, we're sworn brothers.

631
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,340
You helped me fetch the bride
at my wedding back then.

632
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:09,460
I have never forgot your kindness.

633
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,780
How about let me
find you a suitable lady?

634
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,460
Pei Wenxuan.

635
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,620
Your Highness, what took you so long?

636
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,580
I'm getting sleepy.

637
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:27,900
Let's go.

638
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,500
Your Highness...

639
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,420
Mr. Su.

640
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,420
If you really have something important
to say, we can talk some other day.

641
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:38,820
My wife and I have other things
to do at home.

642
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,420
Your Highness.

643
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,420
You suffered so much when you were
with Pei Wenxuan back then.

644
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,660
Do you really want to suffer it again?

645
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:59,260
Why did you
join the Inspectorate Office?

646
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,980
My brother wanted me to come,

647
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,140
so here I am.

648
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,380
But personally,

649
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,540
I'd love to see what Her Highness
and you are up to.

650
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,540
Everyone is busy fighting and struggling

651
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,540
in the palace.

652
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,340
I hate those hypocrites.

653
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,020
But, you and Her Highness
are unlike them.

654
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,740
You're the rare kind of people
who'd go against the flow of things.

655
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:20,860
That's why

656
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,980
I want to see

657
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,980
why you set up the Inspectorate Office.

658
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,540
Tell me.

659
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,140
Why did you join
the Inspectorate Office?

660
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,460
Perhaps like what you said,

661
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,780
I also want to live like a human.

662
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,380
I want to be useful.

663
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,740
I want to provide my family
with some irreplaceable value.

664
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,240
A more important value

665
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,460
than getting married
for political gains.

666
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,180
This is the only way for me

667
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,620
to remain as Shangguan Ya.

668
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,860
As a woman,

669
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,180
your path is more difficult than mine.

670
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,140
Well, let's drop the subject.

671
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,060
Let's have a drink. Cheers.

672
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,260
Su Ronghua.

673
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,460
I went to you today

674
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,860
not to rant and complain.

675
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,420
I just like to gamble,

676
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,380
have a drink,

677
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,300
and mess with you.

678
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,620
The fact that you want

679
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,820
to gamble and drink with me

680
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,500
shows that I've left
a good impression on you.

681
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,740
Maybe

682
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,740
it's because
we're both a different breed.

683
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,620
A different breed?

684
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,980
That makes you and me the same breed.

685
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,060
Who wants to be the same breed as you?

686
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,740
Come on.

687
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,580
We're going to drink
to our hearts' content tonight!

688
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,100
I wonder which gentleman

689
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,900
would marry a woman like you.

690
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,060
I wonder which lady

691
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,580
would marry a man like you.

692
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,500
Let's make a pact, then.

693
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,900
If we can't find anyone compatible,

694
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:48,020
let's just live together
for the rest of our lives.

695
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:48,940
Good idea!

696
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,540
Cheers!

697
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,300
Live together.

698
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:52,980
Cheers!

699
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:01,980
Your Highness.

700
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,500
Why is there an influx of outsiders
in the capital lately?

701
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,380
Probably

702
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,860
for the imperial examinations.

703
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,820
The imperial examinations?

704
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,980
But it'll be held in two months.

705
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,180
Why come here so early?

706
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,020
You didn't know?

707
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,020
They don't just assess
your examination answers.

708
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,060
You can also submit your essays

709
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,180
to the examiner in advance.

710
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,860
If they like it,

711
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,620
even if you don't perform well
in your examinations, you can advance

712
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,460
to the final imperial examination
with your submitted essays.

713
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,460
How do the ordinary candidates

714
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,780
make sure that the examiners

715
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,460
get to read their essays?

716
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,740
By submitting them along
with their examination scripts?

717
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,580
That's exactly

718
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,340
why they're here

719
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,140
in the capital so early.

720
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,060
The candidates will submit their essays

721
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,500
to rich and powerful families
who are interested in their work.

722
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,900
If they like the essays,

723
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,390
they would recommend them
to the examiner.

724
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,780
I guess it's not easy

725
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,940
being a commoner.

726
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,820
You think so too?

727
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,460
If you get a recommendation
from those in power,

728
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,460
the examiner might give you
some extra points.

729
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,060
That makes it even harder for a commoner

730
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,180
to become the top scorer.

731
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:10,380
The rich kids don't even need
to take the examinations.

732
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,340
They already have
their family's backing.

733
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,460
Take Su Rongqing as an example,

734
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,060
when he was 12 years old,

735
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,620
he was already joining his grandfather
in the imperial court.

736
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,340
However,

737
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,420
commoners could only become officials

738
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,780
through the imperial examinations.

739
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,140
Yet, they still have to contend

740
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,380
with proud and rich ones
from the noble families

741
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,620
who are backed by power and wealth.

742
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,460
With an unfair system like this,

743
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,100
it'd be hard for the country
to search for true talents.

744
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,860
Change is necessary.

745
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,460
Your Highness, it's not easy
for commoners to become officials.

746
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,060
If we do encounter someone with talent,

747
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,500
we must foster them as best as we can.

748
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,660

[Recruiting talents]
Recruiting talents?

752
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,260
Even Su Rongqing, the top talent,
is recruiting talents?

00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,020
Anyone who gets his recommendation

754
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,300
is bound to become an official.

755

Today, we will be discussing

the ability to appreciate
a person's character and capability.

- Yes.

764
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,140
I believe that the one with the ability

a person's character and capability

to their full abilities

and motivate people to do their best.

768
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,860
I think it's also important
to be open-minded

769

and can win people by virtue.

770
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,380
Those who can appreciate talents
are wise men themselves,

771
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,620
but more importantly,

772
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,300
they should be able to accept those
who are more talented than they are.

773
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,420
This is the true art

774

We didn't expect
