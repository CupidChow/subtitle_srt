[Episode 7]

6
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,220
Now that you have the chance
to do it all over again,

7
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,300
would you still want Qin Zhenzhen
to enter the palace?

8
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,700
You deliberately
didn't let the Crown Prince come today

9
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,180
because you didn't want them
to meet again, right?

10
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,660
That's good, Mr. Pei.

11
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,900
Make sure you seize this opportunity.

12
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,900
Can you stop making
these kinds of jokes in the future?

13
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,660
I'm not joking.

14
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,780
Hopefully, as we wish,

15
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,060
Qin Lin will come out of seclusion early

16
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,500
and spare us
from all those complications.

17
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,860
Excuse me, is anyone there?

18
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,660
You are...

19
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,940
I am Pei Wenxuan

20
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,780
and this is Princess Pingyue.

21
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,580
We are here under the order
of the Crown Prince

22
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,940
to pay our respects to Young Master Qin.

23
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,620
Greetings, Your Highness.

24
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,140
Greetings, Young Master Pei.

25
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,540
But my young master
has been in seclusion for a long time.

26
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,980
I wonder how the Crown Prince
came to know about him.

27
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,180
The Young Master possesses
the abilities of a war god.

28
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,700
Back in Pingqiu,

29
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,260
he led eight hundred light cavalry
and defeated three thousand enemies,

30
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,980
displaying unmatched valor.

31
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,700
The Crown Prince is eager for talent

32
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,300
and has sent us
to deliver a letter of invitation.

33
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,420
He will personally visit tomorrow

34
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,820
and hopes to meet
Young Master Qin in person.

35
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,540
Did you write this?

36
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:16,740
Yes.

37
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,660
Given this handwriting,

38
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,140
I'll introduce you to my young master.

39
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,460
However, my young master
has an eccentric temperament.

40
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,540
Even if the Crown Prince himself
were to visit tomorrow,

41
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,860
he might still refuse to meet him.

42
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,860
It's no problem.

43
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,980
Talented people
can afford to be a bit willful.

44
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,620
If someone possesses
both talent and good looks,

45
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,060
then their willfulness
is even more justified.

46
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,020
Your Highness
truly has a great sense of humor.

47
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,020
It's getting late

48
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,820
and my humble abode is not suitable
for accommodating guests.

49
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,580
Please, the two of you should return.

50
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,140
Goodbye.

51
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,380
Don't worry,

52
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,380
Qin Lin has always been this way.

53
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,780
He spent his childhood
at the border until he was fifteen.

54
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,020
Only after his father died in battle,

55
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,260
did he leave the military camp

56
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,340
and return to Huajing,

57
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,820
retreating to Jiulu Mountain.

58
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,220
Back then,
Chuan endured harsh conditions

59
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,100
and waited day and night

60
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,940
to finally persuade Qin Lin to come out.

61
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,540
I get it but...

62
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,780
And then there's Cui Qinghe
who we just saw.

63
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,020
He is Qin Lin's close friend

64
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,740
and later became his military adviser.

65
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,780
Hopefully, he will speak well of us

66
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,260
based on my handwriting.

67
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,580
When Qin Lin left back then,

68
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,540
he said he wanted to be buried here.

69
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,020
I accompanied him up the mountain

70
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,460
and was utterly exhausted
by the time we reached this point.

71
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,180
But now,

72
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,180
after all this walking,

73
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,820
I'm still feeling energetic.

74
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,260
Youth is truly wonderful.

75
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,460
Come back.

76
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,420
What is it?

77
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,140
Turn around.

78
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,620
Squat down.

79
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,940
Your Highness,
your stamina is really lacking.

80
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,380
What are you doing?

81
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,140
Since your stamina is good,
let's increase the difficulty.

82
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,620
Carry me down the mountain.

83
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,700
This isn't appropriate, Your Highness.

84
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,900
No one can see us here. Hurry up.

85
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,340
Besides, when have I ever cared
about being appropriate?

86
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,620
Hurry.

87
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,460
Your Highness,
you are totally bullying me.

88
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,900
You'd better walk faster.

89
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,060
It will be dark soon.

90
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,220
Your Highness,

91
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,100
have you been eating too much lately?

92
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,140
It's you whose stamina isn't up to par.

93
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,380
If Your Highness could be lighter,

94
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,900
my stamina would be sufficient.

95
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,300
You want me to be lighter?

96
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,620
Oh yes, you prefer a slimmer figure.

97
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,180
Were you a bit disappointed

98
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,580
that you didn't see
Qin Zhenzhen just now?

99
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,380
Li Rong,

100
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,140
a woman like you

101
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,380
is truly awe-inspiring.

102
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,060
That's to be expected.

103
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,940
After all, there are very few

104
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,020
who are as outstanding as I am.

105
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,660
Young Master Pei, we've arrived.

106
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,100
On behalf of the Ministry of Justice,

107
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,860
I'm here to apprehend
the suspect Pei Wenxuan.

108
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,340
Mr. Pei, please come with me.

109
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,340
I...

110
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,100
Mr. Li.

111
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,290
As the Bureau Director
of the Inspectorate

112
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,100
in the Ministry of Justice,

113
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,060
I, Li Kui, greet Your Highness.

114
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,580
I wish Your Highness longevity
and good health.

115
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,540
Spare the formalities.

116
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,100
May I ask the purpose

117
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,540
of this action, Mr. Li?

118
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,100
Your Highness,

119
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,260
This morning, a merchant
reported to the Jingzhao Prefecture,

120
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,580
claiming that Mr. Pei
murdered his master.

121
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,700
So I have been ordered

122
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,620
to ask Mr. Pei to assist
with the investigation.

123
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,420
Mr. Li,

124
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,300
I can assure you

125
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,340
that I have never done anything illegal.

126
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,180
May I know who this merchant is?

127
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,820
Your Highness,

128
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,460
this person is a foreign merchant

129
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,780
named Tuoba Yan.

130
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,460
Is Tuoba Yan dead?

131
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,380
Your Highness,
I am merely following orders.

132
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,700
I ask for Your Highness's understanding.

133
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,580
Your Highness,

134
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,540
I have never killed anyone.
There is no need to worry.

135
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,860
I have heard

136
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,180
that the prisons
of the Ministry of Justice

137
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:10,500
are very strict.

138
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,900
There won't be any cases
of forced confessions, will there?

139
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,140
Rest assured, Your Highness.

140
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,380
Mr. Pei is an upright gentleman

141
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,940
and I trust him.

142
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,860
Besides, this is merely
a procedural formality.

143
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,180
Mr. Pei will be fine.

144
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,940
Pei Wenxuan is now under my protection

145
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,620
and may continue to be in the future.

146
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,380
I will visit the prison daily
to see him.

147
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,260
So, do you understand

148
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,100
what I'm trying to say here, Mr. Li?

149
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,460
I do.

150
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,660
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

151
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,940
The Ministry of Justice will arrange
a suitable room for Mr. Pei.

152
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,620
Mr. Pei, please.

153
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,920
[Jiulu Mountain]

154
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,020
[Top secret]

155
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,020
Give it to the Crown Prince.

156
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,260
Yes, Your Highness.

157
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,060
Your Highness,

158
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:34,960
currently, Xiao Su

159
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,740
has firmly established himself
in the Northwest.

160
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,540
Your Highness.

161
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,220
- You may all leave now.
- You may all leave now.

162
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,700
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

163
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,700
Get my carriage ready.

164
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,780
Tomorrow, I will go to the Huguo Temple
to pray for my mother's well-being.

165
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,340
A simple carriage
and a few servants will suffice.

166
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,340
Yes, Your Highness.

167
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,320
[The Ministry of Justice]

168
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,940
This is his cell, Your Highness.

169
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,300
You may leave now.

170
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,020
Yes, Your Highness.

171
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,780
What are you looking at?

172
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,060
After spending a night in the cell,

173
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,660
you seem surprisingly energetic
Quite content, aren't you?

174
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,020
You bet I am.

175
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,780
While the accommodations outside

176
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,100
may offer luxurious beds
and soft bedding,

177
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,980
the chaotic lifestyle makes it hard
to have peace of mind.

178
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,260
Here, it's calm and quiet,

179
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,380
providing a chance
for a good night's rest.

180
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,620
Then you should take the opportunity
to stay here for a few more days.

181
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,260
I will come over in a few days as well.

182
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,380
Why are you coming here?

183
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,460
Have you become dumb
after starting life anew?

184
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,220
After falsely accusing you
of killing Tuoba Yan,

185
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,500
the Yang Family
will surely have a follow-up.

186
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,100
We'll need to put on a show in court

187
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,220
to keep things in check.

188
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,540
When the time comes,
I might end up in prison as well.

189
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,740
And we can accompany each other.

190
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,300
Once Chuan takes charge
at the front lines

191
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,140
and assists
Concubine Rou's brother Xiao Su

192
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,140
in stabilizing the borders,

193
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,420
we will be released.

194
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,380
You stay here for now

195
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,380
and find ways to settle in comfortably.

196
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,860
Share your experiences later.

197
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,300
I'm heading out.

198
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,060
Unfortunately,

199
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,700
my young master
is not in a good mood today

200
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,740
and prefers not to see visitors.

201
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,180
Your Highness, please understand.

202
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:09,180
I'll wait
until Young Master Qin's mood improves.

203
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,620
You wouldn't mind me waiting here,

204
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,180
right, Mr. Cui?

205
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,620
Your Highness, do you know
how long you will be waiting here?

206
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,260
These foods
should last me for a few days.

207
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,420
Please convey to Young Master Qin

208
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,340
that Jiulu Mountain is far
from the hustle and bustle,

209
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,460
it's tranquil and beautiful,

210
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,780
perfect for nurturing the mind
and improving one's mood.

211
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,820
I'm not in a hurry.

212
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,020
Your Highness,
please feel free to do as you wish.

213
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,060
No wonder Rong kept reminding me

214
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,820
to be patient.

215
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,450
[Ministry of War]

216
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,060
Your Highness.

217
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,020
Please have some tea.

218
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,980
You arranged for me to inspect
the accounts at the Ministry of War.

219
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,380
I appreciate it, Mr. Su.

220
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,700
This

221
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,140
is what I should do.

222
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,500
That day,

223
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,860
at Tuoba Yan's residence,

224
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,500
you happened to save me.

225
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,860
I'm wondering why the coincidence.

226
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,220
Your Highness,

227
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,580
there are no coincidences in this world.

228
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,100
There is only intention.

229
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,460
The one who tried to kill you

230
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,700
is Su Rongqing.

231
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,380
Being born into the royal family,

232
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,260
deceit is unavoidable.

233
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,340
However, you are a gentleman

234
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,780
as pure as the moonlight.

235
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,980
There's no need for you
to get involved in such matters.

236
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,820
I'll get cracking now.
Feel free to do whatever you want.

237
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,020
I'll take my leave.

Come with us if you want to live.

266
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,060
Miss Jinglan,

267
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,500
has Her Highness not returned yet?

268
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,900
Not yet. I am planning to go
and fetch Her Highness.

269
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,100
Quickly go and inform Her Highness

270
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,460
that there's news about Tuoba Yan.

271
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,060
It hurts. Who are you people?

272
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:34,740
Stop it.

273
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,860
Help him up.

274
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,100
I told you to rescue him,

275
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,460
not to hurt him.

276
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,700
Please forgive us, Your Highness.

277
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,620
Long time no see, Sixth Master.

278
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,500
I...

279
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,340
I thought you had left Huajing,

280
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,140
but it turns out
you're still wandering nearby.

281
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,300
Who are you exactly?

282
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,860
I'm sure

283
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,740
you have already guessed who I am.

284
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,500
Now I just want to ask you for a favor.

285
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,060
I want to overthrow
the powerful and wealthy families,

286
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,780
but just relying on account books
is not enough.

287
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,100
Sixth Master,

288
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,220
could you be a witness for me?

289
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,140
Your Highness,
since you were able to find me,

290
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,180
you should know
that in our line of work,

291
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,060
one's life can be forfeited,

292
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,380
but the rules must never be broken.

293
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,580
You're afraid that if you betray
the Yang Family,

294
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,700
other families
will definitely join forces to kill you,

295
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,260
right?

296
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,380
But you should know

297
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,900
that one must be alive first

298
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,340
to have a chance of being killed.

299
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,300
And now,

300
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,820
I'm in your hands, isn't it the same?

301
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,220
I just saved you, didn't I?

302
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,420
Is that how you save someone?

303
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,140
That's how you save a person?

304
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,260
So, if I don't agree with you,

305
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:55,900
do I have to die

306
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,500
in this courtyard today,

307
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,420
Your Highness?

308
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,940
Sixth Master, you jest.

309
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,820
Why would I kill you?

310
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,580
I heard

311
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,730
that your wife is working
as an embroidery lady

312
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,060
in the Qingshui Town of Luzhou.

313
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,260
Your son has also reached the age
to begin learning.

314
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,580
I heard you arranged
an identity for him,

315
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,140
planning for him to enter
Fengshan Academy next year.

316
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,460
Isn't that right?

317
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,700
People shouldn't be too fixated
on certain things.

318
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,820
Don't you think so?

319
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,140
You're not in a good mood,

320
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,780
and neither am I.

321
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,580
Who's there?

322
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,820
Where did you pop up from?

323
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,150
[Qin Zhenzhen]
I thought you were a wild animal.

324
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:51,900
[Eldest daughter of the Qin Family]

325
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,140
You playboy,
how dare you hold me like that!

326
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,380
I saved you.

327
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,140
How can you treat me like that?

328
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,020
It's clear you're a bookworm
at first glance.

329
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,460
Why would I need you to save me?

330
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,580
Take this!

331
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,060
Miss,

332
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,500
why did you shoot
an arrow at me just now?

333
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,060
If I really wanted to harm you,

334
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,540
why would I only aim
at the place near you?

335
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,220
If you can scare away my prey,

336
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,900
why can't I scare you a little?

337
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,700
I'm sorry.

338
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,300
But I didn't mean to...

339
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,220
No need to explain.

340
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:28,860
Your Majesty.

341
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,180
Has Concubine Ning
started causing trouble again?

342
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,540
It's not Her Highness causing trouble,

343
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,660
it's the border.

344
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,380
General Xiao has taken over
the Yang Family's military power,

345
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,740
but his subordinates
are not cooperating.

346
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,660
The enemy has been making threats
for three days straight,

347
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,100
but the defending troops
remains steadfast in avoiding battle.

348
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,020
General Xiao dares not
execute any more soldiers.

349
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,500
They are threatening me!

350
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,180
Your Majesty, don't be angry
and risk harming your health.

351
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,430
The Yang Family's arrogance

352
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,780
and collusion with the enemy
are outrageous.

353
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,740
They should have been executed
as a warning to others,

354
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,620
but given

355
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,900
the current dire situation...

356
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,780
I can offer some solace for the moment.

357
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,020
Send word to Xiao Su

358
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,060
to guard the border at all costs.

359
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,860
I'll send reinforcements promptly.

360
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:11,660
Yes, Your Majesty.

361
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,380
Also,

362
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,620
go notify Pingyue

363
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,140
to endure it for the time being.

364
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

365
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:20,900
Brother,

366
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,900
today, His Majesty decreed

367
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,930
to have Pingyue detained
in the Ministry of Justice

368
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:25,460
pending trial.

369
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,700
From my understanding of both of them,

370
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,580
Pingyue might indeed have obtained

371
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,620
evidence of the Yang Family
embezzling military funds.

372
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,580
Even so,

373
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,060
the Shangguan Family
cannot take the lead

374
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,700
in opposing the Noble Houses.

375
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,780
Do we really have to stand by
and watch as these pieces of evidence

376
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,300
end up in His Majesty's hands,

377
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,060
rather than benefiting the Crown Prince?

378
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,500
I'm afraid the two siblings

379
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,780
are not aligned with us.

380
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,100
So you are the Crown Prince?

381
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:11,860
Yes.

382
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,060
Your intentions are good,

383
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,980
but you are a bit reckless.

384
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,940
Miss, your criticism is valid.

385
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,540
I was blind to your true abilities

386
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,900
and underestimated you.

387
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,260
That was my first mistake.

388
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,580
Then, I rashly held a lady,

389
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,100
tainting her reputation.

390
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,940
That was my second mistake.

391
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,220
If that's the case,

392
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,980
then there's a third mistake.

393
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,460
You've been here
for three days in a row,

394
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,980
disturbing my peace.

395
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,220
That's your third mistake.

396
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,060
Miss, you are...

397
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,220
I'm the sister
of the person you want to see.

398
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,620
I'm Qin Zhenzhen.

399
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:55,180
I'm wondering though, Your Highness,
on what basis do you believe

400
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,780
my brother will help you?

401
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,740
So you are Miss Qin.

402
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,820
I have heard that your father,
General Qin, was skilled in warfare

403
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,660
but weary of it.

404
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,100
Sadly, he fell in battle
a few years ago,

405
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,340
leaving his ambitions unfulfilled.

406
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,260
My desire is also to find

407
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,340
a capable general

408
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,820
to help end the war and conflicts

409
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,700
and bring peace to the land.

410
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,940
These nuts are a token of my sincerity.

411
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,580
I hope you will accept them.

412
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,580
Thank you then.

413
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,220
Did you all hear
what the Crown Prince said outside?

414
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,660
He's actually quite kind,

415
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,100
thinking of saving me

416
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,740
even though I don't need his help.

417
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,140
You are kind and innocent,

418
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,980
have you considered
that he may have ulterior motives?

419
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,660
But at that time,
he didn't even know who I was.

420
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,780
Lin, shouldn't you be very happy?

421
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,140
There's someone
who fully understands your aspirations

422
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,780
and has both the ability and sincerity

423
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,100
to help you achieve them.

424
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,180
Mr. Li,

425
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,980
can I choose my cell?

426
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,700
Of course, Your Highness.

427
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,140
Which room caught your eye?

428
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,500
I'll take the cell next to Mr. Pei's.

429
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,940
It's comforting

430
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,260
to have a familiar presence nearby.

431
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,700
Your Highness is right.

432
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,180
Please come this way, Your Highness.

433
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,660
Your Highness,

434
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,780
Her Highness and Mr. Pei
have been framed

435
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,780
and imprisoned one after another.

436
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,740
She must have her own arrangements
regarding this matter.

437
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,800
Right now, the priority
is to get General Qin's help

438
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,420
as soon as possible.

439
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,740
Who's this wild creature

440
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,380
that's following me so closely?

441
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:17,900
Feng Ming.

442
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,100
Your Highness.

443
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,060
Miss Qin,

444
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,220
would you be interested
in another sparring match?

445
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,540
If I win,

446
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,740
could you help me
persuade your brother a bit more?

447
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,980
What if you lose?

448
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,020
Then persuade him a bit less.

449
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,420
If you lose,

450
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,900
I'll advise him not to go.

451
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,220
How about that?

452
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,820
I won't go easy on you.

453
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,780
Feng Ming, step back.

454
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,100
Show me what you're made of.

455
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,580
Miss Qin,

456
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,420
the outcome between us
is no longer important.

457
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,020
I trust
that with your brother's aspirations

458
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:11,900
to save the world,

459
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,740
even without persuasion,

460
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,940
he will go.

461
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,700
I've only been here for a short while

462
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,660
and Your Highness
has already come to join me.

463
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:22,940
You must have been eager to see me, huh?

464
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,340
It seems that you haven't learned
much else in jail,

465
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,220
apart from getting more glib-tongued.

466
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,300
Not really.

467
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,300
Your Highness mentioned before

468
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,860
that you would visit me daily,

469
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:34,980
but I

470
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,060
haven't even seen you at all
these past few days.

471
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,700
I've been thinking day and night,
unable to sleep peacefully.

472
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,820
My heart is filled
with countless thoughts and emotions.

473
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,460
If I have offended
Your Highness in any way,

474
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,260
please forgive me.

475
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,380
I'll take my leave now.

476
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,140
Your Highness,
if there is anything you need,

477
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,500
just let me know.

478
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:58,980
Thank you, Mr. Li.

479
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,380
Have you sorted out everything?

480
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,860
One of the two matters is sorted.

481
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,060
I'll tell you about it later.

482
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,300
How did you mess this up?

483
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,620
How come Tuoba Yan isn't dead?

484
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,420
The butler Wang Shun said

485
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,620
that Tuoba Yan
was stabbed to death on the spot,

486
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,260
but it turned out to be a decoy.

487
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,220
It's all because of my negligence,

488
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,620
which has caused trouble
for Your Highness.

489
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,940
I'm willing to accept
your punishment, Your Highness.

490
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,860
What's the use of killing you?

491
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,940
Regardless,

492
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,180
you must find Tuoba Yan for me.

493
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:39,740
Otherwise,

494
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,260
your entire family

495
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,460
will meet their end with me.

496
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,180
That looks good.

497
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:59,460
Come and see me every day from morning

498
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,540
to noon and evening afterwards.

499
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,300
Yes, Your Highness.

500
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,020
You can go now.

501
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,060
Which matter have you sorted out?

502
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,500
You don't have to write it down.
No one else is here.

503
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:30,900
I got the evidence.

504
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,260
What about Qin Lin?
Is he on board with us now?

505
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,380
Do you think it's that easy
to get Qin Lin on board?

506
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,180
I'm worried you
might take it the wrong way,

507
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,420
but I have a solution.

508
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,740
What solution?

509
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,020
After all, he's Zhen's...

510
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:44,700
What Zhen?

511
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,620
He's Miss Qin's brother after all,

512
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,420
so he might do me a favor.

513
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,340
You were rejected for marriage.

514
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,580
Why would he do you a favor?

515
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,860
When was I rejected for marriage?

516
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,260
She simply had no choice.

517
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,340
Pei Wenxuan,

518
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,380
I've noticed something about you.

519
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,780
Your other abilities are average,

520
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,980
but your ability
to deceive yourself is remarkable.

521
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,540
Previously,
her love towards Chuan was so obvious.

522
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,420
And it was never about you.

523
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,140
Your logic is flawed.

524
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,650
She wasn't even acquainted with Li Chuan

525
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,700
when she called off the engagement.

526
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,380
It must have been pressure
from her family.

527
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,740
You think the key point

528
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,740
is when she started
having feelings for Li Chuan?

529
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,220
The key point
is she might not have liked you at all.

530
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,380
From what I see,

531
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,510
calling off the engagement
was entirely voluntary

532
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,340
and her own decision.

533
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,140
What's with the strong reaction today?

534
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,700
I thought we

535
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,740
had finished discussing this.

536
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,420
What? Did you resort to coercion

537
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,900
when interrogating the person?

538
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,460
Is it Tuoba Yan?

539
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,300
I knew it.

540
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,900
You tend to lose your composure
when there's blood around.

541
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,260
I'll take care of these matters
in the future.

542
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,340
No need, it's none of your concern.

543
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,300
Why wouldn't it concern me?

544
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,900
We are supposed to live together.

545
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,020
If you go out to interrogate people
and come back in a bad mood,

546
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,580
then you will take it out on me.

547
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,940
Ultimately, isn't it me
who will suffer from this?

548
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,780
I beg of you, please,

549
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,140
spare me the torture.

550
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,820
In the future,
let me handle such matters for you.

551
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,380
Okay?

552
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,820
Alright, I agree.

553
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,580
I've got something for you.

554
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,770
[To Your Royal Highness]

555
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,640
[The peony's beauty is unmatched.]

556
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,100
[It's a spectacle that captivates
the capital when it blooms.]

557
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,980
You actually had the time
to write poems and paint, huh?

558
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,200
[Aged peony]

559
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,500
I'm just joking.

560
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,780
As they say,
old wine gets better with time.

561
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,460
You're like a fine wine,
getting better with age.

562
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,060
Peony is a symbol of your beauty.

563
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,860
So, "aged peony"
is actually a compliment.

564
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,300
It's not meant to insult you.

565
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,260
Why would I insult you?

566
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,380
I'm not that kind of person.

567
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,740
Your Highness.

568
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,380
Your Highness,
His Highness the Crown Prince is here.

569
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,260
Rong.

570
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,540
Chuan.

571
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,180
Rong,

572
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,220
are you doing okay here?

573
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,140
I'm doing great, don't worry.

574
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,060
Everything is going as I expected.

575
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,140
So, how about it?

576
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,780
Were you able to persuade Qin Lin?

577
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,540
Not yet,

578
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,500
but soon.

579
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:44,700
Soon?

580
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,060
I persuaded her.

581
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,020
It's pretty much a sure thing now.

582
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,220
Long time no see, Pei.

583
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,020
Long time no see.

584
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,940
It's been about four years, hasn't it?

585
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,740
Indeed.

586
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,020
Oh, Rong,

587
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,220
Uncle asked me to check with you

588
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,780
if you could hand
these pieces of evidence

589
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,860
over to the Shangguan Family.

590
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,540
What do you think?

591
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,980
Definitely not.

592
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,820
We can't be tied
to the Shangguan Family any longer.

593
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,380
I'm glad you understand.

594
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,620
Why is she here?

595
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,340
Do you

596
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,900
know her?

597
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,980
This is someone I met
outside Qin Lin's house.

598
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,180
It was a chance encounter.

599
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,980
She said she could help me
persuade Qin Lin,

600
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,940
but the condition
is that she wants to meet Pei Wenxuan.

601
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,620
I heard you were imprisoned

602
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,340
and I was truly worried.

603
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,020
That's why I came here without notice.

604
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,820
Now that I know you're safe,

605
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,060
I feel relieved.

606
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,420
No need to worry.

607
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,460
I can handle everything here.

608
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,540
Are these two in a relationship,

609
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,260
Rong?

610
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,580
Just listen to what they have to say.

611
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,380
Also,

612
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,820
regarding the cancellation
of the engagement...

613
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,020
Cancellation of the engagement?

614
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,660
Pei's engagement with this girl got...

615
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,620
I apologize for not being able
to explain in person.

616
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,540
I hope you can forgive me.

617
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,260
It's alright.

618
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,060
This matter has nothing to do with you
in the first place,

619
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,220
so there's no blame on you.

620
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,580
Please don't worry about it anymore.

621
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,700
You misunderstood.

622
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:13,300
The decision to cancel the engagement
was my own choice.

623
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,420
There are no feelings between us,

624
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,220
yet we were forced
to be together by our parents,

625
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,180
pretending to be a couple

626
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,540
and committing to a lifetime together.

627
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,220
What's the point of that?

628
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,540
I've heard

629
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,940
that you are an open-minded person,

630
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,380
so I believe you can understand.

631
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,020
I originally wanted
to explain this to you in person,

632
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,380
but the elders kept preventing me
from doing so.

633
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,420
I was at a loss as well.

634
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,900
I... I can totally understand.

635
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,580
I mean it.

636
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,700
That's great then.

637
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,780
I was worried you might think
we ditched you

638
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,140
because of Uncle Pei's passing.

639
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,860
I've pushed them many times,

640
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,380
but it kept getting delayed,

641
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,020
so it's been weighing me down
this whole time.

642
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,700
However, now that everything's clear,

643
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,740
I feel relieved.

644
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:10,980
Your Highness,

645
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,020
may I ask why you're laughing?

646
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,460
I'm laughing

647
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,300
at someone
who read too much into things.

648
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,420
You two can continue.
No need to mind me.

649
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,140
Actually, this matter isn't a big deal.

650
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,460
I know you and your brother well.

651
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,580
So no need to worry anymore.

652
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,660
It's not good to stay here for long.

653
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,020
You and the His Highness
should leave first.

654
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,980
Tell your brother

655
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,260
that His Highness is very...

656
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,100
My brother is aware of this.

657
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,620
Don't worry.

658
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,980
He will go.

659
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,540
It's just that we have to wait
a few more days.

660
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:57,820
Wait a moment.

661
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,940
You said your brother would go,

662
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,580
but then you mentioned
helping me persuade him.

663
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,540
Did you lie to me?

664
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,580
He only decided to go
because I persuaded him.

665
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,660
How is that a lie?

666
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,460
You...

667
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,340
Chuan, mind your manners.

668
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,700
Miss Qin,

669
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,780
if the Crown Prince is forced
to be sent to the front lines,

670
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,820
can your brother ensure he will go?

671
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,580
Your Highness, rest assured.

672
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,100
My brother is just testing

673
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,380
His Highness's character
by being difficult.

674
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,700
He had no intention to refuse.

675
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,180
I understand.

676
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,020
Pei, I will take my leave.

677
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,260
Chuan,

678
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,660
during the assembly tomorrow morning,

679
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,250
Father may appoint you
to oversee military affairs

680
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:45,940
in the Northwest.

681
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,220
You mustn't agree directly.

682
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,500
Keep rejecting the offer.

683
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,980
After Qin Lin goes with you
to the front lines,

684
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,220
you mustn't let anyone know
he's associated with you.

685
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,300
Arrange for him to stay
in the military camp secretly.

686
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,660
After planning for so long,

687
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,140
we can't let others benefit
from our efforts.

688
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,380
Rong, don't worry.
I'll handle it properly.

689
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,620
I'll go get prepared now.

690
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,340
Go ahead.

691
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,020
Chuan,

692
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,420
don't personally escort Miss Qin later.

693
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,820
Send someone else to do it.

694
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,820
You have more important matters
to attend to.

695
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,900
Rong, why do you
always treat me like a child?

696
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:23,540
You...

697
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,540
I know. I'm off.

698
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,700
Are you worried

699
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,380
that Li Chuan and Qin Zhenzhen
will get together again?

700
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,460
Are you not worried?

701
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:55,340
They have indeed
met earlier than expected

702
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,340
and it's uncertain
what might happen next.

703
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,980
Li Chuan and Qin Zhenzhen

704
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,740
met a year later in the past.

705
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,540
When Her Majesty was selecting
consorts for the Crown Prince,

706
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,300
Shangguan Ya was the primary consort

707
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,540
and Qin Zhenzhen
was a secondary consort.

708
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,100
The other three

709
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,020
were selected from different families.

710
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,140
Yes.

711
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:18,220
Initially, Chuan was unwilling,

712
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,780
but after being scolded many times,

713
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,300
it was under my persuasion

714
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,700
that he agreed to the marriage.

715
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,660
However, it was from that time onward

716
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,980
that Chuan became less like a youth.

717
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,380
He became more reserved, calm,

718
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,060
and dignified in his demeanor
when handling things.

719
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,460
It was only because Qin Lin
had military power

720
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:50,300
that Mother placed Qin Zhenzhen
in the Eastern Palace.

721
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,420
However, she came
from a humble background,

722
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,820
so initially,
she wasn't favored by the Crown Prince.

723
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,740
Additionally,

724
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,660
her stubborn nature

725
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:03,300
led her to face bullying
in the Eastern Palace.

726
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:07,220
I heard that her servants withheld
her winter coal allowance

727
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,460
and embezzled her monthly stipend,

728
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,580
but she never complained.

729
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,380
It wasn't until later,

730
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,500
when two concubines
in the Eastern Palace

731
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,620
began to frame each other...

732
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,060
Your Highness,

733
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,260
the physicians have been warned

734
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,460
and are afraid to treat you.

735
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,140
Your health is so fragile,

736
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,940
why did you still jump into the lake
to save someone?

737
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,420
Ling, don't worry.

738
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,100
I'm fine.

739
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:37,060
After that,
her maid Ling came to see me.

740
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:37,980
Mr. Pei.

741
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,340
Please save my miss.

742
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:42,660
Get up first.

743
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,100
What happened to Zhen?

744
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,980
It's just some trivial jealousy
and rivalry among the concubines.

745
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:54,860
No need for you to be involved...

746
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,700
How can you say
it's just some trivial jealousy?

747
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,100
She nearly died.

748
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,420
Your Highness,

749
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,420
as a husband,
even if you don't love her,

750
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,180
you should at least
not treat her harshly.

751
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,420
Moreover,

752
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,940
Qin Lin is still risking his life
on the front lines for you.

753
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,700
And please don't forget

754
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,140
that she nearly lost her life

755
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,260
to save your Crown Princess.

756
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:21,300
Alright.

757
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,020
I will go.

758
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:25,740
Pei Wenxuan,

759
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,100
it was you

760
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,140
who personally presented your beloved

761
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,420
