[Episode 8]

6
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,260
Pei Wenxuan,

7
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,580
it was you

8
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,500
who personally presented your beloved

9
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,820
to Chuan.

10
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,620
Your Highness.

11
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:54,780
Your Highness.

12
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,860
Take it easy.

13
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,260
Your Highness.

14
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,660
Ever since then,

15
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,220
from Crown Prince to Emperor,

16
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,300
Chuan has always favored her greatly,

17
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,820
and she, in turn,
has not failed his love.

18
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,700
Even when Chuan was imprisoned later on,

19
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,660
she fought her way out alone
with just a sword,

20
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,900
evading pursuers,
climbing snow-covered mountains,

21
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,940
and journeying to the northern border,

22
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,020
returning with reinforcements.

23
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,300
In the palace, under great favor,

24
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,660
one not only receives love

25
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,300
but also sharp blades.

26
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,700
The second year
after Chuan ascended the throne,

27
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,020
she gave birth to Li Ping,

28
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,940
but shortly afterwards,

29
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,100
she died in the palace.

30
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,940
Your Highnesses,

31
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,420
His Majesty has not eaten
or drunk anything for several days now.

32
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,900
Chuan, always prioritize state affairs

33
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,900
and avoid being too emotional.

34
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,580
Your Majesty.

35
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,380
Go away!

36
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,540
Your Majesty, please don't be like this.

37
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,660
You can all leave now.

38
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,940
Calm down.

39
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,820
Qin Zhenzhen has already passed.

40
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:45,980
Rong.

41
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,860
Zhen has passed.

42
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,180
I know.

43
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,100
Chuan,

44
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,860
let her rest in peace.

45
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,100
Rong,

46
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,060
could we bury Zhen
with the honors of an Empress

47
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,340
and inter her in my imperial tomb?

48
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:11,980
Your Highness.

49
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,820
Let's follow
His Majesty's wish this time.

50
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,100
Chuan seems to have changed drastically,

51
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,340
becoming more and more aggressive.

52
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,540
The Crown Prince, once renowned

53
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,340
for his kindness
and virtue in his youth,

54
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,540
has gradually stepped onto a path
similar to that of our father,

55
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,100
resorting to militarism,

56
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,260
exploiting the common people,

57
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,460
and indulging
in self-destructive behavior.

58
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,380
Our paths have diverged
as he distances himself from me.

59
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,980
So this time,

60
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,100
I suppose you won't let her
enter the palace.

61
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,020
Why are you so quiet?

62
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,220
It's up to you.

63
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,940
You mean

64
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,540
if I let you intervene, you will.

65
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,700
And if I don't want you to,

66
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,380
you won't.

67
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,020
Yes.

68
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,140
What's this supposed to mean?

69
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,420
I shouldn't have interfered back then

70
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,340
and I shouldn't now.

71
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,860
Everyone has their own web,

72
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,460
and this web can entangle others

73
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,900
if what they do exceeds their limits.

74
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,460
Any slight leaning towards one side

75
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,540
causes pain to those on the other.

76
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,780
She should have taken responsibility
for her own life,

77
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,780
and outsiders' meddling
is not a good thing.

78
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,300
Besides,

79
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,540
I have my responsibilities.

80
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,820
Now that I have agreed to marry you,

81
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,980
I will restrain myself according

82
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,020
to a husband's code of conduct.

83
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,820
Until the end of our contract?

84
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,100
Maybe.

85
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,700
If you had this insight earlier,

86
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,700
maybe

87
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,060
we could have grown old together.

88
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,380
Say,

89
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,900
with your forty years of life experience

90
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,900
and your current looks,

91
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,940
how many young women

92
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,740
would be attracted to you
if you went out now?

93
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,740
Li Rong, be honest with me.

94
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,300
What did you think of me back then?

95
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,220
Actually, back then,

96
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,180
you were a good person.

97
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,220
You were just too stubborn

98
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,500
and couldn't let things go.

99
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,700
What made you say that?

100
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,540
Back then, you promised
to take care of Qin Zhenzhen

101
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,500
and held yourself to the principle
that a gentleman's word is his bond,

102
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,500
no matter the circumstances.

103
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,860
You were determined to help her.

104
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,580
You also thought
you had feelings for her,

105
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,260
but then you suddenly fell for me.

106
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,260
This caused an internal struggle,

107
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,540
making you question

108
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,620
how you could be so fickle.

109
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,060
So,

110
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,820
your intentions were never the problem.

111
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,340
It was just that you
couldn't let things go.

112
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,940
Are you saying

113
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,300
that back then you already knew

114
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,580
I liked you?

115
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,340
What else could it be?

116
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,700
If you didn't like me,

117
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,300
why would you treat me so well?

118
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,380
Back then, I was just shy.

119
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,860
I felt you liked me

120
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,860
but wasn't sure.

121
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,260
Besides, who could resist my charm?

122
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,580
What? Am I wrong?

123
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,860
Not exactly wrong.

124
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,180
It's just that besides
not wanting to admit

125
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,100
that I could quickly fall
for someone else,

126
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,900
there was another reason.

127
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,180
What reason?

128
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,820
I guess

129
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,940
liking you

130
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,620
would mean bowing down
to royal power.

131
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,460
If I admitted I liked you,

132
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,940
it would feel like a form of surrender.

133
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:02,940
Li Rong,

134
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,740
I couldn't see myself clearly back then.

135
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,900
Since you understood everything so well,

136
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,500
why didn't you wait for me?

137
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,500
What you said is amusing.

138
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,780
I'm not a junk collector.

139
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,900
Why should I wait for you?

140
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,780
Can you please

141
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,940
be a bit gentler with your words?

142
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,700
So here's the thing.

143
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,060
In my entire life,

144
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,020
I've never truly hated Qin Zhenzhen.

145
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,220
For a woman,

146
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,460
hating her romantic rival

147
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,620
is simply feeling

148
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,260
like she doesn't stand a chance

149
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,860
in the competition for affection.

150
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,780
Thus, she wishes

151
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,540
the rival
to be as repulsive as possible,

152
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,380
believing her beloved must be blind.

153
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,380
But I don't need such consolation.

154
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,260
I, Li Rong,

155
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,700
born of noble blood
with imperial lineage,

156
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,740
though not strikingly beautiful,

157
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,500
hold renown in the capital.

158
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,460
Intelligent
and well-versed in etiquette,

159
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,980
wealth and power
are but embellishments to me.

160
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,260
For a woman like myself,

161
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,020
the question
shouldn't be why I didn't wait for you,

162
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,020
but rather

163
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,660
why I should.

164
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,300
Even if you are handsome,

165
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,940
I wouldn't allow myself
to be so blindly infatuated.

166
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,060
You should know

167
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,780
that some wounds, once inflicted,

168
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,460
are hard to heal,

169
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,580
especially for one born into royalty,

170
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,940
with stringent demands

171
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,820
for fidelity.

172
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,950
[Hanqiu Palace]

173
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,740
The foreign enemy's large army
is approaching the border,

174
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,020
yet the Yang Family insists on disarming
and returning to the capital.

175
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,540
They clearly intend to embarrass me.

176
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,850
Your Majesty, the actions

177
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,100
of the Yang Family
are indeed inappropriate.

178
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,820
If the Yang Family
withdraws their troops,

179
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,140
which of you, my dear ministers,

180
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,620
is willing to step forward
and fight on my behalf?

181
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,380
Crown Prince, can you?

182
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,060
I...

183
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,940
Your Majesty,

184
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,180
currently, our troops are facing
successive defeats, and morale is low.

185
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,940
The Crown Prince is young
and lacks practical combat experience.

186
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,010
Sending him to the front lines

187
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,420
will not only fail
to win the trust of the soldiers

188
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,580
but may burden us further.

189
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,140
I am asking the Crown Prince.

190
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,940
Are you the Crown Prince?

191
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,020
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
I've overstepped my authority.

192
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,860
Crown Prince, answer me.

193
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,540
I...

194
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,060
My knowledge

195
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,420
in military matters is limited,

196
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,500
and doubt my ability
to handle such a task.

197
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,260
If you can't handle such a task,

198
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,100
then I think your time as Crown Prince
may soon come to an end.

199
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,780
Father is pressuring me.

200
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,700
Uncle.

201
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,660
Chuan.

202
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,700
I'm heading to battle

203
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,540
without soldiers or funds.

204
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,820
Can you provide some assistance?

205
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,660
Your Highness, you may be unaware

206
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,860
that if you go to the front lines now

207
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:32,860
and achieve victory,

208
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,540
His Majesty will ensure
Prince Su claims military glory.

209
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,140
Xiao Su is already stationed
at the border,

210
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,300
and your involvement would aid him.

211
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,700
However, should you fail,

212
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,300
His Majesty
will likely not favor you again.

213
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,100
Therefore, whether victorious
or defeated,

214
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,340
now presents a crucial opportunity

215
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,860
for Prince Su
and his loyalists to ascend,

216
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,740
while for us,

217
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,020
it poses only risks with no benefits.

218
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,990
Given the two evils,

219
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,580
I have no choice but to go.

220
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,140
And I must win the battle.

221
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,620
This is our best option.

222
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,660
Your Highness is right.

223
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,740
The Shangguan Family
and Your Highness are in the same boat.

224
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,700
We will surely lend our full support.

225
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,500
Thank you, Uncle.

226
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,900
Lin, we're here.

227
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,260
- Greetings, Young Master Qin.
- Please don't.

228
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,340
Your Highness, this makes us uneasy.

229
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,140
I am thanking you both on behalf
of the soldiers guarding the border

230
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,140
and the people of the Great Xia Dynasty

231
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,500
for coming down the mountain to help.

232
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,820
With your talents as commanders,

233
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,260
this recognition is well deserved.

234
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,300
I am most flattered.

235
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,500
I heard Your Highness
is setting out for battle tomorrow.

236
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,020
Do you have any arrangements
for the two of us?

237
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,460
Wait a minute.

238
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,380
Are you just going to stand here

239
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,620
and discuss things like this?

240
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,980
Thanks for reminding me, Zhen.

241
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,940
My bad.

242
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,980
Your Highness, please.

243
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,020
Please.

244
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,460
I have yet to thank you for your help.

245
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,500
By the looks of it,
everything is in place now?

246
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,020
Yes. I'll set off tomorrow.

247
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,620
So soon?

248
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,340
This is...

249
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,620
This sword is named Zhilian.
[*orchid]

250
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,220
It was forged by my father and me
back in the day.

251
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,460
Now, I give this sword
to Your Highness,

252
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,180
hoping that you can use it

253
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,860
to fulfill your and my father's wishes

254
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,740
and bring about
a peaceful and prosperous era.

255
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,500
The ancients say

256
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,420
that true friendships
are like the orchid.

257
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,500
I will not disappoint your expectations,

258
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,420
even if it means
dying on the battlefield.

259
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,900
What I anticipate is a hero,

260
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,780
not a martyr.

261
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,860
I hope that Your Highness,
while protecting the myriad of subjects,

262
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,700
will also take care of yourself.

263
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,340
Otherwise, everything will be in vain.

264
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,140
May you both return alive.

265
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,020
But we have no swords.

266
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,900
Didn't His Highness
give you anything in return?

267
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,020
I...

268
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,050
[The Ministry of Justice]

269
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,100
Rong.

270
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,340
When did you start
doing exercises for wellness?

271
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,620
I can even perform
the Five Animals Qigong.

272
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,860
Watch closely now.

273
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:00,940
Don't laugh.

274
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,060
No, I mean

275
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,100
when did you start learning the things

276
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,980
that the Grand Empress Dowager
liked to do.

277
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,980
Okay, it's never too early
to start exercising to keep fit.

278
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,020
You did a good job.

279
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,740
I just felt

280
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,900
that it was too stuffy
inside the prison,

281
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,780
so I came out to get some fresh air.

282
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:23,900
So?

283
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,260
Is there's anything
you'd like to tell me?

284
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,340
Father issued a decree today,

285
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,340
appointing me to oversee
military affairs in the Northwest.

286
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,140
Did that person go?

287
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,100
He did.

288
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,740
They split into two groups for the trip.

289
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,380
I've secretly prepared
their undercover identities.

290
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,540
Good.

291
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,540
Once you arrive,

292
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,820
find the Yang Family's account books
immediately.

293
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,460
Got it.

294
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,260
Don't worry, I'm here.

295
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,460
Does Pei Wenxuan treat you well?

296
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,100
If he doesn't treat you well
while I'm away...

297
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,060
I don't need him to treat me well.

298
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,860
I can take care of myself.

299
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
Now, don't worry

300
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,020
and don't waste any more time.
Hurry up and go.

301
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,660
If I don't make it back, you...

302
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,540
What are you talking about?

303
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,580
You will definitely come back.

304
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,300
I'm here

305
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,740
and I'll always protect you.

306
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,260
Do you believe me?

307
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,180
I do believe you.

308
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,140
Wait for me to come back.

309
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,580
After I return, I'll protect you.

310
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,460
Okay, I'll wait for you to protect me.

311
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,140
Go now.

312
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,180
I'm leaving.

313
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,660
Miss Qin,

314
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,260
Young Master Qin and Mr. Cui

315
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,140
have already set out
with the vanguard troops.

316
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,300
I know.

317
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,060
When I bid them farewell earlier,

318
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,460
they told me

319
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,780
that you had urgent matters
to discuss with me.

320
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,820
I have something to give you.

321
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,260
What is it?

322
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,060
This lamp was made by me personally.

323
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,820
The fireflies inside

324
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,700
were also caught by me recently.

325
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,540
This is for you.

326
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,100
Thank you.

327
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:14,100
Your Highness, you must stay safe.

328
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,540
You must return home safely.

329
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,780
I'll return home safely.

330
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,220
Your Highness.

331
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,740
Lift up your heads.

332
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:58,980
Where is Ronghua?

333
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,540
Still not found?

334
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,060
Lounging around all day, idling away,
and engaging in gambling activities,

335
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,340
he's truly a disgrace!

336
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,380
It's infuriating.

337
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,020
Father,

338
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,820
calm down.

339
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,420
That older brother of yours

340
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,460
doesn't look like a gentleman
from a Noble House at all.

341
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,740
Father,

342
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,580
my brother enjoys a carefree life.

343
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,100
You should let him be.

344
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,860
If you don't mind,

345
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:32,590
you can rely on me

346
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,780
whenever there's something important
coming up.

347
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,540
I am willing to do everything I can
to assist you,

348
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,900
alleviate your worries,
and solve your problems.

349
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,820
If only your elder brother

350
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,540
had half of your qualities.

351
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,580
Father, you shouldn't say that.

352
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,260
My elder brother and I
have different aspirations.

353
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,900
I only wish for peace
and happiness for our family,

354
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,380
with each person
living their preferred life

355
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,980
and having their dreams come true.

356
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,140
Recently, you seem quite preoccupied

357
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,260
with Princess Pingyue's affairs.

358
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,500
I understand what's on your mind,

359
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,460
but currently, His Majesty's suspicion
towards the Noble Houses

360
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,340
led him to appoint
those four individuals for the princess.

361
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,300
Father,

362
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,980
things are achieved through hard work.

363
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,220
We don't need to rush anything.

364
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,180
I know what I'm doing.

365
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,020
Good.

366
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:28,820
That's good.

367
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,420
You've always been a sensible child
who knows your limits

368
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,340
and understands
when to advance and when to retreat.

369
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:41,380
These days, Tuoba Yan
seems to have vanished into thin air.

370
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,060
We've searched all over Hua Jing,

371
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,500
but there's no trace of him.

372
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,340
Useless.

373
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,220
All of you are useless.

374
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,650
Now that Li Chuan
has gone to the front lines

375
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:55,500
to supervise the troops,

376
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,940
and Li Rong's case remains undecided,

377
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,500
His Majesty is probably determined

378
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,220
to completely eradicate my Yang Family.

379
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,700
Your Highness,

380
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,420
if that is the case,

381
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,620
why not send word
to the head of the family

382
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,780
and ensure that the Crown Prince

383
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,820
never returns from the battlefield?

384
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:29,120
[City Lord's Mansion]

385
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,700
His Highness is weary

386
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,300
from the trip.

387
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,220
You may all leave now.

388
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,620
- Yes.
- Yes.

389
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,180
Your Highness, we
are about to take over the Yang Family.

390
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,900
What are your plans moving forward?

391
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,630
Of course, we must first repel
the enemy troops

392
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,660
before capturing the Yang Family.

393
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,740
However, the Yang Family is cunning.

394
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,060
I'm unsure how to get a hold over them.

395
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,740
It seems to me

396
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,020
that we should wait for them
to fall into our trap.

397
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,330
Since the Yang Family is collaborating

398
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,340
with the enemy
and betraying the country,

399
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,420
we might as well use
their own tactics against them.

400
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,220
Uncle, after careful consideration,

401
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,020
I've decided to accompany you
back to the capital.

402
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,500
No, you must stay here.

403
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,740
Since the Emperor
has sent the Crown Prince over,

404
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,340
that means he wants to help Xiao Su
in taking over the Northwest.

405
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,340
Our Yang Family is probably not safe.

406
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,140
That's why I need you to stay here,

407
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:44,700
and use the enemy's hand
to eliminate the Crown Prince.

408
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,620
The Great Xia actually sent
a fair-skinned scholar like you here?

409
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,260
Shut up.

410
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,340

411
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,180
Kill him.

annihilating thousands of them
and achieving a complete victory.

Aren't you happy for His Highness?

417
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,020
No, I am very happy.

418
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:31,860
Your Highness,

419
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,100
this is a popular novel of late.

420
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,300
You can take a look later.

421
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,180
Also, I've prepared
some refreshments for you.

422
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,180

423
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,220
Your Highness, if there's nothing else,

Why so generous today?

No snarky remarks?

I'm busy. I have no time for that.

00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,580
I have some refreshments here.

to eat them.

he thinks he's invincible.

Gathering support and forming factions,

490
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,260
he even dares to seek rewards
and recognition.

491
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,260
He sure is my good son.

492
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,300
With frequent reports of victories
from the border,

00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,580
seeking recognition now

494
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,940
is a common practice
to boost the morale of the troops.

and harm your health.

His Majesty requests
that you and Mr. Pei enter the palace

that Mr. Pei
can have an audience directly.

510
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,580
Judging by Pei Wenxuan's expression,

511
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,020
he's likely up to something.

512
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:08,660
Your Highness, is there nothing
you would like to say to me?

513
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,100
No, I'm not interested.

514
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,260
But I have a few words
to say to Your Highness.

515
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,500
I knew it.

516
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,420
Go ahead then, or you might go crazy.

517
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,900
I really am going crazy.

518
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,300
Maybe you'd like to remain quiet.

519
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,340
I think this Su Rongqing
has ulterior motives towards you.

520
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,380
Is that so?

521
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,500
That makes me happy.

522
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,900
No, Li Rong.

523
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,100
I'm telling you seriously.

524
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,300
Don't you think Su Rongqing

525
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,300
is being overly friendly towards you?

526
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,820
That day at Tuoba Yan's mansion,

527
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,180
he even pretended to be drunk

528
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,340
and asked if you would consider him.

529
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,500
Don't you find it strange?

530
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,300
Pei Wenxuan,

531
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,300
do you know what the greatest difference

532
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,820
between you and Su Rongqing is?

533
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,980
He is more ruthless than you.

534
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,180
Family, honor, and legacy.

535
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,500
These are the lifelong burdens
he carries.

536
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,740
Faced with such a burden,

537
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,940
he has been taught from childhood
to exercise restraint,

538
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,060
remain calm,

539
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,180
endure pain,

540
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,900
and not exhibit the emotions
you might anticipate.

541
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,620
Li Rong, oh, Li Rong.

542
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,940
After all these years,

543
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,740
you're still so adorable.

00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,540

00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,940
- Father.
- Your Majesty.

546
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,140
You may rise.

00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,540
- Thank you, Father.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

550
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

551
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,460
A few days ago, someone accused you

552
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,420
of murdering
the wealthy merchant Tuoba Yan.

553
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,980
However, recently,
Tuoba Yan appeared alive

554
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,660
and went to the the Censorate
to file a complaint,

555
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,100
alleging that the Yang Family
had sent people to assassinate him.

556
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,180
Do you know much
about the details of this case?

557
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,610
After I initiated

558
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,940
a thorough investigation
of the Yang Family,

559
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,420
someone covertly wrote a letter

560
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,500
mentioning

561
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,740
that the Yang Family
has been colluding with the enemy

562
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,940
and betraying the country
for many years.

563
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,100
That's complete nonsense.

564
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,140
But the secret letter also states

565
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,220
that to secure their own status,
the Yang Family

566
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,260
had long ago reached agreements
with foreign enemies.

567
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,230
Over these years,

568
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,660
most of the reports of victories,
big and small,

569
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,500
were actually deals
where the enemy took money

570
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,900
and put on acts in collusion
with the Yang Family.

571
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,180
How dare you!

572
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:51,780
Kneel!

573
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,380
Father.

574
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,580
I heard

575
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,130
that in Huajing,

576
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:58,660
there is a foreign merchant
named Tuoba Yan

577
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,580
who has repeatedly purchased
cultural relics from the Yang Family.

578
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,860
Upon investigation, it was discovered

579
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,380
that the relics sold
to Tuoba Yan by the Yangs

580
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,540
were priced far above market rates,

581
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,020
showing that they
are not normal transactions.

582
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,980
It seems this matter
reached the ears of Concubine Ning,

583
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,420
prompting them to eliminate evidence

584
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,540
by murdering Tuoba Yan

585
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,020
and framing me and Mr. Pei.

586
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,150
Meanwhile, Yang Ye,

587
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,100
upon learning that his family members
in his residence were trapped,

588
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,380
devised a plan to assassinate
the commander on the front line

589
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,220
and then submitted his resignation,
threatening Your Majesty.

590
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,300
You're talking nonsense!

591
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,420
Nonsense?

592
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,540
Let me ask you then, Mr. Yang.

593
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,970
In enemy camps,
where the climate is harsh

594
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:35,100
and swords are mostly made of bronze,

595
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,940
why are there reports
from the front lines

596
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,100
indicating

597
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,210
a large number of weapons
of our Great Xia

598
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:39,900
during the attack process?

599
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,300
Your Majesty, please take a look.

600
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,380
Your Majesty,

601
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,580
the account books in the past ten years
from the Northwest front lines,

602
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,620
the Ministry of War's ledgers,

603
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,460
and Tuoba Yan's records

604
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,900
have all been reconciled.

605
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,740
Coupled with Tuoba Yan's testimony
and others',

606
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,020
it's sufficient to prove

607
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,420
that over the years, the Yang Family,

608
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,780
disregarding both Your Majesty
and the welfare of the people,

609
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,700
colluded with the enemy
to deceive our Great Xia.

610
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,420
For such grave crimes, the Yang Family
cannot be allowed to remain.

611
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,580
Yang Ye,

612
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,020
do you have anything else to say?

613
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,780
Whatever Your Majesty says,

614
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,860
that's what it is.

615
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,620
Concubine Ning,

616
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,100
how about you?

617
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,660
With things having come to this point,

618
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,300
what's the point of Your Majesty

619
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,380
asking these questions?

620
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,180
Whether the Yang Family is guilty or not

621
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,300
is entirely Your Majesty's decision.

622
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,220
When Your Majesty
needed the Yang Family,

623
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,620
they had fought at the borders
for half their lives.

624
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,700
Now, when Your Majesty
finds the Yang Family in your way

625
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,060
and wishes to support Prince Su,

626
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,180
you accuse the Yang Family of colluding
with the enemy and deceiving the throne.

627
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,260
Ridiculous.

628
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,100
It's utterly ridiculous!

629
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,740
How audacious of you, Yang Wan!

630
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,740
So you still remember
that my name is Yang Wan?

631
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,060
The Yang Family has achieved
great military feats,

632
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,530
and I, Yang Wan, am renowned

633
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,260
as a loyal and heroic woman
across the seas.

634
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,060
Yet now,

635
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:40,660
I and my kin have become your cast-offs.

636
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,300
Back then, our Yang Family
must have been blind

637
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,580
to have let me choose you!

638
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,780
How insolent!

639
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,940
I'm insolent?

640
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,580
You have driven me to this point

641
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,300
and won't tolerate my defiance?

642
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,020
Let me tell you all.

643
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,980
The fate of my Yang Family today

644
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,380
will be yours tomorrow.

645
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,180
Get this madwoman out of here!

646
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,580
Li Rong, you fool.

647
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,260
He has long wanted to depose Li Chuan.

648
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,220
None of the men
he recommended for marriage

649
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,780
are good.

650
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,660
He wishes you dead

651
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,620
and wants to marry you off
to some distant land!

652
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,300
Yet you still respect him and love him.

653
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,540
You can't see through
your heartless father.

654
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,380
Kill her.

655
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,020
Kill her for me!

656
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,740
Your Majesty!

657
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:29,780
Your Majesty!

658
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,500
May your Li Family

659
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,020
all die miserable deaths!

660
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,060
I'll kill you.

661
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:58,900
Wan!

662
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,100
Let go of me!

663
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,180
Take her out.

664
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,300
Let go!

665
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,020
Wait.

666
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,300
Father,

667
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,940
please ask them to fetch
a stretcher and a white cloth.

668
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,740
Let's at least give her
a dignified exit.

669
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,220
Yang Ye,

670
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,420
do you plead guilty?

671
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,340
I

672
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,380
plead guilty.

673
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,820
The entire Yang Family is to be arrested

674
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,100
and transferred
to the Ministry of Justice.

675
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,900
Considering their ancestors' merits,

676
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,620
they shall be granted a dignified death.

677
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,500
Give him the poison.

678
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,580
Thank you,

679
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,620
Your Majesty.

680
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:18,700
Don't!

681
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,660
Do you know what you are doing?

682
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,060
It's not easy
to be someone else's sword.

683
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,100
General Yang.

684
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,780
Do you know what you're doing?

685
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,700
I've read the poems from your youth

686
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,260
where you vividly described

687
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,060
leading troops on a white horse,
wielding your sword northward

688
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,500
to sweep through Tian Pass
and repay the nation's grace.

689
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,780
Do those verses still resonate with you?

690
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,580
So, someone still remembers these.

691
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:17,980
One person alone
cannot clean up the muddied waters.

692
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:22,300
Officials protect each other
and their relationships are complex.

693
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,620
Young Master Pei,
you come from a humble background.

694
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:25,980
The Pei Family has worked

695
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,940
for generations to reach
where they are today.

696
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,420
You understand
this truth better than I do.

697
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,820
The aspirations of youth soar high,

698
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,540
but in the end, we often find

699
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:46,540
that the words of elders hold true.

700
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:56,380
Mr. Pei, let's part ways here.

701
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,140
There will come a day

702
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,420
when you will understand

703
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,100
the meaning of my words.

704
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:16,980
What's the point of talking

705
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,340
to a dying man?

706
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,700
Only a dying person

707
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,420
will tell you why they are dying.

708
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,620
You will then know

709
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,580
how to avoid dying like that

710
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:35,980
and how to help others

711
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,420
avoid dying like that.
