[Episode 21]

5
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,400
Your Highness.

6
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,440
Stop writing.

7
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,150
Your Highness,
if you want to get divorced,

8
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,400
just do so as soon as possible.

9
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,160
If you want the Prince Consort to stay,

10
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,480
then go back early.

11
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,840
Why are you still here?

12
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,960
You're just too young.

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,320
Why do you care?

14
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,120
Your Highness, you're still
very young yourself.

15
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,840
In fact, I'm a few years older than you.

16
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,040
Just listen to me.

17
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,120
Go back.

18
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,360
Your Highness,
you've always been so decisive.

19
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,080
Why are you being evasive now?

20
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,040
You can't stay
at the Inspectorate Office forever

21
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,480
and go through these documents
until you die.

22
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,440
You still have to go back and meet him
sooner or later.

23
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,920
Do you think

24
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,800
that I am now indecisive

25
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,960
and unlikable?

26
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,120
If I go back now,

27
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,840
this is the kind of person
Pei Wenxuan will meet.

28
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,880
So what?

29
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,080
Anyway, Pei Wenxuan adores you.

30
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,440
And you also care about him.

31
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,840
Who said so?

32
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,280
Your Highness, before this,

33
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,520
have you ever fed anyone soup?

34
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,280
Have you ever attended to anyone?

35
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,400
Have you ever tried

36
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,600
to care about anyone else's feelings?

37
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,520
Have you ever cared

38
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,160
that someone might like you
or otherwise?

39
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,280
Do you really not care about him?

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,400
Back when the assassins
tried to kill you,

41
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,160
you told me to do nothing about it.

42
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,080
But when they tried to kill Pei Wenxuan,

43
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,480
you actually finished them off.

44
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,400
And now, even though it's too risky
to kill Xie Lanqing,

45
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,640
but in order to warn them

46
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,480
and avenge the Prince Consort...

47
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,200
How dare you.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,040
Your Highness, if you keep up like this,

49
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,720
you're pushing everyone who loves you

50
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,600
and whom you love away.

51
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,360
Have you really thought

52
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,800
about how you want to lead your life?

53
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,960
I have thought clearly.

54
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,320
I don't need anyone to care about me.

55
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,040
I have wealth and power.

56
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,880
I can keep anyone I like by my side

57
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,480
and ensure that the people I care
can live a good life.

58
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,760
That's what I want.

59
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,560
Also...

60
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,360
how I will live my life

61
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,080
is not up to you to tell me.

62
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,560
I understand.

63
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,600
You think that everything

64
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,800
needs a result.

65
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,840
Pei Wenxuan is trying
to force me to give him an answer,

66
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,120
and now you're doing the same thing.

67
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,720
Yes, he's right.

68
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,520
I don't want to make any effort

69
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,880
while hoping that he could stay.

70
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,680
This is what selfishness is.

71
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,280
No matter how nice I treat him,

72
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,840
if I can't give him what he wants,

73
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,600
I'll need to make everything clear
and keep nothing for myself.

74
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,240
What happened today is my fault.

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,120
I have been evading
his feelings all this time.

76
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,480
That's why I always assume the worst.

77
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,240
Had I been more mindful,

78
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,520
I wouldn't have hurt him,

79
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,200
so I should be apologizing

80
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,200
and explaining everything to him.

81
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,080
I shouldn't presume
that what I do is best for him,

82
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,520
and assume

83
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,440
that by doing so, I can make up
for what he has done for me.

84
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,400
I should give him whatever he wants,

85
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,400
and if I can't,
I should tell him clearly.

86
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,440
Your Highness, why have you
never thought

87
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,960
about being with him for real?

88
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,200
Your Highness, we're here.

89
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,280
Why have you never thought

90
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
about being with Pei Wenxuan for real?

91
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,520
Rong, remember

92
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,880
that in the face of power,
all love and affection

93
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,320
are as transient as a fleeting cloud.

94
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,200
It will be gone very fast.

95
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,960
I am a bit worried about her.

96
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,640
Who is she to you?

97
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,440
My childhood friend.

98
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,760
Your Highness?

99
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,320
Got it.

100
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,760
Your Highness, you're back.

101
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,400
You haven't gone to sleep yet?

102
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,960
I have a slight wound.

103
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,240
I'll need to get up at night
and change my redressing.

104
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,880
I'm afraid I may disturb you,

105
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
so I'm planning

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,200
to sleep at the study
starting from tonight.

107
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,160
I hope you'll approve my request.

108
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,200
It's getting late and cold.

109
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,360
Your Highness, you should get some rest.

110
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,120
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,120
In the past,

112
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,960
I didn't make myself clear to you.

113
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,640
I was being evasive.

114
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,240
It's my fault.

115
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,160
I let you down today.

116
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,400
It's my fault as well.

117
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,160
Your Highness, don't take it to heart.

118
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,560
Everything is my own decision.

119
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,400
Whether you accept it or not,

120
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,400
that's up to you,

121
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,320
and there's no right or wrong.

122
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,880
Today...

123
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,120
I must have offended you.

124
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,440
I hope you'll forgive me, Your Highness.

125
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,640
Have you really thought

126
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,040
about how you want to live your life?

127
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,640
Your Highness, you want a good life.

128
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,800
You don't want to live the way you did.

129
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,040
You want the Crown Prince to be happy.

130
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,440
You want a complete family.

131
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,000
You want to find someone
with whom you love each other.

132
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,600
You want to be surrounded by children.

133
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,040
You want someone who you can rely on

134
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,840
and keep you company as you age.

135
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,560
Right?

136
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,960
Pei Wenxuan.

137
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,720
Can you...

138
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,480
Can you wait for me a little longer?

139
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,800
I know

140
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm not very likable.

141
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,000
Especially when it comes
to romantic relationships,

142
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,560
you could find me abhorrent.

143
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,760
I am unable to trust you

144
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,040
and even myself.

145
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,160
But that doesn't mean
I can't feel your kindness towards me.

146
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,200
I didn't mean to hold off
on giving you an answer.

147
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,880
I know how to show love well.

148
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,320
But I can do none of them.

149
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,440
I just can't...

150
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,200
let my guard down completely
and hand over my heart to someone else.

151
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,800
That's why I need

152
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
to constantly confirm
that you won't leave.

153
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,280
Still, despite my flaws,

154
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,920
can you just...

155
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,600
even if it's just a dream,

156
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,920
fate has brought us together

157
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,680
after so many tribulations...

158
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,440
so can you wait for me?

159
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,200
Please don't go.

160
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,720
Forget it.

161
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,320
You must find this ridiculous.

162
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,040
Don't take what I said seriously.

163
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,560
Just...

164
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,520
Just follow your heart.

165
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,560
You can leave if you want to.

166
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,200
Rong.

167
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,440
It's fine.

Rong, 10 years.

169
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,520

since you're allying
yourself with my family,

230
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,960

Why should we release him?

341
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,680
Release him secretly.

342
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,320

Your Highness,

348
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,600
the Xie Family's butler visited
Mingyue Palace last night.

349
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,640
I'm afraid they might team up.

350
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,120
Okay, I got it.

351
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,520
Your Highness, I'm still worried

352
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,360
that if we push them too hard,

353
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,600
most of the noble families might
shift their allegiance to Prince Su.

354
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,720
Ya.

355
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,240
Do you know why my father
dotes on Consort Rou?

356
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,160
He dotes on her so much

357
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,720
to leverage over my mother, actually.

358
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,000
No matter what mistake Consort Rou

359
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,640
or Prince Su makes,

360
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,120
my father would never abandon them.

361
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,120
And when he does,

362
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,840
there would be only one reason.

363
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,120
They're no longer useful as his pawns.

364
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,000
Your Highness, I understand now.

365
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,760
I'm going to release that bait now.

366
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,080
Get some rest.

367
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,800
When you release him,

368
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,200
return all his belongings

369
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,360
to him,

370
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,520
especially the jade pendant.

371
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,280
Yes, Your Highness.

372
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,200
Sir, we've received some news.

373
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,000
Go ahead.

374
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,120
The Xie Family sent someone
to Mingyue Palace

375
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,440
to deliver a white jade hairpin.

376
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,640
A white jade hairpin?

377
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,200
Does it have any significance?

378
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,320
It's the trendiest accessory
in Huajing lately.

379
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,600
A white jade hairpin?

380
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,720
Greetings, Your Majesty.

381
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,120
You may rise.

382
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:52,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

383
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,680
I heard you have something
interesting to tell me.

384
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,400
That's right.

385
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,840
Lately, everyone in the city is enamored
with white jade hairpins.

386
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,680
They're practically sold out now.

387
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,800
White jade hairpins are nothing new.

388
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,280
Why the sudden craze?

389
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,520
It was made popular by a top courtesan
in Yizhou, who wore it on her hair.

390
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,760
Preposterous.

391
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,680
You may not know

392
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,440
that its price
is even more preposterous.

393
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,720
How much does one cost?

394
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,280
I'm afraid my yearly salary
can't even afford it.

395
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,320
Lately, there's been a plague
in the southwest,

396
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,160
and people are dying on the streets.

397
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,680
Yet, the people in the capital

398
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,200
would rather spend their money
on something superficial.

399
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,760
We need to intervene.

400
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,920
Who's selling the hairpins?

401
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,320
Well...

402
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,120
What is it?

403
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,160
As an imperial censor,

404
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,080
you should dare say everything.

405
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,000
It's the Xie Family.

406
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,600
I want the Censorate

407
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,120
to discuss this issue tomorrow
in the morning court.

408
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

409
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,750
[Mingyue Palace]

410
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,160
Father, I don't understand

411
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,800
what I have done wrong.

412
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,000
Someone!

413
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,240
Lock this ignorant girl up!

414
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,680
Only release her when she realizes

415
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,680
the error of her ways!

416
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,680
Father, the hairpin is a gift...

417
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,680
Huayue!

418
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,760
Please forgive her, Your Majesty.

419
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,760
I have spoiled her.

420
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,320
Reflect on your wrongdoings, go!

421
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,920
Your Majesty, Huayue is still young.

422
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,360
It's my fault...

423
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,880
Do you take me as a fool?

424
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,640
Do you think this hairpin
is really for Huayue?

425
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,920
Remember.

426
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,760
If you behave like those people,

427
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,280
I will never

428
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,120
visit your palace again!

429
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,240
Your Majesty, I won't socialize
with the noble families again.

430
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,760
You'd better not.

431
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,960
Young Master, Her Highness

432
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,760
had some rest in the morning
in the study,

433
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,240
then had her meal,

434
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,920
and later returned to her room.

435
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,280
Who did this?

436
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,200
It wasn't me.

437
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,720
Her Highness was here alone
in the morning today.

438
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,840
This shows

439
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,320
that Her Highness
is still emotionally unstable.

440
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,520
Did she invite me to eat with her?

441
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,320
No. You wish.

442
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,560
Eat with her?

443
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,520
Young Master, listen to me.

444
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,240
Stop playing coy.

445
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,920
Go and talk to her now.

446
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,360
You need to ease your relationship...

447
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,120
No need.

448
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,480
It's all part of my strategy.

449
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,960
More strategies?

450
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,080
My current strategy

451
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,480
is to get a good night's sleep.

452
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,840
Come on, help me cover the quilt.

453
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,640
You can just be like this.

454
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,560
The coldness will wake you up.

455
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,160
Pei Wenxuan is getting
more and more impudent.

456
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,480
He didn't even come to say good night.

457
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,160
What is he up to now?

458
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,320
Forget it.

459
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,240
The security here is actually so lax.

460
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,120
I should find an opportunity
to remind him.

461
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,640
I thought it was a cat
scratching the windows,

462
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,440
so I got up to check.

463
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,080
I didn't expect to see

464
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,200
such a huge cat.

465
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,640
You are wrong.

466
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,320
It's a little wildcat
that is nothing but ferocious.

467
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,800
You'd better be careful, Mr. Pei.

468
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,920
Your Highness,
if you want me to go back,

469
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,960
you could have just said so.

470
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,120
Aren't you afraid of catching a cold,
coming here late at night?

471
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,960
I couldn't pay you for those buttercups.

472
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,520
So you're still angry at me, aren't you?

473
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,720
I'm not angry.

474
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,920
But you're ignoring me.

475
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,160
I'm not ignoring you.

476
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,560
You are.

477
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,680
You'd rather sleep in a separate room.

478
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,960
That's because you told me

479
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,040
to wait for you.

480
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,480
So, I thought

481
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,800
I should give you some privacy.

482
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,200
I was also thinking

483
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,000
that I should let you decide

484
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,360
how our relationship should be like.

485
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,080
I'm fine with sleeping in the study.

486
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,280
It's just quite cold here.

487
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,400
Stop deliberately
saying something like this.

488
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,720
I finally understand

489
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,360
that you're just playing

490
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,240
hard to get.

491
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,080
You're putting on an act, aren't you?

492
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,080
Just to set me up.

493
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,720
How am I playing hard to get?

494
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,240
Everything I say is true

495
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,400
and comes from my heart.

496
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,520
They're all from your heart?

497
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,560
Fine.

498
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,320
No, I'm wrong.

499
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,000
From your heart?

500
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,040
They're all fake.

501
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,240
I'm so happy

502
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,680
that you would come here to see me.

503
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,440
I'm sleeping here

504
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,800
so that you would care about me.

505
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,800
If you want me to go back,

506
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,800
just tell me,

507
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,600
and I'll go back for your reputation.

508
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,240
For my reputation?

509
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,920
Come back with me then.

510
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,600
Alright.

511
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,360
Quickly.

512
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,320
They look like Young Master
and Her Highness.

513
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,760
I must be getting really sleepy.

514
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,320
It's so comfortable to sleep here.

515
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,240
I need to ask you something.

516
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,680
Huayue got slapped
by my father yesterday.

517
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,040
Was it your doing?

518
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,200
I only told him

519
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,160
about the skyrocketing price
of the white jade hairpin.

520
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,360
The Xie Family owns
a white jade mine in Kunzhou.

521
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,200
They have jade shops all over the place,

522
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,520
most famous for their
white jade hairpins.

523
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,280
However, it's not easy to get one.

524
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,140
Not only are they expensive,

525
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,400
but it depends
on the buyer's status too.

526
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,640
Given Consort Rou's family background,

527
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,240
even if Huayue

528
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,560
can afford to buy one,

529
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,720
the Xie Family might not
sell one to her.

530
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,200
That's why

531
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,920
my father's slap wasn't
just meant for Huayue,

532
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,960
but also Consort Rou.

533
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,680
More importantly,

534
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,360
my father is getting
suspicious of Consort Rou,

535
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,280
that she might be colluding
with the noble families.

536
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,280
Your eyes are filled
with your admiration of me.

537
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,600
That's not admiration.

538
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,960
I'm just thinking
that you're as witty as a devil,

539
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,920
and that's very unsettling.

540
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,640
You're unsettled by that?

541
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,560
Mr. Pei, what other secrets do you have

542
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,840
that I don't know?

543
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,640
Pray tell.

544
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,640
I've got lots of secrets
that you don't know.

545
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,520
Madam Shangguan.

546
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,480
You may leave now.

547
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,360
They will change shifts with you.

548
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,040
But, Mr. Su ordered us
to stand guard here.

549
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,360
What is he saying?

550
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,360
It's just a regular change of shift.

551
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,600
Don't you want to rest?

552
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,160
Thank you for your concern.

553
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,800
Let's go.

554
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,320
Your Highness, it's time to get up.

555
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,720
I may leave for now.

556
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,720
What's going on?

557
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,080
I was still careless.

558
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,440
I forgot to tell her not
to wake me up today.

559
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:24,720
Your Highness!

560
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,280
Your Highness, bad news!

561
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,200
Your Highness, please forgive me!

562
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,040
I don't want to come in,

563
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,680
but my young master is missing!

564
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,440
He may have run away!
We need to go and find him now!

565
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,920
What's all that yelling for?
I'm right here.

566
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,440
Who's that?

567
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,560
Why is there a man talking here?

568
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,040
It's your young master, Pei Wenxuan.

569
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,080
Sorry for disturbing you!

570
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,880
Oh my.

571
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,400
I took the blame for you this time.

572
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,560
You should give me credit for that.

573
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,480
Sure, I will.

574
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,760
Alright, let's get some more sleep.

575
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,640
You can still sleep?

576
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,680
I'm so sleepy.

577
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,880
Let's sleep a while more.

578
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,920
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

579
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,800
- Mr. Pei.
- Mr. Pei.

580
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,760
The Prince Consort is taking over

581
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,360
the military provisions and funds case
as His Majesty has commanded.

582
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,680
Cooperate with the Prince Consort

583
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,440
like how you usually cooperate with me.

584
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,760
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

585
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,560
- Yes, Mr. Pei.
- Yes, Mr. Pei.

586
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,640
By the way,
while you were investigating,

587
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,880
didn't Su Ronghua try to stop you?

588
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,120
The Su Family wouldn't
do something recklessly,

589
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,120
including Su Ronghua himself.

590
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,640
Actually, I don't understand

591
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,560
why you're so confident
in the Su Family.

592
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,840
Do you know...

593
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,800
when I first met

594
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,920
Su Rongqing?

595
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,720
Look, Father.

596
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,320
I've got a bamboo-copter. It can fly!

597
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,120
I want to have wings when I grow up

598
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,120
so I can fly to the most
beautiful places in the Great Xia!

599
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,240
Your Majesty, Mr. Su is here.

600
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,160
Greetings, Your Majesty.

601
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,520
You may rise.

602
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,840
Your Majesty, I implore you
to rescind your command

603
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,960
and not to start a war in the north.

604
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,040
I, Su Rongqing, hope that you would
rescind your command too, Your Majesty.

605
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,720
Let the war end
so that the people can rehabilitate.

606
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,720
You may rise.

607
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,680
Thank you, Your Majesty.

608
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:52,920
Fulai.

609
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,480
Bring the children out to play.

610
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,720
I need to talk to Minister Su.

611
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

612
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,400
Go.

613
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,360
Why do you come to visit my father?

614
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,000
Because he wants
to conquer the northern lands,

615
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,120
and I have to stop him.

616
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,000
But, Father said

617
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,680
that the war
is to beat the bad people up.

618
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,440
Why do you want to stop him?

619
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,360
We have already reclaimed
our lost territorial lands,

620
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,440
and if the war continues,
we'll be invading other nations.

621
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,800
If we win,

622
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,360
the credit goes to the Emperor.

623
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,280
However, the Emperor's achievements

624
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,000
will be achieved by the lives
of the common people.

625
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,680
The South has been experiencing
three years of drought.

626
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,200
The people are suffering.

627
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,120
Rather than starting a war
to conquer foreign enemies in the north,

628
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,640
I hope we can implement policies
that benefit the people,

629
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,880
ensuring that the common people
won't suffer from hunger.

630
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,000
Aren't you afraid

631
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,800
that my father might flog you

632
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,960
or even kill you if you provoke him?

633
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,200
What's so scary about death?

634
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,360
The Su Family

635
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,360
has always lived
and fought for the country.

636
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,600
Actually...

637
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,760
But...

638
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,360
it's not them who are bad,

639
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,440
but the will of others.

640
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,080
A big family like theirs

641
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,240
is bound to have someone
who harbors an evil intention.

642
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,320
Still, I will hold them in respect.

643
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,360
They've got their bottom line,

644
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,200
and it will be fine if I don't cross it.

645
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,840
Tong.

646
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,600
Jinglan, you scared me.

647
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,120
I don't understand.

648
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,920
When Her Highness and the Prince Consort

649
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,520
just got married,

650
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,680
they were such a sweet couple.

651
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,040
Then, they started sleeping
in separate rooms.

652
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,040
But now...

653
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,000
I don't understand what's going on.

654
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,840
This is probably their strategy.

655
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,000
The harder it is for them to meet,

656
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,160
the more they long for each other.

657
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,840
So, should we just pretend
that we don't know anything?

658
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,440
Of course, we have to.

659
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,880
Your Majesty, Princess Pingyue
hired an assassin to kill me!

660
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,360
Please seek justice for me!

661
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,800
Do you have any evidence?

662
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,120
Fortunately,

663
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,160
I was blessed by your grace

664
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,400
to capture the assassin.

665
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,520
I have solid evidence!

666
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,640
Summon Pingyue here now!

667
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

668
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,760
Is everything going well
with the Prince Consort?

669
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,320
Yes.

670
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,160
Send some pastries over to him.

671
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,320
Sure.

672
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,720
Tell him not to get too tired.
You may go now.

673
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,840
Your Highness, bad news!

674
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,560
What is it?

675
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,320
Lin Feibai failed and was captured.

676
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:08,920
What a pity.

677
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,560
Your Highness,
you need to come up with a plan now.

678
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,800
Xie Lanqing will definitely
make an issue of it.

679
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,880
Prepare the evidence that shows

680
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,680
how they tried to kill me.

681
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,640
Your Highness, I don't understand.

682
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,800
Why did you order Lin Feibai

683
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,160
to assassinate Xie Lanqing?

684
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,160
He's the Minister of Justice.

685
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,400
It's hard to get him killed.

686
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,360
Now that Lin Feibai is caught alive,

687
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,360
if he gave you away,

688
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,280
and given the fact that you're
already in so much trouble,

689
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,480
even His Majesty
might not be able to save you.

690
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,800
You're planning to threaten him
with your knowledge of his stronghold?

691
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,800
But Lin Feibai is no fool.

692
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,000
Would he actually
be threatened by that?

693
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,080
He's the one who sees me as a fool,

694
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,120
scheming with Xie Lanqing
to throw me off.

695
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,240
There are many possibilities
for this assassination.

696
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,520
Given how cunning Xie Lanqing is,

697
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,520
he'd prepare a backup plan.

698
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,080
Since you know that,

699
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,000
why did you get him to kill Xie Lanqing?

700
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,840
I only have two choices.

701
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,720
If I believe him,

702
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,320
I'll fall into their trap.

703
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,720
But if I don't,

704
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,320
I'll never be able to trap Xie Lanqing.

705
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,240
By ordering Lin Feibai
to kill Xie Lanqing, I've actually

706
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,680
offered Xie Lanqing an opportunity
to accuse me of that in court.

707
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,720
And by doing so,

708
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,440
he'll have to come out from the dark.

709
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,280
That gives me the chance
to sink my fangs into him.

710
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,360
So, your fangs are...

711
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,960
Really?

712
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,840
Absolutely.

713
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,870
[Hanqiu Palace]

714
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,200
Greetings, Father.

715
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,520
Skip the formalities.

716
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,920
Minister Xie said

717
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,760
you sent this assassin to kill him.

718
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,120
Do you plead guilty?

719
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,640
Father,

720
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,560
I'd like to ask him a few questions.

721
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,560
Permission granted.

722
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,760
You said

723
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,760
I ordered you to kill Mr. Xie.

724
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,160
So, please tell me

725
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,760
how I found you

726
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,920
and how I ordered you to do so.

727
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,000
I am an assassin for hire.

728
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,520
Half a month ago,

729
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,640
Her Highness came to me with a painting

730
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,960
and hired me to kill
a high-ranked official.

731
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,840
Although Her Highness
was wearing a veil

732
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,600
and I couldn't see her face,

733
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,040
I could remember her voice.

734
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,520
You've got sharp ears.

735
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,120
What happened next?

736
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,960
Then, I followed my employer's request

737
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,360
and went to Butterfly Gorge
to kill the man in the painting.

738
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,600
Then, I was ambushed

739
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,040
and thrown into prison

740
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,600
in the Inspectorate Office.

741
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,040
It was there

742
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,760
that I saw the Princess.

743
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,040
After hearing her voice, I knew

744
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,160
that she was the one

745
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,040
who hired me to kill Mr. Xie.

746
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,800
I immediately realized

747
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,800
that the Princess
staged this whole show.

748
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,040
The Princess knew
I was a capable killer,

749
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,680
so she asked me to kill Mr. Xie.

750
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,240
Otherwise,

751
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,200
she'd accuse me of assassinating her,
then have my head chopped off.

752
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,400
Nice story.

753
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,080
Looks like he's prepared.

754
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,480
Is he speaking the truth?

755
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,280
Father, I'd like you

756
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,040
and the other officials here

757
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,320
to observe this man and Mr. Xie.

758
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,120
Don't they look rather similar?

759
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,840
After taking a closer look...

760
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,920
They do look quite similar.

761
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,920
What do you mean?

762
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,520
Father.

763
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,320
Here's the truth.

764
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,200
Half a month ago,
I received a threatening kite

765
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,120
with the word "stop" written in red.

766
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,920
That same evening,

767
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,040
someone tried to assassinate
the Prince Consort.

768
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,360
Your Majesty,

769
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,040
Her Highness ordered me
to investigate this item.

770
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,680
[Stop]
We found out that the red ink used

771
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,680
comes from a stationery shop
in the capital

772
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,160
called Huiming Shop
that caters to the nobility.

773
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,040
I've investigated

774
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,360
their recent accounts
for this half year,

775
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,400
and the Xie Family
is one of their customers.

776
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,160
Of course,

777
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,840
this fact itself

778
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,760
is not enough to prove

779
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,440
that Mr. Xie is related to this case.

780
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,320
The situation back then

781
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,000
was that the enemies were in the dark
while I was in the open.

782
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,040
It was impossible to defend effectively.

783
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,920
That's why I planned to draw them out

784
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,000
by announcing that the Prince Consort

785
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,120
and I would be out on an excursion.

786
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,480
We set up an ambush at Butterfly Gorge,

787
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,760
using myself as bait,

788
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,480
and we caught
a group of assassins alive,

789
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,640
which included this man.

790
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,400
Upon investigation,

791
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,080
this man is adept
at using Seven-star Darts.

792
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,960
He is the Deputy Sect Leader
of the top assassin organization

793
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,720
in the martial world,
Seven-star Sect.

794
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,400
During my investigation,

795
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,200
I found something on him.

796
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,240
What are you doing?

797
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,120
Why are you scared?

798
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,320
