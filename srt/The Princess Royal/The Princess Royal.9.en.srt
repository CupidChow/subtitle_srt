[Episode 9]

6
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,740
What's the point of talking

7
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,020
to a dying man?

8
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,380
Only a dying person

9
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,140
will tell you why they are dying.

10
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,380
You will then know

11
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,260
how to avoid dying like that

12
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,740
and how to help others

13
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,140
avoid dying like that.

14
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,140
Didn't you already know all that?

15
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,300
Did you live those forty years
for nothing?

16
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,060
Li Rong,

17
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,620
you always tell me

18
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,020
that people like you and Su Rongqing

19
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,780
have no true feelings,
but only selfishness.

20
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,900
But not everyone in the court

21
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,540
is willing to take risks

22
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,780
out of a sense of compassion

23
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,300
to cover a condemned person's body.

24
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,980
So, not everything said

25
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,500
is necessarily true,

26
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,900
while some words,
even if they seem like jokes,

27
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,380
aren't always lies.

28
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,820
For example?

29
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,900
For example,

30
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,620
even though I may seem like I'm joking,

31
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,100
I really do

32
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,060
need some money.

33
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,580
Honestly.

34
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,140
I have to say,

35
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,300
you have no shame
when it comes to asking me for money.

36
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,060
I want to rebuild the dark web.

37
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,740
Whatever amount you give me now,

38
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,500
I'll repay double in the future.

39
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,060
Do you want to make this deal or not?

40
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,460
If you need anything,

41
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,460
go straight to the Princess's Mansion
and talk to the superintendent.

42
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,580
Just so you know,

43
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,340
I don't have much money right now.

44
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,340
My assets are limited,
so don't ask for too much.

45
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,740
It seems that marrying the princess
isn't all that great.

46
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,900
I wonder if the other princesses

47
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,500
might be wealthier.

48
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,260
Then go marry other princesses.

49
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:33,940
Give it to me.

50
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,660
Give it back.

51
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,220
I know I'm good-looking,

52
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,420
but don't take advantage of me.

53
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,540
You are truly shameless.

54
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,140
Haven't you known me long enough?

55
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,500
You rascal.

56
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,420
Alright,

57
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,020
Your Highness, you can stop here.

58
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,060
I need to head back now.

59
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,220
Who said I was seeing you off?

60
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,650
If you spend
even one copper coin of mine,

61
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,700
you better record it.

62
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,740
I'll check the accounts.

63
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,420
Li Rong.

64
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,460
Speak.

65
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,140
If there's a next time,

66
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,420
I'll still stand in front of you.

67
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,380
It's always good
to have someone to protect you.

68
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,940
I take my leave now.

69
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,100
Your Highness.

70
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,540
Let's go. I want to see my father.

71
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,540
Yes, Your Highness.

72
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:46,860
Rong, you've lost weight.

73
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,500
How could I not lose weight

74
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,620
in a place like that?

75
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,140
What? Are you still blaming me?

76
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,860
No,

77
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,820
I understand. You care a lot about me.

78
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,980
If you could help, you would.

79
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,820
This time,
it's the Yang Family who went too far,

80
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,980
and you had no choice, Father.

81
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,500
You've grown up

82
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,340
and become more understanding.

83
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,980
There's nothing hard
to understand about this.

84
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,310
As soon as Pei Wenxuan
explained it to me,

85
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,780
I understood.

86
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,500
Were you and Pei Wenxuan
locked up together?

87
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,060
Yes.

88
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,460
Fortunately, he was there.

89
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,020
Otherwise,
I would be scared to death alone.

90
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,780
You've spent some time together now.

91
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,940
What do you think of him?

92
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,020
He

93
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,820
is quite good,

94
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,220
just as you said before.

95
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,260
Today in the court,

96
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,500
I didn't announce
your marriage with Pei Wenxuan

97
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,640
because I thought it was not auspicious

98
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,660
to discuss marriage
after seeing bloodshed.

99
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,260
Later, I will have
the decree of marriage

100
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,380
sent to the Pei's Mansion.

101
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,860
In the future, when you're married
and have established your own household,

102
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,620
you'll have to make your own decisions
in all matters.

103
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,260
So I can't live in the palace anymore?

104
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,260
Which princess
lives in the palace forever?

105
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,500
After you get married in the future,

106
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,220
you must live well.

107
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,980
I intend to set the wedding date
on the third of next month.

108
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,460
What do you think?

109
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,140
I'll abide by your wishes, Father.

110
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,500
I'll ask the Ministry of Rites
to make two new bridal gowns.

111
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,620
You can pick one later.

112
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,020
Okay.

113
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,700
Young master, be careful not to slip.

114
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,860
They just splashed some water here.

115
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,100
Careful.

116
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,620
Young Master Pei.

117
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,940
Ms. Tong, why are you here?

118
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,180
Mr Pei,

119
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,020
I have been waiting for you
for nearly two months.

120
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,300
Today, upon hearing
that you have returned,

121
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,060
I specifically waited here for you.

122
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,140
If there's anything,
you can discuss it with me.

123
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,260
Young Master, you should go back.

124
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,340
Why have you been waiting for me?

125
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,180
Mr. Pei,

126
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,140
it's been two months
since you rented that carriage.

127
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,100
The bill hasn't been settled yet.

128
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,860
I don't mean to trouble you,

129
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,740
but rules are rules.

130
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,300
Why don't you settle the bill today?

131
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:05,860
Okay.

132
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,900
I asked you to give us a couple more...

133
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,420
How much is it?

134
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,020
Exactly twenty taels.

135
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,100
How much is it again?

136
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,340
Twenty taels?

137
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,900
Why did the price go up?

138
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:17,980
Hey, let me tell you,

139
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,020
my young master
just came out of prison.

140
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,340
His monthly salary,

141
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,420
minus necessary expenses,

142
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,340
leaves only two taels.

143
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,100
We need to eat...

144
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,540
Enough.

145
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,620
If you don't have money,

146
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,660
then don't ride
in such a fancy carriage.

147
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,980
Stop pretending to be wealthy.

148
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,100
Watch your words!

149
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,540
My young master is a wealthy man.

150
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,540
How can you look down
on others like a rogue?

151
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,980
Who are you calling a rogue?

152
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,180
You shouldn't rent a carriage
when you have no money!

153
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,100
Just give her the money now.

154
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,220
I have no money.

155
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,260
If you don't have money,
why rent a carriage?

156
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,820
First Young Master, there's a decree.

157
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,220
What decree?

158
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,540
People from the palace have arrived.

159
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,590
Master, Madam, and other young masters
from our residence

160
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,780
have all gathered together.

161
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,300
It seems like something big
is happening.

162
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:50,900
Young Master.

163
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,660
Sir, everyone
from the Pei Family is here now.

164
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:01,900
Please start.

165
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,180
Pei Wenxuan,
get ready to receive the decree.

166
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,820
Please kneel.

167
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,300
Pei Wenxuan,
the eldest son of the Pei Family,

168
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:23,020
is gentle and knowledgeable,

169
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,420
possessing great wisdom
and deep righteousness.

170
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,660
I personally am pleased
to hear of this.

171
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,540
Therefore,
I shall betroth Princess Pingyue to him.

172
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,420
Master Pei, please take this decree.

173
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,900
I will now return to the palace
to report to His Majesty.

174
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,260
Okay.

175
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,900
Receiving His Majesty's marriage decree

176
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,740
is a great blessing.

177
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,900
Take good care
of the princess in the future

178
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,260
and uphold the propriety
of the Pei Family.

179
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,100
Understand?

180
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,660
You may all leave now.

181
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,620
This is great.

182
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,580
Wenxuan, come with me.

183
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,860
Did you know about His Majesty's decree
of marriage beforehand?

184
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,540
Yes.

185
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,180
Being a Prince Consort isn't easy,
you know.

186
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,660
Have some tea first.

187
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,540
Please have some tea first.

188
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,140
Mother, as for this matter,

189
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,780
it's my voluntary choice.

190
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,780
I asked for her hand myself.

191
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,820
You asked for her hand yourself?

192
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,860
Why seek a princess

193
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,660
to be your wife for no reason?

194
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,340
She's really a good person.

195
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,100
You'll see for yourself
when you meet her.

196
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,780
Stop comforting me.

197
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,300
You are just like your father.

198
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,740
How could it be possible

199
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,140
for you to fall for someone so easily?

200
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,220
Do you think I don't know
what's on your mind?

201
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,620
I couldn't stop your second uncle
from talking nonsense at the Qin Family,

202
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,100
causing them to cancel the engagement.

203
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,220
It's all my fault.

204
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,620
Now you're here comforting me.

205
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,740
Mother, I am not just consoling you.

206
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,580
Every word I say is true.

207
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,060
I really

208
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,100
put in a lot of effort
to marry this girl.

209
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,180
You...

210
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,580
You didn't lie to me?

211
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,220
Why would I lie to you?

212
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,620
It's true that I've never seen you
send a letter to Qin Zhenzhen

213
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,180
because you missed her.

214
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,500
You always behaved properly
in front of her.

215
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,340
You acted exactly the same before her

216
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,380
and others.

217
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,300
I don't see you fancy her that way.

218
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,180
So according to you,

219
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,140
I have to find someone I like to tease,

220
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,500
that's the proof of me fancying her?

221
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,500
I don't know if you'd tease her.

222
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,260
But in front of your beloved,

223
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,500
you'll always

224
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,180
be like a child in this life.

225
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,100
Young  Master,
Ms. Tong is still waiting for you.

226
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,700
Ms. Tong,

227
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,540
I'll get the money for your carriage
in a couple of days.

228
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,820
Your Highness,
I'm here to apologize to you.

229
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,500
I was ignorant
and hope you can forgive me.

230
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,980
Please don't hold it against me
in the future.

231
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,260
You don't need to pay for the carriage.

232
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,740
Ms. Tong, please get up.

233
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:47,820
Rest assured.

234
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,900
My young master has already said
that he'd give you the money.

235
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,300
Thank you, Your Highness.

236
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,860
You are welcome. Right, Your Highness?

237
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,540
Speed up.

238
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,060
Be steady when you hang things up.

239
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:00,740
You haven't actually married her yet

240
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,940
and you are already
living off her mansion, huh?

241
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,780
You are...

242
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,740
Since it's Her Highness's order,

243
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,380
please come in with me to get the money.

244
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,340
Go.

245
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:15,940
Please.

246
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,700
Right on my way.

247
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,060
Young Master,
now you feel embarrassed, huh?

248
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,340
Okay.

249
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,180
Mr. Pei,

250
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,180
Her Highness
asked me to give this to you.

251
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,660
Your Majesty, I made some pear soup.

252
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,460
Please have a taste.

253
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,180
That's very thoughtful of you.

254
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:41,980
No need for that.

255
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

256
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,380
Congratulations, Your Majesty,
on removing a major source of concern.

257
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
I have already ordered your brother

258
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,020
to replace Li Chuan

259
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,700
and take command of the Northwest.

260
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,420
Thank you, Your Majesty.

261
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,780
My brother will surely give his all

262
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,460
to repay your grace.

263
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,340
This time your brother
has made great contributions.

264
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,260
If you want anything, just let me know.

265
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,860
Your Majesty,
I do have an impertinent request.

266
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,460
Although you have appointed
the eldest son of the Su Family

267
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,740
as Cheng's tutor,

268
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,380
I have heard

269
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,380
that the eldest son has been unreliable
since childhood.

270
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,180
Therefore, if I may be so bold,

271
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,860
could the eldest son of the Su Family
be replaced with the second son?

272
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,340
This matter still requires
the opinion of the Su Family.

273
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,500
Your Majesty, there is no need to worry.

274
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,820
If it is difficult, then just forget it.

275
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,420
However, you do have a point.

276
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,540
It's just that matters of the court

277
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,620
are not that simple.

278
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:49,620
Father,

279
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,900
why are you sighing?

280
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,660
Your brother

281
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,340
has caused trouble again.

282
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,540
What trouble?

283
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,460
Today, His Majesty asked someone
to sent me a message,

284
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,700
saying he wants to replace
the teacher of Prince Su

285
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,900
with you.

286
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,300
Did they mention the reason for this?

287
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,060
No.

288
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,660
But you are worried

289
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,780
that this is an intentional move
by Consort Rou to win us over,

290
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,060
while our Su Family
has always remained neutral.

291
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,020
Father,

292
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,260
I think these

293
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,980
are just rumors from others.

294
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,860
As long as we don't act
in such a way ourselves,

295
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,180
what do we have to fear?

296
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,180
So, you agreed?

297
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:48,260
I can't think of any reason to refuse.

298
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,900
I know you've never quite approved
of Consort Rou.

299
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,060
I was worried
that you'd be put in a tough spot.

300
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,580
Rongqing,

301
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,060
you've grown more mature
than I anticipated,

302
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,300
and proven more exceptional.

303
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,260
Each of these two wedding gowns
has its own appeal.

304
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,260
making it difficult for me to choose.

305
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,380
Since we are about to be married,

306
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,940
why don't you, my Prince Consort,
help me pick one?

307
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,980
Tell the Ministry of Rites that I want
the one with the phoenix pattern.

308
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,820
But didn't Mr. Pei choose the other one?

309
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,780
Actually, either one will do.

310
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,500
I'm just adopting
the process of elimination.

311
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,260
In matters like this,

312
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,290
choosing the opposite
of what a man picks

313
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:01,980
is usually the right choice.

314
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,300
It's getting harder and harder

315
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,620
to understand you youngsters.

316
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,220
After all this trouble in the Northwest,

317
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,300
the Shangguan Family
is seriously weakened,

318
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,540
and Chuan hasn't gained any credit.

319
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,940
Yet you all are so happy.

320
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,860
I seriously doubt the side

321
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,420
your husband is taking.

322
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,140
Don't worry, Mother.

323
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,500
If you find it hard to understand,

324
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,540
so will Father.

325
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,020
This is good.

326
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,420
Hide the blade until it's time to kill,

327
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,180
then one can strike to kill
with one blow.

328
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,020
That's if you have a blade first.

329
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,660
While your uncle
has helped us this time,

330
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,300
he's also made a request.

331
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,220
He wants Ya
to be Chuan's Crown Princess.

332
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,340
Do you remember Ya?

333
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,300
You met her when you were kids.

334
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,380
I do remember.

335
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,860
I thought
she went back to Youzhou long ago?

336
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,860
She'll be back soon enough.

337
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,740
Chuan is no longer a kid.

338
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,300
I plan to select consorts
for him next year.

339
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,900
Ya would definitely
be the Crown Princess.

340
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,740
I want to get him
another three secondary consorts.

341
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,140
Help me take a look.

342
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,900
It would be best if two of them
are from military families.

343
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,980
Chuan'er doesn't hold military power,

344
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,900
which is always a weakness.

345
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,940
This one will do.

346
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,860
The princess's marriage
is surrounded by complex traditions

347
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,300
and the wedding
is scheduled for tomorrow.

348
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,580
Pei Wenxuan

349
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,980
is probably quite exhausted now.

350
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,580
- Mr. Pei.
- Mr. Pei.

351
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,380
No, it's Prince Consort Pei now.

352
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,980
You are about to get married.

353
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,100
I wish you two, the virtuous couple,
a harmonious union

354
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,340
and a lifetime of happiness together.

355
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,740
Thank you for your kind words
and support.

356
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,820
Congratulations.

357
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,100
Here is the wedding gift money.

358
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,020
It's my hometown's tradition.

359
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,820
Thank you.

360
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,740
Here's some more for you too.

361
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:33,940
Thank you.

362
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,420
Mr. Su.

363
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:42,900
Mr. Pei.

364
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,180
Could it be that you don't want
to give me this wedding gift money?

365
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,300
Not at all.

366
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,660
I just didn't expect

367
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,460
to see you here.

368
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,740
Aren't you working today?

369
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,300
I was just passing by

370
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,220
and saw everyone here,

371
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,500
so I thought I'd join in the fun.

372
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,460
Is the wedding gift money not enough?

373
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,530
As the Prince Consort,

374
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,220
I, of course, will prepare
enough wedding gift money.

375
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,140
I wish you
a lifetime of happiness together.

376
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,020
Thank you.

377
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,500
After getting married,

378
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,130
you must make sure to draw

379
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,540
clear boundaries
with other young ladies.

380
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,940
Don't disappoint the princess.

381
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,940
This is a private family matter.

382
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,780
Mr. Su, you need not worry about it.

383
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,540
Certainly.

384
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,300
I take my leave.

385
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:49,980
Mr. Su,

386
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,980
I have a matter to consult with you.

387
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,300
If your wife's position

388
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,140
is in conflicts
with your family's position,

389
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,620
whose side will you take?

390
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:06,860
Mr. Pei,

391
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,540
it sounds like
you're seeking advice here.

392
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,300
If there's a conflict
between the princess and your family,

393
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,740
you must endure it.

394
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,460
Mr. Su,

395
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,060
what if reconciliation is impossible,

396
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,980
and the conflict
is an either-or situation?

397
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,780
I will stand

398
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,780
with whoever is in the right.

399
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,500
Shouldn't you prioritize
your family more?

400
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,260
In your heart,

401
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:47,260
is the wife not considered family?

402
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,060
You are right, Mr. Su.

403
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,100
My wife is my family.

404
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:57,980
Goodbye.

405
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,020
Your Highness,
you've been traveling for so long.

406
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,020
Why not take a rest at the inn ahead?

407
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,780
My sister's wedding is approaching

408
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,060
and I must attend.

409
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,140
Mr. Pei.

410
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,820
Jingmei? Why are you here?

411
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,300
Here's the message from Her Highness.

412
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,780
[To Pei Wenxuan. From Li Rong]

413
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,740
Tomorrow's wedding rituals
are complicated with many details.

414
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,300
Don't embarrass me.

415
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,700
If you mess it up,

416
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,140
I won't even give you the chance
to jump into the lake yourself.

417
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,860
I'll have you directly thrown in it.

418
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,060
If there's nothing else, Mr. Pei,

419
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,780
please go back and get prepared first.

420
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:01,780
Jingmei,

421
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,860
help me pass a message to Her Highness.

422
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,260
Tell her

423
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,700
that I have a gift for her,

424
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,500
probably something
she has been eagerly anticipating.

425
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,980
When we meet tomorrow,

426
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,580
she mustn't overreact
and thank me too much.

427
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,580
His words

428
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,100
give me a foreboding feeling.

429
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,300
Just wait and see, Your Highness.

430
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,820
There might really be a surprise.

431
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,140
You should rest early today.

432
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,540
You'll find out at the wedding tomorrow.

433
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:37,860
Rong.

434
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,700
Chuan.

435
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,300
I made it at last.

436
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,260
Let me take a look at you.

437
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,380
Your skin has gotten darker,

438
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,340
but you've also grown stronger.

439
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,700
Rong,

440
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,060
I can protect you from now on.

441
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,700
What's wrong?

442
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,060
My dearest sister
is marrying Pei Wenxuan.

443
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,100
That rascal has really hit the jackpot.

444
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,620
After this experience,

445
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,340
you should believe in his strategy.

446
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,500
Looking across
the entire Great Xia Dynasty,

447
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,700
I must be the only woman

448
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,980
to marry the same man twice.

Princess Pingyue embodies
kindness and purity.

Her virtuous deeds
are adorned with grace.

456
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,390
Pei Wenxuan,
the noble son of the Pei Family,

457
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,980
exemplifies amicability and benevolence.

458
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,580
He is endowed with exceptional talents.

Today, Princess Pingyue is married
to the young master of the Pei Family.

460
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,500
All officials celebrate
and the entire nation hears of it.

This is presented to the heavens
and announced to the gods.

A perfect couple ordained by fate
are to be wedded.

We are all here to witness the princess
wed the talented young gentleman.

464
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,020
In solemn unity, they exchange vows
as a pair of lovebirds.

465
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,140
On the platform, flutes are played,
attracting the soaring phoenix.

466
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,980
They are a true match made in heaven.

467
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,240
Their love will be everlasting

468
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,140
and they shall be blessed
with myriad progeny.

469
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,420
Greetings, Father and Mother.

470
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,180
Since the beginning of time,

471
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,810
the union of husband and wife

472
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,180
has marked the genesis
of humanity's bond.

473
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,500
As celebrated in the poetry
of the Zhou and Shang dynasties,

474
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,940
marriage heralds
the transformation of families.

475
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,260
On this auspicious day,

476
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,860
may you and Pei Wenxuan

477
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,460
always respect each other

478
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,820
and form a harmonious union.

479
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,860
Thank you, Father.

480
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,380
Since you are already married,

481
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,060
you should pay respects
to your husband's ancestors

482
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:48,900
and serve your parents-in-law.

483
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,020
You must be meticulous and fair

484
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,100
and fulfill your duties.

485
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,220
I hope you and Pei Wenxuan
will grow old together,

486
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,900
enjoy lifelong harmony,

487
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,380
and have a prosperous life

488
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,820
and many children.

489
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,140
Thank you for your advice, Mother.

490
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,220
Ceremony concluded.

491
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,780
Thank you.

492
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,660
Rong, promise me

493
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,700
that you will lead a good life.

494
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,180
Mother, please don't worry.

495
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,340
In the future, I will come back often
to visit you in the palace,

496
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,700
just as before.

497
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,900
Please don't be too sad

498
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:25,860
and lose your composure.

499
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:36,940
Sis,

500
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,260
in the future, you will definitely marry
the most outstanding man

501
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,340
in Huajing.

502
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,580
Thank you, Cheng.

503
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,660
I'm very happy to hear that.

504
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,140
Do you like it?

505
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:49,940
Yes.

506
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,060
I like everything you give me.

507
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,180
Rong,

508
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,340
I'll clear the road for you today.

509
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,380
Clearing the way is the duty
of the street patrol soldiers.

510
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,420
You are the Crown Prince
of our dynasty.

511
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,380
With me leading the way,

512
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,820
the Pei Family
and everyone else in the nation

513
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,980
will not dare to underestimate you.

514
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,740
I am the Princess Royal of our dynasty.

515
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,860
Who dares to underestimate me?

516
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:17,980
I don't care.

517
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,980
Please, Rong.

518
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,180
It's the Crown Prince!

519
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,260
Your Highness!

520
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:40,860
Your Highness.

521
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,620
Princess Pingyue is married to Mr. Pei.

522
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:47,100
I'll celebrate this day with you all.

523
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,260
Princess Pingyue is married to Mr. Pei.

524
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,580
I'll celebrate this day with you all.

525
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:58,260
I heard that the sons of the Pei Family
have always had conflicts.

526
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,860
Do you know
who is going to greet the bride later?

527
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,460
I heard it's the groom himself.

528
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:05,590
In our dynasty,

529
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,100
it's always the groom's brothers
who greet the bride.

530
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,860
Isn't this embarrassing?

531
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,220
It's no big deal.

532
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,340
Such situations, though rare, do happen.

533
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,140
Jingmei,

534
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,820
who did Pei Wenxuan arrange
to come pick me up?

535
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,580
I haven't heard about this.

536
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,580
Why does it feel like

537
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,540
he's going to do
something unconventional?

538
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,340
Your Highness,

539
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,220
I, Su Rongqing,

540

I feel you've been keeping something
to yourself.

727
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,260
You've changed a lot in this past year.

728
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,580
People

729
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,900
won't stay the same forever.

730
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,980
Ronghua, it's getting late.

731
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,500
You should head back soon.
Don't worry about me.

732
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:16,780
Rongqing,

733
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,540
tell me the truth.

734
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,460
Is it your own choice

735
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,940
to serve as a teacher to Prince Su?

736
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,260
Partly, I guess.

737
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,620
If you're unwilling,

738
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,780
don't force yourself.

739
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,060
I'll talk to Father about it.

740
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,020
Rong Qing,

741
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,580
you do have feelings
for Princess Pingyue,

742
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:57,740
