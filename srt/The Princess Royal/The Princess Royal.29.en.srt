[Episode 29]

5
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,340
Please, Your Highness.

6
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,580
You're here, Pingyue.

7
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,420
Greetings, Your Highness.

8
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,620
Take a seat.

9
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,260
These are my favorites.

10
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,780
Thank you, Your Highness.

11
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,060
Have some tea.

12
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,020
After you were betrothed,
you hardly came to the palace.

13
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,420
I haven't seen you in a while
and I've missed you.

14
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,500
How is it after the divorce?

15
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,340
Thank you for your concerns,
Your Highness.

16
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,620
I've been busy with my work
in the Inspectorate Office.

17
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,620
Otherwise, nothing in particular.

18
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,100
That's good.

19
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,380
I brought you here

20
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,140
for a request.

21
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,900
A person from my hometown

22
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,780
has been studying hard for ten years.

23
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,700
He finally passed the autumn examination
and became a recommended scholar.

24
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,300
He planned to take part
in this year's spring examination.

25
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,380
However, someone stole his spot.

26
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,620
He traveled all the way to Huajing

27
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,660
to file complaints.

28
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,260
Since you work
in the Inspectorate Office

29
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,620
and are appreciated by your father,

30
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,260
I asked him to go to you.

31
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,660
Did you see him?

32
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,660
By the way, his name is Chen Houzhao.

33
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,620
It seems like

34
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,940
you've met him.

35
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:17,980
Not at all.

36
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,860
Your Highness,

37
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,940
the matter you said should be handled
by the Ministry of Justice.

38
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,180
You should redirect him to them.

39
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,940
It's getting late.

40
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,540
I'll take my leave.

41
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,380
Pingyue.

42
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,700
A secret will not remain hidden forever.

43
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,380
Be more cautious
when you meet with your ex-spouse.

44
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,060
It's better not to let your father
know anything about it.

45
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,180
I suppose I should send
some women to Pei Wenxuan's way

46
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,140
in case he reconciled with Pingyue.

47
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,700
Tell Pei Wenxuan

48
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,660
to stop meeting me.

49
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,020
We're being watched.

50
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:08,780
Also,

51
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,340
change the guard posts in the mansion

52
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,260
so that Cui Yulang can come to see me.

53
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,220
Yes, Your Highness.

54
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:16,820
Go.

55
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,100
Everyone, is there anything
you'd like to report?

56
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,300
I'd like to raise an issue.

57
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,460
Say it.

58
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,140
Princess Pingyue
of the Inspectorate Office

59
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,340
refused to accept a case

60
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,980
and even expelled
the plaintiff coercively.

61
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,900
There's no such thing, Your Majesty.

62
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,980
What did she do?

63
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,900
Please elaborate.

64
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,820
Chen Houzhao, a candidate,

65
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,260
was ranked first in last year's
autumn examination in Qingcheng.

66
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,820
He was thus recommended to attend
this year's spring examination.

67
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,620
However, a local squire extorted him

68
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,700
and took his candidature. Therefore,
he couldn't take part in the exam.

69
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,700
He came to Huajing to file complaints

70
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,580
and seek a legal remedy.

71
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,260
However, his written complaint met
a dead end in the Inspectorate Office.

72
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,540
Chen Houzhao was expelled
by Her Highness

73
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,700
via a boat.

74
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:19,860
Somehow,

75
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,980
it sank the moment it left Huajing.

76
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,420
Chen Houzhao
has been missing since then.

77
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:26,860
This is

78
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,260
an egregious matter, and I hope

79
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,060
you can launch an investigation.

80
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,220
Pingyue.

81
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,460
Any explanation?

82
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,060
I...

83
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,660
I'm wronged.

84
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,620
Do you have any evidence?

85
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,740
I have eyewitnesses

86
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,180
who can be summoned at any time.

87
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,380
He did come to lodge a complaint

88
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,580
and I did receive his written complaint.

89
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,900
But before I could launch
the investigation,

90
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,300
he left the capital.

91
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,540
How could you say

92
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,180
that I forced him to leave?

93
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,060
Enough.

94
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,340
Official Wang is an important official.

95
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,820
He will not accuse you
of wrongdoing lightly.

96
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,140
Pingyue, come to the Imperial Study
after the morning court

97
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,860
to explain everything to me.

98
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,540
Yes, Your Majesty.

99
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,980
Greetings, Father.

100
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,420
Kneel.

101
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,660
Tell me.

102
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,780
Why did Chen Houzhao go missing?

103
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,740
Is he dead?

104
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,220
I do not know.

105
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,540
I know

106
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,900
what you're thinking about.

107
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,820
Answer me.

108
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,460
Why did you refuse to investigate
the imperial examination fraud?

109
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,300
The Inspectorate Office isn't for show.

110
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,100
Chen Houzhao's case reflects

111
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,700
the basis of our
talent-recruiting system.

112
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,820
Wang Houwen accused you
of murdering Chen Houzhao.

113
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,460
What do you have to say?

114
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,820
I did not kill Chen Houzhao.

115
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,780
This doesn't matter.

116
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,740
Just tell me.

117
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,820
Will you investigate
the imperial examination fraud?

118
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,620
I'd love to,

119
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,660
but...

120
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,100
I'm too scared to do it.

121
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,220
Too scared?

122
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,220
What's the use
of the Inspectorate Office anymore then?

123
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,580
You're no longer the Supervisor
of the Inspectorate Office.

124
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,500
Resign voluntarily

125
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,980
and recommend Prince Su
to take your position.

126
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,780
Father, Prince Su is...

127
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,300
Even if you don't resign,

128
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,260
as the Supervisor
of the Inspectorate Office,

129
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,420
you're not convincible.

130
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

131
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,260
Stand up.

132
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,180
You had a divorce recently.

133
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,060
Use this opportunity to rest up

134
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,980
and reflect upon yourself.

135
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,020

Rong told me that you were living
a good life in the Northwest

141

and that you even earned
some military merits by the front line.

142

I'm so glad to hear that.

143

For a few months now,

172

00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,900
and cultivate vegetables and flowers.

187
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,820
I've lived there for many years.

188
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,380
That is my home.

189
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,300
What about you, Cui?

190
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,180
I...

191
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,420
You once told me

192
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,700
about your mother's life experience.

193
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,300
It's the reason why you aren't
accepted into the Cui Family.

194
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,780
It has bothered you for many years.

195
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,180
I suppose

196
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,660
you'll want to return to them.

197
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,180
In the future,

198
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,300
we'll trade military feats
for your family's acknowledgment.

199
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,180
Your Highness,

200
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,140
the previous
Supervisor of the Inspectorate Office

201
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,580
recommended Prince Su
to take over the Office in this letter.

202
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,940
You may leave now.

203
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,260
Cui Yulang is so capable.

204
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,660
One trick and he delivers
the Inspectorate Office upon our laps.

205
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,300
How come no one has noticed
his brilliance before?

206
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,420
Mother,

207
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,500
don't you think
it's too good to be true?

208
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,700
Cheng,

209
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,300
you're overthinking it.

210
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,940
Cheng is right.

211
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,500
Everyone in this world,

212
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,500
especially those at the imperial court,

213
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,900
has their own consideration.

214
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,300
We don't know what Cui Yulang

215
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,620
wants at the moment.

216
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,020
However,

217
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,540
he got us the Inspectorate Office,

218
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,460
and thus,
I shall acknowledge his ingenuity.

219
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,580
Regardless of our stances,

220
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,140
it's a tool we can use

221
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,180
so we shall use it to our advantage.

222
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,060
In fact, Su Rongqing,

223
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,260
Cui Yulang, or the Inspectorate Office

224
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,340
make no difference.

225
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,860
Now that you have your father's support,

226
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,340
the Inspectorate Office
will be a lethal weapon.

227
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,140
But it is a double-edged sword.

228
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,420
If...

229
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,420
If one day,

230
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,740
it hurts us,

231
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,900
what do we do, Mother?

232
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,300
Cheng, you have grown up.

233
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,460
You've learned to think carefully
before you act.

234
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,460
But sometimes,

235
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,820
we just have to do it with hope

236
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,860
and try our best to achieve
what we want.

237
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,540
If we don't try,
we will never know the outcome.

238
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,260
Before one learns to swim,
one must jump into the water.

239
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,140
Don't you agree?

240
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,340
As to how far we can go,

241
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,580
only time will tell.

242
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,100
[Wenxuan's Abode]

243
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,260
So the Inspectorate Office
has a new supervisor now?

244
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,500
It must be Li Rong's plan.

245
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,260
She simply
let go of the Inspectorate Office

246
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,500
because His Majesty only regarded her
as a pawn.

247
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,260
If His Majesty did care about her
even just a little,

248
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,700
she wouldn't have lost
her position this soon.

249
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,380
Besides, she was even asked
to recommend Prince Su in person.

250
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,780
Prepare a robe for me.

251
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,100
Make sure you fumigate it with incense.

252
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:17,660
Sure.

253
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,260
Young Master, are you meeting someone
for business

254
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,700
or for love?

255
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,500
Please don't behave like this.

256
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,460
Her Highness said it wasn't
that you weren't allowed to see her.

257
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,860
It's because people are watching you.

258
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,860
How confident are you regarding my plan?

259
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,700
At this stage,

260
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,460
while Consort Rou looks indifferent,

261
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,740
I'm sure she has grown to trust me

262
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,540
after I gave her
the Inspectorate Office.

263
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,860
Since everything is in order,

264
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,260
I'll take my leave.

265
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:01,900
Go.

266
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,260
Jinglan.

267
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,500
I'm tired. Prepare the bath.

268
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,380
Yes, Your Highness.

269
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,580
Hurry up.

270
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,500
I heard echoes.

271
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,580
Me too.

272
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,900
Am I developing auditory hallucinations?

273
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,940
Yes.

274
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,740
Hurry up.

275
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:45,980
Never mind that. Come on.

276
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,500
All right.

277
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,460
What's going on?

278
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,420
Mr. Cui?

279
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,580
Cui Yulang?

280
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,940
What are you doing here?

281
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,420
Mr. Pei,

282
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,580
what are you doing here?

283
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,620
I'm going home.

284
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,020
Me too.

285
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,020
What are you talking about, you fool?

286
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,180
Mr. Cui!

287
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,020
Mr. Pei.

288
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,580
Mr. Pei.

289
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,140
Mr. Cui came for a serious meeting.

290
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,460
Don't fight here

291
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,900
or we'll alert the guards.

292
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,060
A serious meeting?

293
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,780
I misunderstood you.

294
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,260
Is your eye all right?

295
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:27,780
No!

296
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,740
I'm fine.

297
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,180
It's a misunderstanding.

298
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,660
Mr. Yuan,

299
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,180
why don't you see me out first?

300
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,980
Are you sure I didn't hurt you
with that punch?

301
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,220
Talk to you next time, Mr. Pei.

302
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:42,980
Mr. Pei.

303
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,900
Didn't you say that you were going home?

304
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,220
By climbing the wall?

305
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,860
What are you implying? Come down now.

306
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,060
Where is Her Highness?

307
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,700
They two, ask them to leave.

308
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,740
Her Highness
doesn't need any more service.

309
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,980
You're dismissed.

310
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,060
I'll stand guard here.

311
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,580
Yes.

312
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,260
I snuck in here.

313
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,220
What are you doing here?

314
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,060
I miss you.

315
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,980
Still, I must remind you

316
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,740
to be extra vigilant.

317
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,380
Consort Rou is keeping
a close watch on us.

318
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,580
I know.

319
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,420
I was being cautious when I came over.

320
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,380
No one followed me.

321
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,420
Oh right,

322
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,020
you did a lot of things recently.

323
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,340
All that to let Consort Rou
take over the Inspectorate Office?

324
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,220
You must be exhausted.

325
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,540
I'm fine.

326
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,580
His Majesty

327
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,980
asked you to recommend Prince Su?

328
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,740
Don't be upset. It's a trivial matter.

329
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,780
It'll be over soon.

330
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,580
You came tonight because you thought

331
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,340
I was upset that I lost my position

332
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,420
and that Father asked me

333
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,420
to write a letter
to recommend Prince Su personally?

334
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,100
Is that so?

335
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,980
It's not just that.

336
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,220
I punched Cui Yulang

337
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,540
by the wall just now.

338
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,620
I've got emotional damage.

339
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,300
Shouldn't you offer me compensation?

340
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,100
What compensation do you want?

341
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,900
What about this?

342
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,300

[Taiji Hall]
Last night,

358
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,180
I received a memorial from Pingyue.

359
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,340
She resigned as the Supervisor
of the Inspectorate Office

360
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,180
and recommended Prince Su
to take her place.

361
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,860
I thought it was a great idea.

362
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,340
What do you think, everyone?

363
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,300
They are all very calm.

364
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,620
It seems like
this is part of their plan.

365
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,580
Your Majesty,

366
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,460
may I know why Princess Pingyue

367
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,620
resigned from her position?

368
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,740
Prince Su is young.

369
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,020
He might not
be able to take this position.

370
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,540
Mr. Shangguan,

371
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,220
while Cheng is young, he is a prince.

372
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,700
He should be involved in state affairs.

373
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,700
Running the Inspectorate Office

374
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,460
will be a good exercise for him.

375
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,380
Father.

376
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,180
I've been feeling
under the weather lately.

377
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,260
I cannot serve you for the moment

378
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,980
and I ask for your forgiveness.

379
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,580
It's all right.

380
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,500
You are a woman, after all.

381
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,580
It's good for you to resign
and cultivate your moral character.

382
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,460
Your Majesty,
Prince Su is simply too young.

383
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,140
It might be dangerous
to appoint His Highness

384
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,780
in such an important position.

385
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,540
You do make some sense.

386
00:21:59,060 --> 00:21:59,700
How about this?

387
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,580
Consort Rou will assist Prince Su

388
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,300
in tandem.

389
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,060
Your Majesty.

390
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,020
Consort Rou is just a consort
in the harem.

391
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,780
She cannot meddle in state affairs.

392
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,300
Pingyue didn't meddle
in state affairs in the past,

393
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,060
but she has performed masterfully.

394
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,100
Were it not for her poor health,

395
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,180
I'd love to let her continue.

396
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,580
Your Majesty!

397
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,620
Your Majesty.

398
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,540
What's the hurry?

399
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,540
Bad news.

400
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,100
Speak.

401
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,780
A group of scholars and some other men

402
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,940
blocked the palace gate.

403
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,540
They claimed that their candidatures
in the spring examination

404
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,660
had been stolen

405
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,300
and they wanted justice.

406
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,980
What is happening?

407
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,100
These scholars said

408
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,420
that they were recommended students
who passed the provincial exams.

409
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,260
They were supposed to come to Huajing
to take part in the spring examination,

410
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,860
but someone took their spots.

411
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,140
Therefore, they came to Huajing

412
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,820
to voice their grievances
to you, Your Majesty.

413
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,340
They are now kneeling outside

414
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,620
waiting for a word from you.

415
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,180
You may leave.

416
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:54,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

417
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,820
Who among you

418
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,580
would like

419
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,860
to handle this case?

420
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,300
Your Majesty,
I would like to handle this case.

421
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,380
Official Pei,

422
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,780
you only became
the Vice Minister of Personnel recently.

423
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,060
You might not be

424
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,820
experienced enough for a case like this.

425
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,980
While I am certainly inexperienced,

426
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,180
my determination makes up for it.

427
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,500
I come from a modest background.

428
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,500
I cannot bear to see

429
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,020
that the opportunities
these scholars should enjoy

430
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,740
were stripped from them.

431
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,700
Therefore, I implore you to allow me

432
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,980
to handle this case.

433
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:51,500
I will make sure that justice is served.

434
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,060
You're too young.

435
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,140
Even if you have the determination,
you might not be able to handle it.

436
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,060
I agree with you, Your Majesty.

437
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,140
Mr. Pei is inexperienced.

438
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,820
But since this is a serious matter,

439
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,100
why don't we let
the Crown Prince handle it?

440
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,620
Mr. Pei can assist His Highness.

441
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,300
What do you think, Mr. Pei?

442
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,500
He's trying to put Chuan to death.

443
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,380
Your Majesty, His Highness is busy.

444
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,820
He will eventually delegate

445
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:39,220
the task to his subordinate.

446
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,620
If you can let me handle this matter,

447
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,380
I will do my best to resolve it.

448
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,780
I agree with Mr Pei.

449
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,180
Father,

450
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,060
it is not a very serious matter.

451
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,460
The imperial examination
is an educational assessment.

452
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,900
Compared to the disasters
or conflicts by the border,

453
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,140
it is insignificant.

454
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,700
Mr. Pei is a fourth-ranked
vice minister.

455
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,620
He has more than enough capacity

456
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,060
to handle this case.

457
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,900
Why don't we let Mr. Pei

458
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,620
handle this matter?

459
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,300
I beg to differ.

460
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,820
The imperial examination is the system
by which we select future officials.

461
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,980
It is of paramount importance.

462
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,180
Someone abused the system

463
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,660
on a national level.

464
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,380
If His Highness
doesn't address the issue in person,

465
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,500
our subjects will not be appeased.

466
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,820
I beg to differ...

467
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,700
Your Majesty.

468
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,580
Why don't you let Prince Su handle this?

469
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,060
This is a ruse to get rid
of the Crown Prince.

470
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,460
Why is she so eager?

471
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,100
Your Majesty,

472
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,180
I heard that Princess Pingyue

473
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,460
recommended Cheng to be the Supervisor
of the Inspectorate Office.

474
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,460
While Cheng is young,

475
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,020
he wants to reduce your burden too.

476
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,420
If none of you can come

477
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,660
to a consensus regarding this matter,

478
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,540
why don't we let Cheng
use this as a practice?

479
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,500
I will accompany him
to meet with those scholars

480
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,060
to hear their plea.

481
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,980
You're righteous, Consort Rou.

482
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,780
Prince Su
is part of the imperial bloodline.

483
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,700
If he's running the Inspectorate Office,

484
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,620
he is the best candidate to handle

485
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,020
this case.

486
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,740
- You're righteous, Consort Rou.
- You're righteous, Consort Rou.

487
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,260
- You're righteous, Prince Su.
- You're righteous, Prince Su.

488
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,860
This is decided then.

489
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,860
Consort Rou is digging her own grave.

490
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,340
You may air

491
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,980
your grievances to Prince Su.

492
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,700
He will make sure
that he will seek justice for you.

493
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,660
Your Highness,

494
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,180
I am Wen Xingzhi.

495
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,380
We have three demands.

496
00:26:59,260 --> 00:26:59,980
One,

497
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,060
identify the culprit

498
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,660
behind our stolen candidatures

499
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,740
and give us justice.

500
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,980
Of course.

501
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,900
I'm here with Prince Su

502
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,460
for this matter precisely.

503
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,260
Two,

504
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,100
add a palace examination

505
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,300
this year, invigilated

506
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,060
by His Majesty,

507
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,060
so that no one can abuse their power

508
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,220
and cheat.

509
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,700
Three,

510
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,700
take the imperial examination

511
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,900
as the sole means to select officials

512
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,260
and abolish the traditional nomination
by noble families

513
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,340
for a fairer system.

514
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,180
How preposterous!

515
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,700
Great job.

516
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,660
Likewise.

517
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,260
You scoundrel.

518
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,660
Isn't this too much to avenge the loss

519
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,140
of my position?

520
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,700
Your Highness, you're here today

521
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:01,980
so you must have made

522
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,220
the decision
to help poor scholars like us.

523
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,020
We have been

524
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,500
studying for decades

525
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,100
and we shoulder our family's hopes

526
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,580
just to become an official.

527
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,340
To pay for my tuition,
my father refuses to treat

528
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,980
his sickness

529
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,620
or eat staple food.

530
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,220
I finally became a recommended student,

531
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,140
yet,

532
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:23,660
my decade-long dream
was destroyed within a night.

533
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,300
Prince Su and I

534
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,900
promise to get to the bottom of this.

535
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,340
However, the appointment
of court officials

536
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,660
has nothing to do with this.

537
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,020
How can you say
it has nothing to do with this?

538
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:37,940
Mr. Pei.

539
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,060
The leader, Wen Xingzhi,

540
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,300
is your man, isn't he?

541
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,300
What are you talking about, Mr. Su?

542
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,340
I don't understand.

543
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,700
The Imperial Examination is set up

544
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,220
to recruit more talented people.

545
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,740
Yet the imperial court is filled
with members of the noble families

546
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,940
who collude with one another,
which puts the court at stake.

547
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,700
How dare you!

548
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,820
The palace gate is no place
for such baseless accusations

549
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,060
from you wet-behind-the-ears!

550
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:05,780
Someone!

551
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,100
What are you doing here?

552
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,820
You want to kill us

553
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,740
to silence us?

554
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:10,860
Your Highness,

555
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,020
is this the justice you promised us?

556
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:16,900
Back off.

557
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,420
Everyone.

558
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,380
This is a serious matter.

559
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,260
Please stand up.

560
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,740
We'll handle your affairs one by one.

561
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,020
When, Your Highness?

562
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,820
Are you planning to make another plan

563
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,460
after you

564
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,900
calm us down?

565
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,060
Truth be told,

566
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,340
I too come from a modest background.

567
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,700
When I was little,

568
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,860
Father sold me into the palace

569
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,420
for two silver taels.

570
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,780
I have suffered

571
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,940
as you have.

572
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,500
In fact,

573
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,020
as a woman,

574
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,340
I might have suffered more than you did.

575
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,180
Therefore, please rest assured.

576
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,460
I will give you justice

577
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,740
even if it costs my life.

578
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,420
I will handle your case

579
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,660
one by one.

580
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,380
This is not an empty promise.

581
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,020
Please believe me.

582
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,260
Stand up, please.

583
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,220
Mr. Pei.

584
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,460
I'm a subordinate of Eunuch Fulai

585
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,660
and I came bearing a message.

586
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,860
His Majesty wants to see you.

587
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,340
Okay, I will go at once.

588
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,580
Your Highness.

589
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,460
Speak.

590
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,100
Just speak frankly.

591
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,900
His Majesty wants you to submit
the official seal of the Office.

592
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,180
Thank you for your trust.

593
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,340
Please give me some time.

594
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,980
You will hear from me soon.

595
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,060
Prince Su and I...

596
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:04,620
Here you go.

597
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,300
will relay this
to His Majesty immediately.

598
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,100
Ask Cui Yulang to see me later.

599
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,260
This is to declare war
on the noble families.

600
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,660
You're asking us
to get ourselves killed!

601
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,220
What is happening?

602
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,100
Why is reform being raised here?

603
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,500
I believe

604
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,540
this is a perfect opportunity

605
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,140
for you, Your Highness.

606
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,820
Did you know this would happen,
Your Highness?

607
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,780
No.

608
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,860
What did you tell Consort Rou?

609
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,300
After His Majesty's accession,

610
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,100
he is often restricted
by the noble families

611
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:50,300
and he has long wanted
to get rid of them.

612
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,100
His Majesty has anticipated

613
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,740
the current circumstances
for many years.

614
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,460
I believe

615
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,740
it provides the best opportunity
to win His Majesty's support

616
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,540
and to eliminate the Crown Prince.

617
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,580
It's easier said than done.

618
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,060
We're not convincing enough.

619
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,180
Even I think that it's too aggressive.

620
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,420
Then,

621
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,220
I told them this.

622
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,740
It's very simple.

623
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,380
It all depends

624
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,700
on whether His Majesty
will see Consort Rou or not.

625
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,180
If he comes to her and supports her,

626
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,580
it means His Majesty wants her to do it.

627
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,100
If not,

628
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,860
I suggested

629
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,220
Consort Rou and Prince Su

630
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,100
voice their difficulties
in front of His Majesty

631
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,420
and ask for resignation.

632
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,540
It will minimize the damage
done to Prince Su.

633
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,980
However, the task

634
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,460
will fall on Pei Wenxuan.

635
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,980
Your logic is sound.

636
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,820
Consort Rou cares too much
about His Majesty.

637
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,740
If His Majesty consoles her,

638
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,300
she will take up
this challenging task for him.

639
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,900
I know what to do now.

640
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,540
I should take my leave then.

641
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,300
Jinglan, tell Wenxuan

642
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,580
that I'm coming over.

643
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,060
Yes, Your Highness.

644
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,420
[Inspectorate Office]
Greetings, Your Highnesses.

645
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,940
Your Highnesses,

646
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,860
should I recuse myself?

647
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,020
You are the Deputy Supervisor
of the Inspectorate Office.

648
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,060
You should be here to assist us.

649
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,780
Stay here and hear their plea.

650
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,380
Yes, Your Highness.

651
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,980
Ask them to come here one by one
to recount their story.

652
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,700
Summon the scholars.

653
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,420
Your Highnesses,

654
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,020
I am Chen Qimai

655
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,060
from Jiangshan County...

656
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,460
Wen Xingzhi, you may voice

657
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,180
your grievances
to Prince Su and Consort Rou.

658
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,660
Your Highnesses,

659
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,620
my exam candidature was stolen.

660
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,500
It's just a trivial matter.

661
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,140
Commoners like us hope

662
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,540
that we can
use this opportunity to reform

663
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,940
the official's selection system.

664
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,980
While we commoners can become officials

665
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,180
through the current system,

666
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,820
the position assigned to us

667
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,220
is insignificant at most.

668
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,580
I must say,

669
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,860
Mr. Pei's plan is ingenious.

670
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,020
[Qingmei Restaurant]
Remember Lin Feibai?

671
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,300
The illegitimate child
of the Xie Family?

672
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,340
Yes, he's serving
the military at the border

673
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,260
and has earned many military merits.

674
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,340
He's returning soon.

675
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,980
If he is allowed back
into the Xie Family,

676
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,460
one can say that he has
rewritten his destiny.

677
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,620
It's not going to be easy
to join the Xie Family.

678
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,180
After Xie Lanqing passed away,

679
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,260
his third brother, Xie Chunhe,
took over the family.

680
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,620
Xie Chunhe looks

681
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,660
affable,

682
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,140
but in reality, he's a vicious man.

683
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,380
When Xie Lanqing was still alive,

684
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,940
Xie Chunhe was the mastermind

685
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,700
behind the Xie Family's many plans,

686
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,300
including the plan
to assassinate Her Highness.

687
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,260
He did it?

688
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,340
Many years ago,

689
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,620
I was once Xie Chunhe's

690
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,300
gaming partner.

691
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,380
We played card games
for ten days consecutively

692
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,980
and I had never lost once.

693
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,220
Then he lost his temper.

694
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,100
He flipped the table,

695
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,140
hit his attendant, and slapped his maid.

696
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,460
I couldn't stand the sight of it,
so I left right away.

697
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,140
I am the young master of the Su Family,

698
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,300
so he wouldn't dare to harm me.

699
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,420
Later,

700
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,860
I heard that the attendant
and the maid who dealt cards

701
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,060
both disappeared.

702
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,940
You mean...

703
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,700
Xie Chunhe is a ruthless man.

704
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,420
In the Qin Family's case,

705
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,100
the Xie Family suffered a loss
from Her Highness.

706
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,740
Knowing Xie Chunhe,

707
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,940
he will return

708
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,620
twice the humiliation.

709
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,460
What's on your mind?

710
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,220
I was thinking...

711
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,380
I was thinking

712
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,580
that you actually won Xie Chunhe
for ten consecutive days.

713
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,420
You always won too when we played

714
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,380
together.

715
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,860
Do you have a trick or two?

716
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,620
Of course.

717
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,740
I knew it.

718
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,380
Tell me.

719
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,460
You want to know?

720
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,660
Don't be cryptic. Tell me already.

721
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,100
This is my trick.

722
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:38,900
This is...

723
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,140
My lucky dice.

724
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,900
I've been keeping it by my side.

725
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,100
As long as I have it,

726
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,620
I win every gamble.

727
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,940
Is it that powerful?

728
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,900
The Inspectorate Office
has met a new supervisor.

729
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,460
The future will only grow more unstable.

730
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,020
I don't know

731
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,180
what the future holds,

732
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,860
but one thing is for sure,

733
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,860
Her Highness and you

734
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,660
will need luck on your side.

735
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,780
Here. Take this.

736
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:06,900
May the odds

737
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,660
be in your favor

738
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,620
in the future.

739
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,460
I'll gladly accept it.

740
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,900
Thank you for the lucky dice.

741
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,420
A toast to you.

742
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:21,580
Cheers.

743
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,540
[Wenxuan's Abode]

744
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,380
Where are you going?

745
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,940
Young Master, there's a...

746
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:40,940
Your Highness!

747
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,180
Your Highness, when did you arrive?

748
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,020
Young Master, Her Highness is here.

749
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,220
You must have waited for a long time.

750
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,180
Let me get you some water.

751
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,740
The carriage is ready.

752
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,820
We can set off at any time.

753
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,380
I'm not going.

754
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,220
No?

755
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,020
Right.

756
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,660
We're not going anywhere.

757
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,820
I'll ask them to dismiss.

758
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,980
I came

759
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,100
because I have some questions

760
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,340
for you, Mr. Pei.

761
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,380
What are you doing?

762
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,140
Sorry, I made a mistake.

763
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:41,820
Yes.

764
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,860
I want to reform
the official's selection system.

765
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,740
I know Su Rongqing
wants to use this case

766
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,380
to put the Crown Prince
in a difficult situation.

767
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,380
And knowing His Highness,

768
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,780
he will accept the case.

769
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,380
But no matter what he does,
he will come out with a loss.

770
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:58,860
Therefore,

771
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,220
I told His Majesty
about this case in advance.

772
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,380
We discussed and agreed

773
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,820
to use this case to launch a reform.

774
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,780
Utterly ridiculous!

775
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,660
The demands you asked them to make today

776
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,740
cannot be achieved for at least
the next few centuries.

777
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,340
Get up.

778
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,100
No.

779
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,700
Unless...

780
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,100
Unless you stay here tonight.

781
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,540
I want you to get up now.

782
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,460
Do not talk back.

783
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,220
No.

784
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,300
Get up.

785
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,940
Do you truly think
that after our divorce,

786
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,220
whatever happens to you

787
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,460
will not affect me?

788
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,740
If Consort Rou didn't show up today,

789
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,940
would you have accepted the case?

790
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,060
Fine. If you handled it well,

791
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,380
then all would be good.

792
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,420
What if you didn't? What would happen?

793
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,300
Have you forgotten
how difficult it was for you and Chuan

794
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,140
to launch the reform?

795
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,660
If you corner the noble families

796
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,460
and they fight back,
what will happen to you?

797
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,180
Your Highness,

798
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,700
all the great changes in this world

799
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,980
come with a price.

800
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,380
What price?

801
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,620
Your life.

802
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,100
Are you my tactician
or my cannon fodder?

803
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,740
Does your life mean nothing?

804
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,420
I didn't say I was sacrificing myself.

805
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,780
If you didn't care about your life,

806
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,100
why would you become my spouse?

807
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,500
I'm still alive right now.

808
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,940
I don't care
if you're currently in danger or not.

809
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,620
Did you talk to me
before you took the risk?

810
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,020
Do you think that your survival
doesn't matter to me

811
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,700
or that I don't care about you?

812
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,220
Answer me.

813
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,860
Listen up, Pei Wenxuan.

814
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,580
Your life isn't just yours.

815
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,060
You're my husband

816
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,980
and the father of my future child.

817
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,100
Even for the sake of us,

818
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,020
you should have told me everything.

819
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,180
Do not laugh.

820
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,740
If you can't do that,

821
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,380
I...

822
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,540
How annoying!

823
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,900
Rong.

824
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,580
Rong.

825
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:18,780
Don't be angry.

826
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,020
I'm sorry.

827
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,100
I'm sorry.

828
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,580
If you died because of this,

829
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,860
what would I do?

830
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,420
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

831
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,700
I won't do this again.

832
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,980
I won't make you worry.

833
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,580
I'll tell you everything.

834
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,100
Don't be mad.

835
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:43,650
How did you come in here?

836
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,380
Even now, you're thinking
about this stupid question?

837
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,020
How did you come in here?

838
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,380
Like this.

839
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,980
You climbed the wall?

840
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:05,100
But the next door...

841
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,140
I bought it.

842
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,300
Go back then.

843
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,300
You don't want me to stay?

844
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,580
I'm joking.

845
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,620
I'd love it if you could stay over.

846
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,060
But I thought about it

847
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,260
and I realized

848
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,660
that I had made a mistake.

849
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,260
If you stay over,

850
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,780
you're

851
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,740
awarding my mistake.

852
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:43,140
An intimate time
should also be a romantic time.

853
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,220
It shouldn't be mixed
with other matters.

854
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:50,900
Besides,

855
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,620
you're right, Your Highness.

856
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,340
We're not allies.

857
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,580
I am your spouse

858
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,580
and the father of your child.

859
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,620
Moving forward,

860
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,340
I will tell you everything in advance

861
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,660
and discuss them with you.

862
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,220
Good.

863
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,140
I'll go back then.

864
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:17,980
Be careful.

865
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,540
I am very nimble.

866
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,060
I'm leaving.

867
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,020
Be careful.

868
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,700
Don't worry, Your Highness.

869
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,460
His Highness has gone back
to his chamber to rest.

870
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,420
Mr. Su.

871
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,100
Come in.

872
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:47,900
Your Highness.

873
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:54,740
I will leave after posing my question.

874
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,140
May I know who suggested you

875
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,700
handle the case today?

876
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,780
Someone did advise me,

877
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,180
but it's what I want to do too.

878
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,620
So it's your idea

879
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,540
to cross the noble families directly?

880
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:21,740
Your Highness,

881
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,140
Prince Su and you have barely
secured your position in court.

882
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:28,100
Even Princess Pingyue
is reluctant to handle the case.

883
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,540
Yet you volunteered so eagerly.

884
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,900
You might have been set up.

885
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:35,940
That's all I want to say.

886
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,700
Take care, Your Highness.

887
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:45,100
Your Highness.

888
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,620
If I may speak frankly,

889
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:52,740
Mr. Su is right.

890
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,620
I know that.

891
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,220
But I had no other options.

892
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,460
I took the case in public.

893
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,060
I thought

894
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:06,780
that while I did not work at court,

895
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:08,940
many people
from a similar background to mine

896
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:12,140
might support Cheng.

897
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:14,140
I was hoping to gain more
with this endeavor.

898
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:22,060
But if these scholars are not satisfied
and make another scene,

899
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,180
Cheng's reputation
will be irreparably damaged.

900
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,780
It's not difficult to handle
the imperial examination fraud,

901
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:29,500
but we are powerless to launch a reform.

902
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,100
I believe we must

903
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,660
count on Mr. Su in this.
