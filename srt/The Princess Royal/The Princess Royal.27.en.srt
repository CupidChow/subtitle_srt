[Episode 27]

5
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,300
Su Rongqing.

6
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,780
Hand over Hongde's son now.

7
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,660
Your Majesty, you have wronged me.

8
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,060
I don't know where you heard this from.

9
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,780
Why don't you summon him here

10
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,260
so I can confront him directly?

11
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,060
Confront him?

12
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,620
For what?

13
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,700
Hongde had already identified you.

14
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,460
As soon as the Remonstration Office
received his testimony,

15
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,500
it was burnt.

16
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,540
I summoned him to come as a witness,

17
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,020
yet he died on the way here,

18
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,780
which was confirmed as suicide.

19
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,820
If it weren't because someone's
threatening him with his son,

20
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,260
why would he kill himself?

21
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,300
Now that we're investigating
the child's whereabouts,

22
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,220
you're involved in this as well.

23
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,180
If it happened only once,
it may be called a coincidence.

24
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,620
But there are two or three in a row.
How can they be called coincidences?

25
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,260
Your Majesty, you are correct.

26
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,220
I also believe
that this is not a coincidence,

27
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,300
but someone's trying to frame me.

28
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,220
Your Majesty, I hope you will
investigate the truth.

29
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,060
Very well.

30
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,420
I will investigate it now.

31
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,140
Someone.

32
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,540
Take Su Rongqing away

33
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,380
and put him in prison.

34
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,380
Your Majesty,
Su Ronghua, the Deputy Supervisor

35
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,860
of the Inspectorate Office,
requests an audience.

36
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:47,940
Summon him in.

37
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,300
Greetings, Your Majesty.

38
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,140
You may rise.

39
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,380
I dare not, Your Majesty.

40
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,020
Oh, no! He's here to take the blame.

41
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:14,740
Father...

42
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,500
Your Majesty, I hope we can talk alone.

43
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,740
The rest of you can leave now.

44
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,140
What? Are you disregarding my command?

45
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,700
Yes, Father.

46
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,220
I'll take my leave.

47
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,820
They say you're very close
to your brother.

48
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,100
I finally get to see that
with my own eyes today.

49
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,620
Don't you feel guilty at all?

50
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:50,860
Your Highness.

51
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,460
Sometimes,
we can't afford to feel guilty.

52
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,100
Some people tread
on the path of despair.

53
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,940
So all they can do is to forge on

54
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,700
without being overcautious
and indecisive.

55
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,340
I used to believe

56
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,980
people were moving forward
because they were forced to do so.

57
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,380
But, I've come to realize

58
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,340
that we create our own paths.

59
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,900
If you don't move forward,

60
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,060
you will never know
what kind of road lies ahead.

61
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:30,980
What if...

62
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,020
ahead of you is a cliff?

63
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,220
That depends on whether

64
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,460
you're willing to risk your life.

65
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,260
Then, are you willing to risk your life

66
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,020
to continue on your path?

67
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,900
Perhaps.

68
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,820
I'm just taking one step at a time.

69
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,220
Eunuch.

70
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,020
Please pass this memorial
to His Majesty.

71
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:03,780
Yes.

72
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,340
You weren't like this in the past.

73
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,700
Well...

74
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,660
People will change.

75
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,460
You took action against me first.

76
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:28,900
Sorry.

77
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,020
I had no choice.

78
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,220
But, you have to believe me.

79
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,900
I would never

80
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,700
harm you.

81
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,700
Your Highness, I noticed
that it's raining heavily,

82
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,700
so I came to take you home.

83
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,540
Mr. Su.

84
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,340
Good to meet you here.

85
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,580
This is more than just a meeting.

86
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,580
Mr. Pei, long time no see.

87
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,860
Your Majesty, please let me explain.

88
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,580
It was I who abused my position
as Prince Su's former tutor

89
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,300
to instigate Consort Rou

90
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,100
into framing the Crown Prince
and Princess Pingyue.

91
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,620
You scoundrel!

92
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,660
What other tricks are you
hiding from me?

93
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:46,900
Your actions

94
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,860
only prove that Su Rongqing
must be involved in this.

95
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,860
Your Majesty, you may not know

96
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,860
that while I seem
uninterested in politics,

97
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,860
I am actually envious
of my younger brother.

98
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,340
That's why I tried
to draw Consort Rou over into my side

99
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,700
so that I could gain a position
in the imperial court.

100
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,700
So I can prove my worth
as the eldest son of the Su Family.

101
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,420
You scoundrel!

102
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,380
Your Majesty.

103
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,740
It was me who abducted Hongde's son.

104
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,060
On account of my family's loyalty

105
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,500
and my service
as Prince Su's former tutor,

106
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,940
I hope my merits can
atone for my wrongdoings.

107
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,380
Please spare me.

108
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,620
So, this is the kind of tutor
I got for Prince Su.

109
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,940
Since it was you,

110
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,860
why didn't you say earlier?

111
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,500
I'm wrong.

112
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,300
Let me ask you this again.

113
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,660
Was it you or Su Rongqing?

114
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,540
It was me.

115
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,700
I dared not admit it,

116
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,220
but I couldn't bear to see
my brother be wronged,

117
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,900
so I had no choice
but to admit my guilt.

118
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,500
I hope you'll forgive me, Your Majesty.

119
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,540
Then, why did Hongde
identify your brother in his testimony?

120
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,940
I didn't show my face when I met Hongde.

121
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,540
Perhaps Hongde saw something else

122
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,620
and guessed that it was the Su Family.

123
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,340
In Huajing,

124
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,620
my brother is more famous than I am.

125
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,740
Perhaps Hongde guessed the wrong person.

126
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,260
Since he guessed the wrong person,

127
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,820
why did you set fire
to the Remonstration Office

128
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,060
and even commit murder?

129
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,180
What were you thinking?

130
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,700
Your Majesty, about the fire
at the Remonstration Office,

131
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,020
I don't know what happened.

132
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,300
As for Hongde's death,
it was a misunderstanding.

133
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,380
I did tell Hongde

134
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,460
that if anything happened,
he must never sell me out.

135
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,300
But, I don't know

136
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,620
why he would kill himself
on the way here.

137
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,060
Your Majesty.

138
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,060
I was so stupid and made a mistake.

139
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,100
As Prince Su's former tutor,

140
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,020
I wanted the best

141
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,020
for Prince Su and Consort Rou.

142
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,260
Even though you later

143
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,540
appointed my brother to teach Prince Su,

144
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,900
I'm the only one
who truly cares about Prince Su.

145
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,980
Princess Pingyue is the Supervisor
of the Inspectorate Office.

146
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,260
She is in a high position and powerful.

147
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,900
She's also the Crown Prince's sister.

148
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,100
They're inseparable.

149
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,700
This was what Consort Rou worried about.

150
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,540
That's why I came up with this plan.

151
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,180
Both you and Consort Rou are imbeciles.

152
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,540
Why did I empower Pingyue?

153
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,420
Without her,

154
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,860
would your family dare

155
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,740
take on a powerful noble family
like the Shangguan Family?

156
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,100
They would muster the entire clan's
strength to support the Crown Prince.

157
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,540
Can you?

158
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,980
Pingyue has been fighting for power
against the noble families,

159
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,340
whether they seem genuine or not.

160
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,940
Now that the position once held
by the Shangguan Family is vacated,

161
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,500
I can appoint my own people

162
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,980
to replace the noble families.

163
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,780
This is the result.

164
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,740
Why was she so worried?

165
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,300
She may be worried,

166
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,140
but why are you worried too?

167
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,540
Is this how you're helping her?

168
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,060
Your Majesty,
I have realized my mistake.

169
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,660
I was too near-sighted

170
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,220
to understand your intentions.

171
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,780
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

172
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,020
Forget it.

173
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,380
I think that you are not suited

174
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,980
to remain in the imperial court.

175
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,140
Leave now.

176
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,100
Thank you for sparing me, Your Majesty.

177
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,020
You shouldn't have come.

178
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,580
What would you do if I didn't come?

179
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,260
Rongqing.

180
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,300
I don't know what you're up to

181
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,140
but don't forget

182
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,380
that I'm your elder brother.

183
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,660
You're not on this path alone.

184
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,580
But, there are some paths

185
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,100
that are destined to be trod alone.

186
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,740
When I reach the end,

187
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,300
if I die there,

188
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,420
if you would,

189
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,220
I hope you'll collect my dead body.

190
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,340
Rongqing, what nonsense is that?

191
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:19,940
Ronghua.

192
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,140
Can you promise me something?

193
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,140
Stay out of my business.

194
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,940
I hope today's incident
won't happen again.

195
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,460
I will walk alone on my own path.

196
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,500
I will bear

197
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,740
my own sins.

198
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,100
Ronghua.

199
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,820
If you want the best for me...

200
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,260
just mind your own business.

201
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,500
As for the rest,

202
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,580
leave them to me.

203
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,180
Ronghua, go home now.

204
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,420
You should grab a drink
with Shangguan Ya.

205
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,140
When the time is right,

206
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,140
you should propose to her.

207
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,180
Mr. Su, you need
to leave the palace now.

208
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,380
[Zhengwu Gate]
Mr. Su.

209
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,740
You didn't get flogged?

210
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,540
Congratulations.

211
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,900
Are you here to laugh at my misfortune?

212
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,860
I thought you've finished
staging your act.

213
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,300
And His Majesty didn't punish you.

214
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,020
So, you're here to pick me up

215
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,380
because you care about me?

216
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,500
You're wrong.

217
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,580
I don't really care much
about other people.

218
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,660
It's fine.

219
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,020
I'm good at this.

220
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,060
I can teach you.

221
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,620
To be honest,

222
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,940
I brought some liquor.

223
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,980
Are you interested in joining me

224
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,820
to go up the mountain
to watch the sunrise?

225
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,660
Watch the sunrise?

226
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,780
Why? You're not interested?

227
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,580
No.

228
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,660
Of course, I'm interested.

229
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,860
Besides,

230
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,180
how could I bear to let you

231
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,340
go up the mountain alone

232
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,020
without any company?

233
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,620
I didn't realize before

234
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,700
that you're good at
saying sweet words.

235
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,020
Let's go.

236
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,380
Your Majesty,

237
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,100
I know you don't trust anyone now.

238
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,820
Since you don't,

239
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,980
why don't you give it a try?

240
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,260
Give what a try?

241
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,300
Try to test...

242
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,300
all the doubts you have in mind.

243
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,500
What is it?

244
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,700
You've been thinking hard
about something.

245
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,820
You feel bad for him?

246
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,380
Why?

247
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,700
You dummy.

248
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,220
Why would I feel bad?

249
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,580
I was just thinking

250
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,540
that everyone is doing fine now,

251
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,220
so why is the past repeating itself?

252
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,220
What went wrong?

253
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,300
Your Highness.

254
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,140
Only saints can remain pure
in a tainted world.

255
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,780
Most people like you and me

256
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,140
are just ordinary mortals.

257
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,980
Have you committed any evil then?

258
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,900
I am but an ordinary human.

259
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,500
But when I had any evil thoughts,

260
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,260
I would think about you.

261
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,940
For some reason,

262
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,700
even when I hated you the most,

263
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,180
I didn't want you to look down on me.

264
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,100
Why?

265
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,140
When we first met,

266
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,140
you were
such a wonderful person in my eyes.

267
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,900
I want to be the light in your eyes,

268
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,860
not a dark shadow.

269
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,780
Your Highness, actually...

270
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,700
It's fine.

271
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,500
As long as you can
maintain your conscience,

272
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,700
I will support you.

273
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,420
In fact, I was feeling apprehensive

274
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,660
about Hongde's matter today.

275
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,300
But, you wanted me
to confront Su Rongqing,

276
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,180
so I went.

277
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,540
That's because I knew
you'd plan everything out.

278
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,180
Because you were there,

279
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,540
I felt safe.

280
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,580
Pei Wenxuan.

281
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,460
I can accept both good and evil.

282
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,980
But I'm happy that you can fulfill

283
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,060
my anticipations that are almost

284
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,700
like a dream to achieve.

285
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,820
Let's go back. I'm tired.

286
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,660
Coming.

287
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,620
[Mingyue Palace]

288
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,780
Mother,

289
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,340
I'm afraid Hongde's case
will implicate us.

290
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,780
I share your concerns.

291
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,380
But, as long as your uncle
remains stationed at the borders,

292
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,100
we still have hope.

293
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,100
Your Highnesses.

294
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,140
Your Highness, Second Young Master Su
sent a letter to say

295
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,860
that you and Prince Su

296
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,740
can pin all the blame

297
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,620
on First Young Master Su.

298
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,220
He still doesn't
understand His Majesty that well.

299
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,820
His Majesty does not want
to see anyone shifting blame.

300
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,260
Everyone.

301
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,380
Do you have any objections
to this year's list

302
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,540
of staff mobilizations in the court?

303
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,820
Your Majesty.

304
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,500
What are your thoughts?

305
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,460
Your Majesty.

306
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,780
I have little talent and learning
and am inexperienced.

307
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,900
I've found it tough to fulfill
my duties as a minister.

308
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,060
Therefore, I implore you to select
another official to replace me.

309
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,020
What is he up to this time?

310
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,700
Who else would take over his position?

311
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,420
Since Official Su
is resigning voluntarily,

312
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,260
I shall not force him to stay.

313
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,580
How about this?

314
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,260
We'll vacate the position
of the Minister of Justice for now

315
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,860
and allow the vice ministers
to run the ministry.

316
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,460
If there are any crucial decisions
to be made,

317
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,100
you may report directly to me.

318
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,300
Report directly?

319
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,660
That means His Majesty
is taking over the Ministry of Justice

320
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,940
and skipping
over the Department of Imperial Affairs!

321
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,580
What do you think, Official Su?

322
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,060
Wise decision, Your Majesty.

323
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,220
Does anyone else have other opinions?

324
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,180
As for the rebuilding
of the Remonstration Office,

325
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,260
the Ministry of Rites
should expedite the project.

326
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,380
Before the Remonstration Office
is rebuilt,

327
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,220
we need to keep
this imperial court running.

328
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,060
After some thought, I have decided

329
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,820
to build a grand secretariat

330
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,420
to temporarily replace
the Remonstration Office

331
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,820
to allow officials to review
and sort the memorials in there

332
00:18:59,060 --> 00:18:59,980
to share my burden.

333
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:02,940
Pei Liming.

334
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,180
Su Minzhi.

335
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,300
Shangguan Xu.

336
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,620
I will need the three of you

337
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,860
to spare some time every day

338
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,980
to review and sort the memorials.

339
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,700
If you are busy with your regular work,

340
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,500
you may inform me beforehand,

341
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,100
and I will find another arrangement.

342
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,540
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

343
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,420
The three of them represent
different power factions

344
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,780
in the current imperial court.

345
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,220
I guess that's fair.

346
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,180
However, the three of them are
burdened with their regular duties,

347
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,980
so other than them,

348
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,380
I hope to select a few more officials
for this task.

349
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,580
I have not decided who to select yet.

350
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,060
We'll discuss this someday.

351
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,340
Those three people are not
the crucial part of Father's plan.

352
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,820
It's the people
that will be appointed later.

353
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,940
A remonstration office
that can be monitored by Pei Wenxuan

354
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,900
is not better than a grand secretariat
that will benefit Prince Su's future.

355
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,980
I know I have committed a stupid act

356
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,220
and brought much disaster

357
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,860
by letting someone take advantage of me.

358
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,780
To silence others,

359
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:10,460
I am willing to be demoted.

360
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,980
You're not that stupid.

361
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,700
At least you've realized your mistake.

362
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,140
Forget about the demotion.

363
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,740
Why are you crying
if you've realized your mistake?

364
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,660
I know that you may

365
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,740
chastise me for saying this,

366
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,460
but my feminine intuition tells me

367
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,980
that Pei Wenxuan and Pingyue

368
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,180
are still deeply in love.

369
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,700
Therefore, my guess

370
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,220
is that they're
scheming something together.

371
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,780
Pei Wenxuan claims to be on your side,

372
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,420
but I believe that he's
overtly agreeing but covertly opposing.

373
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,500
The Prince Consort is handsome
and has high moral qualities.

374
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,460
Princess Pingyue
is beautiful and amazing.

375
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,900
Despite being a perfect match,
their marriage won't end up good.

376
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,900
Due to their conflicting personalities,

377
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,660
their marriage is impossible to sustain.

378
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,460
Therefore, I have approved
Pei Wenxuan's request

379
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,220
for an amicable divorce.

380
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,980
Mr. Pei, please receive the decree.

381
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,620
I accept your decree.
Thank you, Your Majesty.

382
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,620
I shall return now.

383
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,780
Take care, Eunuch Fu.

384
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,700
Take care, Eunuch Fu.

385
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,700
Young Master, you must be feeling smug.

386
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,900
You're too ahead of yourself.

387
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,300
You've lost Her Highness just like that.

388
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,220
This is so vexing.

389
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,260
That's it?

390
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,660
Yes, Your Highness

391
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,940
You haven't lost any of your wealth
or power.

392
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,620
You've only lost me.

393
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,980
All you know is
venting your anger on me.

394
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,220
Must you leave in such a rush?

395
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,660
You...

396
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,700
I...

397
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,540
The Prince Consort is so heartless.

398
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,460
He wouldn't even stay a second longer.

399
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,220
He's leaving overnight.

400
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,980
What a cold-blooded man.

401
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,940
Young Master, think again.

402
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,220
If you leave now...

403
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,620
Pei Wenxuan!

404
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:52,900
Don't go!

405
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,380
Your Highness!

406
00:22:59,380 --> 00:22:59,940
You...

407
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,420
Look at her...

408
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,700
What are you doing?

409
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,460
Do you hate me that much?

410
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,540
Don't go.

411
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,700
I'll ask my father

412
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,980
to cancel the divorce.

413
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,220
No need.

414
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,460
I don't deserve to be your consort.

415
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,060
Don't even harbor that thought.

416
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,140
Young Master, how could you say that?

417
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,860
Her Highness has treated you so well.

418
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,900
She's never let you down.

419
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,700
I've been so nice to you!

420
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,140
How have I let you down? Tell me!

421
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,220
She's even crying.
I feel so sad for her.

422
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:26,940
Exactly.

423
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,540
Her Highness may have

424
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,220
a foul temper...

425
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:29,900
What did you say?

426
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,620
What's wrong with her temper?

427
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,180
Let's not talk about that now.

428
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,180
It's just...

429
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,780
If you leave now,

430
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,900
you can never return anymore.

431
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,980
That's enough. Are you leaving with me?

432
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,940
Pei Wenxuan, don't go.

433
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,260
You...

434
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,460
Well?

435
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:44,740
You...

436
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,140
You...

437
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,780
I need to go.

438
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,220
Pei Wenxuan!

439
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:52,860
He...

440
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,060
Go! All of you, leave!

441
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,980
Out of sight, out of mind! Leave now!

442
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,140
Leave!

443
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,260
Pei Wenxuan!

444
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,940
Let them go! Don't let them come back!

445
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,460
We sing while drinking...

446
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,980
The life is short.

447
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,620
We hold hands and watch the light
of the early morning sun...

448
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,420
As if the Immortals
have appeared in front of us!

449
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,380
Look!

450
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,620
The sun is out.

451
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,740
Come on!

452
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:23,980
How beautiful.

453
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,540
Ya.

454
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:31,980
Tell me the truth.

455
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,220
Why did you come to keep me company?

456
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,380
Su Ronghua.

457
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,660
Congratulations on leaving the dark
and embracing the light.

458
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,220
You are the light in my heart.

459
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,900
Since the first day I met you...

460
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,620
you've always been my light.

461
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,500
Mr. Su.

462
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,260
Are you confessing your love for me?

463
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,820
You'd better be careful.

464
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,340
I'm going to chase you recklessly.

465
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,140
You'll have to work hard

466
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,620
if you want to hold my hands
like this forever.

467
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,780
I won't let you go.

468
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,180
Since you have nothing to report,

469
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,460
court is dismissed.

470
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,900
- Take care, Your Majesty.
- Take care, Your Majesty.

471
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,700
Your Highness.

472
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:08,100
I have a prescription
handed down by my family

473
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,220
that can relieve swelling.

474
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,820
I've tested
that it's useful and effective.

475
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,660
Thank you, Mr. Cui.

476
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:35,980
Rongqing.

477
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:38,940
Let's go home.

478
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,660
Investigate these people.

479
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,020
If they refuse to confess,

480
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,260
just arrest them.

481
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,420
Yes, Your Highness.

482
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,820
Greetings, Your Highness
and Miss Shangguan.

483
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,700
Your Highness, I'll be off to work.

484
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,420
Give me your resignation letter.

485
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,820
Your Highness, you knew what I would do?

486
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,740
I'm not that dumb.

487
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,140
This is good for you, though.

488
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,860
If you continue working in officialdom,

489
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,180
no one knows

490
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,060
how your future may be.

491
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,460
I shall not see you out.

492
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,020
Let's meet again someday.

493
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:32,780
Thank you, Your Highness.

494
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,620
Your Highness.

495
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,700
Rongqing may have gone astray lately,

496
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,300
but he means no harm towards you.

497
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,660
I hope you will not
bear a grudge against him.

498
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,300
I keep my work
and personal life separate.

499
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,660
Wise words, Your Highness.

500
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,420
Your Majesty.

501
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,940
Consort Rou is waiting outside
with a bowl of soothing soup.

502
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,460
Let her in.

503
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,780
Your Majesty.

504
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,660
I made some soothing soup for you.

505
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,420
Please drink it.

506
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,340
Why are you still kneeling?

507
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,620
You may rise.

508
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,260
I am punishing myself.

509
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,500
I admit I was tricked by someone else.

510
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,300
I need to remember this lesson.

511
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,020
I'm glad to hear that.

512
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,020
Your Majesty, you may have forgiven me,

513
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,260
but I cannot forgive myself.

514
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,180
I know that I have
little talent and learning,

515
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,780
but I am loyal to you.

516
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,900
I can also be a sword at your disposal

517
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,820
and I'm definitely more obedient
than Pei Wenxuan.

518
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,580
Wherever you sword points,

519
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,020
that's where I'll go.

520
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,980
Bring the soup here.

521
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,620
Fulai.

522
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,540
No need for that.

523
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,700
[Princess's Mansion]

524
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,700
Your Highness,
here's another freshly boiled egg.

525
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,380
Let me replace that one with this.

526
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,340
Alright. Roll the egg on this side.

527
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:25,900
Ouch.

528
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,620
It was so embarrassing
at the court today.

529
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,420
My heavenly beauty

530
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,700
has been ruined by Pei Wenxuan.

531
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,180
Exactly.

532
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,980
It's all that scoundrel's fault.

533
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,940
When did you come here?

534
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,060
Rong.

535
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,300
I...

536
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,460
If there's something, just say it.

537
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,260
If not, just leave.

538
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,500
This is not a good time to meet.

539
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,500
Rong.

540
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,060
It's not like I didn't see

541
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,060
how you looked in the morning.

542
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:56,860
See,

543
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,660
you look better than you were
in the morning.

544
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,420
Really?

545
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,380
Yes.

546
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,820
Just roll your face
with the egg a while more

547
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,100
and you'll be fine tomorrow.

548
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,100
Say it. What brings you here?

549
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,020
Given my understanding of Pei Wenxuan,

550
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,820
he's already planned everything out.

551
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,460
At worst,

552
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,700
you can remarry him later.

553
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,420
I know you fancy him.

554
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,780
Otherwise, given your temperament,

555
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:33,820
you wouldn't have

556
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,020
run across the whole street
just to stop his carriage.

557
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,980
But seriously, Rong,

558
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,140
your stamina must be great.

559
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:40,740
Wait.

560
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,540
Who ran across the whole street
to stop his carriage?

561
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,140
You.

562
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,900
It's all over the gossip vine.

563
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,340
Everyone in Huajing knows.

564
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,460
If I must say,

565
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,300
an amicable divorce is better
than the two of you getting into danger.

566
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,380
So, don't be too upset.

567
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,780
Who said I'm upset?

568
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,020
I'm absolutely delighted.

569
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,140
I feel fantastic now.

570
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:06,900
Delighted?

571
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,860
Why were your eyes swollen
from crying then?

572
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,420
Here's the truth.

573
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,020
Your Highness,

574
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,500
here's some chili powder
from the Shu area.

575
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,260
They're bound
to make your eyes become swollen.

576
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,180
I haven't had any of it,

577
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,380
yet I feel my eyes are getting swollen.

578
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,620
I see. That's a relief.

579
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,020
Alright,

580
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,860
get to the point.

581
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,140
If you have spare time,

582
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,580
I need you to gather some information.

583
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,140
About what?

584
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,020
Check whether the chief examiner

585
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,340
for the imperial examination
is selected.

586
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,820
It probably has been decided.

587
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,660
But it shouldn't have been this soon.

588
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,180
It's so weird this year.

589
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,420
Mr. Wang said

590
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,540
that this year's examination
is particularly important,

591
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,500
and he even requested directly to Father

592
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,380
that he wants to be the chief examiner.

593
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,380
A minister volunteering
to be a chief examiner?

594
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,940
Who would dare go over him?

595
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,660
So, even though it's not
formally decided yet,

596
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,700
the result is almost certain.

597
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,460
Rong, stop thinking about Pei Wenxuan.

598
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,300
Out with the old, in with the new!

599
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,540
I'll bring you out someday.

600
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,860
If you see anyone you fancy...

601
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,540
That's enough.

602
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,740
Stop sticking your nose in my business.

603
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,020
And you?

604
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,660
What about your marriage?

605
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,060
Me? I don't care anymore.

606
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,940
They can choose whomever they want.

607
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,780
Guess what happened?

608
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,340
Father and Mother secretly decided

609
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,060
to put this off for now.

610
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,500
No more consort selection?

611
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:57,740
No more.

612
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,500
Your Majesty, the Empress is here.

613
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,900
Don't you want to know why I'm here?

614
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,620
To speak up for Pingyue?

615
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,020
No. Since the focus of all our problems

616
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,860
is on the future Crown Princess,

617
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,580
we shouldn't be in this stalemate
any longer.

618
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,980
Besides, the Shangguan Family

619
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,660
has already given up
on the consort selection.

620
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,220
Given up?

621
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,540
On what condition?

622
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,660
Chuan must not marry anyone
related to Consort Rou.

623
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,260
Sure, I promise you this.

624
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,580
How very decisive of you.

625
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,580
No matter how inadequate
I find the Crown Prince to be,

626
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,180
I still hope

627
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,740
that he can marry someone worthy of him.

628
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:05,860
Very well.

629
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:09,660
I'll take my leave.

630
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,670
[Su's Mansion]

631
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,500
Young Master.

632
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,860
Why do you seem upset?

633
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,700
Other than
the First Young Master's involvement,

634
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,020
everything is going

635
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,340
according to your plans, isn't it?

636
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,620
Xiao Rou was stupid enough

637
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,980
to antagonize us.

638
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,060
You mean...

639
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,060
My initial plan

640
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,100
was to kick Pei Wenxuan
out of officialdom

641
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,780
so that he could just be
the Prince Consort.

642
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,780
My aim was
to reduce the Princess's Mansion's

643
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:18,660
and the Inspectorate Office's
expenditure,

644
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:19,740
but she...

645
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,020
made the Princess get a divorce.

646
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,260
By reducing
the Princess's Mansion's expenditure,

647
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,980
you want to restrict

648
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,340
the development
of the Princess's military strength?

649
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,860
Your Highness, we have received letters
from the Northwest and Southwest.

650
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,460
Tell me the details.

651
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,980
There is no direct confrontation
at the Northwest now.

652
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:42,980
The enemy only

653
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,860
strikes a particular city
once in a while

654
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:45,900
and scrambles off immediately.

655
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,740
Qin Lin has been sent to the front lines
to guard the cities alone.

656
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,500
He has recruited
the commoner people from the cities

657
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,340
whose food was stolen by the enemy.

658
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,420
Together with his direct associates,

659
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,180
he has almost ten thousand people
under his command.

660
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,900
But now,
their biggest problem is funding.

661
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,580
He is requesting your help
to gather more funds

662
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,140
as the current development
has reached a bottleneck.

663
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,460
Funds again.

664
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,740
And the Southwest?

665
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,900
There have been

666
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,940
several large-scale battles.

667
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,580
Lin Feibai has been
rising through the ranks quickly,

668
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,740
but there are problems all the same.

669
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,580
He needs money to bribe his superiors

670
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,580
for his promotion.

671
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,980
Is there anything else
not related to money issues?

672
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,060
And the divorce?

673
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,260
How's the investigation going?

674
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,180
We have discovered

675
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,580
that Su Rongqing

676
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,380
had a secret conversation
with His Majesty.

677
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,060
His Majesty then issued a decree

678
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,100
to reduce
the Inspectorate Office's expenditure

679
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,460
and make Qingzhou submit
half of its tax revenue to the palace

680
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,940
to support the military in the north.

681
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,700
Then, who made His Majesty

682
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,780
change his mind?

683
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:53,940
Consort Rou.

684
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,620
Xiao Rou is improvident.

685
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,180
Only Su Rongqing knows

686
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,020
the Princess's Mansion's weakness.

687
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,620
Well.

688
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,780
Go and talk to Cui Yulang

689
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:08,900
and ask him

690
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,620
if he still wants to proceed

691
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,140
with his earlier proposal
he mentioned to me.

692
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,340
Yes, Your Highness.

693
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:18,580
The roses bloom
amid the termites' nest.

694
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,780
They ask where you come from...

695
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,940
What are you doing here, sir?

696
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,220
Have I done something wrong

697
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,500
and you're here to take me
to the Inspectorate Office?

698
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,980
Her Highness wanted me to ask you

699
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,980
whether you want to proceed

700
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,380
with the earlier proposal
you mentioned to her.

701
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,140
Princess Pingyue?

702
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,780
Mr. Cui.

703
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:54,140
Then, please ask her this on my behalf.

704
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,540
If I agree to do as she says,

705
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:01,020
would she keep me safe?

706
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,620
Anything else you want to ask her?

707
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,180
One more thing.

708
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,700
Once the plan succeeds,

709
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,980
is she willing to help me
investigate a case

710
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,460
to seek justice for my friend?

711
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,500
Anything else?

712
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,740
If Her Highness agrees to all that,

713
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,140
just give me the word.

714
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,300
I'll have my day off in three days.

715
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:30,220
I will reserve a private room
on the top floor of Deshun Inn

716
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,700
and wait for Her Highness.

717
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,900
By the way, before that,

718
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:41,060
tell Her Highness not to let
the Prince Consort know about this.

719
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:46,100
Compared to the Prince Consort,
I am just nothing.

720
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,420
I hope Her Highness
can show some care to me.

721
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,300
Care?

722
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,100
That Cui Yulang.

723
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,340
Why did he mention the Prince Consort
for no reason?

724
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,380
He even wants you
to show some care to him?

725
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,900
He's crazy.

726
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,980
Why would I go wherever he says?

727
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,100
Tell him

728
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,820
to wait for me at Qingyue Restaurant
three days later.

729
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,500
Okay, I know.

730
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,420
I must say,

731
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,780
Her Highness knows how to have fun.

732
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,500
Her Highness also
mentioned something else.

733
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:17,620
What is it?

734
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,020
Tell him

735
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,340
not to harbor any wild thoughts.

736
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,140
Act decently.

737
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,660
I have no interest in him.

738
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,450
[Wenxuan's Abode]

739
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,300
Tong Ye.

740
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,100
What is it, Young Master?

741
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,780
Go to the Princess's Mansion

742
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,580
and ask Qinglan and the others

743
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,100
if the Princess has any plans
on her day off.

744
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,980
Report to me afterward.

745
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,860
Young Master,

746
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,380
you shouldn't have...

747
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,940
I will gather the information you need!

748
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:07,300
Your Highness, Tong said
the Prince Consort wants to meet you.

749
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,060
But I've made an appointment
with Cui Yulang.

750
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,940
What should we do?

751
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:17,660
How about this?

752
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,140
Send someone to tell him

753
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,860
that I have something to do
out of the city today,

754
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,020
and that I'll meet him next time.

755
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,420
Tell him it's official business

756
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,540
and don't take it to heart.

757
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,500
What business would she have
on her day off?

758
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,340
They didn't tell me that exactly.

759
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,060
Young Master,

760
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:39,060
why don't you rest up at home today?

761
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:41,900
No way.

762
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,580
My intuition tells me
something is fishy.

763
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,020
Your Highness, we're being followed.

764
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,060
Let's change the location.

765
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,020
Send someone to tell Cui Yulang

766
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,020
to wait for me at Luwei Pavilion.

767
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,220
Find a place to stop later

768
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,500
so we can all get some rest.

769
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,220
Yes, Your Highness.

770
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,020
Alright.

771
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,620
Given Li Rong's usual tactics,

772
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,180
that carriage must be empty.

773
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:37,940
Wait for me here.

774
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:42,100
[Qingmei Post]

775
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,380
I'll go inside alone.

776
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,180
Yes, Your Highness.

777
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:33,700
Your Highness.

778
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,980
How much more flamboyant can you be?

779
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,420
She's here to meet Cui Yulang?

780
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,140
I should have got him killed
with my sword that day.
