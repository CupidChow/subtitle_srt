00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 38]

5
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,740
I will safeguard this nobleness
on your behalf, Father.

6
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:27,980
Father.

7
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,980
Please simmer down.

8
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:49,740
Rongqing.

9
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,060
I'm glad you have figured it out.

10
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,220
No matter what,

11
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,700
you must remember this.

12
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,140
The Crown Prince is the monarch

13
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,980
and we are his subjects.

14
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,340
As long as the Crown Prince

15
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,660
doesn't violate ethics...

16
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:15,940
I...

17
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,620
I lose my sight.

18
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,620
Rongqing...

19
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,660
Hurry.

20
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,580
Send for a physician.

21
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,220
Father,

22
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,980
there is only one way

23
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,620
to safeguard the nobleness
of the Su Family.

24
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,100
That is to support

25
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,620
a ruler who listens to us.

26
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,180
Otherwise...

27
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,740
our family will be eliminated.

28
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,500
Father, have a rest.

29
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,780
I will return once everything is done.

30
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:13,820
No.

31
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,300
Rong... No.

32
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,100
No.

33
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,460
Grandfather, I wonder
if I could make a request.

34
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,060
According to the ancestral rules,

35
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,580
the patriarch token is inherited
by the legitimate firstborn son.

36
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,020
Second Uncle,
please hand it over to me.

37
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,460
I can't. You are still too young.

38
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,220
If I were to hand
over the patriarch token to you,

39
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,260
I'm afraid something might happen.

40
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,220
Don't worry.

41
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,100
I didn't ask for it

42
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,300
to compete with you
over the family property.

43
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,780
We are facing desperate times as it is

44
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,900
and our family needs a leader.

45
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,820
If I don't take control of these things,

46
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,340
will you, Second Uncle?

47
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,020
I'm not here to joke around.

48
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,380
At any rate,

49
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,660
someone must be chosen
to lead our family.

50
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,860
We won't choose anyone.

51
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,660
Choosing no one

52
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,580
means everyone
has the right to step in.

53
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,020
Second Uncle,
you need to think it through.

54
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,860
Our family and Princess Pingyue
share a deep bond.

55
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,780
If you don't choose anyone to lead,

56
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,820
do you expect the foundation
of our family to sustain

57
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,060
or

58
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,380
do you want to lead us to our demise?

59
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,700
What you are doing now

60
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,500
is bringing destruction to our family!

61
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,220
I know what you are up to.

62
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,540
News from the palace says
that Prince Su is in one piece.

63
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,620
As you have always assisted
the Crown Prince,

64
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,940
you fear His Majesty might dethrone him.

65
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,700
So what you are doing now

66
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,500
is usurping the throne.

67
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,340
Wenxuan.

68
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,540
What will you do

69
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,260
if you are not given
the patriarch token today?

70
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,340
Grandfather,

71
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,460
the Crown Prince is my brother-in-law

72
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,660
and I will not abandon him.

73
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,660
If so,

74
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,500
how confident are you?

75
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,700
Father.

76
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,780
Grandfather.

77
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,900
Prince Su is dead.

78
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,620
And the one in the palace...

79
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,420
He's an impostor.

80
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,820
Besides me, many people

81
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,260
are aware of this.

82
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,820
They can't hide that for long.

83
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,050
The diabolical consort ruined
the pureness of the imperial bloodline.

84
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,420
How high is the chance

85
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,540
do you think that fake Prince Su stands?

86
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,340
Liming, how will you choose?

87
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,460
Father.

88
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,500
I trust Wenxuan.

89
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,140
Pei Liming!

90
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,860
Give him the patriarch token
and the warehouse keys.

91
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,820
Father, he's only a young man.

92
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,060
This isn't his decision.

93
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,300
It's mine.

94
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,820
Give him the patriarch token!

95
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,020
Father, we can't allow him
to repeat past mistakes.

96
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,980
Give him now!

97
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,740
Our family

98
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,900
must stay out of this matter.

99
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,580
As of now, it's imperative

100
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,620
to tie Pei Wenxuan up
and send him to the palace.

101
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,420
Someone!

102
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,100
Pei Lixian,

103
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,140
you use violence
in the ancestral shrine.

104
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,180
What are you trying to do?

105
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,140
To discipline this unworthy descendant
on behalf of our ancestors.

106
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,260
Third Uncle, never mind.

107
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,660
Grandfather.

108
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,420
Second Uncle uses violence
in the ancestral shrine.

109
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,700
Please allow me to ease your burden.

110
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,020
What are you waiting for?

111
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:13,940
Take him down.

112
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,940
Second Uncle, look around.

113
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,260
Who are their swords pointing at?

114
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,060
Here's the patriarch token.

115
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,420
I shall see
who dares lay a finger on me.

116
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,780
Reporting!

117
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,340
The front and back yards
have been surrounded by our men.

118
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,780
Tong Ye.

119
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,380
Second Uncle, this liquor

120
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,140
is what you gave my father back then.

121
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,540
He finished it all.

122
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,820
Today,

123
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,580
I return it to you on his behalf.

124
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:48,900
Wenxuan.

125
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,580
If you insist on taking
the patriarch token,

126
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,300
you can have it.

127
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:17,980
Pei Wenxuan.

128
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,380
Father.

129
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,020
Wenxuan!

130
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:36,980
Wenxuan!

131
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,260
My father is seriously ill.

132
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,020
I will be the acting master
of the Su Family.

133
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,900
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

134
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,620
Seal off the inner courtyard.

135
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,500
Do not allow anyone to approach.

136
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,220
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

137
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,180
Mu Hong.

138
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:33,940
Yes.

139
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,820
Find the First Young Master
and ground him.

140
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,900
Escort the irrelevant clansmen

141
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,820
out of Huajing in batches.

142
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,180
Gather all troops of the Su's Mansion

143
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,700
to stand guard at the South Gate.

144
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,540
Send a messenger to Tianshou Pass

145
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,140
to inform Su Ping about the coup here

146
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,860
and ask him to bring back
8,000 elite soldiers.

147
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:53,740
Yes, sir.

148
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,980
Your Highness,

149
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,580
His Majesty summons you.

150
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,220
A war is looming,

151
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,130
but at least the people in Huajing

152
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,380
can be informed in advance.

153
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,420
Unfortunately, some cities

154
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,780
will desperately
resist the attack yet fail

155
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,940
and the commanders can't
organize evacuations in time.

156
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,740
That's the worst.

157
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,620
Some may lose their lives

158
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,420
the very next day.

159
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,970
[Huajing]

160
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,540
Let's go.

161
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,220
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

162
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,900
You all leave now.

163
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,500
Be careful.

164
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,780
Your Majesty, I will summon
the imperial physician.

165
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,500
Wait.

166
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,940
What time is it now?

167
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,140
It's almost the Xu hour.

168
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,300
We are running out of time.

169
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,180
The Crown Prince is on his way here.

170
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,900
[Hanqiu Palace]

171
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,420
Greetings, Your Majesty.

172
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,860
Stop!

173
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,940
The carriage, stop!

174
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,180
Stop!

175
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,780
Stop!

176
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,540
Stop.

177
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,020
Yes.

178
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,060
Your Highness.

179
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,140
Why are you here?

180
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,460
May I have a word?

181
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,180
Su Ronghua just came to me

182
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,780
and said Su Rongqing rebelled.

183
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,820
Now, the Su Family is under his control.

184
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,500
The Su Family and other noble families
have conspired with Consort Rou.

185
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,980
They mobilized 8,000 elite soldiers
from Tianshou Pass.

186
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,780
Has he taken any action yet?

187
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,740
Not yet.

188
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,540
Not yet?

189
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,460
He's waiting for Chuan to act.

190
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,540
Once Chuan initiates a coup,

191
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,980
he will have a rightful reason
to kill Chuan.

192
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,500
If noble families in the capital
join him,

193
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,740
Su Rongqing has nearly 10,000 soldiers

194
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,020
in Huajing alone.

195
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,060
If more troops of the Su Family
and the Wang Family

196
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,100
from around Huajing
are mobilized tonight,

197
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,220
he can gather

198
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,220
20,000 soldiers altogether
to Huajing within tomorrow.

199
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,700
In that case,

200
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,220
Chuan will definitely lose.

201
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,180
There is only one way left.

202
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,740
That is to agree with Father
to suppress the Shangguan Family

203
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,460
and collaborate with him
if we want any chance of success.

204
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,380
Your Highness,

205
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,540
what should we do now?

206
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,180
Please make your decision.

207
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,820
Your Highness,

208
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,540
if I die in the palace today,

209
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,660
what will you do?

210
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,220
I will go back.

211
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,100
I will return to the palace

212
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,860
and get Li Chuan out.

213
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,420
Don't alert anyone.

214
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,100
Yuan Feiyu.

215
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,060
Head back to see Pei Wenxuan.

216
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,690
Tell him
something happened to me halfway

217
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,580
and ask him to come to my rescue.

218
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,540
Then,

219
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,380
escort as many members
of the Shangguan Family

220
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,020
and the Pei Family as possible
out of the city.

221
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,620
Go.

222
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,700
Yes, Your Highness.

223
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,380
Ya, you have to leave Huajing too.

224
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,810
Your Highness, I...

225
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,700
We must preserve our strength.

226
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,270
As long as the Crown Prince stays alive,

227
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,580
we still have a chance.

228
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,020
Once Xun Chuan arrives,

229
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,740
you will attack the city immediately.

230
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,580
What about you, Your Highness?

231
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,260
I need to stay in the palace

232
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,060
to command the attack.

233
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,580
If no one commands in the palace,

234
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,380
Su Rongqing will soon realize
that Chuan is gone.

235
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,020
Besides, even if he finds out

236
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,260
that I'm inside there,

237
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,740
I still can stall for some time.

238
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,540
That's it.

239
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,340
Make haste. Stop hesitating.

240
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,580
Your Highness, I will return
and notify Lin Feibai

241
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,260
to meet you near the palace

242
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,140
and support you.

243
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:26,780
All right.

244
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,260
Consort Rou commits treason,

245
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,340
intending to overthrow the throne.

246
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,260
[Token]
Her Majesty takes over the palace

247
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,620
and the imperial guards
at the order of His Majesty.

248
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,140
You shall obey.

249
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,820
We will be at Her Majesty's command.

250
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,500
Mr. Pei.

251
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,340
What are you doing here?

252
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,620
Her Highness is in trouble

253
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,820
at an inn outside the city.

254
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,620
She asks you to go there immediately.

255
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,100
Tong Ye.

256
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,540
Lead the troops and stand guard here.

257
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,220
I need to leave the city.
I will be back soon.

258
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,820
Enter the palace now.

259
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,140
Your Majesty.

260
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,340
Mother.

261
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,180
Eunuch Fu,

262
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,500
you have been in the palace
for a long time.

263
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,500
The majority of imperial guards
of His Majesty

264
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,580
have been replaced
by the Shangguan Family.

265
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,820
As of now,

266
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,500
the Hanqiu Palace is under my control.

267
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,140
You should know what to do
to protect yourself, I suppose.

268
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,220
I shall

269
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,700
follow your orders, Your Majesty.

270
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,860
Why are you still standing here?

271
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:08,860
Go in

272
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,700
and make him surrender
the imperial jade seal.

273
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,980
You will ascend the throne
during tomorrow's morning court.

274
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,460
Mother...

275
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,460
I have taken action on your behalf.

276
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,740
If you don't go in now,

277
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,180
he will kill you,

278
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,500
make Li Cheng the Crown Prince,

279
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,340
and execute me, Rong,

280
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,060
and the entire Shangguan Family.

281
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,650
[Hanqiu Palace]

282
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,500
I wanted to give you a chance to choose.

283
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,020
But you ignore it

284
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,820
and show me your answer.

285
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,060
Do you know

286
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,300
you will be thrown into infamy
in history

287
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,940
if you kill me?

288
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,260
That doesn't matter to me.

289
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,460
You are not even scared of that.

290
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,580
It seems...

291
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,020
you want the throne so desperately.

292
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,100
No.

293
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,460
Not you.

294
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,340
It's your mother, sister,

295
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,140
and the Shangguan Family.

296
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,780
All of you want my throne!

297
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:09,940
Father.

298
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,900
The throne means nothing to me.

299
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,980
What baffles me is,

300
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,900
why you can't accept me?

301
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,300
You are my child.

302
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,980
It's not you that I don't accept,

303
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:32,260
but your mother
and the Shangguan Family.

304
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,020
The Shangguan Family is greedy.

305
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,060
They see my Li Family as their puppets

306
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,820
and intend to rule the country with us

307
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,220
by marriage alliance.

308
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,660
They have no feelings.

309
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,700
Do you think
your mother truly loves you?

310
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,380
Do you think the Shangguan Family...

311
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,580
regard you as their family?

312
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,020
No,

313
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,100
they don't.

314
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,060
You are only a tool

315
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,900
they use to control the Great Xia.

316
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,420
What are you doing here?

317
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,660
I'm here to see you for the last time.

318
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,260
Li Ming,

319
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,260
more than half of your guards
have been replaced by people

320
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,780
from the Shangguan Family
at the order of my brother.

321
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,220
Your Hanqiu Palace and the entire palace

322
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,220
are under my control.

323
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,260
I should have predicted

324
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,860
that the Shangguan Family would rebel.

325
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,860
It's just that I didn't expect you

326
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,420
to be so heartless.

327
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,660
When you sent people
to build Beiyan Pagoda for me,

328
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,620
I thought the feelings between us
were genuine.

329
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,980
Because you once said

330
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,700
you would show me
the prettiest stars in the universe.

331
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,940
The stars on the ground

332
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,620
are the prosperous nation you give me.

333
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,900
And the stars in the sky

334
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,820
would be within my reach
when I stood at Beiyan Pagoda.

335
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,420
I thought

336
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,780
I was so close to the love

337
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,500
that everyone yearned for.

338
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,820
But then,

339
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,740
you favored one consort
after another

340
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,660
to keep your power in check.

341
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,740
Beiyan Pagoda...

342
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,460
actually became a joke that mocked me.

343
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,540
When I thought

344
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,380
you were at least Chuan's father,

345
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,460
you supported Li Cheng wholeheartedly

346
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,420
and tried to dethrone Chuan!

347
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,180
What are you waiting for?

348
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,380
Do it now.

349
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,860
Li Chuan.

350
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,580
Many people are waiting for you outside.

351
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,940
A slight delay in your ascension
can change everything.

352
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,580
Hurry.

353
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,380
Shangguan Yue.

354
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,340
He is my son.

355
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,900
Do you think killing his own father
is that easy?

356
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,420
Do it right now!

357
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,500
Foolish woman!

358
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,140
Had I known this day would come,

359
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,820
I would've torn down the Beiyan Pagoda!

360
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,820
Once I kill you,

361
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,660
I will raze it to the ground personally!

362
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,620
I will do it!

363
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,540
Mother!

364
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,700
You are so indecisive.

365
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,980
How can you be the Crown Prince
or even the Emperor?

366
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,620
Kill him
and you will become the Emperor.

367
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,100
The whole country will be yours.

368
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,180
Kill him now!

369
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,180
Put your sword down.

370
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,500
Chuan, put it down.

371
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,180
Why are you back here, Rong?

372
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,220
Rong, you...

373
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:39,860
Mother.

374
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,580
He poisoned Li Cheng to death too.

375
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,460
What did you say?

376
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,980
The Li Cheng in the palace
is an impostor?

377
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:56,820
That's right.

378
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,820
He didn't trust Li Cheng

379
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,100
and intended to control him with poison.

380
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,180
Am I right?

381
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,620
Yes.

382
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,020
Cheng was poisoned by me.

383
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,820
But my intention of controlling him

384
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,020
is somehow for your sake, Chuan.

385
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,740
Li Ming, you don't love anyone.

386
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,020
You only love your throne.

387
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,100
Mother.

388
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,780
Su Rongqing and Xiao Rou
have joined hands

389
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,980
and are waiting outside the city
with their troops now.

390
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,580
Once Chuan commits regicide,

391
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,020
they will kill him
with the excuse of rebellion

392
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,780
and put the fake Li Cheng on the throne.

393
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,660
What? Then...

394
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,700
Chuan and you must
leave the palace right now.

395
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,020
I will stay here.

396
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,660
You are staying here alone?

397
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,020
Yes. You must go now.

398
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,660
- Chuan.
- Chuan!

399
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,540
Chuan.

400
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,260
The chance I offered still counts.

401
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,020
If you help me eliminate
the Shangguan Family,

402
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,740
I will give you the throne right now.

403
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,260
I can also give you the entire nation.

404
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,380
I won't surrender Rong and Mother

405
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,220
to keep myself alive.

406
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,420
I may not be qualified as a crown prince

407
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,300
or even a monarch,

408
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,220
but I don't want to be someone like you.

409
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,620
I want to protect my family.

410
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,460
I want to be with someone I like

411
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,100
and do anything I like.

412
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,220
I won't sacrifice anyone's lives

413
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,180
for my own gain.

414
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,700
I want to be indecisive.

415
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,540
I want to be naive and kind.

416
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,700
I want to hold no grudges.

417
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,540
You are really stupid!

418
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,740
Scold me if you want. I don't care.

419
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,260
You never liked me anyway.

420
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,460
Whatever case it is, Father,

421
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,020
I won't kill you.

422
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,020
That will taint my heart.

423
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,860
Rong, let's leave.

424
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,780
Mother.

425
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,140
Chuan.

426
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:29,980
Chuan!

427
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,620
Chuan.

428
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:37,540
Chuan.

429
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,260
Listen to me.

430
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,700
I can't leave.

431
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,420
I have to disguise myself as you
and stay in the palace

432
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,500
to avoid Su Rongqing's suspicion.

433
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,940
Rong, I'm not leaving.

434
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,300
Either we leave together

435
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,620
or I will stay here with you.

436
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,940
If the troops of the Su Family
and the Xiao Family combine,

437
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,620
we have no chance of winning.

438
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,700
You must leave the city and return
only after gathering reinforcements.

439
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,420
No.

440
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,580
As I said,

441
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,100
I will stay to protect you...

442
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,890
What are you doing? Chuan!

443
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,540
Mother, leave now.

444
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,780
Otherwise, all of us
would be trapped here.

445
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,700
What about you?

446
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:15,100
Rong! Rong!

447
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,020
Where is Her Highness's carriage?

448
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,940
What's going on here?
Where is Her Highness?

449
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,780
She's in the palace.

450
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,220
Why did she go back there?

451
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,140
Su Rongqing may have
led an army of 300,000 soldiers

452
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,140
to ambush in Huajing.

453
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,300
Her Highness is stalling

454
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,740
to send the Crown Prince
out of the palace.

455
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,060
She was also concerned
you might be trapped there,

456
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,780
so she sent me to lure you out.

457
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:47,820
What's this?

458
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,820
Her Highness told me
to give you her handwritten letter

459
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,420
upon your arrival at the inn.

460
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,220
You love me more than your life,

461
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,100
so do me,

462
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,620
and I have no regrets.

463
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,020
By Li Rong.

464
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:04,820
Sir,

465
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,420
Her Highness is doing this
for the big picture.

466
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,460
Who did Su Rongqing contact?

467
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,020
The Wang Family, the Zheng Family,
the Gu Family,

468
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,100
and the Xiao Family
under Consort Rou's lead.

469
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,540
Try every possible means

470
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,380
to track down these families.

471
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,420
Arrest those who have left the city.

472
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,780
As for those who remain,

473
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,780
besiege their mansions.

474
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,780
They probably would bring troops

475
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,860
to surround the palace tomorrow morning,

476
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,020
leaving fewer soldiers
in their mansions.

477
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,180
By then,

478
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,540
capture everyone there,

479
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,300
especially the Su Family
and the Wang Family.

480
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,100
You might get a bad reputation for this.

481
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:39,980
Just do as I say.

482
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,180
You are afraid of me?

483
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,180
I'm not.

484
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,820
You are not afraid of Chuan,

485
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,980
but you fear me.

486
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,820
Why?

487
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,740
You think I will kill you?

488
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,020
And you think he won't do that?

489
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,420
Isn't that true?

490
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,980
He's not like you.

491
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:54,860
Don't worry.

492
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,300
I can easily kill you now.

493
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,560
I don't need to use poison.

494
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,820
Why have you returned?

495
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,580
Did you come back here to die for Chuan?

496
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,300
Where are Consort Rou and Li Cheng?

497
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,580
Why are you asking this?

498
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,900
Honestly, I'm always confused

499
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,580
about what you want.

500
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,140
You want to suppress the noble families

501
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,620
and the Shangguan Family,

502
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,100
but you can't see
Chuan has the same intention as yours.

503
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,620
You have tried so hard to depose him.

504
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,580
Just why?

505
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,500
Despite knowing Li Cheng is an impostor,

506
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,180
you are still willing

507
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:40,820
to pass the throne to him?

508
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,500
Stop your nonsense.

509
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,100
Although Cheng was poisoned,

510
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,810
the poison has been cleared.

511
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,980
No imperial physician could detoxify
the Poison of the Fragrant Beauty.

512
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,620
Didn't you know that when you used it?

513
00:31:59,100 --> 00:31:59,860
You haven't answered

514
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,980
my question.

515
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,100
Why did you do that to Chuan?

516
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,980
Because he's not just a lineage
of the Li Family.

517
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,580
He can never get rid
of the Shangguan Family.

518
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,580
Neither can you.

519
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,020
You are also a lineage
of the Shangguan Family

520
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,340
and can never get away from them...

521
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,620
We are the lineages
of the Shangguan Family,

522
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,260
but are we not your children?

523
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:38,980
Forget it.

524
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,300
Enough about these upsetting things.

525
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,500
Father.

526
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,540
I have a child too.

527
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,980
This is my first child

528
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,580
in nearly forty years.

529
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,260
Forty years?

530
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,180
What are you talking about?

531
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,740
Let me tell you a secret.

532
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,340
In fact...

533
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,540
I don't know why this happened,

534
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,980
but I have lived twice.

535
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,300
Maybe not.

536
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,780
Maybe it's just a dream.

537
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,340
I'm not sure if you came into my dream

538
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,820
or I came into yours.

539
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,820
Are you insane?

540
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,100
I know you won't believe that.

541
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,620
Honestly, you never knew Li Chuan.

542
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,340
You think he's weak.

543
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,620
Do you think he doesn't want
to suppress the noble families?

544
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,300
He was much crueler than you later on.

545
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,420
He went on expeditions to the North,

546
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,620
slaughtered the entire Su Family,

547
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,180
and reformed
the appointment system for officials.

548
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,260
Close the gate!

549
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,740
Close the gate!

550
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,580
Back off!

551
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,140
Ya.

552
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,940
I will go and stop my cousin

553
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,060
and tell him the truth.

554
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,220
Don't worry about me
and don't push yourself too much.

555
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,420
I know.

556
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,860
Take care.

557
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:58,900
Take care.

558
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,180
Be careful.

559
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,100
I will.

560
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,020
Can't bear to let him leave?

561
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,820
We will settle the Crown Prince
and the Empress in a safe place first.

562
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,980
Send someone to contact Xun Chuan

563
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,980
to see where she is.

564
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,500
Then, count the forces outside the city.

565
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,380
We can't stay by Her Highness' side,

566
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,860
but we must save her.

567
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,660
Your Highness.

568
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,820
Soldiers from the Inspectorate Office,
Pei's Mansion, and your mansion

569
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,340
are more than 3,000 altogether

570
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,820
and have gathered
around the Hanqiu Palace.

571
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,300
It seems

572
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,020
you are going all out for this battle.

573
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,300
Not really.

574
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,980
If it's meant to lose,

575
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,460
why don't I surrender directly?

576
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,140
If we fight wars for a few more years...

577
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,460
to eliminate all the noble families

578
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,180
and let the Great Xia collapse,

579
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,580
perhaps a new dynasty

580
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,740
could change the situation.

581
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,420
Don't you think

582
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,260
this is too cruel?

583
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,740
Cruel?

584
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,490
Neither of us wishes
for the Great Xia's destruction.

585
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,460
That's what the people want.

586
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,220
Pei Wenxuan always says

587
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,260
the desire for powers
is triggered by human hearts.

588
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,380
He says I can't understand human hearts.

589
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,420
If I did,

590
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,500
I would be a good ruler.

591
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,780
It's true that you don't.

592
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,300
If you did,

593
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,620
you wouldn't have forced Chuan

594
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,740
and yourself.

595
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:04,610
This palace forces people into demons

596
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,860
and makes them believe
that's what the world is all about.

597
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,060
Then they continue to force others.

598
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,900
Pei Wenxuan is right.

599
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,460
Only if I had realized this sooner.

600
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:31,900
Your Highness.

601
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,860
Your Majesty,
it's time for the morning court.

602
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:43,940
Rong.

603
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,860
You will go on my behalf.

604
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,660
You haven't taken a closer look

605
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,860
at the golden throne.

606
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,420
Go and have a look.

607
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,820
Fulai, draft a decree.

608
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

609
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:15,700
Rong.

610
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,260
Come and sit here.

611
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,020
This jade seal...

612
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,420
You can have it.

613
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,140
What's this?

614
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,300
This belongs to you.

615
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,460
I'm returning it to you.

616
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,340
When you were a month old...

617
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,860
I held a Zhuazhou ritual for you.

618
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,700
You grabbed this jade seal.

619
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,300
It symbolizes power.

620
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,220
I was so happy.

621
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,940
I thought my dear daughter

622
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,340
would become a great figure.

623
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,900
Since then,

624
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,780
I have been carrying this with me.

625
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,660
However, as you grew older

626
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,180
and became more opinionated,

627
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,220
I actually began to fear this jade seal.

628
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,460
I also began to fear the power
in your hands.

629
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:00,100
Sometimes, I wonder

630
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,700
if this jade seal...

631
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:08,380
holds my fear of you

632
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,740
or my love.

633
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,580
That was the first time

634
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,420
I became a father.

635
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,140
When I saw your little hands...

636
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,260
grabbing this jade seal tightly...

637
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,540
I was elated.

638
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,500
Take it.

639
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,100
Rong.

640
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,660
Don't blame me.

641
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,540
How is the situation in the palace?

642
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,100
Mr. Su, are you really confident
about this?

643
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,580
Together with your troops,

644
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,380
we have 30,000 soldiers available now.

645
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,660
The palace is sealed,

646
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,060
but news continues to come out.

647
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,780
The morning court
hasn't been canceled yet.

648
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,620
Perhaps Li Chuan will
announce his ascension

649
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,100
during the morning court.

650
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:58,780
If he dares announce it,

651
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,100
it means His Majesty...

652
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,580
Young Master.

653
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,780
His Majesty sent Fulai over
with a decree

654
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,300
summoning the Su Family,
the Wang Family,

655
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,460
the Gu Family, the Zheng Family,
and the Xiao Family

656
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,700
to the imperial hall.

657
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,580
Everyone, this is our opportunity.

658
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,300
It seems His Majesty
is being held hostage.

659
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:32,660
Li Chuan issues a fake decree

660
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,020
to lure us into negotiation.

661
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,220
However,

662
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,020
before my cousin and Mr. Wang
mobilize the troops,

663
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,180
there are only over 10,000 soldiers
in the city.

664
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,220
Therefore,

665
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,580
please deploy all your forces.

666
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,940
Otherwise, not only can't
we attack the palace,

667
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:52,900
but we might also be captured
during the morning court.

668
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,020
Don't worry.

669
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,940
Since we have decided to ally with you,

670
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,220
we won't hide anything.

671
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,380
Very well.

672
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,100
