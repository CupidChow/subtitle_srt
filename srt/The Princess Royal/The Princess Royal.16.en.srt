[Episode 16]

5
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,460
Pei Wenxuan

6
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,380
has so much on his plate right now.

7
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,460
Can he handle it all?

8
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,620
And you,

9
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,740
do you think you can take charge of it?

10
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,220
I'm genuinely trying to help,

11
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,020
so I take care of it on his behalf.

12
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,740
I don't care...

13
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,460
Mother.

14
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,020
Watch my performance now.

15
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,460
It's just handling the accounts, right?

16
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,100
I'll do it.

17
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,980
Your Highness,

18
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,980
with your noble status...

19
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,340
However noble my status is,

20
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,900
I'm still Wenxuan's wife, aren't I?

21
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,300
Wenxuan is busy with state affairs,

22
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,740
so as his wife, isn't it my duty

23
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,420
to help him with managing accounts

24
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,820
and such matters?

25
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,660
Don't you have many things to do
in the Inspectorate Office?

26
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,740
No matter how hard it is for me,

27
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,660
it's worth it for Wenxuan.

28
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,860
As for the finances,

29
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,780
it's actually not a huge amount.

30
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,060
I already have my own fiefdom,

31
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,420
so I'll manage them all together.

32
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,940
Second Uncle.

33
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,340
Please mind your own business.

34
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,820
Right, Wenxuan?

35
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,380
Yes.

36
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,060
My wife is quite formidable.

37
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,540
Second Uncle,
you'd better not provoke her.

38
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,300
Liming!

39
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,860
Say something.

40
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,500
Give it to them.

41
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,100
Give...

42
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:52,900
Give it to them?

43
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,660
Alright.

44
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,460
I have nothing more to say.

45
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,900
I have nothing to say!

46
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,540
Alright then.

47
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,860
In that case,

48
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,820
I'll send someone tomorrow
to check the accounts

49
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,380
and then move them
into the Princess's Mansion, okay?

50
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,860
Move them into the Princess's Mansion?

51
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,220
Your Highness,

52
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,100
are you suggesting

53
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,540
that Wenxuan would sever ties
with our family altogether?

54
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,180
Third Uncle, you misunderstood.

55
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,860
Her Highness is just checking our assets

56
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,620
and keeping the warehouse keys
on my behalf.

57
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,220
Besides, moving them
into the Princess's Mansion

58
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,380
is only because of her noble status.

59
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,860
Grandfather,

60
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,740
since no one objects,

61
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,700
let's settle it this way.

62
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,780
Those of the same surname
are bound by blood

63
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,980
and there is no bond
stronger than blood ties.

64
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,020
Please, everyone,

65
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,460
I hope we can all support each other
and move forward hand in hand

66
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,660
in the days to come.

67
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,180
I am truly gratified

68
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,420
by Wenxuan's thoughts on this matter.

69
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,460
Let's consider this settled then.

70
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,340
Thank you, Grandfather.

71
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,300
Please hold on.

72
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,140
Wenxuan,

73
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,660
Mother isn't feeling well.
I need to leave with her now.

74
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,100
Slowly.

75
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,180
I'll take my leave now.

76
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:08,860
I'll come visit you another day,
Grandfather.

77
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,580
Good job.

78
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,020
I was so scared.

79
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,620
So stupid.

80
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,620
What was I supposed to do?

81
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,540
You too.

82
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,260
Don't give it to them then
if you are so capable.

83
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,260
Those from the noble families

84
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,060
must have brought
these crucial witnesses here

85
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,020
to kill them once and for all.

86
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,900
Quickly report this to Her Highness.

87
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,340
Yes.

88
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,100
I'll come over tomorrow
to check your assets.

89
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,420
Who knows if Pei Lixian

90
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,220
will stir up trouble again?

91
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,900
Just get whatever you can get.

92
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,420
Pei Lixian is clever.

93
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,300
He won't make trouble
over these trivial matters for you.

94
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,820
Tomorrow night, just send anyone

95
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,140
to check the assets.

96
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,260
Focus on retrieving the land deed.

97
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,180
Got it.

98
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,060
Most of my father's estate is elsewhere.

99
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,580
Just instruct Tuoba Yan

100
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,980
to get them back one by one.

101
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,540
By the way,

102
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,460
are you at ease in asking Tuoba Yan

103
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,820
to manage your father's assets?

104
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,300
Why wouldn't I be at ease?

105
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,540
Tuoba Yan works for you.

106
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,100
And now you and I are on the same side.

107
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,140
So why should I worry?

108
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,460
You said "now."

109
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,020

That wasn't enough. Let's continue.

153
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,700
Your Highness.

154
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,340
Your Highness, bad news.

155
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,700
Something bad has happened.

156
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,380
What is it?

157
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,060
All the witnesses are dead.

158

Your Majesty.

159
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,220
Something bad has happened.

160
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,180
How dare he!

161
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,740
He knew I ordered Pingyue
to investigate the case,

162
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,770
yet he still acted boldly

163
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,060
and committed murder
to erase all evidence.

164
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,740
Your Majesty,

165
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,700
please calm down.

166
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,220
If we look at it
from a different perspective,

167
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,780
the Inspectorate Office

168
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,660
has already played
a deterrent role against them.

169
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,700
You do have a way with words.

170
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,020
From my perspective,

171
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,380
they don't take the Inspectorate Office

172
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,220
seriously at all.

173
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,780
Nevertheless,

174
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,140
it seems the Inspectorate Office
must be kept.

175
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,140
Go

176
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,060
and summon Consort Rou.

177
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,380
Yes, Your Majesty.

178
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,420
Luo Juan, the crucial witness,

179
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,340
will definitely be eliminated
by the noble families.

180
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,220
The establishment
of the Inspectorate Office

181
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,860
poses a significant threat
to the noble families.

182
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,140
So,

183
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,260
they will definitely try to find ways
to force you out.

184
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,860
If you win...

185
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,220
this battle,

186
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,420
the Inspectorate Office's position
will be secure.

187
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,580
But if you lose,

188
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,780
it will be even more difficult
in the future

189
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,860
for His Highness or His Majesty

190
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,620
to establish another force

191
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,260
that is capable
of challenging the noble families.

192
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:05,980
Also...

193
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,260
there will be no hope for our future.

194
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,660
I need to go to the Ministry of Justice.

195
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:18,700
Your Majesty.

196
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,100
If Pingyue can't handle it,

197
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,940
would you dare
to take over the Inspectorate Office?

198
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,460
I and the warriors of the Xiao Family

199
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,260
are all at your command.

200
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,140
Your Highness,

201
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,020
Princess Pingyue has sent someone
to deliver a message.

202
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,740
What did she say?

203
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,620
She wants to see Qin Lang.

204
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,820
- Rong.
- Chuan.

205
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,020
I'll go in with you.

206
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,260
What are you doing here?

207
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,540
You shouldn't have come here.

208
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,180
There are too many people around.
Let's talk inside.

209
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,580
Your Highness, this way, please.

210
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,260
Let's go.

211
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,060
Your Highness,

212
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,660
you need to keep it brief.

213
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,420
They'll switch shifts in an hour.

214
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,580
Please be quick.

215
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,660
Got it.

216
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,180
You may go out and keep watch first.

217
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,060
Yes, Your Highness.

218
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,540
General Qin.

219
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,300
Are you Princess Pingyue
and the Crown Prince?

220
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,700
General Qin.

221
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,060
I'm in charge
of reviewing the Qin Family's case now.

222
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,140
Did you know that?

223
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,420
Your Highness,

224
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,140
did Zhenzhen come to see you?

225
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,300
Your Highness,

226
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,060
is Zhenzhen well?

227
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,700
We don't have much time.

228
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,380
How about you go through the case
from start to finish?

229
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,780
Your Highness,
where would you like me to start?

230
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,820
Huangping County.

231
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,500
This case began with Weng Ping
from the Censorate.

232
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,420
He received a report letter

233
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,660
accusing you of accepting bribes
from the Yang Family

234
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,900
and instructing the Qin Family
to intentionally abandon the city

235
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,900
during the battle occurred
in Huangping County years ago.

236
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,060
Later,

237
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,010
they confirmed it

238
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,540
with the testimony

239
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,700
of your Deputy General Luo Juan
as evidence.

240
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,060
They also used the taels of gold found
in your courtyard

241
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,780
and the letters written by Yang Ye
as supporting evidence.

242
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,420
I initially intended to ask Luo Juan

243
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,420
to testify for you,

244
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,020
but I just learned

245
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,260
that Luo Juan has already died.

246
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,380
Luo Juan is dead?

247
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:46,660
Yes.

248
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,300
All the commanders who participated
in the battle

249
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,260
occurred in Huangping County
have all died.

250
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,540
General Qin,
Her Highness is investigating the case.

251
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,420
We need evidence to overturn it.

252
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,260
You just need to tell us what you know.

253
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,380
Leave the rest to Her Highness and me.

254
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,140
Okay.

255
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,020
Alright.

256
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,180
In the battle occurred
in Huangping County,

257
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,820
there were three thousand soldiers
defending the city

258
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,380
while there were also
three thousand enemies attacking us.

259
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,420
Originally, Yang Ye intended to order us
to defend the city for five days.

260
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,620
However, facing defeat
and unable to withstand the enemy,

261
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,060
we had no choice
but to evacuate the civilians first

262
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,900
and then abandon the city.

263
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,940
You defended the city
while they attacked.

264
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,020
With equal forces, theoretically,
you shouldn't have lost.

265
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,860
Why did you lose?

266
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,980
We didn't have enough soldiers.

267
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,500
Quickly, ask the soldiers
to get some rest.

268
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,020
General.

269
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,940
The provisions and funds arrived?
Excellent!

270
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,220
They've arrived, but...

271
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,660
What's wrong?

272
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,660
General, please take a look.

273
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,500
It's filled with sand inside.

274
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,500
These darn scoundrels!

275
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,220
General.

276
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,860
How many people do we have left?

277
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,460
Including these wounded soldiers,

278
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,340
it totals three thousand.

279
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,540
Here's what we'll do.

280
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,900
Let's rinse the rice thoroughly,

281
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,700
add more water,

282
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,900
and distribute the rice soup
and congee to the soldiers.

283
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,780
We need to sustain ourselves
for as long as possible.

284
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,540
Yes, sir.

285
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,580
Unable to even fill our stomachs,

286
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,460
we may have only half our forces

287
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,140
fit for battle soon.

288
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,700
Later, there were less than two thousand
of them who could fight in the battle.

289
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,700
With provisions and funds
still not arriving,

290
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,380
if we persisted like that,

291
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,340
the remaining soldiers

292
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,260
would be trapped in the city
and eventually starved to death.

293
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,300
Have you reported these issues?

294
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,180
I've previously reported
and explained it.

295
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,420
It should be
at the end of the Military Record.

296
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,060
The Military Record

297
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,780
was likely destroyed
by the noble families long ago.

298
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:24,900
Let's do this instead.

299
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,500
Please write a list

300
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,500
of all relevant personnel for me.

301
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,380
Okay.

302
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,700
Your Highness, I'm done.

303
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,110
[Wang Pingning, Tian Ke, Tong Huangshi]

304
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,580
Your Highness, we have to go now.

305
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,180
Keep an eye on General Qin

306
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,460
and ensure nothing goes wrong.

307
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,540
Your Highness, rest assured.
I've already made the arrangements.

308
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,700
Your Highness, hurry

309
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,980
and leave quickly.

310
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,020
I'll take my leave now.

311
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,780
Your Highness.

312
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,460
Your Highness, how is Zhenzhen

313
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,020
doing right now?

314
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,180
She's quite safe. Please rest assured.

315
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,060
Good. Thank you, Your Highness.

316
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,100
You take care too.

317
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,620
Okay.

318
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,460
Let's go.

319
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,180
Xun Chuan.

320
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:42,900
Yes, Your Highness.

321
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,460
Hurry up and mobilize some manpower.

322
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,340
No matter what,

323
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,700
tonight, we have to get
the Qin Family members

324
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,740
out from the Ministry of Justice.

325
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,540
If there are any issues,

326
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,820
ask them to come to me.

327
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,220
Okay.

328
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,500
Rong, Xun Chuan...

329
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,340
You go back first.

330
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,900
Don't let anyone find out
that you intervened.

331
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,740
Don't worry.

332
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,180
I know how to handle this.

333
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,220
Leave now.

334
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:06,980
Rong.

335
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,020
The Qin Family members must stay alive.

336
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,180
You have my promise.

337
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,340
I'm off.

338
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,460
Walk with me.

339
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,700
Let's go.

340
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,740
Careful.

341
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,660
I really want to walk
while keeping my eyes closed for a bit.

342
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,020
I suddenly realize

343
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,980
that this seems to be the first time

344
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,980
we've ever done
something like this together.

345
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,180
The first year after we got married,

346
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,780
our relationship was still okay, right?

347
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,300
Later on, when things happened,

348
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,900
we often argued.

349
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,620
The only time I felt touched by you
was when I was in prison.

350
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,660
Do you remember?

351
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:11,740
Back then, the Nie Family,

352
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,620
where one of the secondary consorts
of the Crown Prince came from,

353
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,620
committed atrocities.

354
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,460
Chuan was implicated

355
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,060
and I was imprisoned as a result.

356
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,300
The reason you felt touched

357
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,700
was because you thought I would give up

358
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,140
on you and His Highness

359
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,820
and join Consort Rou.

360
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,220
At that time, Chuan asked me
if you would help me.

361
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,500
Honestly, I wasn't sure

362
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,180
because I didn't think

363
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,900
our relationship was that good.

364
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,780
It was all my fault.

365
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,260
I didn't give you a sense of security.

366
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:28,900
Pei Wenxuan.

367
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,260
I want you to take
the Inspectorate Office's and my tokens

368
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,250
and follow the route
the provisions and funds took

369
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,060
to Huangping Town back then.

370
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,020
Transcribe all the records

371
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,900
of the provisions and funds in transit

372
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,740
from the county offices along the way.

373
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,060
Now you trust me?

374
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,660
Don't flatter yourself.

375
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:00,420
You can more or less
put my mind at ease, I suppose.

376
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,140
Today, I interrogated Qin Lang.

377
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,100
They couldn't possibly be unaware of it.

378
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,460
Moreover, Qin Lang
provided a list of names,

379
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,020
which would put him in danger.

380
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,660
I've already arranged
for Xun Chuan to get him out.

381
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,860
Tomorrow in court,

382
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,860
I will also request
to be placed under house arrest.

383
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,580
This isn't the only way.

384
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,980
But it's the best way.

385
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,740
In twenty days,

386
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,420
the Qin Family
is scheduled to be executed.

387
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,700
By then...

388
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,620
can you come back with the evidence?

389
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,940
The journey

390
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,940
might not be safe.

391
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,460
So you must be careful.

392
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,860
If I leave the capital

393
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,860
and investigate the accounts
of the grain depots along the way,

394
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,860
it won't just be unsafe.

395
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,300
It might get me killed.

396
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,100
But it doesn't matter.

397
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,580
I serve at Your Highness's command.

398
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,460
I would always die for you
without hesitation.

399
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,260
I will set out immediately.

400
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,300
Pei Wenxuan.

401
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,540
I'll wait for your return.

402
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,180
There will be a reward
if you handle it well.

403
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,780
Take care.

404
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,860
It's no big deal.

405
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,460
The enemy is approaching, everyone.

406
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,300
By order of Her Highness,

407
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,780
secure the gates!

408
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:21,780
- Yes!
- Yes!

409
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,300
Ms. Xun Chuan.

410
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,060
The Qin Family members have arrived.

411
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,180
Thank you.

412
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,060
Mr. Pei is a civil official,

413
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,500
yet he's traveling day and night
for Her Highness.

414
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,020
Can he take it?

415
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,900
I can barely

416
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,660
feel my legs.

417
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,700
Why hasn't Tian Sheng returned
from buying supplies?

418
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,660
What's taking him so long?

419
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,500
Mr. Pei, I'm back.

420
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:51,660
Take this.

421
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,220
Mr. Pei,

422
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,620
you were drawing when I left,

423
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,820
and now that I'm back,
you're still drawing.

424
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,940
Just sketching casually,

425
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,500
refining my character

426
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,140
and elevating my mind.

427
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,460
By the way, sir,

428
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,660
here's the ointment you asked me to buy.

429
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,300
What ointment?

430
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,020
Shouldn't it be moisturizer?

431
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,980
Did I buy the wrong thing?

432
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,420
No, sir,

433
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,020
you asked me to buy Jinchuang Ointment.

434
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,220
The physician also said

435
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,100
it was normal for your buttocks
and feet to get worn out

436
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,140
from long-distance riding.

437
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,780
What buttocks...

438
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,540
It's not that severe.

439
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,460
I just wore some skin off my feet.

440
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,260
By the way, sir,

441
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,740
the physician specifically instructed

442
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,740
that once you applied
his Jinchuang Ointment

443
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,260
and rested well for two days,
you'd recover.

444
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,580
So, shall we take a break here?

445
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,420
I already said it was not that severe.

446
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,260
I just wore some skin off my foot.

447
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,150
I'll apply
a bit of the Jinchuang Ointment

448
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:54,580
to my foot,

449
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,620
and then we can hit the road.

450
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,460
Yes, sir.

451
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,300
Take it.

452
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,940
I just rubbed some skin off my foot.

453
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,180
I'll be fine once I apply
some Jinchuang Ointment.

454
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,140
Do not tell anyone about this matter.

455
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,180
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

456
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,780
Especially Her Highness.

457
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,300
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

458
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,380
Come here.

459
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,140
Look.

460
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,300
[Rong]

461
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,070
[Su's Mansion]

462
00:23:59,100 --> 00:23:59,700
Please.

463
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:03,860
- Father.
- Master.

464
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,020
The Qin Family members were rescued
from the Ministry of Justice by Li Rong.

465
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,500
Go keep an eye on Pei Wenxuan,

466
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,540
especially towards the direction
leading out of the city.

467
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,060
He will definitely take action.

468
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,020
Yes, sir.

469
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,940
There are many noble families involved
in the Qin Family's case.

470
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,940
If Her Highness keeps investigating
any deeper, she may be in danger.

471
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,460
This won't do.
I must go into the palace immediately

472
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,940
and ask Li Rong to send the people
back to the Ministry of Justice.

473
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,260
Father, please wait.

474
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,500
Let me go meet Princess Pingyue first.

475
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,180
Please wait for my message.

476
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,020
Your Highness, Ms. Xun Chuan is here.

477
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,380
Your Highness.

478
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,380
How is Mr. Qin?

479
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,220
Thankfully,

480
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,060
his life has been saved.

481
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,180
You two may leave now.

482
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,500
Yes, Your Highness.

483
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,140
Take a seat.

484
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,860
He brought you up, right?

485
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,060
Yes.

486
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,780
Haven't you thought

487
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,660
about telling him about your situation?

488
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,180
For now,

489
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,580
I'll hold off on saying too much.

490
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,340
If I tell him,

491
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,500
he'll be worried about me.

492
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,220
Just let him know I'm still alive

493
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,100
and he'll be reassured.

494
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,260
Okay.

495
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,380
Take this name list.

496
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,100
I might be trapped in the palace,

497
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,380
so you'll have two things to do.

498
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,980
First, protect the Qin Family members.

499
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,660
Don't allow anyone to take them away

500
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,420
from the Princess's Mansion.

501
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,540
Got it.

502
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,780
Second, go and see Shangguan Ya.

503
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,180
Sort out the suitable candidates
from this list

504
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,300
and obtain testimony from witnesses

505
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,100
who embezzled military provisions
and funds in Huangping County back then.

506
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,180
Yes.

507
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,900
[Princess's Mansion]

508
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,130
The Ministry of Justice
is handling a case

509
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,020
and we are here to apprehend fugitives.

510
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,940
Your Highness. Your Highness,

511
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,340
it's Mr. Su

512
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,460
who has come with people
from the Ministry of Justice.

513
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,580
They say that they want to see you.

514
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:33,860
Don't panic.

515
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:39,980
Help me get changed.

516
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,180
Sir, we've been followed.

517
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,500
Find an inn up ahead.

518
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,420
We'll get some rest.

519
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,100
Rest?

520
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:50,740
Yes.

521
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,740
[Princess's Mansion]

522
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,940
Mr. Su, you're showing
your authority here.

523
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,010
You've brought so many people

524
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,500
to my mansion this early in the morning.

525
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,500
May I ask what the reason for this is?

526
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,660
Your Highness.

527
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,140
The prisoners detained
by the Ministry of Justice

528
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,580
has somehow been brought
to your mansion.

529
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,700
According to our laws,

530
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,220
this action violates
national regulations.

531
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,500
It would be best
if you handed over the prisoners.

532
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,180
If you do, I will pretend this incident

533
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,620
of breaking into the jail
and rescuing prisoners never happened.

534
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:30,900
Breaking into the jail
and rescuing prisoners?

535
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:32,860
The Qin Family's case

536
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,180
is being investigated
by my Inspectorate Office.

537
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,380
Now, someone I need to interrogate
is in danger,

538
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,740
so I have specially brought them here
for interrogation and protection.

539
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,820
How can this be called
breaking into the jail?

540
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,820
Your Highness, even if you
need to interrogate a prisoner,

541
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,900
you must follow
the proper legal procedures

542
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,500
and obtain approval
from the relevant officials.

543
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,460
You should hand them over.

544
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,140
You must know this.

545
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,860
The Inspectorate Office...

546
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,540
has not been fully established yet.

547
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,860
Your Highness,

548
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,100
this is the only way I can protect you.

549
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,740
Are you threatening me?

550
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,380
So you are threatening me.

551
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,180
Your Highness, I am doing this
for your own good.

552
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,260
You're not doing this for my benefit

553
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,900
but for the Su Family...

554
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,820
and the power of the noble families
behind you.

555
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:45,820
Mr. Su.

556
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,580
It's natural for people
to do things for their own good.

557
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,260
You don't need
to justify yourself so grandly.

558
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,260
You don't need to threaten me either.

559
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,060
If you want to complain, go ahead.

560
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,900
The morning court is about to begin

561
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,660
and I'll be waiting for you
to complain about me

562
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,500
in the hall.

563
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,980
Why don't you believe me?

564
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,180
Why do you always

565
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,980
interpret everyone's good intentions

566
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,940
as malicious intention?

567
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,820
Everything you're doing now

568
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,500
will only cause harm
without any benefit.

569
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,740
What are you seeking?

570
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,660
What am I seeking?

571
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,940
I suppose I am seeking peace of mind.

with the noble families

and not establish
the Inspectorate Office

607
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,060
or investigate the Qin Family's case.

608
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,180
But my pursuit of power

609
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,180
isn't about elevating myself
above others.

610
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,340
It's about living in a world

611
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,460
that aligns with my values.

612
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,820
It's a world of justice and fairness.

613
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,700
Fairness.

614
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,700
The word fairness

615
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:04,460
is too precious

616
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,660

or try to stop me.

619
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,820
Your persuasion won't change my mind,
nor can you prevent me.

620

If you truly disagree...

621
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,420
feel free to confront me directly.

622
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,780
The Crown Prince and I
are not on the same path.

623
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,020
I will walk

624
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,740

00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:07,980

00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,780
How come only you two are here?

627
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,660
Where are the others?

628
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,980
They're having diarrhea

629
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,900
from the change in environment,

630
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,660
so they won't be dining with you.

631
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,420
Got it. Sit down and eat.

632
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,460
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,860
Pei Wenxuan's purpose on this trip

634
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,420
must be to collect the Military Record.

635
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,060
Since he won't work for us,

636
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,700
he must be eliminated.

637
00:33:59,140 --> 00:33:59,860
Pingyue,

638
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,340
last night, I received a memorial

639
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,860
reporting that you broke
into the Ministry of Justice at night

640
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,020
and took away the entire Qin Family.

641
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,540
What?

642
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,570
Has it become your habit

643
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,140
to cause trouble
at the Ministry of Justice now?

644
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,500
Your Majesty,
please punish Her Highness severely.

645
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,900
Please punish her severely.

646
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,820
Please punish her severely.

647
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,260
Strip her of her fiefdom
and punish her severely.

648
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,620
Pingyue, you heard them
and you saw their reaction.

649
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,300
After causing such a big trouble,

650
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,220
have you managed to find anything?

651
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,220
Not yet.

652
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,820
However, during the investigation,

653
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,140
I found that all the witnesses
had been killed

654
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:44,540
and more of the evidence
had been destroyed.

655
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,940
I'm still investigating.

656
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,620
Please give me some more time, Father.

657
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,340
They are actually all dead?

658
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,540
It was on the outskirts of the city.

659
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,940
Their corpses were left in the wild
after they were all killed.

660
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,620
Father,

661
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,420
if the witnesses of a case

662
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,620
were all killed,

663
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,500
don't you think there must be
something wrong with the case?

664
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,740
Your Majesty, the witnesses are dead,

665
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,220
but the evidence is still there.

666
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,220
Yang Ye's letters are verified.

667
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,140
The taels of gold they took as bribes

668
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,860
were also found in the Qin's mansion.

669
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,340
These pieces of evidence
have been verified

670
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,940
by the Censorate, Ministry of Justice,
and Court of Judicial Review.

671
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,900
Do you think

672
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,180
that all these three organizations
are deceiving you here?

673
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,900
Isn't that possible?

674
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,980
When I established
the Inspectorate Office,

675
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:43,500
what you've been thinking
is to seize power...

676
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,060
and make me yield.

677
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,660
You are the Minister
of the Ministry of Justice.

678
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,020
When faced with such a case
that's full of doubts,

679
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,380
you're not thinking
about how to investigate it

680
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,740
to uncover the truth.

681
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,700
Yet you only think
about playing with power and influence.

682
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,940
You don't take people's lives
seriously at all.

683
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,540
How can I not be furious?

684
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,100
I know very well
what you are planning to do.

685
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,820
But let me tell you.

686
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,580
The Qin Family
who you unjustly seek to destroy

687
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,340
are not just a few ministers

688
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,420
or a few living and breathing people.

689
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,060
They are the walls defending our border

690
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,340
and the backbone of the Great Xia.

691
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,220
What you seek to ruin today

692
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,420
is the prosperity
and future of the Great Xia.

693
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,580
Therefore...

694
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,700
I will never back down.

695
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,220
Go after them!

696
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:44,770
I'll bear the responsibility

697
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:45,820
for intruding
into the Ministry of Justice.

698
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,380
But let me ask you this.

699
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,740
Do you dare to leave

700
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,380
the Qin Family members at my place?

701
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,940
Do you dare to let me investigate...

702
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,140
the Qin Family's case?

703
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,660
Since you claim
that the death of witnesses

704
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,140
has no connection
to the Qin Family's case,

705
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,380
then why are you afraid
of my investigation?

706
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:09,300
Your Majesty, it's not that I'm afraid
of Her Highness investigating the case,

707
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,900
I'm just worried
that she'd continue to cause trouble.

708
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,060
What if I vouch for her?

709
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:19,500
I'm afraid you can't
restrain Princess Pingyue.

710
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,060
What do you want then?

711
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,940
I'll definitely continue to investigate
the Qin Family's case.

712
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:38,460
You still need to be punished.

713
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,420
Your Majesty,

714
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,860
as the Minister
of the Ministry of Justice,

715
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,580
I cannot tolerate someone
flagrantly disregarding the law.

716
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,940
Even if you are a princess,

717
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:53,180
you should still abide
by the principles set by His Majesty.

718
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,300
Very well.

719
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,180
I will do as you wish, Mr. Xie.

720
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,820
Father,

721
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,100
I was wrong to intrude
into the Ministry of Justice.

722
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,620
I willingly accept the punishment
of being flogged thirty times

723
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,100
and reciting scriptures
at Beiyan Pagoda for a month.

724
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,620
However, the Ministry of Justices
failed in their duties

725
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,500
by not adequately protecting
key witnesses,

726
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,140
indirectly leading to their deaths.

727
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,860
This is their first wrongdoing.

728
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,300
Father appointed me to take charge
of the Inspectorate Office,

729
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,620
but the Ministry of Justices
refused to follow imperial orders,

730
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,340
did not fully cooperate
with the investigation.

731
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,020
Instead, under the guise of regulations,

732
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,660
they obstructed me in every way,

733
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,700
disregarding Father's authority.

734
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,580
This is their second wrongdoing.

735
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:36,660
Your Majesty...

736
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,770
Now, upon learning of the deaths

737
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:39,340
of the witnesses
and the doubts in this case,

738
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,220
they have neglected their duties,
refusing to investigate thoroughly.

739
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,900
This is their third wrongdoing.

740
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,140
That's completely nonsense.

741
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,220
Mr. Xie is the Minister
of the Ministry of Justice

742
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,100
and he's in charge of it.

743
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,980
Yet now, the Ministry of Justice
is plagued with numerous problems.

744
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,020
Mr. Xie has to be held accountable.

745
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,740
I voluntarily accept my punishment.

746
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:57,100
However, cleaning up the Ministry
of Justice is imperative.

747
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,220
Although these three wrongdoings

748
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,860
are mainly shown
through the Qin Family's case,

749
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,340
the overall situation
can still be deduced.

750
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,660
The Ministry of Justice's usual ways
of handling cases

751
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,220
are indeed harmful to the state.

752
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,980
Father,
please thoroughly investigate them

753
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,140
without any leniency.

754
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,620
My niece is different now.

755
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,740
What Her Highness said is reasonable.

756
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,460
I request you to thoroughly investigate

757
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,460
those in the Ministry of Justice,
Your Majesty.

758
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,720
- Please punish
- Please punish

759
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,580
- the Ministry of Justice severely.
- the Ministry of Justice severely.

760
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,700
Father.

761
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:27,900
Since I've already

762
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,540
intervened in the Qin Family's case,

763
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,860
I will not quit so easily.

764
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,260
Please grant me another twenty days.

765
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,140
Your Majesty, please don't...

766
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,140
If nothing is uncovered...

767
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,860
after twenty days,

768
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:45,420
it will prove that there is no injustice
in the Qin Family's case

769
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,100
and that I have been unreasonable.

770
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,220
I shall willingly accept my punishment

771
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,060
of being expelled from the capital
and return to my fiefdom.

772
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,900
I'll never enter the capital again.

773
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,620
Your request is granted.

774
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:03,940
Your Highness.

775
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:07,860
[Beiyan Pagoda]

776
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:08,900
Guard our residence.

777
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,740
As soon as you hear something
from my husband,

778
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,020
come and let me know.

779
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,740
Yes, Your Highness.

780
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,420
Rong has completely betrayed
the Shangguan Family.

781
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,900
As her mother, did you know this?

782
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:36,900
I don't know

783
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,100
what happened to this child.

784
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,620
Ever since her wedding day,

785
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,140
it's like she's become
a different person.

786
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:49,260
It seems Pei Wenxuan
has had a significant influence on her.

787
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,620
It seems

788
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,940
to be the only explanation.

789
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,900
You should go to Beiyan Pagoda
and tell her

790
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,380
not to wait for Pei Wenxuan.
