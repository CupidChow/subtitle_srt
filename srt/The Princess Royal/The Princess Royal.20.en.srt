00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,950
[Adapted from Mo Shu Bai's novel,
The Princess Royal on jjwxc.net]

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,020
[This is a work of fiction.]

4
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 20]

5
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,060
It seems

6
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,060
that no one has sincerely confessed
their feelings to you.

7
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,860
Aren't you the same?

8
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,060
Of course not.

9
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,060
Many people confessed
their feelings to me before.

10
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,500
Who are you talking about? Su Rongqing?

11
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,580
No.

12
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,340
Don't overthink it.

13
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,380
They're just nobodies

14
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,900
who think they're attractive

15
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,220
and want to offer themselves to me

16
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,780
to gain a promising future.

17
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,420
Offer themselves to you?

18
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,620
Did they have a death wish?

19
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,900
What's that supposed to mean?

20
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,860
Nothing.

21
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,340
I'm just so charming, you know.

22
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,780
Yes, you're so charming.

23
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,420
But I do wonder,

24
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,700
how exactly did these people
offer themselves to you?

25
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,140
Why are you asking about that?

26
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,020
I just saw in this book

27
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,220
that the scholar went to great lengths,

28
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,500
even choosing a special place,

29
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,700
just to confess his feelings.
Was that really necessary?

30
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,220
It depends
on whether they are attentive.

31
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,260
If they do,
they'll go to even greater lengths.

32
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,540
If they don't,

33
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,020
they might not even bother
to say they like you.

34
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,380
So, what counts
as truly being attentive?

35
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,820
When it comes to being attentive,

36
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,460
you should just show
that you really care.

37
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,220
How to show that I really care then?

38
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,660
Do you remember

39
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,100
that there were always peonies
at my mansion every winter?

40
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,060
That was because Su Rongqing thought

41
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,500
I liked peonies
and didn't like plum blossoms.

42
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,620
So every winter,

43
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,300
he cultivated peonies in the greenhouse.

44
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,180
At that time, I felt

45
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,660
that maybe it was called attentive.

46
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,980
What's the use of planting peonies then?

47
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,540
What you like is actually buttercups.

48
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,060
How do you know?

49
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,780
Have a guess.

50
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,260
I don't think I've ever told anyone.

51
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,660
Mother always taught me from a young age

52
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,300
not to let anyone know what I like,

53
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,340
even if it's just a flower.

54
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,460
Your mother was right.

55
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,060
Dig in.

56
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:46,940
Your Highness.

57
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,380
You mentioned earlier
that you wanted to go out for a trip.

58
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,580
Have you chosen a place?

59
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,220
Not yet.

60
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,500
I've actually found a place
with a nice view.

61
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,980
Shall we go there?

62
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,620
Where do you want me to go?

63
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,860
Butterfly Gorge.

64
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,020
Butterfly Gorge?

65
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,780
Why there?

66
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,300
Because the scenery there is nice.

67
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,500
Sure.

68
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,140
I also want to go there.

69
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,620
Perfect then.

70
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:33,330
I think

71
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,420
it's because I've been investigating
the case recently,

72
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,780
this chest of gold

73
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,420
was left at my gate.

74
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,180
Your Majesty,
if I were a bit weak-willed,

75
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,260
I might have fallen for their trap.

76
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,140
I dare not keep it to myself,

77
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,620
so I've decided to hand it over
to the national treasury.

78
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,020
Good.

79
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,540
Very good.

80
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,340
If it wasn't for this case,

81
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,600
I wouldn't have known

82
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,300
that our court officials,
both civil and military,

83
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,260
are corrupt to such an extent,

84
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,180
rotting from the inside out.

85
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,500
It seems

86
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,380
I must perform a thorough cleansing.

87
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,580
Your Majesty,

88
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,960
in this case,
a total of seventy-eight officials

89
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,700
are involved.

90
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,820
According to the laws of the Great Xia,

91
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,580
I recommend demoting
forty-eight of them,

92
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,300
exiling twenty-three of them,

93
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,820
and executing seven of them.

94
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,780
The full list is here.
Please decide, Your Majesty.

95
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:30,740
I approve.

96
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,780
Your Majesty.

97
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,500
Your Majesty, please think twice.

98
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,660
- Your Majesty, it's not advisable.
- Your Majesty, please think twice.

99
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,420
Your Majesty,
it's absolutely not advisable.

100
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,860
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

101
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,780
The morning court is dismissed.

102
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,580
- Take care, Your Majesty.
- Take care, Your Majesty.

103
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,340
Young Master, we've arrived.

104
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:48,900
Take a look.

105
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,460
Think about how to set up the venue.

106
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,700
Not bad.

107
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,820
I want to cover the entire gorge
with fresh flowers.

108
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,460
What are you doing?

109
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,060
I just want to see
if you're having a fever.

110
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,020
What do you mean?

111
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,660
You've just got the family fortune back.

112
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,460
Now you want to squander it like this?

113
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,300
Covering the entire gorge with flowers?

114
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,260
Do you know how much that will cost?

115
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,900
All you care about is money.

116
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,900
Money is just a worldly possession,
you know?

117
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,180
I do.

118
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,260
When I say cover the gorge with flowers,
I want it covered with flowers.

119
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,820
Just do as I say.

120
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,180
Miss Shangguan, everything
has already been arranged in the back.

121
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,660
It's still early in the day.

122
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,380
Let's hurry and find the next spot.

123
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,900
I remember there's another one ahead.

124
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:39,900
Okay.

125
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,500
Miss Shangguan,

126
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,740
if I remember correctly,

127
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,660
this matter was not notified
to the Prince Consort.

128
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,460
Stop.

129
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,660
Unload the stuff.

130
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,060
Your Highness.

131
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,300
Have you mentioned
setting an ambush at Butterfly Gorge

132
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,460
with the Prince Consort?

133
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,380
What's wrong?

134
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,140
It seems like
there's another group of people

135
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,220
doing something else
at Butterfly Gorge today.

136
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,140
Something else?

137
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,140
Do you know who's behind it?

138
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,020
I thought you already knew.

139
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,140
It seems to be
the Prince Consort's people.

140
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,380
The Prince Consort?

141
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,460
What are his people doing there?

142
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,940
We're not sure yet,

143
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,100
but today,

144
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,580
they've brought
in a large quantity of flowers.

145
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,140
It seems they're setting up something.

146
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,420
A large quantity of flowers?

147
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,300
Then lots of people
may have noticed it, right?

148
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:44,980
Exactly.

149
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,300
I was worried about you going out,

150
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,620
but now

151
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,060
with what the Prince Consort
has done today,

152
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,460
it has surely startled our enemies.

153
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,540
Pei Wenxuan is indeed smart.

154
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,100
He couldn't be deceived after all.

155
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,980
No wonder he wanted
to make an appointment with me there.

156
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,260
I thought it was just a coincidence,

157
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,140
but it seems he was trying
to send me a message.

158
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,700
The Prince Consort is a clever man.

159
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,740
Seeing you have come this far,

160
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,340
he knows he can't stop you,

161
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,740
so he might as well help you.

162
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,060
If it succeeds,
everyone will be rewarded.

163
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,580
What is it?

164
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,860
I know what you've done

165
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,420
at Butterfly Gorge.

166
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,420
Your Highness, you mean...

167
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,500
I really didn't expect you to do that.

168
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,820
Is Her Highness

169
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,300
keeping an eye on me all the time?

170
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,060
She already knows in advance.

171
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,740
Since you already know it,

172
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,220
do you still plan to join me?

173
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,300
Of course.

174
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,260
You've put in so much effort.

175
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,140
I definitely will go.

176
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,500
But remember.

177
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,460
Make sure you do a good job.

178
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,700
With Her Highness's intelligence,

179
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,500
she naturally knows what I'm thinking.

180
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,100
She didn't refuse.

181
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,540
Is this her way

182
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,460
of showing me that she's accepted me?

183
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,260
Your Highness, I won't disappoint you.

184
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,060
I knew you understood me best.

185
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,540
I'm hungry. Let's go and eat.

186
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
Here. See if it's still hot.

187
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,020
Her demeanor

188
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,860
suggests high expectations.

189
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,620
What if it's not what she wants?

190
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:55,820
Where is he?

191
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:58,980
Jinglan.

192
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,620
Yes.

193
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,620
Coming, Your Highness.

194
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,140
You are awake, Your Highness.

195
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,060
Where's the Prince Consort?

196
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,340
His Highness woke up before dawn.

197
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,740
He specifically told me

198
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,020
not to wake you up,

199
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,340
hoping you could sleep a little longer.

200
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,580
Do you know how many people
he brought out?

201
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,100
His Highness didn't say,

202
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,780
but he looked quite mysterious.

203
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,300
Help me get cleaned up.

204
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,500
I didn't expect the Prince Consort
to be so romantic,

205
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,260
creating a sea of flowers.

206
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,540
Unfortunately,

207
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,100
it's about
to turn into a bloody romance soon.

208
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,820
Your Highness,
with so many people with you,

209
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,260
who would dare to approach you?

210
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,780
If I didn't bring so many people,

211
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,660
they wouldn't dare to come near.

212
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,580
Your Highness,
I don't quite understand what you mean.

213
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,940
Think about it. Given my current status

214
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,340
and the critical stage of the case,

215
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,940
if I don't take
strict precautions around me,

216
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,220
there will surely be a hidden move.

217
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,180
Compared to overt strength,

218
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,270
covert arrangements

219
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,340
are what truly intimidate
those assassins.

220
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,740
They are here.

221
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,340
Your Highness, this carriage
won't be shot through, will it?

222
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,060
Don't worry.

223
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,460
This carriage has been reinforced.

224
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,540
Arrows won't pierce through it.

225
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,300
Once they've exhausted their arrows,

226
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,740
they'll surely charge out.

227
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,420
That's when we'll lure them
into our trap.

228
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,060
Your Highness, get on the horse.

229
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,060
Go after her!

230
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:36,940
Hurry! Stop!

231
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,700
Hurry!

232
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,740
Protect Her Highness.

233
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,060
Madam, they have already taken action.

234
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,220
Everyone get ready.

235
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,260
Wait for my command.

236
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,420
Prepare to drop the rocks
once Her Highness has passed.

237
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,020
Yes.

238
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,420
Let's go.

239
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,660
Ya, capture them alive!

240
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,260
Get ready to drop the rocks.

241
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,180
Drop them!

242
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,340
- Stop!
- Stop!

243
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,180
Stop!

244
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:31,900
Stop!

245
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:39,980
Pei Wenxuan.

246
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,900
Young Master, run quickly!

247
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,500
There are many assassins
coming from that direction.

248
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,260
Yes, let's go that way...

249
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,460
Young Master, don't run that way.

250
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,460
It's dangerous!

251
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,940
Pei Wenxuan!

252
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,700
They've really spent huge sums of money
on getting people to kill me.

253
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,900
They sent so many assassins.

254
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,340
Where are your people?

255
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,940
Young Master, watch out!

256
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,820
Protect Her Highness.

257
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,500
Set the fire!

258
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,820
Just hold on a little longer.

259
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,100
We're almost at the cave we've prepared.

260
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,540
It looks like Her Highness
has succeeded.

261
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,260
Have the clothes been prepared
for Her Highness and the Prince Consort?

262
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,700
They were put in the cave beforehand.

263
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,380
Good.

264
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,820
You all stay here

265
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,860
and guard the people we captured.

266
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,180
I'll go meet up with Her Highness first.

267
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:05,820
- Yes.
- Yes.

268
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,620
Come on.

269
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,860
I'll handle it myself.

270
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,220
Can you manage?

271
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,740
Let me do it.

272
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,860
I'll do it myself.

273
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,860
Why did you risk your life

274
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,660
to shield me earlier?

275
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,340
Did you think...

276
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,980
I would abandon you?

277
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,340
Do you still feel cold?

278
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,420
You should put on some more clothes.

279
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,100
When you're injured,
you're definitely sensitive to the cold.

280
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,460
What exactly is wrong with you?

281
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,860
Were you

282
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,340
trying to tell me something just now?

283
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,020
What happened today

284
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,620
was all arranged by you, right?

285
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,940
Didn't you already know?

286
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,420
Don't be angry.

287
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,180
I know what I'm doing.

288
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,380
Just now, I split their people
into two groups.

289
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,620
A small part of them
is detained outside,

290
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,520
allowing Shangguan Ya

291
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,980
to capture some of them
and bring them back.

292
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,340
This secures the evidence
of their assassination attempt.

293
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,820
I simply can't afford
to waste any more time with them.

294
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,540
They keep making this kind of moves
from time to time

295
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,300
and I can't be on guard every day.

296
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,900
So, I lured them out

297
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,020
to capture them all at once.

298
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,340
Can you please say something?

299
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,940
Using yourself as bait

300
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,780
is too risky.

301
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,980
Please don't do this again
in the future.

302
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,940
Got it. I won't do it again.

303
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,780
Just bear with it a little longer.

304
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,220
Shangguan Ya
should be coming to get us soon.

305
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,780
Later, you should go back
and treat your wounds.

306
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,020
He wears his hair down today.

307
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,980
He is also especially

308
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,020
wearing the white attire I once praised.

309
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,780
It seems
he has dressed up especially today.

310
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,860
Your Highness.

311
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,380
I'm here.

312
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,060
Hurry. They are here.

313
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,300
Your Highness.

314
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,540
Your Highness. Young Master.

315
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,260
Are you alright?

316
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:57,980
I'm fine.

317
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,780
Young Master, you...

318
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,020
- How did it go?
- Are you badly injured?

319
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,060
Your Highness, we've made a big success.

320
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,340
We captured twelve of them alive,

321
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,020
including...

322
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,700
some from the Seven-star Sect.

323
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,700
Seven-star Sect?

324
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,460
Take them back for interrogation.

325
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,250
Bring the bodies back too

326
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,460
and investigate
each one of them thoroughly.

327
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,140
Yes, Your Highness.

328
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,780
Jingmei, take the Prince Consort back
to rest and recuperate.

329
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,940
I'll handle these matters
and return shortly.

330
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,780
No need.

331
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,540
Tong Ye.

332
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,740
Let's go.

333
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,820
Your Highness, we'll...

334
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,540
Young Master, slowly.

335
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,220
Your Highness,

336
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,300
why does the Prince Consort
seem a bit upset?

337
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,100
Let's go.

338
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,540
Go.

339
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,820
Your Highness.

340
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,300
Hurry.

341
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,540
- Hurry up and move.
- Go.

342
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:57,980
Keep up.

343
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,540
Move faster.

344
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,740
Your Highness,
where did the Prince Consort

345
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,500
get all these flowers?

346
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,140
This is Pei Wenxuan's favorite guqin.

347
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,820
The buttercups that cover the mountain

348
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,060
and his favorite guqin.

349
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,820
If he was only cooperating with me
to lure the enemy,

350
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,580
why would he have bothered
with such elaborate arrangements?

351
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,100
Your Highness,
why are you still standing there?

352
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,340
Hurry up and go after him.

353
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,620
Go after him?

354
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,140
He's clearly showing his love for you.

355
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,260
You, behaving like this,
will only hurt him more.

356
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,060
Hurry and go.

357
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,620
Don't push me.

358
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,700
Pei Wenxuan!

359
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,540
Your guqin.

360
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,540
Since the strings
of the guqin have been broken,

361
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,380
then just throw it away.

362
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,300
You've kept this guqin
for a long time though.

363
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,940
A little repair
will make it usable again.

364
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,140
I've repaired it many times already.

365
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:13,980
There's no need anymore.

366
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,780
Your Highness.

367
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,300
I've been preparing

368
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,300
for a long time for today.

369
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,140
These buttercups...

370
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,300
I actually asked someone
to cultivate them at great expense

371
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,020
before our wedding.

372
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,540
They just weren't mature back then,

373
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,820
and now they are.

374
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,780
As for the clothes...

375
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,460
they're the ones
you once praised in the past.

376
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,500
Everything was prepared

377
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,180
according to your preferences.

378
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,100
I was afraid you might not like it.

379
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,420
Your Highness.

380
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,340
You should have told me.

381
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,740
I thought you knew already.

382
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,020
I thought with your keen mind

383
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,260
and perceptiveness,
you would have figured it out.

384
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,340
You'd just experienced
an assassination attempt,

385
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,620
yet I wanted to take you out.

386
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,780
I thought you
had already secretly investigated me,

387
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,300
so you were cooperating with me
like this,

388
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,260
making a big show
of bringing flowers here.

389
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,900
I really didn't expect you...

390
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,820
to lose your usual composure.

391
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,060
You are right.

392
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,540
I didn't understand before

393
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,340
why you resisted love so strongly.

394
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,980
Now I see.

395
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,540
When there's someone in your heart,

396
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,980
it's hard not to lose composure.

397
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,300
I noticed your unusual behavior before,

398
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,140
but I genuinely thought

399
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,380
you were showing goodwill towards me.

400
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,260
Now it's clear

401
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,620
that I lost my sense of proportion.

402
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,380
And I almost

403
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,980
ruined your plans.

404
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,020
It's my fault.

405
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,700
But rest assured, Your Highness.

406
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,180
From now on...

407
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,180
I won't lose my composure
like this again.

408
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,500
Quarrel.

409
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:55,980
No quarrel.

410
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,580
Quarrel.

411
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,580
Pei Wenxuan.

412
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,820
Who gave you the right
to decide whether we're friends or not?

413
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,060
Now you don't want
to make friends with me,

414
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:04,820
so we must do that as you wish?

415
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,380
You come and go as you please.

416
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,380
Have you ever asked me?

417
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,420
Who do you think you are
to act this way with me?

418
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,980
Yes, I have no right.

419
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,300
I never had any right.

420
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,780
But Li Rong,

421
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,500
you never had me in your heart before.

422
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,100
I don't know

423
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,340
how to get into your heart now.

424
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,460
Even if you don't have me in your heart,

425
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,420
does that mean I have no right
to like you, accompany you,

426
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,660

was arranged by him for Her Highness.

504
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,220
Judging by today's situation,

505
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,060
Her Highness
doesn't seem to appreciate it.

00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,300

Yes, Your Highness.

519
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,700

520
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,220

526
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,700
have such a good relationship?

527
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,060
I thought you were on your day off,
Mr. Su?

528
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,020
I heard that something happened to you

529
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,340

530
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,020
I heard you were attacked

531
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,740

of the Ministry of Justice

532
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,620
to investigate thoroughly.

533

534
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,540
You didn't come
until everything was settled.

535
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,140
Quite the timing, isn't it?

536
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,220
Miss Shangguan,
there's no need for such sarcasm.

537
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,440
You and the Prince Consort

538
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,380
have both been attacked
one after the other.

539
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,280
The Ministry of Justice is willing

540
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,820
to continue assisting
in the investigation.

541
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,540
As for today's assassination attempt,

542
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,700
I can only offer a reminder.

543
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,700
Your Highness,
please be careful in all things

544
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,660
and seek verification cautiously.

545
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,380
Thank you for the reminder.

546
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,460

investigate this matter thoroughly.

547

the Su Family,

549
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,260

550
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,900
I will ensure your safety.

551
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,420
Thank you.

552
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,020
[Inspectorate Office]

553
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,460
Your Highness,
this person was determined to die.

554
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,860
There was even a poison sac
hidden in his mouth,

555
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,300
which was already removed.

556
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,020
All his belongings are over there.

557
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,660
This is...

558
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,780
It's actually you.

559
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,920
You're Lin Feibai,
the Deputy Sect Leader

560
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,140
of the most elite assassin organization

561
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,070
in the martial world,

562
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:22,140
the Seven-star Sect.

563
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:29,100
They've even hired you.

564
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,020
They are really sparing no expense.

565
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,580
No wonder they were so bold.

566
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,540
It turns out that they are determined
to ensure my demise today.

567
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,140
Sect Leader Lin.

568
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,500
I want to have a proper chat with you.

569
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,340
In a moment,

570
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,260
if I take the cloth out of your mouth,

571
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:53,780
don't try to bite your tongue
and kill yourself.

572
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,460
Otherwise,

573
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,860
I'll have to lead an attack
on Qinqu Mountain

574
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,300
and wipe out the Seven-star Sect

575
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,180
to get to the bottom of this.

576
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,260
The last thing
an assassin organization wants

577
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,500
is for its base to be discovered, right?

578
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,820
Don't worry, if you cooperate with me,

579
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,300
I'll pretend I don't know anything.

580
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,620
How do you know?

581
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,380
How I know is not important.

582
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,700
What's important

583
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,140
is that you'd better cooperate with me.

584
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,940
Revealing the information
about the employer

585
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,580
is taboo in your line of work.

586
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,460
Therefore,

587
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,260
I won't ask you to testify

588
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,820
or expose you.

589
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,300
You just need to tell me
everything you know.

590
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,100
And what happens after I tell you?

591
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,420
If you go out
and use the information I gave you

592
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,220
to find the culprit,
I'm dead anyway, aren't I?

593
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,500
Not necessarily.

594
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,380
You could give me a hint

595
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,900
and I'd follow the lead

596
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,900
as if I discovered it myself.

597
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:04,100
Then, I'll give you a chance
to break out and escape.

598
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,980
Once you're back,
you can tell your brothers

599
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,940
to relocate.

600
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,420
Is there such a good thing in the world?

601
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:15,980
Do you think I'm that naive?

602
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,900
There are conditions, of course.

603
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,380
It was also your people who attempted

604
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,980
to assassinate Pei Wenxuan before,
wasn't it?

605
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,700
Whoever ordered you
to assassinate Pei Wenxuan,

606
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,620
use the same method

607
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,580
to kill that person for me.

608
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,380
Once it's done,

609
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,470
have someone disguised

610
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,180
as an ordinary person
to make a deal with me.

611
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,380
I can sell you a piece of land

612
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,860
from my fief.

613
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:43,860
Of course,

614
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,980
you won't need to pay for it.

615
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,180
It will just be a transaction
on the surface.

616
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,500
Once you've moved your base

617
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,980
from Qinqu Mountain to my fief,

618
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,300
I can guarantee your safety.

619
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:04,380
This matter will be known

620
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,660
only to you and me, and no one else.

621
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,580
Xie Lanqing,

622
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,740
the Minister of Justice.

623
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,460
Will you still
carry out the assassination?

624
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,460
Yes.

625
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,580
Imperial Physician Wang,

626
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,980
how is my young master?

627
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,020
His Highness suffered sword wounds.

628
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,300
It's deep and bleeding profusely.

629
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,700
As a result,
he is currently unconscious.

630
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,420
Fortunately,

631
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,860
it did not hurt his internal organs.

632
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,740
But he still needs some time
to rest and recover.

633
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,940
That's a relief.

634
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,460
Thank you.

635
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,340
You are welcome.

636
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,500
Confess now.

637
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,300
Let's get it over and done with.
It's better for everyone that way.

638
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,140
Why are you staring at me?

639
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,100
I remember you.

640
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,940
You're the one
who stuffed cloth into my mouth.

641
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,500
I won't talk to you.

642
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,180
Get someone else.

643
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,780
You want someone else, huh?

644
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,140
Alright, I'll do it.

645
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,140
Go ahead and talk.

646
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,660
I've heard
the Seven-star Sect's specialty

647
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,860
is the Seven-star Darts, right?

648
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,860
If I chop off your fingers,

649
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,780
can you still
aim at the target so accurately?

650
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,020
I dare you.

651
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,180
Miss Shangguan may not dare.

652
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,740
But if you ask me...

653
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:37,900
Stop!

654
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,460
Tell him to go out.

655
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,180
Wasn't it you
who wanted to get someone else?

656
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:50,860
No, I'll just talk to you.

657
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:51,860
Tell him to go out

658
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,340
and I will confess.

659
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,140
You should have talked earlier.

660
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:57,980
Mr. Su.

661
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:01,780
Very impressive.

662
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,500
Please.

663
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,260
You want me around
when I'm useful to you,

664
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,580
and when I'm not,
you kick me out, huh?

665
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,540
How heartless. Truly heartless.

666
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:17,980
Alright.

667
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,580
He's gone.

668
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:20,940
Can you confess now?

669
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,940
Young Master, you are awake.

670
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,620
I'm fine.

671
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,780
So, how do you feel?

672
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,020
I'm fine, really.

673
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,820
Is Her Highness back?

674
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,460
Not yet.

675
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,300
Um, do you want something to eat?

676
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,620
You've been asleep all day.

677
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,220
No need.

678
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,180
I'll wait for Her Highness to return
and eat with her.

679
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:47,860
Also,

680
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,380
don't tell Her Highness too much
about my injuries.

681
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,140
You may go and rest for now.

682
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,530
[Inspectorate Office]

683
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:21,900
Your Highness.

684
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:24,780
Your Highness.

685
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,180
Are you not leaving yet?

686
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,380
Your Highness.

687
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,020
It's getting late.

688
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,060
You should go back early.

689
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,660
Today's situation is unusual.

690
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,500
Mr. Su, if it's not too much trouble,

691
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,420
please escort Ya home.

692
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,780
I shall heed your order.

693
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,820
Your Highness,
you should also return home soon.

694
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,540
I'll go home after I finish
dealing with these matters.

695
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,300
Su Ronghua,

696
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,420
I really can't figure this person out.

697
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,500
We all know why you are here

698
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,540
at the Inspectorate Office.

699
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,340
But by escorting me home today,
you're showing others

700
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,860
that you are on the same side
with Her Highness and me.

701
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,300
Miss Shangguan,

702
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,500
I don't always intend to oppose you.

703
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,180
I have my own sense of right and wrong.

704
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,820
When I think others
have crossed the line,

705
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,820
I'll support you.

706
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,060
And when I think
you've crossed the line,

707
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,460
I'll support others.

708
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,060
Don't you have your own stance?

709
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,700
Of course, I do.

710
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,940
But my stance is based
on my own sense of right and wrong,

711
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,300
with no concern
for royal authority or noble families.

712
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,380
Is that so?

713
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,620
Finally, there's a chance like this.

714
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,900
I won't discuss such matters with you.

715
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,460
Miss Shangguan. Your concerns today

716
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,020
are something related
to Her Highness, right?

717
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,220
Why not talk to me about it?

718
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,420
In fact,
even if you don't say it, I know.

719
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,340
As for those buttercups
all over the mountains today,

720
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,820
Mr. Pei must have spent
a lot of effort on preparing them.

721
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,140
But Her Highness
was setting an ambush there.

722
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:01,060
Obviously, neither of them
knew each other's plans.

723
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,460
The relationship
between Mr. Pei and Her Highness

724
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,940
seems quite delicate.

725
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,980
Are you thinking

726
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,700
that Her Highness cares for Mr. Pei,

727
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,300
and Mr. Pei cares for Her Highness,

728
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,220
so why is their relationship so tense?

729
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,460
Su Ronghua,

730
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,300
it's not appropriate for you
to gossip about Her Highness.

731
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,580
Don't you want to know the answer,
Miss Shangguan?

732
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,340
It's because she cares.

733
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,900
The more Her Highness
cares about something,

734
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,540
the more she dares not touch it.

735
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,780
Why would you say that
about Her Highness?

736
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,260
Do you know her well?

737
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,620
Her Highness
and Pei Wenxuan are different.

738
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,780
Her Highness
comes from the imperial family.

739
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,940
She has been taught

740
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:42,100
that between spouses,
there are only formalities.

741
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,580
Love is like the moon in the sky
and flowers in the water,

742
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,300
all but an illusion.

743
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,180
Pei Wenxuan appears gentle and modest

744
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,740
but is actually very assertive.

745
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,500
If he wants something,

746
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,660
he plans meticulously
and fights for every inch.

747
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,300
Especially in matters
of romantic relationships,

748
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,940
he won't give up
until he achieves his goal.

749
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,900
Her Highness
has indeed always been passive

750
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,380
and rarely takes the initiative.

751
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,660
That's because she's afraid.

752
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:08,780
Her Highness sees love
as both solemn and sorrowful.

753
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,180
She's afraid
of losing control in relationships,

754
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:14,740
so the more she cares,
the more she fears.

755
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,260
Are these all your guesses?

756
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:18,820
They are not my guesses.

757
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,700
Someone told me all that.

758
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:21,860
Who told you?

759
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,140
You don't need to know who told me.

760
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,660
I'm just trying
to clarify things for you.

761
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:28,580
You don't need to ask any further.

762
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:33,380
But I feel Pei Wenxuan
and Her Highness are not a good match.

763
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,820
The relationship that Her Highness wants

764
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,140
cannot be provided by Mr. Pei.

765
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,260
So Her Highness would be afraid.

766
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:40,620
Therefore,

767
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,460
stop worrying about them.

768
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:43,860
Let things happen naturally.

769
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,060
Whether they are a good match
isn't for you to decide.

770
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,180
Miss Shangguan.

771
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,060
You should go back by yourself.
