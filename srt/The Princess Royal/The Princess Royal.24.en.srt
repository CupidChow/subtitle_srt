I need to tell you something.

12
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,140
The Su Family is hellbent
on recruiting talents.

13
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,740
They even asked the Right Chancellor Su
to join them for a while.

14
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,180
Everyone flocks toward them.

15
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,140
But look at us...

16
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,620
Su Rongqing strongly opposed
the imperial examination before.

17
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,020
But he changed his mind all of a sudden.

18
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,380
He's clearly trying
to steal talents from me.

19
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,900
What did you say, Young Master?

20
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,700
Before?

21
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,500
That will cost a lot of money...

22
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,580
Hush now. Just go.

23
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:07,940
Go.

24
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,340
Okay.

26
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:13,860

28
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,140
that no matter whose article
was selected

29

- One silver tael?
- One silver tael?

31
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,340
One silver tael.

32
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,500
This is better

33
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,580
than meeting the Right Chancellor.

34
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,260
Of course.

35
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,540
The Prince Consort
used to be a commoner,

36
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,220
so he knows what commoners
like us want better.

37
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,140

It can be especially shown
in their actions.

this year's imperial examination?

63

It has had a big impact on us.

78

I will do my best.

87
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,100
We are now waiting for great timing

88
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,380
before we can ask Prince Su

89
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,940
to recruit talents for us in person.

90
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,580
What brought you here, Mr. Su?

91
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,100
Mr. Shangguan, do you perhaps
have a candidate in mind

92
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,940
as the imperial examination's
chief examiner?

93
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,220
That's a decision
for the Ministry of Personnel.

94
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,580
It is a thankless job.

95
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,940
Ask Liu Hangchun to do it.

96
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,780
Liu Hangchun?

97
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,700
He's not trustworthy.

98
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,620
He often makes a lot of mistakes.

99
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,980
If someone reports him,

100
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,940
it'll be...

101
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,580
Who do you suggest, Mr. Su?

102
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,460
My son, Rongqing,
is very interested in this matter.

103
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,380
I wonder if it's possible

104
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,260
to let him...

105
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,220
Mr. Su, His Majesty
promotes the imperial examination

106
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,140
to contend
against the noble families like us.

107
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,300
The chief examiner cannot be one of us.

108
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,380
Therefore, we must find someone

109
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,900
who isn't from a noble family

110
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,260
but is willing to do our bidding.

111
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,100
Your Highness, how is it?

112
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,300
You asked me to give you the signatures
of those handsome scholars.

113
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,420
But Pei Wenxuan isn't willing
to cooperate.

114
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,900
Forget about it now.

115

Your Highness,
you can't break your promise.

117
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,020
When did I promise you

118
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,180
that I'd bring the signatures back?

119
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,780
I did try for you.

120
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,100
Don't be insatiable.

121
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,060
But I told my friends
I would give them the signatures.

122
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,820
They were all so excited.

123

129

He used to look down on this.

130

Why the sudden change?

131
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,820
Right.

132
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,900

on the examination candidates.

00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,100
My consort is a talented man.

188
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,380
If no one plays a dirty trick,

189
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,100
he can easily excel in the role
of a secretary of examinations.

190
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,420
So don't be scared.

191
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,900
I just want you to pay attention to him.

192
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,340
I know someone
might have talked to you already,

193
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,300
but I hope you

194
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,420
can make a sound judgment.

195
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,100
Your Highness,

196
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,940
I do not have a final say in this.

197
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,780
The Prince Consort must
rely on his talent

198
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,180
to earn that position.

199
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,020
I will handle this
with fairness and impartiality,

200
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,780
so please rest assured, Your Highness.

201
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,140
I am relieved to hear that

202
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,820
from you, Mr. Liu.

203
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,820
As you as you're satisfied,
Your Highness.

204
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,420
If there's nothing else,

205
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,620
I shall take my leave.

206
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,980
Take care, Mr. Liu.

207
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:37,980
Your Highness.

208
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,860
In a few days, the list
of staff mobilizations

209
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,860
within the Ministry of Personnel

210
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,540
will be out.

211
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,100
Once Liu Hangchun

212
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,300
adds The Prince Consort's name to it,

213
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,980
it'll be too late for Wang Houwen
to do anything

214
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,900
even if he gets hold of this.

215
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,620
Indeed.

216
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,820
Once the Ministry of Personnel
produces the list,

217
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,940
Ministry of Justice will release
its list of staff mobilizations soon.

218
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,220
Pei Liming is doing the follow-up work
to Xie Lanqing's case.

219
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,740
So he should by right

220
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,460
be the Minister of Justice.

221
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:10,820
Young Master.

222
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,860
Any news from our informants?

223
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,580
Yes.

224
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,580
You asked them to keep an eye
on the Princess's Mansion.

225
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,060
They went to see Liu Hangchun.

226
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,180
It must be to get an in
with the Ministry of Personnel.

227
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,580
I need to know

228
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,700
whether it's Her Highness or Pei Wenxuan

229
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,620
went to that person.

230
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,780
It's Her Highness.

231
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,020
I see.

232
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,540
I was looking for an opportunity.

233
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,420
Now,

234
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,900
it presents itself.

235
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,660
Your Highness,

236
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,220
Second Young Master Su
sent a message saying

237
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,300
that he was setting up a trap.

238
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,140
Let me read it.

239
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,220
He asked you

240
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,700
to follow his plan.

241
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,020
He added that this operation

242
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,980
would test if you two can be allies.

243
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,300
Your Highness, just tell me the truth.

244
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,380
Are they handsome?

245
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,420
I didn't pay attention to them.

246
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,820
Why not? They are charming.

247
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,780
Your Highness, Miss Shangguan,

248
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,580
my young master asked me
to deliver this to you.

249
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,380
He did it!

250
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,340
Many handsome bachelors came

251
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,220
to Huajing for a forum.

252
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,020
I asked Su Ronghua

253
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,500
to get me their signatures.

254
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,540
Many noble ladies
are coveting their signatures.

255
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,260
It won't be a bad thing
to do them a favor.

256
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,020
Su Ronghua is Huajing's
most handsome man.

257
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,340
Su Ronghua is charming.

258
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,620
Su Ronghua is not only handsome
but also talented.

259
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,300
You may hang this portrait
of mine in your chamber.

260
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,180
It will brighten your day.

261
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,940
You want to do those ladies a favor?

262
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,100
Tell Su Ronghua

263
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,300
he's done for.

264
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,380
I shall relay this message verbatim.

265
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,180
Both of you want to see me today.

266
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,380
I am so honored.

267
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,220
May I know

268
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,340
what I can do for you.

269
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,540
Come on, Mr. Wang.

270
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,940
Thank you, Second Young Master Su.

271
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,460
Mr. Wang.

272
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,340
We came

273
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,140
to recommend someone
for the Ministry of Personnel.

274
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,740
Is that so?

275
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,660
You can just dispatch a messenger

276
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,540
to me.

277
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,500
No need to come to me personally.

278
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,220
But the Ministry of Personnel

279
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,620
can only offer the position
of the secretary of examinations now.

280
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,060
It's a sixth-ranked position.

281
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,180
I'm afraid you may
look down on it, Second Young Master Su.

282
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,380
Mr. Wang.

283
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,220
Isn't the Vice Minister
of Personnel pending too?

284
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,100
You're right, Mr. Su.

285
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,460
Many people are coveting

286
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,700
that position.

287
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,020
I wonder who you'd like to recommend.

288
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,580
Mr. Wang.

289
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,340
The list of nominees for the position
of the secretary of examinations

290
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,380
is here.

291
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,180
Please give written instructions
or comments.

292
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,840
[Pei Wenxuan, Cui Shuhe,
Shangguan Yu, Shuangguan Minzhi...]

293
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,570
[Pei Wenxuan]

294
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,300
Your Highness, to tell you the truth,

295
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,020
I saw with my own eyes that Mr. Wang

296
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,580
circled the Prince Consort's name.

297
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,180
Good.

298
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,020
When he's been officially appointed,

299
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,380
you will be rewarded again.

300
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,580
Thank you, Your Highness.

301
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,780
You may leave now.

302
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,300
I'll take my leave, Your Highness.

303
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,060
Your Highness, you seem happier

304
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,420
handling the Prince Consort's affairs
than your own affairs.

305
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,420
Of course.

306
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,260
I'm used to handling my affairs.

307
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,700
It's my first time doing so much
for someone else.

308
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,420
You're odd, Your Highness.

309
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,780
Men often

310
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,900
feel happy

311
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,020
when they help women.

312
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,420
When the Prince Consort spoils you,

313
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,140
you don't feel too thrilled.

314
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,140
Yet you are elated

315
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,060
when helping the Prince Consort.

316
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,300
Listen up.

317
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,300
Being spoiled is nothing to be proud of,

318
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,660
but spoiling others shows
that you are a capable one.

319
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,300
Someone can like you,

320
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,180
but you will lose your good looks
as age.

321
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,140
However, it's different
when you pamper someone.

322
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,540
You can spoil him when you want,

323
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,180
and leave when you no longer like him.

324
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,020
You can feel free
to do whatever you want.

325
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,140
How enlightening, Your Highness.

326
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,300
Don't believe what Her Highness says.

327
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,900
She's just being stubborn.

328
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,900
How am I stubborn?

329
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,420
Your Highness,

330
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,540
one doesn't need a specific reason
to feel happy

331
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,660
after helping someone else.

332
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,660
Maybe it's just because you like him.

333
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,900
This isn't something embarrassing.

334
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,060
That's right.

335
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,820
It isn't something embarrassing.

336
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,780
Don't tell me
you didn't sleep last night.

337
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,300
Yes. I'm so nervous.

338
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,860
You don't actually believe

339
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,380
that I could get things done for you,
do you?

340
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,020
Of course, I do.

341
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,780
But this is my first promotion

342
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,780
and you helped me with it personally.

343
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,100
So of course, I am nervous.

344
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,260
All right.

345
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,060
Enter the hall!

346
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,540
See you later.

347
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,060
- Boundless fortune to Your Majesty.
- Boundless fortune to Your Majesty.

348
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,500
- Long Live Your Majesty.
- Long Live Your Majesty.

349
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,780
Please rise, everyone.

350
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,380
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

351
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,820
Minister Wang,

352
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,780
tell me about the staff mobilizations
by the Ministry of Personnel.

353
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,980
Your Majesty.

354
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,940
The new Minister of Justice

355
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,980
will be Su Rongqing.

356
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,500
Thank you, Your Majesty.

357
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,300
He actually
took my second uncle's place?

358
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,820
Just how many dirty tricks did he play

359
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,060
to get that position?

360
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,580
The new
Vice Minister of Personnel

361
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,380
will be Pei Wenxuan.

362
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,060
Him?

363
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,340
Oh my!

364
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,220
It's supposed to be a sixth-ranked
position, secretary of examinations.

365
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,380
How come it's a fourth-ranked position?

366
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,620
- Mr. Pei.
- Mr. Pei.

367
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,980
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

368
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,300
Mr. Pei.

369
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,860
Mr. Pei has fainted.

370
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,940
Mr. Pei.

371
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,300
Pei Wenxuan?

372
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,540
Pei Wenxuan?

373
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,980
What is happening?

374
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,980
Your Majesty, my consort has fainted.

375
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,500
May I take him

376
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,540
to rest?

377
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,340
Bring him to the side hall.

378
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,580
Summon an imperial physician

379
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,300
to check on him.

380
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,100
Thank you, Your Majesty.

381
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,380
Hurry.

382
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,780
How's he?

383
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,260
Your Highness,

384
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,940
the Prince Consort suffers
from exhaustion

385
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,020
and his injuries are yet to heal fully.

386
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,580
He has fainted

387
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,860
because his mind is overwhelmed
and gets impaired.

388
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,340
He will need a few days to recuperate.

389
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,780
Anything else to note?

390
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,460
Are there any herbs he needs to avoid?

391
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,860
There's only one thing.

392
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,540
He shall not restrain himself

393
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,020
from conjugal consummation...

394
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,820
That's enough.

395
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:05,980
I understand.

396
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,540
Anything else?

397
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,020
Sleep more. Eat more.

398
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,740
He should go out for a stroll more
when he's free.

399
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,460
Relaxing his mind can be beneficial too.

400
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,020
Okay. Thank you.

401
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,300
- I'll take my leave.
- I'll take my leave.

402
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,460
Your Highness.

403
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,860
Right. Ask them to investigate

404
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,420
what happened
to the staff mobilizations.

405
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,260
Yes, Your Highness.

406
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,340
He fainted at the court.

407
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,740
Isn't it great
to be the Vice Minister of Personnel?

408
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,540
Did he faint from anger or happiness?

409
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,700
Anger, of course.

410
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,460
Pei Wenxuan is a cunning man
who cannot be underestimated.

411
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,900
It isn't a good news to him.

412
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,780
He received such a huge promotion.

413
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,980
Why was he angry?

414
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,500
Other ministers will not agree

415
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,180
with him
to be the Vice Minister of Personnel.

416
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,660
Not only will he not get that position,

417
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,740
but His Majesty
will begin to doubt him too.

418
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:10,900
Additionally,

419
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,740
His Majesty will grow wary

420
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,500
when the Inspectorate Office
grows too powerful.

421
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,220
When he puts his guard up,

422
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,580
so ends Pingyue's influence
in the imperial court.

423
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,260
I must say,

424
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,300
Mr. Su's plan is ingenious.

425
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,820
Mr. Su is so amazing.

426
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:39,740
You're awake.

427
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,260
How do you feel?

428
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,260
Do you want water?

429
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:44,900
No need.

430
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,460
Your Highness.

431
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,180
Did you catch the rest
of the staff mobilizations?

432
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,060
I'll get the list
from the Ministry of Personnel later.

433
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,900
Your Highness, I know you're
acting in my best interest,

434
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,020
but promoting me
to the Vice Minister of...

435
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,900
I asked for the position
of secretary of examinations.

436
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,260
I didn't ask for the position
of vice minister.

437
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,500
Then...

438
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,980
Pei Wenxuan sure rose quickly
through the ranks.

439
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,980
He's lucky.

440
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,020
Did you see His Majesty's

441
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,980
face just now?

442
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,340
I did.

443
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,180
His Majesty is getting mad
because Princess Pingyue

444
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,260
is meddling in everything.

445
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,620
I'm afraid that the Prince Consort can't
get the position of vice minister.

446
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,220
What brought you here, Mr. Su?

447
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,740
Mr. Shangguan, do you perhaps
have a candidate in mind

448
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,580
as the imperial examination's
chief examiner?

449
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,220
Who do you recommend?

450
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,660
Pei Wenxuan.

451
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:58,980
Second Young Master.

452
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,380
You jest.

453
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,740
He's our enemy, isn't he?

454
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,020
Think about it, Mr. Wang.

455
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,860
With His Majesty's temperament,

456
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,300
Pei Wenxuan
will never get this position.

457
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,460
Because

458
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,740
he wouldn't dare to take it.

459
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,220
Mr. Su,

460
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,620
I know you are capable,

461
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,140
but you represent the interests
of those noble families.

462
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:21,900
Your Highness.

463
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,900
What if I tell you I can
give you the Inspectorate Office?

464
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,580
I heard

465
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,620
that you used to fancy Princess Pingyue.

466
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:40,020
That is the past.

467
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,340
You just have to tell me
if you trust me or not.

468
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,420
What do you want me to do?

469
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,780
Go to Wang Houwen

470
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,300
and ask him to appoint Pei Wenxuan
as the Vice Minister of Personnel.

471
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,740
Rongqing.

472
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,820
No matter what they say about you,

473
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,020
in my eyes, you're the best

474
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,300
and the most excellent one.

475
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,580
I trust you to take
good care of our family.

476
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,020
Greetings, Your Highness.

477
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,100
Congratulations, Mr. Pei.

478
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,340
Mr. Pei, I shall see you
in the Ministry of Personnel.

479
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,820
You flattered me.

480
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,500
It's just a list.

481
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,140
And I am too inexperienced

482
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,740
to take the position.

483
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,820
Don't be modest, Mr. Pei.

484
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,220
I have faith in you.

485
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:45,740
Your Highness.

486
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,380
What's the matter?

487
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,180
I feel dizzy.

488
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,820
Let's go home. I'll feel better then.

489
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:50,900
Mr. Pei.

490
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,340
Congratulations on your promotion.

491
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,500
Thanks.

492
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,460
Come on. Slowly.

493
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,820
That was a lousy act.

494
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,860
I know.

495
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,900
You're heavy.

496
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:02,980
Pei Wenxuan.

497
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,300
This is just the first gift
I'll be giving to you.

498
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,300
Your Highness.

499
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,500
Mr. Liu, why are you kneeling here?

500
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,460
Did you do something wrong?

501
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,100
You may rise.

502
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,060
Just speak then.

503
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:24,780
Your Highness,

504
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,940
last night, someone gave me the list
of staff mobilizations

505
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,980
of fifth-ranked officials and above.

506
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,660
He asked me

507
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,700
to remove Mr. Pei's name

508
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,940
from the position
of secretary of examinations.

509
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,580
I didn't want to defy your order.

510
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,140
But that person said

511
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,140
it'd be beneficial
for the Prince Consort.

512
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,780
I thought

513
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,420
being the Vice Minister of Personnel

514
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,100
was better than being
a secretary of examinations.

515
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,180
Moreover, the list of the mobilizations
concerning fifth-ranked positions

516
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,140
and above would be submitted
to His Majesty in advance.

517
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,420
If His Majesty first saw
that the Prince Consort

518
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,420
was one of the candidates
|for the Vice Minister of Personnel,

519
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,620
then he saw the list I wrote,

520
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:07,620
he might think
that I failed in my duties.

521
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,180
Therefore, I...

522
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,780
Therefore, you removed his name

523
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,580
from the position
of secretary of examinations.

524
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,500
Isn't it great that my consort
is now the Vice Minister of Personnel?

525
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,460
Why are you so scared?

526
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,940
Who came to you?

527
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,740
What did they tell you?

528
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,500
It was Mr. Wang Houwen.

529
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,580
He told me
Consort Rou wanted someone else

530
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,460
to be the secretary of examinations,

531
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,660
and he wanted me to arrange for it.

532
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,860
I didn't dare to do that for him,
so I told him

533
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,980
that someone already took that position.

534
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,380
He asked me who it was

535
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,820
and I told him
it was the Prince Consort.

536
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,260
He then told me that the Prince Consort

537
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,260
had been appointed

538
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,740
as the Vice Minister of Personnel.

539
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,980
I thought it was odd.

540
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,540
But if he was already appointed
as the Vice Minister of Personnel,

541
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,260
I supposed there was no point in making
him the secretary of examinations.

542
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,540
But unexpectedly,

543
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,260
the Prince Consort fainted
at the court today.

544
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,660
Everyone thought it's said

545
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,460
that he was simply overwhelmed
by happiness,

546
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,580
I knew

547
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,500
that I must have done something wrong.

548
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,740
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

549
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,860
Stand up.

550
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,820
I now know what happened.

551
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,780
You may leave, Mr. Liu.

552
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,060
I'll take my leave.

553
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,860
In our next lesson,

554
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,180
I hope you can explain to me

555
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,180
how to enhance one's self-cultivation
and be a self-disciplined ruler.

556
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,900
Yes, sir.

557
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,060
Greetings, Mr. Su.

558
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:50,780
Your Highness.

559
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,900
May I

560
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,580
speak frankly, Your Highness?

561
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,140
Please do.

562
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,180
I believe His Highness should volunteer

563
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,900
to be the secretary of examinations.

564
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,780
As his mother,

565
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,220
you are from a humble family

566
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,820
which is perfectly justifiable.

567
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,020
The imperial examination
only recruits commoners.

568
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,060
Why would I need individuals
without any foundations?

569
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,100
Mind your manner, Cheng.

570
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,820
Some of them are very knowledgeable.

571
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,620
You can pick and train them.

572
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,740
In time,

573
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,460
they will be one of the noble families

574
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,340
who will work for you.

575
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,460
You're brilliant, Your Highness.

576
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,900
It's all your foresight, Mr. Su.

577
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,660
Cheng, thank your tutor
for his guidance.

578
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:38,900
Thank you, sir.

579
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,420
Answer me.

580
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,220
Is Pei Wenxuan very experienced now?

581
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,300
How dare you

582
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,860
appoint him
as the Vice Minister of Personnel?

583
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,460
I rarely meddle in affairs

584
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,380
in the Ministry of Personnel

585
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,620
because I have faith in your judgment.

586
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,620
But what are you doing here?

587
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,260
How can you give
such an important position

588
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,060
to Pei Wenxuan?

589
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:07,820
Your Majesty.

590
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,780
Mr. Pei might be young,

591
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,420
but he is the Prince Consort.

592
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,500
Her Highness...

593
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,460
So what if she's a princess?

594
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,740
Can a princess be above the laws,

595
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,500
the state principles, or even me?

596
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,300
Tell me.

597
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,060
Who helped Pei Wenxuan

598
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,140
get the position
of the Vice Minister of Personnel?

599
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,860
Tell me honestly.

600
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,620
Your Majesty,
Princess Pingyue seeks an audience.

601
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,340
Reject her request.

602
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,580
Yes, Your Majesty.

603
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:39,860
Wait.

604
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:41,780
Summon her in.

605
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:43,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

606
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,700
Leave now.
Reflect upon yourself at home.

607
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,740
I'll have others investigate
the truth later.

608
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,580
Yes, Your Majesty.

609
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,980
Greetings, Your Highness.

610
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,680
Mr. Wang,
you're a third-ranked minister,

611
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,020
who's served in the court
for a long time.

612
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,460
No need to extend such formality to me.

613
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,620
A minister is just nothing.

614
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,100
The former Minister of Justice,
Xie Lanqing,

615
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,740
also the master of the Xie Family,

616
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:23,620
was even taken down by you.

617
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,820
If I may advise you, Your Highness,

618
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,100
your honor

619
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,900
is contingent upon the Shangguan Family.

620
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,940
After all,
the noble families are your allies.

621
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,260
Don't pick

622
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,660
the wrong side.

623
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,340
I'll take my leave, Your Highness.

624
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,740
Your Highness, please.

625
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,980
Your Majesty, Princess Pingyue is here.

626
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,020
Greetings, Father.

627
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,660
Rise.

628
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,340
Pei Wenxuan has been
officially appointed.

629
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,700
What other complaints do you have?

630
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,460
Father, please choose another one

631
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,860
to take the position
of the Vice Minister of Personnel.

632
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,900
Why? Isn't it a great thing
that Pei Wenxuan

633
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,740
is a vice minister now?
Why reject the offer?

634
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,700
Father, I made a mistake.

635
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,500
Please forgive me.

636
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,540
Speak.

637
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,460
In fact, I helped

638
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,540
Pei Wenxuan in secret

639
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,140
to secure his promotion.

640
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,660
How else could he become
a vice minister then?

641
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,540
But I wasn't going
after the position of vice minister.

642
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,020
I wanted him to become
a secretary of examinations.

643
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,540
You're saying

644
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,060
someone's framing you

645
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,860
by making Pei Wenxuan

646
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,700
the Vice Minister of Personnel?

647
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,500
Yes.

648
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,300
Why would they do that?

649
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,820
Isn't it obvious?

650
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,900
They want to drive a wedge between us.

651
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,740
How is appointing Pei Wenxuan
as the Vice Minister of Personnel

652
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,860
an act to create a divide between us?

653
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,220
Father, you asked me to establish
the Inspectorate Office.

654
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,580
I solved many cases
and gained more power.

655
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,100
If I used my power for my own good,

656
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,660
then for both our country and people,

657
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,140
you would want to eradicate me.

658
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,740
It seems like the mastermind
of this scheme

659
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,700
harbors no good intention.

660
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,260
Father,

661
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:55,020
while I did make a mistake,

662
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,380
I couldn't bear it anymore.

663
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,060
I have had enough of the mockery.

664
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,340
Who mocked you?

665
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,900
After I was betrothed,

666
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,380
I was mocked by my younger sisters
in the palace.

667
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,900
Huayue said

668
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,940
that it's because Pei Wenxuan held
a lowly background and was powerless

669
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,540
and because you didn't like me

670
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,260
so you made me marry him.

671
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,420
Nonsense!

672
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,180
Why would Huayue say such words?

673
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,020
Father.

674
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,740
Do you mean to say
that Huayue wouldn't say that,

675
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,780
or that Huayue
shouldn't have said it out loud?

676
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,020
Father,

677
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,820
why do you think I'm so scared

678
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,500
and come to see you in a hurry

679
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,220
to revoke the decision
to remove Pei Wenxuan

680
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,060
from his position?

681
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,700
Do you think
it's only because he is too young?

682
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,380
In terms of age,

683
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,780
Su Rongqing is also young.

684
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,580
How come he could
be the Vice Minister of Justice,

685
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,780
and now, even get promoted
to the Minister of Justice?

686
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,700
Yet my consort
can't even be a vice minister.

687
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,420
However, I still have to come today.

688
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,660
I'm afraid If I did not,

689
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,220
Father might believe

690
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,340
that I would continue
helping Pei Wenxuan in secret.

691
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,620
I was so scared.

692
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,340
I fear that you and I will drift apart.

693
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,220
What makes you think I'll do that?

694
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,900
Because I know...

695
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,380
I'm not Huayue.

696
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,060
I am the daughter
of the Shangguan Family.

697
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,740
You are my daughter.

698
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,380
But Huayue said

699
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,180
that you grew wary
of the Shangguan Family,

700
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,300
so you made me marry a commoner.

701
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,260
She's gone too far!

702
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,940
Pei Wenxuan was ranked first
in the Royal Selection.

703
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,380
He is handsome and kind.

704
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,500
I'm sure you know how excellent he is.

705
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,900
I do.

706
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,100
So please, Father,

707
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,260
do not doubt me.

708
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,460
I'm not that capable.

709
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,180
I did everything

710
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,940
to seek justice.

711
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,940
I just hope my consort won't be denied
the opportunity to work

712
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,100
as a sixth-ranked official
because of me.

713
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,020
Father.

714
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,060
Please grant my request.

715
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,420
I need to think about it.

716
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,700
You may leave now.

717
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,060
Yes, Father.

718
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,340
Your Majesty.

719
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,220
All of them are playing tricks

720
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,700
to fool me.

721
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,980
And they are doing
a remarkable job at it.

722
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,540
Pingyue was right.

723
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,220
When Pei Wenxuan was announced
to be the Vice Minister of Personnel,

724
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,980
I questioned their fidelity.

725
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:56,740
Your Majesty.

726
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,180
I believe

727
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,620
something more sinister must be at play

728
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:06,420
behind Mr. Pei's new promotion.

729
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,620
Send someone
to investigate the truth for me.

730
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,180
Yes, Your Majesty.

731
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,900
Your Highness, a letter
from the Northwest.

732
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,060
Is it from Zhenzhen?

733
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,220
Your Highness, it's been a while.

734
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,740
The distance between us is vast.

735
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,860
I wonder when you'll receive

736
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,060
this letter.

737
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,500
Perhaps you'll receive it
in March when swan geese

738
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,940
is flying back to the north?

739
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,660
The soldiers in the Northwest

740
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,020
believe that the returning swan geese

741
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,420
carry with them the yearning
of their families.

742
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,020
When I see them,

743
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:45,100
they remind me of you

744
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,140
and my family in Huajing.

745
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,740
Thus, I named the sword you gave me

746
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,340
Hongyu.

747
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,660
I was like a swan goose's feather,

748
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,580
carried by the wayward breeze.

749
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,820
Fortunately, I met you and Her Highness.

750
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,580
I was given the chance to take
destiny into my own hands

751
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,740
and pursue my ambition.

752
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:09,980
I hope this feather can convey

753
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,780
my blessings and longings to you.

754
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,380
May this feather remind you
of my presence

755
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,140
and this letter brighten your day.

756
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,260
Zhenzhen, I am sure

757
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,460
we will meet again one day.

758
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,300
Hongyu.

759
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:34,980
Hush.

760
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,220
If I'm getting married,

761
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,180
I definitely won't marry someone
like Pei Wenxuan.

762
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,020
He's good for nothing

763
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,340
except for his pretty face.

764
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,100
He's from a humble background
and married Pingyue.

765
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,300
Yet he couldn't even secure the position
as the secretary of examinations.

766
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,820
Pingyue has been arrogant all her life.

767
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,740
To have a husband like him...

768
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,540
Father.

769
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,380
Your Majesty,

770
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,180
why did no one
inform us of your arrival?

771
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,220
Is this how you raised your daughter?

772
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,700
She's a princess yet she's talking
behind others' backs.

773
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,900
It's all my fault
for not disciplining her well.

774
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,820
Huayue, apologize to your father now.

775
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,020
Apologize?

776
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,500
Is she the one who should apologize?

777
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:24,780
Get out!

778
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,540
I'll take my leave, Father.

779
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,140
Everyone else should leave too.

780
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,300
Your Majesty,
Huayue is young and naive.

781
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,900
She must have picked up
bad habits in the palace.

782
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,860
I was about to lecture her.

783
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,420
Was it your idea to let Pei Wenxuan

784
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,820
be the Vice Minister of Personnel?

785
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,420
What do you mean, Your Majesty?

786
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,780
I mostly keep to myself in the harem.

787
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,940
I can't possibly decide
on such an important matter.

788
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,220
Perhaps the rumors mislead you

789
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,140
into misunderstanding me, Your Majesty.

790
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,980
Rumors?

791
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,940
I know very well

792
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,020
what you're capable of.

793
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,500
Otherwise,

794
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,660
how could a lowly person

795
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,980
like you

796
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,540
can be who you are today.

797
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,740
I know it's because

798
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,340
I'm lucky enough to earn your favor,
Your Majesty.

799
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,460
I truly have nothing to do with it.

800
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,780
There must be a gossipmonger.

801
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,660
Perhaps I can confront him?

802
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,460
Quit pretending!

803
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,780
You can plot schemes.

804
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:46,060
You can also pull dirty tricks
in this harem.

805
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,780
But don't try to deceive
or take advantage of me.

806
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,500
I can put you in this position

807
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,300
and I can take it away
from you just as easily.

808
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,620
I do not like others deceiving me.

809
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,860
For today's matter,

810
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,620
I can

811
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,580
let it go.

812
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,740
But Xiao Rou,

813
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,660
remember what you said to me.

814
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,500
You said

815
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,300
you'd be my blade.

816
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,780
Don't forget who you are.

817
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,300
If one day,

818
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,500
I realize that the blade
is pointing at me,

819
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,460
I...

820
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,700
will melt it.

821
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

822
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:04,900
Your Highness.

823
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,500
Pei,

824
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,900
my family did send me

825
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,420
an odorless, colorless and chronic drug,

826
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,180
didn't they?

827
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:16,860
Yes, Your Highness.

828
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,100
You mean to...

829
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:27,900
Young Master.

830
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,500
Your Highness.

831
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,580
Young Master.

832
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,500
Young... Your Highness!

833
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,180
Young Master.

834
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:36,780
What's the matter?

835
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,500
Something bad happened.

836
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,220
What is it?

837
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,500
Daoist Hongde was summoned
to the palace at night.

838
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,180
And then?

839
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:42,740
Then...

840
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,460
What's the matter?

841
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:44,860
Your Highness,

842
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,500
Daoist Hongde was summoned
to the palace at night

843
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,700
by Consort Rou, or so I heard.

844
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,860
In the palace, he put out

845
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,580
an accusation against you.

846
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,260
He said

847
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,100
that it came from our mansion

848
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,700
that the Crown Prince's marriage

849
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,900
must be postponed till five years later.

850
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,100
What?

851
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,500
His Majesty was infuriated

852
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,100
and he wanted to summon you right away.

853
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,980
But the messenger,
who was going to come out

854
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:08,580
of the palace to convey the edict,

855
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,460
was somehow brought back in.

856
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,940
Brought back in?

857
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,100
Anything else?

858
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,300
Nothing.

859
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,220
Oh, wait.

860
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:22,060
I heard His Majesty wasn't going
to look into this affair.

861
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,700
Leave the city

862
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,460
and head to Qingshui County.

863
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,580
Find a laundrywoman called Tian Fang

864
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,860
and give her 300 silver taels.

865
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,220
Tell her that her husband has been found

866
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,620
so that she can bring her mother-in-law
to Huajing to reunite with him.

867
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,940
That much money?

868
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,420
Just go.

869
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,020
Okay.

870
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,780
You're trying to take advantage
of Hongde's scandal?

871
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:37,540
Yes.

872
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,620
And it must be something
that comes with solid evidence.

873
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,780
Did you talk to Hongde
after you came back?

874
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:45,580
No.

875
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,420
Neither of us has talked to him.

876
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,900
So he was bought to falsely accuse us.

877
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,140
But with Consort Rou's capability,

878
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,300
she isn't smart enough
to devise this plan.
