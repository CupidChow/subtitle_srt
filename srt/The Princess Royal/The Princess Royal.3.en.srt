00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 3]

6
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,940
I will ask you one more time.

7
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,820
Why did you stop me

8
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,940
from choosing other people?

9
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,780
I...

10
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:51,940
I...

11
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,660
Because you felt guilty
about what you had done to me.

12
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,380
So you also...

13
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,460
It seems that fate won't let you go,

14
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,420
you ungrateful scoundrel.

15
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,340
So you've fallen
into my hands once again.

16
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,900
What? Are you afraid to admit it?

17
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,780
Right,

18
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,140
I feel guilty for you,

19
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,060
but haven't you done the same to me?

20
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,820
We've been quarreling
over those long-standing issues

21
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,140
for twenty years.

22
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,620
You just need to answer this.

23
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,020
Why did you come here today?

24
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,940
Just to glance
at the eighteen-year-old you.

25
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,260
Nothing more?

26
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,100
What else do you think?

27
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:56,860
Perhaps,

28
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,060
to lend a hand to you again.

29
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,260
You really did a good job.

30
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,300
You narrowed down the choices
from Father

31
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,660
to none but yourself.

32
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,180
I shouldn't have meddled
in your affairs,

33
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,220
but I sincerely hope

34
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,780
that you can live a happy life
in the future.

35
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,460
This wish

36
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,940
has remained unchanged

37
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,740
all the time.

38
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,340
Your way to help me
live a happy life is...

39
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,540
I killed him too.

40
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,420
So we're even.

41
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,140
I never imagined

42
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,380
it would come to this.

43
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,900
What do you suggest we do?

44
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,740
Every other option comes
with an unknown outcome.

45
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,180
But since we know each other well,

46
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,300
I would like to request to marry you,
Your Highness.

47
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,340
Perhaps one day,

48
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,820
when you can break free,

49
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,140
you might make another choice.

50
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,940
Pei Wenxuan,

51
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,540
given this second chance by fate,

52
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,020
I don't want to live as before
to give my heart to the wrong person,

53
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,860
to get caught in endless intrigues,

54
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,780
and to end up alone.

55
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,580
If I choose you again,

56
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,700
there will be no difference
from what happened before.

57
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,300
If we tread the same path,

58
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,180
we will have only one ally.

59
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,140
Then are we going to use
and set up each other again?

60
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,140
We both know well

61
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,980
in the court,

62
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,460
that what matters is the power we have

63
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,300
rather than our spouses or kin.

64
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,420
Yet,

65
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,860
at the pinnacle,

66
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,140
as we walk alone through this world,

67
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,260
we'll start to long for the simple joys
and bustling life.

68
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,060
We both

69
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,500
once stood at the pinnacle before.

70
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,260
Tell me.

71
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,380
What's the difference

72
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,380
between being a loner

73
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,740
and being a lone ghost?

74
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,620
Looks like it's going to rain.

75
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,060
You should go get some umbrellas ready.

76
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,180
Alright.

77
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,940
Your Highness,

78
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,420
the eunuch says

79
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,140
it's about time

80
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,380
to wrap things up.

81
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,620
Tell them I'm not feeling well.

82
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,580
You go and see the guests out for me.

83
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,500
Yes.

84
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,620
I'm tired of that kind of life.

85
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,500
So,

86
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,340
do you really think I should marry you

87
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,980
and continue living that life?

88
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,940
In this arranged marriage,

89
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,100
neither of us had a choice.

90
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,420
We were both just after power.

91
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,980
To be honest,

92
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,380
we didn't have much feelings
for each other.

93
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,260
Qin Zhenzhen made us

94
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,980
know each other better.

95
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,540
You had someone in your heart,

96
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,220
but you just never made it clear.

97
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,180
Now that I know,

98
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,580
it's not a big deal.

99
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,820
After all, I can have someone
in my heart too.

100
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,780
But since that's the case,

101
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,300
why didn't you make it clear earlier?

102
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,540
How about this?

103
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,700
Things will remain the same
between us in the future.

104
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,340
But I want you to understand

105
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,860
that I'm no longer your wife

106
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,980
and you are no longer my husband.

107
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,660
We will live our separate lives

108
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,180
and enjoy our own joys.

109
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,020
But you have to promise me,

110
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,980
as allies,

111
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,300
that we shall never betray each other.

112
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,020
What do you say?

113
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,060
Tell me.

114
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,180
Pei Wenxuan, tell me your answer.

115
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,540
If you remain silent,

116
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,940
I'll take it
that you still have feelings for me.

117
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,980
But if you do have feelings for me

118
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,820
and still meddle in her affairs,

119
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,220
that would make me sick.

120
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,420
We shouldn't have been together.

121
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,940
I'm going to ask Father

122
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,460
for a divorce right now.

123
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,300
Why must we even do this, Your Highness?

124
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,300
Then tell me, what do you want?

125
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,860
As allies,

126
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,580
you should know

127
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,260
that divorce isn't good
for either of us.

128
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,500
From now on,

129
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,180
let's just live our own lives separately

130
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,660
in the name of a couple.

131
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,980
As allies,
we must never betray each other.

132
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,540
Whoever betrays...

133
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,620
Will die a miserable death.

134
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:47,940
Indeed,

135
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,100
we were both punished.

136
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,420
It seems

137
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,860
nothing can be hidden from you.

138
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,300
The grudges of the past

139
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,100
are too tangled to clear up now.

140
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,340
I never intended to bother you now.

141
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,380
But thinking we were once a couple

142
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,660
and might never see each other again,

143
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,900
I came to see you.

144
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,340
I didn't expect

145
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,260
that I couldn't help

146
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,980
meddling in your affairs.

147
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,380
You're being ridiculous.

148
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,660
Do you think

149
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,140
I couldn't get married

150
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,940
without your interference?

151
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,580
Or...

152
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,300
You just wanted to check
if those men are good for me.

153
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,380
Unexpectedly, Su Rongqing alone

154
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,900
already made you uncomfortable.

155
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,420
You are joking around, Your Highness.

156
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,020
I wouldn't dare.

157
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,940
After being a powerful minister
for so long,

158
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,260
you dare even
to fight for the succession.

159
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,780
There's nothing you wouldn't dare to do.

160
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,060
There's no need to tease me anymore.

161
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,580
You'd better think carefully

162
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,420
that with your current situation,

163
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,900
if not me,

164
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,660
who else could you choose
as your husband

165
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,820
to protect you?

166
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:23,820
Drop your act.

167
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,940
You've probably already
prepared a pretext.

168
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,660
Given the current circumstances,

169
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,700
it's hard for you
to avoid His Majesty's suspicion.

170
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,180
Choosing the one from the Noble Houses
as your husband

171
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,660
might provoke His Majesty.

172
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,940
But once the Crown Prince
ascends the throne,

173
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,900
your future will be worry-free.

174
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,300
By that time,

175
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,540
you can rekindle the relationship
with Young Master Su.

176
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:05,780
So,

177
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,780
your top priority now is
to ensure the Crown Prince's safety.

178
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,260
Your Majesty.

179
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,020
Mother.

180
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,140
Mother.

181
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,300
Do you know what kind of men

182
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,700
Father has chosen for Rong?

183
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,180
[Shangguan Yue, Empress]
They're either rough and reckless men

184
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,180
or commoners of low birth.

185
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,180
The remaining ones are a fool

186
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,180
and a playboy.

187
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,900
How come
Father doesn't take this seriously.

188
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,900
Mother, why don't you
find a good husband for Rong?

189
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,060
Your father has always been wary of you.

190
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,540
Do you know why?

191
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:48,820
Why?

192
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,140
Because our Shangguan Family

193
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,180
is the leading Noble House nowadays.

194
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,300
What your father truly fears

195
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,660
is the Shangguan Family behind you.

196
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,140
If Rong were to marry
into another Noble House,

197
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,780
who then could stop

198
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,660
you and her in the future?

199
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,420
At the founding of our nation,

200
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,540
the royal family indeed needed
the support of Noble Houses.

201
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,940
But now that the nation
is in a stable state,

202
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,420
Noble Houses

203
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,940
have become the greatest threat
to the imperial power.

204
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,940
You have to make a choice
between your position as Crown Prince

205
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,540
and Rong's happiness.

206
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,820
I understand what you're saying,

207
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,500
but

208
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,020
if my position as the Crown Prince

209
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,580
comes at the cost
of Rong's lifelong happiness,

210
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,940
then I'd rather not have it.

211
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,820
What nonsense are you talking about?

212
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,780
You think you have a say on that?

213
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,980
You are of the royal and noble house's
blood, which is unchangeable.

214
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,340
Even if you don't want it,

215
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,140
the noble house behind you
won't allow it to happen.

216
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,300
This matter

217
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,380
is beyond both of our decisions.

218
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,540
But among Cui Yulang, Yang Quan,

219
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,060
and Lu Yu,

220
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,620
Cui Yulang comes from humble beginnings,

221
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,300
so marrying him
would be of the least use.

222
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,180
Besides, he's dissolute

223
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,300
and loves writing poetry,

224
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,740
which gives plenty of leverage
against him.

225
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,380
If you really marry him,

226
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,980
it could cause trouble
for the Crown Prince.

227
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,460
Speaking of the Yang Family,

228
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,420
they are too powerful.

229
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,180
Yang Quan is too harsh and aggressive.

230
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,220
At this moment,

231
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,380
His Majesty's intention
in marrying you to Yang Quan

232
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,980
is actually a move

233
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,500
against the Yang Family.

234
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,700
If you marry Yang Quan now,

235
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,820
it's likely that His Majesty
will make his move soon after.

236
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,140
By then,

237
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,300
you will inevitably be involved,

238
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,420
and so will the Crown Prince.

239
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,380
Indeed,

240
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,540
from what I saw today,

241
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,660
Yang Quan is nothing but a brute.

242
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,100
But I think Marquis Lu Yu

243
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,300
would be a good match.

244
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,140
Marquis Ningguo was His Majesty's
reading partner back then

245
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,180
and even took an arrow for His Majesty.

246
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,260
His Majesty values others' favor,

247
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,980
so I believe

248
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,180
it would be beneficial

249
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,900
if you could marry Marquis Lu.

250
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,540
Moreover,

251
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,300
Marquis Ningguo is a reliable man,

252
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,580
and Marquis Lu Yu is simple-minded
and hardly ever leaves his mansion.

253
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,860
He may not

254
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,540
be a good husband,

255
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,780
but at least he won't
hold the Crown Prince back.

256
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,340
More importantly,

257
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,380
he is in poor health.

258
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,580
Given his current condition,

259
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,980
he might only

260
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,820
have a couple of years left.

261
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,380
However,

262
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,500
I'm concerned

263
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,660
that if you marry him,

264
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,700
you might face mockery
from everyone in the palace,

265
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,700
and I worry you might not withstand it.

266
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,340
You've been quite thoughtful.

267
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,620
If I can endure the mockery

268
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,100
and marry him as you've suggested,

269
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,180
when he passes away later,

270
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,220
and Chuan ascends to the throne,

271
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,980
could I then get remarried?

272
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,380
Exactly.

273
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,940
You've planned everything
so meticulously.

274
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,540
If I don't marry you and have a way out,

275
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,380
then what about you?

276
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,660
You don't need to worry about me.

277
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,620
I have my own way.

278
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,220
Well then, Young Master Pei,
you're certainly a man of character.

279
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,620
In that case,

280
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,700
you may leave now.

281
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,980
It's getting late.

282
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,500
If you don't leave soon

283
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,340
and have the carriage stained with mud,

284
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,820
you might get a scolding
from the butler.

285
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,100
I've been wanting to leave.

286
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,940
Thank you for your grace, Your Highness.

287
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,340
Rascal.

288
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,380
Wait.

289
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,300
In the past,

290
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,820
we have different positions

291
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,500
and it's hard to tell who's right
and who's wrong.

292
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,380
Whether this is a dream
or reality right now,

293
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,940
since the fate has given us

294
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,380
a chance to start over,

295
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,380
let's not meet

296
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,020
from now on.

297
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,820
We shall both live our own lives.

298
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,060
Yes, this is my last time

299
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,500
meeting you, Your Highness.

300
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,220
From now on,

301
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,860

00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,580

please convey a message

00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,620
I bid farewell to her.
Please take good care.

364
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,100
Remind Her Highness

365
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,780
to be careful

366
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,980

00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,660

371
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,940
You're quite impressive.

372
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,700
You even received a reward
from the Princess.

373
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,860
It's just a shame
it's not the silver tael.

374
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,420
Hold it properly, Young Master.

375
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,500
If the Princess
had given some silver taels,

376
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,580
that would have been more useful.

377
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,380
You know nothing at all.

378
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,780
That's true.

379
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,780
But at least I know

380
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,060
we'll have to pay
if we don't return the carriage.

381
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,860
Sit still.

382
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,820
He said this to you?

383
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,500
I don't need his concern at all.

384
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,820
He is a mere eighth-rank official,

385
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,380
and he's worse off than I am.

386
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,700
The only person I know
who can play chess with me

387
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,380
on equal footing is Pei Wenxuan.

388
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,220
Our matches are thrilling.

389
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,620
Others aren't as skillful as him,

390
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,740
and Su Rongqing
always lets me win on purpose.

391
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,780
But Pei Wenxuan, that rascal,

392
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,820
is bold and fierce.

393
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,100
From now on,

394
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,260
there's no one

395
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,740
who can play chess with me
fully and delightfully.

396
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,500
Don't hold back later.

397
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,340
Treat it like a battle.

398
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,020
Young Master,
she is a princess after all.

399
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,380
Are we really going to...

400
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,700
Even if we don't kidnap the Princess,

401
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,660
do you think His Majesty will spare us?

402
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,060
Don't be naive.

403
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,140
My sister has already sent me a letter.

404
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,220
We can only count on ourselves now.

405
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,940
Only by marrying the Princess

406
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,340
and allying with the Crown Prince

407
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,820
can I save my life.

408
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,420
Do you have a foolproof plan?

409
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,060
First, we pretend
to kidnap the Princess.

410
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,500
Then, at the crucial moment,

411
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,220
I'll appear to save her.

412
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,860
After that...

413
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,860
Spending the night
with just the two of us...

414
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,700
His Majesty always values reputation.

415
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,620
He will betroth Li Rong to me

416
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,540
even if she refuses.

417
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,540
There's no one else in the world

418
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,180
who would care so much
about my pitiful dignity.

419
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,380
What's going on?

420
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,700
Young Master, something's off.

421
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,460
I saw...

422
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,140
Silver taels!

423
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:47,700
Get to the point.

424
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,220
I just saw several men
in black passed by.

425
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,020
The horses they were riding
looked like war horses.

426
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,140
War horses?

427
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,580
Think about it, in the dead of night,

428
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,180
who dares to ride war horses
in the capital?

429
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,460
The Yang Family.

430
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:03,900
Oh no.

431
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,500
They're heading in the direction

432
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,780
of the Princess's residence.

433
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,260
Yang Quan was so forward
with the Princess at the Spring Banquet.

434
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,660
It seems he was determined to win her.

435
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,820
They're going to use force.

436
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,300
Hurry to the palace

437
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,740
and report that Princess Pingyue
is in danger,

438
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,700
and someone is trying
to assassinate her.

439
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,060
Yes.

440
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,260
Ask them to send people to rescue her.

441
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,580
I'll go now. Wait!

442
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,020
Young Master, what about you?

443
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,260
I must go back to the Princess.

444
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,380
Go now.

445
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,500
It's dangerous. You...

446
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,020
We don't have much time.

447
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,020
Listen to me, if...

448
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,580
We don't have much time.
Hurry to the palace.

449
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,900
Make sure you stay safe.

450
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,380
I see.

451
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,180
Alright.

452
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,380
Take care of the silver taels.

453
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,140
I'm afraid Yang Quan's men

454
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,660
might have already surrounded her place.

455
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,980
Even if I rush back,
I might not be able to get in.

456
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,380
According to Li Rong's
travel habits back then,

457
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,580
the Empress would send
at least 20 secret guards to her.

458
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,500
Together with her entourage,

459
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,620
there should be over a hundred people.

460
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,460
It won't be hard for Li Rong
to break out.

461
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,060
What I can do

462
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,780
is to hold
off the Yang Family's pursuers.

463
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,940
You found people ambushing outside?

464
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,140
It's a good number of them.

465
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,580
But they don't seem
to be the usual martial artists.

466
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,980
Why do you say that?

467
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,100
Their hiding techniques

468
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,980
are different from the martial artists
we usually encounter.

469
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,140
They're of the Yang Family.

470
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,220
The one coming out now
isn't the Princess.

471
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,580
How do you know that?

472
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,340
Your Highness, we're ready to depart.

473
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,060
I'm almost done reading.

474
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,250
Your Highness,

475
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,940
the people ambushing outside
haven't taken any action.

476
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,900
They haven't?

477
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,140
I was wondering

478
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,660
how come Yang Quan was so bold

479
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,140
to try to kidnap me

480
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,980
without fearing any mishaps.

481
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,540
It turns out there's a traitor among us.

482
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,220
- Your Highness, please forgive us.
- Your Highness, please forgive us.

483
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,940
Get up.

484
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,820
Jinglan,

485
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,140
change into my clothes.

486
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,140
Take a group of men
and leave through the back door.

487
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,460
Circle around the back mountain

488
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,900
and stay far away from the main road.

489
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,180
When you leave,
make sure you leave quickly.

490
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,340
Don't get caught.

491
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,940
That's Li Rong's carriage.

492
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,940
She managed to escape indeed.

493
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,340
But I fear Yang Quan's forces

494
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,660
will soon catch up.

495
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:32,860
Capture her alive!

496
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,980
Protect the Princess!

497
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,660
General.

498
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,340
A group of people
just rushed out of the gate.

499
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,460
We're still tricked by her.

500
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,300
Chase them on the main road, quickly!

501
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,780
Your Highness!

502
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,260
Your... Your Highness?

503
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,340
Come on.

504
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:51,980
Your Highness!

505
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,020
Li Rong,

506
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,500
come on, wake up.

507
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,980
You can't just pass out like this.

508
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,260
I intended to help you,
but I made a mistake.

509
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,780
Your new life has just begun.

510
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,340
You can't end up like this.

511
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,180
Li Rong, wake up!

512
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,500
Li Rong! Li Rong!

513
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,300
No one's on horseback.

514
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,340
We've still been tricked.

515
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:35,900
Chase them that way!

516
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,340
The Princess might have left.

517
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:43,820
Hold them off.

518
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,340
Wake up, Li Rong!

519
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,220
Oh my...

520
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,060
I just wanted to have a look
at the eighteen-year-old you.

521
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,140
but I failed to control myself,

522
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,060
and now all this mess has happened.

523
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,220
If you were really dead,

524
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,340
I'd truly feel guilty.

525
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,140
Li Rong, wake up!

526
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,540
Li Rong!

527
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,900
Help! Put me down!

528
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,580
Don't move.

529
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,700
Put me down! Help!

530
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,620
It's me, Pei Wenxuan!

531
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,340
Don't move.

532
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:19,860
Put me down!

533
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,580
Alright, alright.

534
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,180
Why are you here?

535
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,380
We need to leave here quickly.

536
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,300
Yang Quan's people are catching up.

537
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,940
We need to be faster, even faster!

538
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,660
Stop right there!

539
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,260
Please, General,
go inform the Crown Prince

540
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,020
that something happened
to Princess Pingyue.

541
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,100
Just stay.

542
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,300
Where exactly are we?

543
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,180
I was in such a rush

544
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,580
that I didn't see where I was going.

545
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,380
This place

546
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,540
looks like a reed marsh.

547
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,620
I'm asking you how to get out.

548
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,900
I surely know this is a reed marsh.

549
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,100
That's obvious, isn't it?

550
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,860
I don't know the way either.

551
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,620
Forget it.

552
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,940
Let's just see how it goes.

553
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,780
No, I can't walk anymore.

554
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,580
Wait, you...

555
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,100
What's with your attitude?

556
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,820
I'm hurt and I feel dizzy.

557
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,780
I'm not moving anymore.

558
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,740
Fine.

559
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,460
Your Highness,

560
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,500
may I carry you on my back?

561
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,540
Come on, Your Highness.

562
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,980
Don't worry. It's safe and steady.

563
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,260
Squat down steadily.

564
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,380
Here we go!

565
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,620
Now what do we do?

566
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,620
Let's look for a water source first.

567
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,100
You know where to find water?

568
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,740
You don't know, right?

569
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,220
There's a way to find water.

570
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,820
You have to check
what types the plants are,

571
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,140
how dense they are,
and the elevation of the terrain.

572
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,860
I never realized before

573
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,260
you are quite knowledgeable.

574
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,580
You're the distinguished princess

575
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,700
who is well served and taken care of.

576
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,140
How could you understand these things?

577
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,500
I might as well marry a country woman.

578
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,220
Maybe we can have some common topics.

579
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,180
It looks like my distinguished status

580
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,340
bothers you, right?

581
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,180
Why even pursue a career
in the imperial court then?

582
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,100
You might as well be a farmer.

583
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,340
Li Rong,

584
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,420
can you not speak
without being sarcastic?

585
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,420
I can speak normally with others

586
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,420
but not you.

587
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,180
I think

588
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,140
you often have an expressionless face,

589
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,300
and when you smile,
it seems rather scheming.

590
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,340
You look better when you're angry.

591
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,500
Even out of the palace,
you're still so presumptuous?

592
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,260
Do you believe I'd leave you here?

593
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,740
Let's see what you'd do

594
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,620
when Yang Quan catches up.

595
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,620
You mean I'm scared?

596
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,460
He's not going to kill me.

597
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,340
At worst,
he'll just force me into marriage.

598
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,620
I just didn't expect

599
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,900
that his reach would extend this far

600
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,020
to plant a spy in my place

601
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,340
and set an ambush on the road.

602
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,180
He's audacious.

603
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,780
You still haven't told me

604
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,140
why you're here.

605
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,740
I was...

606
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,100
What?

607
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,620
I...

608
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,140
Pei Wenxuan,

609
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,660
I have something to ask you.

610
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,500
Alright, I confess.

611
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,940
It was me, okay?

612
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,020
What did you do?

613
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,420
I can really explain.

614
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,100
I was actually trying to help you.

615
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,300
Those traps...

616
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,660
They were all used on me.

617
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,700
Tell me the truth,

618
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,980
did you come here for revenge?

619
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,540
I really wanted to help you.

620
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,100
Put me down.

621
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,860
Get away from me.

622
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,180
I'm afraid
that I might accidentally kill you.

623
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,020
I was planning to use the trap

624
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,460
to quietly hold off Yang Quan's men.

625
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,740
Who knew you'd show up like that?

626
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:13,940
Besides,

627
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,860
who uses such a foolish method
for revenge?

628
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,740
Foolish?

629
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,300
I think you misunderstand
what foolish means.

630
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,980
I think you're really cunning.

631
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,580
You feel trapped, with no way out,

632
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,380
and desperately want to marry me.

633
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,820
But you can't put aside your pride.

634
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,340
So you thought of a plan

635
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,340
to play the hero

636
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,420
and trick me into your plan, right?

637
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,620
And you were saying
you only came to the banquet

638
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,300
to see the eighteen-year-old me.

639
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,180
I think you just

640
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,780
can't stand seeing me
marrying Su Rongqing.

641
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,660
Why do I care if you marry him?

642
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,300
You do care.

643
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,260
Go ahead and marry him.

644
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,340
But if you...

645
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,220
My neck is sore from your grip.

646
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,460
Li Rong, I have nothing to do with you.

647
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,420
Marry whomever you want.

648
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,060
I don't care. I...

649
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,580
Then why did you make a scene
at the Spring Banquet?

650
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,180
I made a scene?

651
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,980
You're the one who can't let go

652
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,420
and can't part with my status
as a princess.

653
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,500
Oh, please.

654
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,380
You just have princess syndrome.

655
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,380
I am a princess. What's wrong
with having princess syndrome?

656
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,140
You know,

657
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,620
you're the most shameless

658
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,140
and spineless toy boy I've ever met.

659
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,660
Who are you calling a toy boy!

660
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,620
Isn't Su Rongqing a toy boy too?

661
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:08,620
Stop!

662
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,100
Stop!

663
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,060
Don't touch me.

664
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,860
Li Rong, just think about it.

665
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,660
When have I ever relied on you
over these years?

666
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,260
When have you not relied on me?

667
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,660
That was mutual dependence.

668
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:21,940
You helped me develop my career,

669
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,140
and I helped your brother
ascend the throne.

670
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,820
Besides,

671
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,180
who covered the expenses
of Princess Royal's Mansion

672
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,260
over these years?

673
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,420
Well, thank you so much for that.

674
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,300
How generous you are

675
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,580
to support the whole mansion.

676
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,340
But listen, Pei Wenxuan,

677
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,940
never forget where your salaries
come from.

678
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,260
Ultimately,

679
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,100
it's because

680
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,940
you married me.

681
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,620
If you weren't my husband,

682
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,020
would my brother trust you that much?

683
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,700
Please, don't flatter yourself.

684
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,860
You are not covering my expenses.

685
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,380
You are buying resources from me.

686
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,900
I need to get resources from you?

687
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:54,460
Let me ask you,

688
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,140
didn't you use my informants
and my intelligence network?

689
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,860
Did you pay for that?

690
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,580
How about when you pressured others
with my name

691
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,020
and when you asked me
to persuade my brother?

692
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:01,580
What?

693
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,340
Has Li Chuan never questioned you
over these years?

694
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,620
When he suspected you
of manipulating power

695
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,620
and sent you back to your fief,

696
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,540
who pleaded for you then?

697
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,780
No matter what, Li Chuan is my brother.

698
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,940
He won't do anything to me.

699
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:09,820
But you,

700
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,340
when he punished you by flogging,

701
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,900
who asked me to go to the Imperial Study
to beg for mercy for you?

702
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,500
How can you even bring these things up?

703
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,260
Over all the years...

704
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,540
Never mind.

705
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,860
I'm tired. Go find us something to eat.

706
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,380
We can argue after we're full.

707
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,660
What do you want to eat?

708
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,300
A feast.

709
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,740
A feast?

710
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:53,940
Just stay here.

711
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,300
I can't go any further.

712
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,420
Sit for a while.

713
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,700
Where are you going?

714
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,020
To gather some hays and branches.

715
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:17,180
[Qionghua Palace]

716
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:17,980
Concubine Ning,

717
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,860
what do you mean by this?

718
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:26,300
I heard that Her Highness
left her residence on her own,

719
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,300
and now, her whereabouts are unknown.

720
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,700
It seems

721
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,900
she wasn't fond of the consorts
His Majesty chose for her.

722
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,620
I've already sent people
to look for her.

723
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,700
I'm afraid the Princess might
stupidly make a misstep.

724
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:43,260
My daughter is the Princess.

725
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,100
Many are concerned for her well-being.

726
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,260
You don't need to trouble yourself.

727
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,820
If my brother can't marry the Princess,

728
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,820
he can turn

729
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,540
to Princess Huayue.

730
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,620
Are you

731
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,420
threatening me?

732
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,580
Your Majesty,

733
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,380
you don't need to be angry.

734
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,900
Everyone knows

735
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:14,340
His Majesty has always harbored
suspicions towards the Crown Prince.

736
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,100
If we say randomly

737
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,140
that all the Yang Family's actions

738
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,100
are following the Crown Prince's order.

739
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,300
He tries to seize military power
from the Yang Family.

740
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,460
What do you think

741
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,340
His Majesty would do?

742
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,380
Since you're saying this randomly,

743
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,540
then I'll take it
into light consideration.

744
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,900
I'll wait for the good news,
Your Majesty.

745
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,980
Come on, sit here.

746
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,380
The ground is a bit damp.
Don't catch a cold.

747
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,140
Sit on the grass

748
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,340
so it doesn't get blown away.

749
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,700
If it does, we'll have nothing
to start a fire with.

750
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,300
You really don't know
how to speak nicely, do you?

751
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,740
I feel much more comfortable.

752
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,420
When he's not speaking,

753
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,500
he's quite good-looking.

754
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,020
How is it?

755
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,180
You grill it yourself.

756
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,460
I don't know how to grill.

757
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,100
Then don't eat.

758
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,740
But I love grilled fish.

759
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,820
If you don't grill it for me,

760
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,540
I'll just snatch it from you.

761
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,700
You...

762
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,500
Fine, I'll grill this one for you first.

763
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,180
When did you get back?

764
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,220
Over ten days ago. And you?

765
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,500
About the same.

766
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,980
How can this be?

767
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,180
Is this a dream?

768
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,700
I don't know.

769
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,780
I just remember

770
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,980
as I was dying,

771
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,460
I wondered

772
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,300
if we could stand in the heavens

773
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,980
to see the road we've traveled through
from an all-knowing perspective,

774
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,820
would we...

775
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,300
regret some things?

776
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,820
I didn't expect

777
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,220
that you actually
didn't hide it from me.

778
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,540
Why would I hide anything?

779
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,140
You didn't hide anything
from me, either.

780
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,500
I'm not like you.

781
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,300
I tend to take the responsibility
for my actions,

782
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,300
not like you,

783
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,300
a despicable man.

784
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:11,700
Wait,

785
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,700
you call me a despicable man?

786
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,060
It was you who ordered someone
to kill me.

787
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,580
I asked someone to kill you

788
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,700
because you were the one
to break our alliance oath first.

789
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,180
You could kill me,

790
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,300
then why couldn't I retaliate?

791
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,620
When did I ever try to kill you?

792
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:24,900
Drop the act.

793
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,740
I did plant spies in your place,

794
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,060
but that was to guard
against Su Rongqing.

795
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,700
Besides, if I really wanted to kill you,

796
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,740
I would have done it

797
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,980
a long time ago.

798
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,180
When... When did you die?

799
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,260
I died on my way home
after leaving your place

800
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:50,780
in Baiyi Alley.

801
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,100
It was a gruesome death.

802
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,100
Crown... Crown Prince.

803
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:02,740
Hurry.

804
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,540
Greetings, Your Highness.

805
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,740
Su Rongqing, what are you doing here?

806
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,420
I received a report

807
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,140
that Princess Pingyue
had been kidnapped.

808
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,580
I wish to assist you

809
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,180
in rescuing Her Highness.

810
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,740
There's no time to lose. Hurry.

811
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,380
Why do you think I killed you?

812
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,060
You poisoned me.

813
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,060
When did I ever poison you?

814
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:25,940
Poison of the Fragrant Beauty.

815
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,620
No, I didn't.

816
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,620
Alright, then answer my question.

817
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,060
Why did you carry a strange fragrance

818
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,460
on you that day?

819
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,540
You don't usually wear sachets,

820
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,180
but you did that day. Why?

821
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,420
Then you discussed with me
about succession matters

822
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,940
and even threatened
that if I didn't agree,

823
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:40,900
you would kill me.

824
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,820
I was so angry at the time,

825
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:43,740
and I coughed severely.

826
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,660
Right after you left,
the poison took effect.

827
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,180
Yes, there is insufficient evidence,

828
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,020
but you had the motive
and the abilities.

829
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,140
Besides, all clues point to you.

830
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,300
Li Rong,

831
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,060
you just don't trust me.

832
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:01,780
Then explain to me

833
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,380
about the strange fragrance on you.

834
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:05,900
I was afraid

835
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,740
it might upset you.

836
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:12,700
Ridiculous!

837
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,820
Do you mean I, the prince consort,

838
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,540
can't enter
the Princess Royal's Mansion?

839
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,540
Her Highness is in poor health.

840
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,060
If you wish to visit,

841
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,180
you must wear a sachet.

842
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,260
Her Highness
has been bedridden for days.

843
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,180
Everyone in the mansion must wear one,

844
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,420
and

845
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,860
you are no exception.

846
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,420
It's said the Poison of Fragrant Beauty

847
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,660
is triggered by the interaction
of two different poisons.

848
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,340
Perhaps, your body was poisoned

849
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,140
a long time ago,

850
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,580
but the toxins had not yet activated.

851
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:56,740
The sachet that Su Rongqing gave me
acted as a catalyst.

852
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,500
The strong scent on me

853
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,500
triggered the toxins
in your body to react.

854
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,100
Moreover,

855
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,300
Su Rongqing prepared soup and medicine

856
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,620
for you daily.

857
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,780
Wouldn't he have had
even more opportunities to act?

858
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,180
Forget it.

859
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,460
Whether it was Su Rongqing
or not is still unknown.

860
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,180
What's important is, I didn't do this.

861
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,380
Don't pin this on me.

862
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,220
But I once

863
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,220
saved his life.

864
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:37,940
Your brother caused the entire Su Family
to be imprisoned,

865
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,900
with men executed and women exiled.

866
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,140
Su Rongqing survived,

867
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,180
but your family

868
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:45,940
was the primary cause
behind the Su Family's downfall.

869
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:47,820
Moreover,

870
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,620
although Su Rongqing saved his life,

871
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:52,420
he was subjected to castration.

872
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,660
The Su Family in Huajing

873
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,180
is ungrateful for His Majesty's mercy,

874
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,620
trying to plot a rebellion
to overthrow the throne.

875
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,460
The evidence is clear.

876
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,140
All male members are to be executed

877
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,900
while female members are to be exiled

878
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,620
to serve in military labor.

879
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,740
Your Majesty, the Su Family
has been a noble family for centuries,

880
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,340
and they contributed
to the founding of the nation.

881
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:11,820
If their entire family is exterminated,

882
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,900
wouldn't it hurt the feelings
of our people?

883
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,620
As the Princess Royal,

884
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,340
I beg you to spare
the Su Family's members.

885
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,140
What a Princess Royal.

886
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,340
The Su Family planned to ally
with the Empress, Shangguan Ya,

887
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,900
to elevate the Third Prince
to the throne.

888
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:28,980
They're forming factions.

889
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,060
This is treason!

890
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:32,220
Your Majesty.

891
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,900
Have you lost your senses,
Princess Royal?

892
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,540
Are you sure to even protect a traitor?

893
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,180
At least,

894
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,020
spare Su Rongqing.

895
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,260
Su Rongqing is sensible and modest.

896
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,660
He would never involve himself
in such matters.

897
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,740
Being a member of the Su Family,

898
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,460
how could Su Rongqing be unaware
of its internal affairs?

899
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:51,140
If he is spared,

900
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,300
it will lead to endless calamities.

901
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,340
You have already
annihilated the Su Family.

902
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,180
Now that you possess sovereignty,

903
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,140
why would you fear a mere Su Rongqing?

904
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,060
Your Majesty,

905
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:08,740
from childhood,

906
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,620
I have always supported you.

907
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,070
I helped you ascend the throne

908
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:14,780
and have been assisting you
in ruling the nation ever since.

909
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,340
This is the first time
I am asking you for something.

910
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,300
Please, at least spare Su Rongqing.

911
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:21,340
Enough.

912
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,580
I can keep him alive,

913
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:26,700
but he can't escape his punishment.

914
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,540
Decree that Su Rongqing
be subjected to castration.

915
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:39,700
♪Who gazes at the sky from afar?♪

916
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:43,180
