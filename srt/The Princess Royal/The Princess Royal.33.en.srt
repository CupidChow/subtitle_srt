[Episode 33]

5
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,620
Ronghua,

6
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,980
are you so sure
the Crown Prince will ascend the throne?

7
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,020
Rongqing.

8
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,300
You should know when to stop

9
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,100
and turn back while you still can.

10
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,980
Ronghua, don't worry.

11
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,140
All of this will be over soon.

12
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,020
What did you say?

13
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,580
I said,

14
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,020
when the time comes,

15
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,820
I'll propose to the Shangguan Family
on your behalf.

16
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,460
In previous years,

17
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,220
a winter hunt was held
at the end of each year.

18
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,260
But I think

19
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,540
holding a winter hunt year after year
is too solemn.

20
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,460
That's why I'm doing
something different this year.

21
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,820
I call it the Winter Festivity.

22
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,740
There are many youngsters here.

23
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,660
I propose that we should
hold a lion dance contest

24
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,180
for the Winter Festivity.
What do you all think?

25
00:02:59,260 --> 00:02:59,620
Excellent.

26
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,260
It's been so long
since we've enjoyed such performances.

27
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,660
All right.

28
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,180
Yes, Your Majesty.

29
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,180
This is interesting.

30
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,980
Huayue, don't worry.

31
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,660
Father will protect us.

32
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,220
Since that's the case,

33
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,340
you all have to make it interesting

34
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,620
and competitive.

35
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,300
Is anyone willing to volunteer?

36
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,260
Come out

37
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,460
and show me what you've got.

38
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,900
Your Majesty.

39
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,220
I'm willing to perform first
to entertain everyone.

40
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,060
Are you the son of Xie Lanqing?

41
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,340
Your Majesty,

42
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,340
I was exiled to the southwest border.

43
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,460
During these days,
I killed plenty of enemies,

44
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,500
earning military merits

45
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,140
and being promoted
to the fifth-ranked General of the South.

46
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,860
With the cessation of hostilities,
I have been longing for my homeland,

47
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,420
so I've taken a leave
to return to the capital.

48
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,060
I never expected you

49
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,420
to have such favorable turns in life.

50
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,100
Seems like you're not
someone ordinary either.

51
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,220
It's good to turn over a new leaf.

52
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,260
Since you volunteered,

53
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,540
is there a specific one
you want to challenge?

54
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,140
I've heard that Second Young Master Su

55
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,260
is an excellent lion dancer
in the capital.

56
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,100
Since there's a chance,

57
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,180
I hope I can learn a move or two
from Minister Su today.

58
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,820
I knew he was targeting me.

59
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,980
When it comes to lion dancing...

60
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,020
my brother isn't the person
you should compete against.

61
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,300
Your Majesty.

62
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,260
I'm willing to have a competition
on my brother's behalf.

63
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,940
General Lin, I assume
you won't mind, right?

64
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,740
I do like

65
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,300
your temperament.

66
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,380
Both you and General Lin
are extraordinary individuals.

67
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,740
I'm looking forward

68
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,620
to this opening match.

69
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,740
Thank you, Your Majesty.

70
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,180
Your Majesty,

71
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,380
I would like to perform as well.

72
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,180
If we do have enough time,

73
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,180
may I compete
against Second Young Master Su?

74
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,860
Sure. This is excellent!

75
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,860
The Winter Festivity should be exciting.

76
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,420
Go and make your preparations.

77
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,860
Thank you, Your Majesty.

78
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,260
What are you fighting for?

79
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,940
I'm fighting for

80
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,140
what you're fighting for.

81
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,140
Cut the crap.

82
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,180
See you on the stakes.

83
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,660
Ronghua has always indulged himself
in gambling and drinking.

84
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,580
I never expected him

85
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,900
to be good at lion dancing.

86
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,700
Well,

87
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,940
he's pretty skillful at lion dancing.

88
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,180
It's all thanks to my teaching.

89
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,020
Their performances are exciting indeed.

90
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,660
Excellent!

91
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,300
Serve us some tea.

92
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,460
Awesome!

93
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,580
Try this.

94
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,060
First Young Master Su is pretty good.

95
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,300
Just look at him.

96
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,820
It's all thanks to my teaching.

97
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,300
Excellent.

98
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,980
With your status,

99
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,940
you can get any of the noble ladies
to be your bride.

100
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,100
Why are you taking offense at this?

101
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,500
You think I'm taking offense at this?

102
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,060
You've been a playboy all along.

103
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,660
Why are you pretending
to be passionately devoted now?

104
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,860
If you truly love her,

105
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,060
why didn't you marry her sooner?

106
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,060
Mr. Pei,

107
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,900
you surely didn't come just to invite me
for a lion dance, right?

108
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,500
Mr. Su, seems like

109
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,100
you know what I'm going to do next.

110
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:04,780
I guessed it.

111
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,700
You all are trying to help Lin Feibai
take control of the Xie Family.

112
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,420
You're going to kill Xie Chunhe.

113
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,700
And I even know
that you all are trying to kill him

114
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,500
by using
the Poison of the Fragrant Beauty.

115
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,500
Ronghua!

116
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,300
Su Ronghua, is that all you've got?

117
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,340
You started it.

118
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,100
Bring it on then.
Let's have another round.

119
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:05,980
Fine by me.

120
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,260
Enough.

121
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,260
Ronghua, are you hurt?

122
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,180
I'm fine.

123
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,540
Bring them away to have some rest.

124
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,620
I'll check on your injury.

125
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,660
Go now.

126
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,180
You should check on Su Ronghua.

127
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,660
He won't give up

128
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,940
unless you clarify things with him.

129
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,540
Mr. Pei,

130
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,820
I'm afraid you all won't be able
to proceed with your plan.

131
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,660
First, you poisoned Xie Chunhe
with the Poison of the Fragrant Beauty.

132
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,220
You wanted to put him
under your control.

133
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,620
But you realized that the Xie Family
wasn't listening to you at all.

134
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,900
Therefore, you put
the catalyst in the tea

135
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,020
so that he would
die from the poison, right?

136
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,660
Mr. Su, you swapped the tea attendant

137
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,300
to make sure Xie Chunhe's tea
wasn't poisoned.

138
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,620
If so, how would you know

139
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,540
if I did change the tea or not?

140
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,700
Mr. Pei, you're truly a firm character
behind a gentle appearance.

141
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,900
However, even if you did put
the catalyst in the tea,

142
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,420
Xie Chunhe wouldn't die from it.

143
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,180
Mr. Xie!

144
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:38,980
Mr. Xie!

145
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,980
What's going on?

146
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,100
Mr. Xie!

147
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,220
Imperial physician!

148
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:44,900
Chuan.

149
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,460
Go and take a look.

150
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,900
See what's going on.

151
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:49,900
Yes, Father.

152
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,060
I'll go and check on him too.

153
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:53,660
Huayue,

154
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,820
do not be impulsive.

155
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,500
- Mr. Xie!
- Mr. Xie!

156
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,420
What's going on?

157
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,340
Mr. Xie!

158
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,180
Mr. Su, seems like
you still lost in the end.

159
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,140
Don't worry, Mr. Pei.

160
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,900
Xie Chunhe won't die from this.

161
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,380
Come and take a look!

162
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,020
Yes.

163
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,620
Your Majesty,

164
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,420
the lion dance is exciting indeed.

165
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,740
Transmit my order.

166
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,140
Tighten the security.

167
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,460
The show has only just begun.

168
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,620
Poison of the Fragrant Beauty?

169
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,860
In my last life,

170
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,700
during my last argument
with Pei Wenxuan,

171
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,140
that was the smell of the sachet

172
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,500
Su Rongqing gave to Pei Wenxuan.

173
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,460
But why hasn't he coughed up blood yet?

174
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,100
Could it be that the dose of the poison
within the sachet isn't enough?

175
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,180
How is he?

176
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,180
What's the situation?

177
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,140
I can't identify the cause for now.

178
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:02,620
But...

179
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,900
Someone, help Mr. Xie out.

180
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,220
Hurry! Carry him away!

181
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,580
- Yes.
- Yes.

182
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,620
Mr. Su.

183
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,620
Miss Shangguan.

184
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,300
Mr. Su.

185
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,460
Is your hand all right?

186
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,180
It's just a minor sprain.

187
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,020
I'm fine.

188
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,100
Young Master, I shall take my leave.

189
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:36,940
Please have a seat.

190
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,180
No, thanks.

191
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,940
I'm here to tell you something.

192
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,900
Miss Shangguan, are you here
to condemn me

193
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,020
for ruining your plan?

194
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:46,940
That's right.

195
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,740
If so, I shall get you a cup of tea
and seek forgiveness from you.

196
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:49,860
Please have a seat.

197
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,300
Please.

198
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,500
I've heard that the Su Family has been
a renowned family for a century

199
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,580
and your family rules are strict.

200
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,380
As expected,
even your servant is sensible.

201
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,900
However, Mr. Su, I don't understand

202
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,380
why you're not sensible at all.

203
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,780
We used to be friends.

204
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,900
But you were trying
to sabotage my marriage.

205
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,100
Don't you think you went overboard?

206
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,460
Friends?

207
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,060
Shangguan Ya.

208
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,380
I don't think you took me for a friend.

209
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,780
You took me for a fool, didn't you?

210
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,020
We've known each other for a long time.

211
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,660
Did you really only take me
for a friend?

212
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,620
I'll be honest with you.

213
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,460
I've never seen you as a friend.

214
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,380
It's the same for you.

215
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,580
We were just using each other

216
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,540
all along.

217
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,180
At first, it was as you said
that we were using each other.

218
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,460
But what about after that?

219
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,380
Do you still dare say
that we were just using each other?

220
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,660
Why not?

221
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,340
If you used me,

222
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,300
why would you head to the prison
and apologize to me?

223
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,620
If you used me,

224
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,340
why would you meet me at the palace gate

225
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,500
when I took the blame for Ronqing?

226
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,860
If you used me,

227
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,020
why would you watch
the sunrise with me and drink with me

228
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,020
when I had a conflict with Rongqing?

229
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,580
We promised
not to let go of each other's hands...

230
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,780
That's enough.

231
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,300
I was just having fun.

232
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,820
Mr. Su, you take things too seriously.

233
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,700
Having fun?

234
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,140
If you truly only see me
as a friend who can have fun with you,

235
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,500
I will never pester you again.

236
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,340
Look at me.

237
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,540
Look at me!

238
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,900
Do you dare say that again

239
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,260
while looking into my eyes?

240
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,660
Why not?

241
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,860
I can give you the power you want.

242
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:54,900
Shangguan Ya.

243
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,860
I know you want
to keep the Shangguan Family safe.

244
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,380
I know you want to be free.

245
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,420
I know you want
to be in charge of the Shangguan Family.

246
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,020
I have my own businesses.

247
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,060
They've been doing great
all these years.

248
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,380
I can provide you
with provisions and forage.

249
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,700
I have a fief in Lan County.

250
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,140
The late Emperor bestowed it on me
some years ago.

251
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,780
You may build your army there.

252
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,260
If you intend to fight your brothers
for the Shangguan Family

253
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,780
and you need the support
of the imperial court,

254
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,060
I can join the officialdom.

255
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,940
If you don't want me
to join the officialdom,

256
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,340
I'll stay in the Shangguan Family

257
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,580
and assist you.

258
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,380
Ya.

259
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,660
I can give you

260
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,060
everything you want

261
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,620
and even more.

262
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,620
I didn't propose to you earlier

263
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,340
because the timing wasn't right.

264
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,420
When will be the right timing, then?

265
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,220
After the Crown Prince
ascends the throne.

266
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,140
Do you think the Su Family
will still be around

267
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,620
after the Crown Prince
ascends the throne?

268
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,900
Don't you know

269
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,660
what Su Rongqing is doing?

270
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,820
Of course, I know
what Su Rongqing is doing.

271
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,980
But have my father and I
taken any action?

272
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:14,780
Ya.

273
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,780
No matter who ascends the throne,

274
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,420
the Su Family will be fine.

275
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,940
My family has never been involved
in disputes over the throne.

276
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,340
Rongqing

277
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,940
is just one of His Majesty's pawns.

278
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,340
Since he's bound by the family rules,

279
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,300
he'll stop at where he should.

280
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,980
The Crown Prince is supported
by the noble families.

281
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,620
Now, the Shangguan Family
just needs to lie low.

282
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,180
Once His Majesty passes away
and the Crown Prince ascends the throne,

283
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,140
we can get married.

284
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,820
If you're willing,

285
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,180
I will have a grand procession
to marry you

286
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,340
as the wife of the first young master
of the Su Family.

287
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,140
If you're not willing,

288
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,620
I'll tell you the same thing.

289
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,420
I'm willing to leave the Su Family
of my own accord

290
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,140
and marry into your family.

291
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,460
Su Ronghua.

292
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,340
I know all about...

293
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,060
your sincere feelings for me.

294
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,100
It's a shame that you don't understand
what Su Rongqing wants.

295
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,140
You don't understand...

296
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,740
what I want either.

297
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,620
Why hasn't he coughed up blood yet?

298
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,380
Young Master!

299
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,660
Young Master, what happened?

300
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,420
Young Master?

301
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,540
What are you doing?

302
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,020
Your Highness!

303
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,300
I encountered a soothsayer
on the streets today.

304
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,220
He said a disaster
would befall my young master today.

305
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,540
Thus, he gave me this sachet.

306
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,460
He said if something like that
were to happen,

307
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,980
I should immerse this in the tea.

308
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,060
After that, I should serve Young Master
with the tea.

309
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,060
Your Highness,

310
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,220
please make way!

311
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,500
This concerns his life!

312
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,300
Give it to me.

313
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,460
These aren't valuable herbs.

314
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,580
I'll give it a try.

315
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,140
Young Master?

316
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:58,820
Young Master.

317
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,700
His pulses have been stabilized.

318
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,350
He vomited the poison as well.

319
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,420
That isn't the poison.

320
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,500
That's the antidote.

321
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,700
I need an answer.

322
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,580
I need to know the truth.

323
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:23,740
Your Highness.

324
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,140
Miss Shangguan wishes to speak with you
at the back hill.

325
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,180
Where's Miss Shangguan?

326
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,460
Oh no!

327
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,180
Rong!

328
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,700
It's an ambush.

329
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,060
Chuan!

330
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:09,980
Protect Her Highness!

331
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,620
Chuan!

332
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,060
Run!

333
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,260
Chuan!

334
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,420
Escort my sister to leave!

335
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,740
Chuan!

336
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,740
Rong, just leave!

337
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,260
Your Highness, run!

338
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,180
Fengming, let's retreat!

339
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,380
After her!

340
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,460
Young Master.

341
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,540
Thank you, sir.

342
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,100
No!

343
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,780
Cheng!

344
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,020
Cheng!

345
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,380
- Prince Su?
- Cheng!

346
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,140
Prince Su!

347
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:32,860
Cheng!

348
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,500
Your Majesty!

349
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,460
Cheng!

350
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,020
Imperial physician!

351
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,780
- Imperial physician!
- Imperial physician!

352
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,420
Cheng!

353
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,100
Your Majesty.

354
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,060
Hurry!

355
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,140
Your Majesty, he...

356
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:50,780
He...

357
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,180
Speak up!

358
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,460
I think His Highness is poisoned!

359
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,140
By what kind of poison?

360
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:53,740
Shut up!

361
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,860
Treat him the way you neutralize
the Poison of the Fragrant Beauty.

362
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,620
If you fail, I'll execute you
and your entire clan!

363
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,260
Yes, Your Majesty!

364
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,220
Li Rong!

365
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,420
Pei Wenxuan!

366
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:43,820
Hurry!

367
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,420
Your Highness!

368
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,700
Hold onto me!

369
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,580
Your Highness,

370
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,940
this time, I finally
won against Pei Wenxuan.

371
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,180
Li Rong!

372
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,300
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

373
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,100
Your Highness, calm down!

374
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,980
It's useless
even if you jump after them.

375
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,220
Now, you're Her Highness's last hope.

376
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,660
Our priority right now
is to protect the Crown Prince.

377
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,500
Head to the bottom of the cliff.

378
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,020
Find Her Highness at all costs.

379
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:58,980
Yes, sir!

380
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,500
The rest of you,

381
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,180
follow me.

382
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,140
Li Chuan, there's no escape.

383
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,620
I'll show you some respect.

384
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,020
You may cut your throat.

385
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,140
Your Highness, you should retreat.

386
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,660
Kill them!

387
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,140
Fengming!

388
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,460
Your Highness.

389
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,420
Protect His Highness!

390
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,220
Escort His Highness back to the tent.

391
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:49,860
Your Highness!

392
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,460
Come on.

393
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:54,820
Your Highness.

394
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,540
Be careful.

395
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,460
Where's Rong?

396
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,100
Where is Rong?

397
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,780
Your Highness, I'll bring her here

398
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,100
once you've fully recovered.

399
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,580
Take His Highness for some rest.

400
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,140
You won't deceive me, right?

401
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,300
I won't. Imperial physician.

402
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,140
Your Highness, please have some rest.

403
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,340
Come on.

404
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,700
Mr. Pei.

405
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,740
Li Cheng isn't dead.

406
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,860
We have to send someone
to keep an eye on the palace.

407
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,220
Regarding Li Chuan's injury,

408
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,620
I want no one else to know it

409
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,260
no matter whether he lives
or dies in the end.

410
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,580
Also,

411
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,180
notify Lin Feibai and his troops

412
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,100
to be ready to enter the capital
ahead of schedule.

413
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,100
Miss Shangguan, I'll be counting on you.

414
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:57,900
Mr. Pei.

415
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,700
You must bring Her Highness back.

416
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,180
I will.

417
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,260
Don't worry.

418
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,460
I'm not trying to kill you.

419
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,940
I still have questions for you.

420
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,780
Therefore, I won't kill you.

421
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,700
Your Highness, what questions
do you have for me?

422
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,140
Back then...

423
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,060
how did I die?

424
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,420
Your Highness, you asked me
the same question before.

425
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:27,980
I killed you...

426
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,740
You're lying.

427
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,100
Today, Pei Wenxuan

428
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,460
poisoned Xie Chunhe by using
the Poison of the Fragrant Beauty.

429
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,380
But Xie Chunhe didn't die immediately

430
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,980
when the poison was taking effect.

431
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,460
There must be something that was
delaying the effects of the poison.

432
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,100
When I rushed there,

433
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,060
I detected an abnormal scent
from Xie Chunhe.

434
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,340
It had the same smell

435
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,060
as the smell I detected

436
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,260
from Pei Wenxuan back then.

437
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,380
At first, I thought that was
the Poison of the Fragrant Beauty.

438
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,780
But after that,

439
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,820
Xie Chunhe's servant added
the ingredients inside the sachet

440
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,380
into the tea and fed him with it.

441
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,220
After that,

442
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,660
the poison was neutralized.

443
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,500
Therefore, I have reasons

444
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,340
to suspect that you didn't
give Pei Wenxuan the poison back then.

445
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,220
You gave him the antidote,
which delayed the effects of the poison.

446
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,140
Am I right?

447
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:31,740
If so, who exactly killed me?

448
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:34,820
Your Highness.

449
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,660
That's not important.

450
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,780
It's not important?

451
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,940
If so,

452
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,020
let's return together.

453
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,620
We shall assist Chuan together.

454
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,780
Your Highness.

455
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:22,140
Li Chuan once annihilated my clan.

456
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,300
But the current him
did nothing to your clan.

457
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,740
Why can't you let him off?

458
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,980
We can make a new choice.

459
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,500
Some events

460
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,780
are entirely preventable.

461
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,860
Why can't you let him off?

462
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,020
Let's assist Chuan

463
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,940
and help him ascend the throne.

464
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,740
You can be the master of the Su Family.

465
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,580
I can even be your matchmaker.

466
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,660
You can marry the lady you love.

467
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,100
Don't worry.

468
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,100
With me around,

469
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,540
Chuan won't do anything
to the noble families.

470
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:55,780
Let's

471
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:57,860
assist Chuan

472
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,060
and help him become an emperor
who will be remembered for centuries.

473
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,940
This way, all of us can live in peace.

474
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,220
It won't end that way.

475
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,500
Your Highness,

476
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,580
you should stay out of this.

477
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,580
You should leave Huajing
together with Pei Wenxuan.

478
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,660
I'll bring you back

479
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,700
after one year.

480
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,740
For what?

481
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,500
Is it to witness Chuan's ascension?

482
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,780
He cannot ascend the throne!

483
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,540
Even if you don't tell me...

484
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,420
I still know the answer.

485
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,380
I'm sure that I was killed

486
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,980
by the Poison
of the Fragrant Beauty back then.

487
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,310
If not, you wouldn't have used
the antidote to it.

488
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,620
And only three people
know about its formula.

489
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,100
It's you,

490
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,500
Pei Wenxuan,

491
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,140
and...

492
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,540
And Li Chuan.

493
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,140
If it wasn't you

494
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,860
or Pei Wenxuan,

495
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,220
who else could it be?

496
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,260
I'm not a golden canary
kept in a cage.

497
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,900
I've been through pleasant moments.

498
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,500
I've been through hard times as well.

499
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,100
Su Rongqing.

500
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,780
If you still take me as the Princess,

501
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,940
turn around and look at me.

502
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,700
Look at me.

503
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:01,900
Tell me.

504
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,580
Who...

505
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,300
killed me?

506
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,580
It was everyone.

507
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,020
It was me.

508
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,180
It was Li Chuan.

509
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,020
It was Shangguan Ya.

510
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,980
All of us joined our forces
and killed you.

511
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,940
So, Your Highness...

512
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,940
Now, you know

513
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,540
why I would never allow Li Chuan
to ascend the throne again

514
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,300
even though this might only be a dream.

515
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,100
Now, you know...

516
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,580
why I have to sit idly by

517
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,580
and watch you marry another man

518
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,460
even though I've entered your dream

519
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,140
as

520
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,980
a perfectly normal man.

521
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,260
Did you think I didn't wish
to vie for you?

522
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,020
Did you think I dared not do so
or I couldn't win?

523
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,500
It's none of that.

524
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,620
It's all because...

525
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,900
I don't have the right to do so.

526
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,780
People like Li Chuan and me...

527
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,300
only deserve to live in hell.

528
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,260
I deserve to die.

529
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,140
Li Chuan...

530
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,420
deserves to die as well.

531
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,490
Young Master, our men and I
can head down there ourselves.

532
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,100
I'll head there myself.

533
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:19,580
Wait.

534
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,460
Young Master.

535
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,660
This is too high and too risky.

536
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,580
Can't you just wait here for our news?

537
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,660
Young Master, why are you so stubborn?

538
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,260
What if something happens to you?

539
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:32,700
If so, I...

540
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,220
Enough!

541
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,220
You only care about me.

542
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,140
What about Her Highness?

543
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,980
She fell off the cliff
right in front of me.

544
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,740
But I couldn't do anything about it.

545
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,460
I could've caught her hands

546
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,380
had I been

547
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,020
a little faster, just like Su Rongqing.

548
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,500
I'm the most useless prince consort
in the world.

549
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,260
Young Master,
this isn't entirely your fault.

550
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,460
I must find Her Highness.

551
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,980
I must find Her Highness!

552
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,220
Young Master, you should take a break.

553
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,060
I said, let's continue.

554
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,620
Young Master, wait for me!

555
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:20,740
Young Master!

556
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,380
Young Master.

557
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,780
Young Master, watch out!

558
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,580
What's the reason?

559
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,780
Why did Chuan kill me?

560
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,980
I spent my whole life assisting him.

561
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,780
I was his elder sister.

562
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,660
I was the closest blood relative he had

563
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,460
after our parents had passed away.

564
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,300
Even if he was worried
about my influence and power,

565
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,020
he shouldn't have resorted
to ruthlessness.

566
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,540
It was the tenth year of Dexu Era.

567
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,460
You were traveling around.

568
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,030
Then you encountered an alchemist.

569
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,660
He excelled at making elixirs.

570
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,860
You inquired about him
from various sources

571
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,220
and visited him
in the mountains several times

572
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,980
before you were able to convince him
to leave the mountain.

573
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,060
Then you recommended him to Li Chuan.

574
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,660
Not long after that,

575
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:45,310
Li Chuan often felt unwell.

576
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,860
He launched a thorough investigation
within the palace.

577
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,860
However, he didn't discover anything.

578
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,420
The alchemist you recommended
to Li Chuan

579
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,660
died because he fell into the lake
after getting drunk.

580
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,500
So, there was something wrong
with the alchemist?

581
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,020
That alchemist

582
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,540
was carefully selected
by the noble families.

583
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,060
Shangguan Ya came up with the plan.

584
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,540
She lured you

585
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:10,620
into encountering the alchemist.

586
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:19,580
So...

587
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,900
So, that made Chuan think

588
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,780
that I was trying to kill him, right?

589
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,180
But why didn't he ask me about it?

590
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:33,780
If he did...

591
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:34,500
What should he ask you?

592
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:37,290
Your Highness, what if you were the one

593
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,980
who planted the alchemist
by His Majesty's side on purpose?

594
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,780
Would you admit to it?

595
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,260
Since it was discovered back then,

596
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,260
why wasn't I investigated at that time?

597
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:53,980
How could he investigate you?

598
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:56,980
You're the Princess Royal
representing the noble families,

599
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,580
the powerful regent Princess Royal.

600
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,220
If he were to make a move
against you openly,

601
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,580
how certain could he be of success?

602
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:07,900
So...

603
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,500
So...

604
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,580
he chose to poison you.
