- We wish to see Your Majesty.
- We wish to see Your Majesty.

7
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,300
I am the Empress

8
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,580
and the biological mother
of the Crown Prince.

9
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,300
Why does His Majesty refuse to see me?

10
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,220
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

11
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,340
Prime Minister Pei has given an order
that no one is allowed

12
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,020
to step into the Hanqiu Palace

14
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,660

no one may enter

Your Majesty,
you've come to the Hanqiu Palace

in the middle of the night
with these ministers.

28
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,900
Do you intend to force an abdication?

[Shangguan Ya,

30
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,020
Prime Minister Pei,

31
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,700
His Majesty has been waiting for you.

32
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,060

Tell him to stay on standby.

37
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,380
Yes, Your Majesty.

38
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,980
You are awake, Your Highness.

39
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,020
This is freshly brewed pear soup.

do you want to leave a message?

48
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,540
Depose Crown Prince Li Xin

49
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,460
and let the Eldest Prince Li Ping
inherit the throne.

50
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,380
I have already prepared everything

51
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,860
on my way here.

52
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,220
[Depose him
from the position of Crown Prince]

53
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,780
Since the founding of the Xia Dynasty,

54
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,860
the power has always been in the hands
of the Noble Houses.

55
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,460
Although my Li Family is royalty,

56
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,580
we are merely puppets
of the Noble Houses.

57
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,940
It is only when facing death

58
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,620
that I realize my eldest sister,

59
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,940
Princess Royal Li Rong,

60
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,740
is the true power
behind the Noble Houses.

61
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,260
After my demise,

62
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,820
if the Princess Royal plots a rebellion,

63
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,820
how should you, her nominal husband

64
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,620
and the representative
of the commoners, respond,

65
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,060
Prime Minister Pei?

66
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,140
The nation belongs to the people.

67
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,420
As long as I am here,

68
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,020
the commoners

69
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,300
will not fall into decline.

70
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,860
What is the situation
with the Crown Prince's succession?

71
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,700
Prime Minister Pei refuses to relent

72
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,620
and insists on following
His Majesty's wishes

73
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,700
to appoint the Eldest Prince Li Ping
as the Crown Prince.

74
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,620
Pei Wenxuan intends to make Li Ping
the Crown Prince.

75
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,060
We, the Noble Houses,
will be their biggest obstacle.

76
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,260
Therefore, before he makes a move...

77
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,420
Before Pei Wenxuan makes a move...

78
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,380
Your Highness, rest assured.

79
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,500
Everything has been arranged properly.

80
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,620
That's good to know.

81
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,620
If I died,

82
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,700
Pei Wenxuan would have unmatched power.

83
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,460
If you died,

84
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,500
he wouldn't survive either.

85
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,860
I'd kill him

86
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,740
to let him be buried with you.

87
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,940
I never realized

88
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,220
that our Young Master Su,
so elegant and composed,

89
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,980
could also get angry.

90
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,340
There are lots of things
that can make me angry,

91
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,300
for example...

92
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,420
Your Highness, Prime Minister Pei
requests an audience.

93
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,700
If Your Highness prefers not to see him,

94
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,100
I'll go and send him away.

95
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,140
After all, we are husband and wife,

96
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,980
and we haven't divorced yet.

97
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,700
I shall go and see him.

98
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,660
Probably,

99
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,100
this will be our final meeting.

100
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,500
You may leave now.

101
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,100
Ask him to leave.

102
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,740
Rongqing.

103
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,020
Could you get me a cup of tea, please?

104
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,140
Then please take care of yourself.

105
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,980
I promise not to get angry.

106
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,140
What do you come to see me for?

107
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,500
I've come today

108
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,780
to discuss the matter
of appointing the Crown Prince with you.

109
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,900
Xin is the biological son
of the Empress Shangguan Ya.

110
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,340
He is modest, respectful,
and utterly worthy of the position.

111
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,620
What's there to discuss?

112
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,540
The Third Prince Li Xin
is arrogant and unruly,

113
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,580
which makes him unsuitable
for the position of Crown Prince.

114
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,740
His mother, Shangguan,
holds too much power.

115
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,060
If something were to happen
to you and me in the future...

116
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,900
Why is he also wearing the sachet?

117
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,820
And the fragrance is so strong.

118
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,220
You're saying high-sounding words.

119
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,700
But you know exactly

120
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,060
what your true purpose is.

121
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,420
Do you insist on letting Li Xin
ascend the throne?

122
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,100
Xin is the biological son
of the Empress.

123
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,220
Are we really
going to let a concubine's son

124
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,700
ascend the throne instead?

125
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,180
Are you still holding a grudge
against Zhen?

126
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,380
Can you please address her
as Imperial Concubine Qin?

127
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,420
How can you call her Zhen?

128
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,900
Don't forget

129
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,700
that the Qin Zhenzhen you adore

130
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,740
is my younger brother,

131
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,220
the current Emperor Li Chuan's
deceased concubine.

132
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,820
Her child Li Ping cannot
become the Crown Prince.

133
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,260
You can still talk this much with me.

134
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,020
It seems

135
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,580
you are not as frail
as has been rumored.

136
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,100
If you disagree, so be it.

137
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,780
We'll each handle things
our own way later on.

138
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,460
But don't blame me
for not reminding you.

139
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,460
I'd like to know

140
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,540
what your way will be.

141
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,220
Whatever way you think it is.

142
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,980
What? Are you going to kill me?

143
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,540
Do you think I don't dare to do so?

144
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,620
Pei Wenxuan,

145
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,340
do you really want to sacrifice
the well-being of the whole world

146
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,660
for your own selfish desires?

147
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,500
What capabilities do I possess

148
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,220
to influence the whole world?

149
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,860
However, the person
favored by Your Highness

150
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,260
may not necessarily
be of good character.

151
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,140
What's the point of him,
a castrated man,

152
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,620
currying favor with you here?

153
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,460
What did you say?

154
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,620
Pei Wenxuan.

155
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,460
Pei Wenxuan,

156
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,380
I won't allow you
to slander Rongqing in the slightest!

157
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,780
We agreed not to get angry,

158
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,900
so why are you
getting so worked up again?

159
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,660
Go fetch the medicine for Her Highness.

160
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,660
- Yes.
- Yes.

161
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,940
He's definitely up to no good
coming to see you here.

162
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,940
You're still unwell,
so why bother seeing him?

163
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,060
I'm fine.

164
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,060
What's wrong?

165
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,300
Imperial Physician!
Get the Imperial Physician now!

166
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,580
It's the Poison of the Fragrant Beauty.

167
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,420
Pei Wenxuan.

168
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,020
It's Pei Wenxuan.

169
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,900
The sachet he was wearing...

170
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,460
Rong, stop talking.

171
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,500
Conserve your strength.

172
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,460
I'm sorry.

173
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,980
I failed to protect you.

174
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,140
He finally made his move against me.

175
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,580
Heed my order.

176
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,780
If I die,

177
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,420
Pei Wenxuan...

178
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,020
cannot live.

179
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,260
Young Master,
I feel something's not right.

180
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,220
[Tong Ye, Pei Wenxuan's valet]
Could it be that the Princess's Mansion

181
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,060
has sent someone to follow us?

182
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,260
Ignore them.

183
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,980
How can we ignore them?

184
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,540
She's just trying to scare me.

185
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,980
She won't actually kill me.

186
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,220
Whose order are you following?

187
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,740
By order of the Princess Royal,

188
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,260
you shall be killed without mercy.

189
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,420
I never thought

190
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,060
you would eventually attack me.

191
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,780
You are the only weal and woe...

192
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,580
that I cannot avoid in my lifetime.

193
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,820
What's the situation
with that person now?

194
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,260
It's all sorted.

195
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,580
For twenty years,

196
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,260
I've been entangled with him.

197
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,420
I've never expected it

198
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,380
to end like this.

199
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,860
It's all over between you and him.

200
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,260
None of us

201
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,340
are worthy of Your Highness.

202
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,420
My greatest regret...

203
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,220
in this lifetime...

204
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,780
is...

205
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,420
missing you.

206
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,940
If only

207
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,620
I could dream a great dream

208
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,260
and I could start...

209
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,540
everything anew.

210
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:15,540
The Princess Royal has passed away.

211
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,620
Where am I?

212
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,300
It's been a while,

213
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,020
warm sunshine.

214
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,460
Your Highness, you're awake.

215
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,500
Jinglan?

216
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,820
What's going on?

217
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,820
How come she's not dead?

218
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,380
Jinglan, aren't you...

219
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,140
Watch out, Your Highness.

220
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,860
Could it be

221
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,540
that we're now meeting
in the underworld?

222
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,300
Your Highness, it hurts.

223
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,060
You really are alive.

224
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,100
You are not dead.

225
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:25,740
Your Highness,
why are you wishing me dead

226
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,140
when there's nothing happened?

227
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,020
I don't know
whether the past was a dream

228
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,940
or the present is a dream,

229
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,660
but luckily, you're still alive.

230
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,940
That's great.

231
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,420
Your Highness, are you all right?

232
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,620
It's already the hour of Si.
[*9 AM to 11 AM]

233
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,180
His Majesty held court
and has just finished it.

234
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,420
He has sent word for you

235
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,820
to join him for lunch.

236
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,980
I was just about to come and wake you.

237
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,620
But you are already awake.

238
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,700
You said His Majesty
had just finished court?

239
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,700
That's great.

240
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,380
The message from the palace
said his days were numbered.

241
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:05,820
By the way,

242
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,020
how about that rascal Pei Wenxuan?

243
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,420
Has he died yet?

244
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,580
Who is this Pei Wenxuan?

245
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,540
Do you have a grudge against him?

246
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,980
The Poison of the Fragrant Beauty

247
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,300
not only failed to kill me

248
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,820
but also had the miraculous effect
of rejuvenating me.

249
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,260
Your Highness.

250
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,020
This isn't the Princess Royal's Mansion,

251
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,820
but the Changle Palace
where I lived before getting married.

252
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,620
My body feels so light.

253
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,780
Your Highness, where are you going?

254
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,580
Please slow down.

255
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,540
Your Highness.

256
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,860
What's happening to you, Your Highness?

257
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,260
Tell me

258
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,740
what year it is now.

259
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,060
It's...

260
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,940
It's the twenty-fourth year
of the Yongning Era now.

261
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,740
The twenty-fourth year
of the Yongning Era?

262
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,820
This year,

263
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,900
I am eighteen years old.

264
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,300
I am not yet married,

265
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,620
and neither you
nor Father have passed away.

266
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,020
What on earth is going on?

267
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,060
Could it be that even heaven feels

268
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,340
that the old me lived
too constrained a life?

269
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,540
You are just like your mother,
wanting to control the royal family

270
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,180
with the support
of the Shangguan Family.

271
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,900
If one day I ascended the throne,

272
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,700
would you also pressure me like
how the Noble Houses

273
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,740
pressured Father?

274
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,820
What is your relationship with her?

275
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,620
Childhood friends.

276
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,940
I wonder

277
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,500
how Rongqing is doing now.

278
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,380
I must have been blind

279
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,460
to have chosen that rascal Pei Wenxuan.

280
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,380
It brought me nothing but my own demise.

281
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,340
This time, just you wait.

282
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,700
Your Highness,

283
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,900
we shall get going.

284
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,980
We can't keep His Majesty waiting.

285
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,340
Do you know

286
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,300
why Father has summoned me for a meal?

287
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,580
His Majesty

288
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,460
wants to choose a consort for you.

289
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,380
So here I am, facing
another meal of hidden dangers.

290
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,100
It's such a coincidence

291
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,860
that I've come back to this day.

292
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,260
Since heaven has given me

293
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,340
another chance,

294
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,740
I won't repeat my past mistakes.

295
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,660
Pei Wenxuan,
you'd better not be on the list.

296
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:03,900
Help me get dressed.

297
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,460
Your Highness.

298
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,580
Pei Wenxuan,

299
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,060
no matter why we end up together,

300
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,140
now that we're married,

301
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,820
I still want to spend
a lifetime with you.

302
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,820
I am deeply honored

303
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,700
and will be eternally grateful
and repay your favor.

304
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,620
In that case, our primary concern

305
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,340
going forward will be honesty.

306
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,500
Despite our initial vows,

307
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,060
he, like everyone else in this palace,

308
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,420
inevitably leaned towards power
and personal gain.

309
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,790
[Hanqiu Palace]

310
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,420
I haven't seen Father in over ten years.

311
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,540
Has he already aged so much

312
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,340
[Li Ming, Emperor]
since I was eighteen?

313
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,420
Father,

314
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,500
if everything were to start over,

315
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,620
could we just be a common father
and daughter from an ordinary family?

316
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,500
Why are you standing at the doorway?

317
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,460
I...

318
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,300
I'm here to greet you, Father.

319
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:43,900
You may rise.

320
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,860
Come join me for the meal.

321
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,620
Father,

322
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,980
this is the chestnut cake
that I brought for you

323
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,980
from the Changle Palace.
It's your favorite.

324
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,700
Please try it.

325
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,140
Eunuch Fu, this is inappropriate.

326
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:05,980
Shush.

327
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:07,500
[Fu Lai]

328
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,520
[Chief Eunuch]
These are snacks

329
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,300
brought by Her Highness.

330
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,580
Your Highness, please forgive him.

331
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,380
The newcomer
doesn't understand the rules.

332
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,420
You may leave now.

333
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,380
Delicious.

334
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,580
Father, have a taste.

335
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,060
Okay, I'll have a taste.

336
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,860
That's very thoughtful of you, Rong.

337
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,060
Father, why are you inviting me

338
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,700
to have a meal with you today?

339
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:58,900
Fu Lai.

340
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,580
Someone.

341
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,540
Your Highness, please take a look.

342
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,260
The first one is Lu Yu,
the son of Marquis Ningguo, Lu Tingwei.

343
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:09,260
He was granted the title
of hereditary marquis by royal decree.

344
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:10,700
The second one is Yang Quan,

345
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,620
the second son of Grand Marshal,
Yang Ye.

346
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,250
He was granted the title
of first-class major general

347
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:17,980
by royal decree.

348
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,780
The third one

349
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,940
is the newly acclaimed scholar,
Cui Yulang.

350
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,820
It's exactly the same as before.

351
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,700
The fourth one is Pei Wenxuan,

352
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,420
the son of the former Vice Minister
of Rites, Pei Lizhi,

353
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,470
He was the top candidate recommended

354
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,620
in the twenty-second year
of the Yongning Era.

355
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,940
What is meant to come has come.

356
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,220
There's no escaping it in the end.

357
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,900
Father.

358
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,140
Recently, everyone in the court
has been talking about your marriage.

359
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,060
I was thinking it was about time
for you to get married,

360
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,580
so I called you over to see

361
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,820
if any of these four young men

362
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,660
catch your eye.

363
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:16,900
What's the matter?

364
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,460
None of them attract you?

365
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,540
I've carefully selected them for you.

366
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,820
Just pick one that you find agreeable

367
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,300
and I will take care of the rest.

368
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,340
Everything is just as before.

369
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,540
I am merely a pawn for Father

370
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,020
to balance the Noble Houses.

371
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,140
It's not that I don't find
any of them appealing.

372
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,100
It's just that they all look

373
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,380
so handsome.

374
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,460
I want them all.

375
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,660
Don't be ridiculous.

376
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,220
All of you, leave.

377
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,180
I'll take my leave, Your Highness.

378
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,620
If I did allow you to do that,

379
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,700
then I might receive countless memorials
from the ministers

380
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,460
in the future.

381
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,060
Father, I was just joking.

382
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,700
Isn't one's moral quality

383
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,420
the most important thing in a marriage

384
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,340
rather than his appearance?

385
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,540
I can't tell much just by looks alone.

386
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,060
How about this?

387
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,340
You allow me to dress up

388
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,740
as an ordinary girl

389
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,460
and then you tell these gentlemen

390
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,780
to meet and talk to me.

391
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,380
We can build some early rapport.

392
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,020
It would be great

393
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,220
if you could also allow me
to go out of the palace for a bit.

394
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,420
I've heard

395
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,220
that the roasted duck
at the Linglong Pavilion is the best

396
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,180
and the peach blossoms
at the Huguo Temple are stunning.

397
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:28,940
Alright, alright.

398
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,580
Are you planning
to meet your future husband

399
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,540
or just wanting to go out and have fun?

400
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,820
Father.

401
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,420
Father, please agree to my request.

402
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,700
Father, please.

403
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,340
The Spring Banquet
is right around the corner anyway.

404
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,620
Then why not use the Spring Banquet
as an opportunity to meet them?

405
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,220
Invite these four young men over.

406
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,740
You can meet them and have a chat.

407
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:00,780
What is it?

408
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,260
Do you have any other concerns?

409
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,340
I think

410
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,380
if we only invite those four,

411
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,740
it might be too obvious.

412
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,380
Why not invite more young men
from the Noble Houses?

413
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,540
We will only know if a man is good

414
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,020
when there's a comparison.

415
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,580
With so many young gentlemen
standing together,

416
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,220
I'll be able to tell who's good

417
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,620
and who's bad at a glance.

418
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,580
What do you think, Father?

419
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,660
That's quite an idea.

420
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,500
You do have a lot of clever ideas.

421
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,420
Thank you, Father.

422
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,380
[Princess Royal]
Young Master.

423
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,660
Young Master.

424
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,380
Great news.

425
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,260
Incredibly great news.

426
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,060
Tong Ye?

427
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,500
How come you look so young?

428
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,460
I look young?

429
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,620
Am I dreaming?

430
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,060
Young Master, are you alright?

431
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,540
Are you upset about Miss Qin
calling off the engagement?

432
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,340
Don't take it to heart.

433
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,180
Her calling off the engagement
is her loss.

434
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:18,740
Hold on.

435
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,020
What date is today?

436
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,890
The first day of the third month

437
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:24,980
in the twenty-fourth year
of the Yongning Era.

438
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,140
Young Master, please remember today.

439
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,220
It's a hugely auspicious day.

440
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,380
What auspicious day?

441
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,100
I'll be brief.

442
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,820
Things haven't been going well
for us lately, right?

443
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,700
Miss Qin called off the engagement,

444
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,340
Mrs. Tong is pressuring us
for debts every day,

445
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,980
and your second uncle
is holding onto the family's money.

446
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,420
Isn't this the time
when I was at my poorest?

447
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,300
How could it be an auspicious day?

448
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,180
Say, if...

449
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:53,700
Enough.

450
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,380
I thought you said you'd be brief.

451
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,420
Okay.

452
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,580
So I thought I should find a way
to turn things around for you.

453
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,940
And I went to offer incense
to ancestors.

454
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,980
Get to the point.

455
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,380
Here comes the point.

456
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,060
As soon as I made a wish

457
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,540
for you to have a good marriage,

458
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,300
Master seems to have blessed us.

459
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,340
Do you know?

460
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,940
Princess Pingyue sent her maid

461
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,260
to deliver you an invitation

462
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,100
to ask you to attend the Spring Banquet.

463
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,260
Princess Pingyue?

464
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,300
You mean Li Rong?

465
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,580
You can't just address the princess
by her name.

466
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,540
If they heard it

467
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,380
and spread the word,
it could mean death.

468
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,780
She's been waiting in the study for us
for quite a while.

469
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:32,740
So...

470
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,700
Let's think about it this way.

471
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,420
There's a reason the Qin Family
called off the engagement.

472
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,060
Ever since Master passed away,

473
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,100
your second uncle
has been oppressing you.

474
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,500
He doesn't give you the money
when you ask for it.

475
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,540
And he doesn't give you the power
when you need it.

476
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,460
I'm telling you, it's probably

477
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,060
those scoundrels

478
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:48,980
causing all this trouble.

479
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,420
Can you be quiet for a moment?

480
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,940
From now on,
don't ever mention this matter anymore.

481
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,260
Yes. Then you should stop being sad.

482
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,220
Is this my karma?

483
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,620
I've returned to my most destitute time.

484
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,180
The Qin Family’s young lady
broke off our engagement,

485
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,140
and soon after, Princess Pingyue
would be selecting a consort.

486
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,020
Young Master Pei,

487
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,180
this is an invitation

488
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,940
to the Spring Banquet
from Princess Pingyue.

489
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,820
When he received the invitation,

490
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,660
was he surprised and delighted?

491
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,580
Did he ask you in astonishment,

492
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,100
"I'm just a minor official
of the eighth rank,

493
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,660
why would Princess Pingyue
send me an invitation?"

494
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,940
Was he overjoyed?

495
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:42,060
The situation at that time was...

496
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,340
Miss Jinglan,

497
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,580
I just want to confirm again.

498
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,340
Is this invitation

499
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,180
meant for our young master?

500
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,220
He just got promoted to the eighth rank.

501
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,260
The invitation is meant for me.

502
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,580
It must be from Her Highness for me.

503
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,380
Though I'm not that capable,

504
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,740
I'm blessed with good looks.

505
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,620
Blessed with good looks?

506
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,100
He actually said that?

507
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,660
In that case, I'll make sure

508
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,060
that you suffer
because of your good looks.

509
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,180
[Invitation]
This is a dream of starting over,

510
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:26,580
