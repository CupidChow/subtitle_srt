[Episode 13]

5
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,100
What are you thinking about?

6
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,660
I might need

7
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,580
to trouble you with a favor.

8
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,100
When you say it like that,
it doesn't sound good.

9
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,660
Could you arrange a meeting
with Su Rongqing

10
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,340
at the bureau later?

[Hanqiu Palace]

12
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,860
You want me to arrange a meeting
with Su Rongqing?

13
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,580
Why?

14
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,620
Can't you do this one little favor?

15
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,540
Aren't we close friends?

16
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,140
If you're unsure

17
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,500
about the time and place,

18
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,860
I can help you choose.

19
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,380
How about you recommend a place
for me then?

20
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,940
How about Tingfeng Restaurant rooftop?

21
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,100
You can enjoy the moon and the breeze.

22
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,300
It sounds quite refined.

23
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,900
That sounds great.

24
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,060
Then drinks at Tingfeng Restaurant

25
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,020
at dusk tomorrow would be delightful.

26
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,900
You can dream about it.

27
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,300
That place is so popular

28
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,980
that you must book a month in advance.

29
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,700
With Su Rongqing...

30
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,980
You can just meet him at a tea house.

31
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,300
What's the need for some place refined?

32
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,140
That's not right.

33
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,180
Your Highness.

34
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,580
Mr. Pei.

35
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,260
His Majesty requests your presence.

36
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,020
How dare you.

37
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,340
You dare walk in front of me.

38
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:09,900
Your Highness,

39
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,260
we just received an urgent report.

40
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,260
Miss Qin has appeared
at the Princess's Mansion.

41
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:14,620
Let's go.

42
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,540
Your Highness, please reconsider.

43
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,340
If you go now

44
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,300
and the noble families learn
you care about Miss Qin,

45
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,100
they will intensify their efforts
against the Qin Family.

46
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,500
Father,

47
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,380
what I lack now is

48
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,380
an official position.

49
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,220
You want power?

50
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,300
How much power do you want?

51
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,820
That depends on what Your Majesty wants
Her Highness to do.

52
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,140
Tell me

53
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,980
what you can do for me.

54
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,500
If I truly give you power,

55
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,540
can you hold onto it?

56
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,340
That's what I'm here for.

57
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,220
After all, I am Her Highness's husband.

58
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,740
It seems you two have plans already.

59
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,620
They're all in the memorial
I presented to Father.

60
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:49,900
All right.

61
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,140
Let me think about it.

62
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,780
Take Pingyue back now.

63
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,020
- I shall take my leave, Your Majesty.
- I shall take my leave, Father.

64
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,820
Come, let me carry you.

65
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,820
How confident are you?

66
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,260
Judging by His Majesty's attitude,
it shouldn't be a big problem.

67
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,060
I'll direct all the issues to myself

68
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,180
and make him think it was my idea.

69
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,380
That way,

70
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,060
he won't consider you too clever

71
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,380
and will feel more at ease.

72
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,420
You're really smart.

73
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,620
Could you stop hitting my head?

74
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,140
What's the problem?

75
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,820
At least, don't do it here.

76
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,940
Can't you wait until we get back?

77
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,660
I prefer doing it here.

78
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,540
What can you do about it?

79
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,620
Your Highness,

80
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,860
Eunuch Fu has arrived.

81
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:30,980
Eunuch Fu.

82
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,700
Greetings, Your Highness.

83
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,460
Greetings, Prince Consort.

84
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,420
What brings you here?

85
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,260
Your Highness,

86
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,900
His Majesty has approved your memorial.

87
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,380
However, we still need a justification.

88
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,660
His Majesty said

89
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,100
if you can come up
with a good justification,

90
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,020
he will not only allow you
to establish the Inspectorate Office

91
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,980
but also grant you three more fiefs.

92
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,820
Currently, His Majesty has given you

93
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,660
a double-edged sword.

94
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,300
Be careful not to put yourself

95
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,180
in danger.

96
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,220
I understand.

97
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,100
Thank you, Eunuch Fu.

98
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,260
Greetings, Your Highness.

99
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,940
Miss Qin, please rise.

100
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,740
Thank you, Your Highness.

[Memorial Tablet of Noble Consort Zhenjing
of the Qin Clan]

102
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,340
Who placed this sword here?

103
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,980
I did.

104
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,020
Your Majesty,

105
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,100
this sword is inappropriate
for the occasion.

106
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,260
I've made it clear
that no one should touch it.

107
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,660
Your Majesty.

108
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,260
Since you and the Empress
have already seen her.

109
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,060
Someone,

110
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,540
close the coffin.

111
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,100
As for you,

112
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,780
you are not suitable for Huajing

113
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,220
or for marriages within noble families.

114
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,620
After establishing
the Inspectorate Office,

115
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,980
I will use extreme measures
to investigate the Qin Family case.

116
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,100
I need a skilled martial artist
to assist me.

117
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,740
Do you want me to be that person,
Your Highness?

118
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:47,940
Yes.

119
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,100
But once we make our move,

120
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,340
the noble families will take revenge.

121
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,860
They won't dare come after me directly.

122
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,780
But they will target my subordinates.

123
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,460
So, after the Qin's case is settled,

124
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,940
you cannot stay in Huajing.

125
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,060
I will send you to the Northwest.

126
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,220
The Yang Family has fallen,

127
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,820
and the Northwest is in chaos.

128
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,700
I need you to establish
an Inspectorate Office branch there,

129
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,660
assist Qin Lin
in controlling the military power,

130
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,780
and stabilize the region.

131
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,420
Later,

132
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,140
when I am more established,

133
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,940
I will make other arrangements.

134
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,060
I shall await Your Highness's command.

135
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,740
You should know this.

136
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,980
To prevent your actions
from implicating the Qin Family,

137
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,860
you cannot bear the Qin surname

138
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,140
or be part of the Qin Family
from now on.

139
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,780
Have you thought this through?

140
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,660
Please grant me a new name,
Your Highness.

141
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,460
Will you not regret it?

142
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,860
Your Highness is leading the Qins
through dangerous paths.

143
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,500
How could a woman like me
seek personal happiness?

144
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,660
I wish to be a blade
in Your Highness's hand,

145
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,340
aiding you in your endeavors.

146
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,020
From this day forth,
you shall be known as Xun Chuan.

147
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,060
As for Qin Zhenzhen,

148
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,540
I will arrange
for a fitting end for her.

149
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,700
Yes, Your Highness.

150
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,060
Rongqing.

151
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,180
Father.

152
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,300
Leave us.

153
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,820
Rongqing,

154
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,300
I am puzzled
by the Qin Family's affairs.

155
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,420
Why did His Majesty send you?

156
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,820
Because I represent the noble families.

157
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,500
His Majesty sent me
to carry out his orders

158
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,300
and few dared to defy him.

159
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,180
His Majesty's move is quite strategic.

160
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,660
I wonder if he aims to control

161
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,180
or divide the noble families.

162
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,660
What do you think, Father?

163
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,660
Rongqing,

164
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,060
you are my proudest son.

165
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,420
I believe

166
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,500
you will never betray the Su Family.

167
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,580
If that is true,

168
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,260
His Majesty will surely reconsider.

169
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,660
Both His Majesty
and the Shangguan Family won't allow

170
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,660
the Su Family to remain uninvolved.

171
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,020
Our only option is

172
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,580
to leverage their strengths
to achieve our goals.

173
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,300
Rong.

174
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,900
I am afraid he already found out.

175
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,900
You can leave now.

176
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,300
Yes, Your Highness.

177
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:35,940
Rong.

178
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:38,940
Chuan.

179
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,940
Are you here because of Miss Qin?

180
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,780
Yes.

181
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,660
Is Miss Qin all right?

182
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,660
I heard she is injured.

183
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,380
I brought some excellent medicine
for her wounds.

184
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,900
Can you please pass it on to her?

185
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,300
Don't worry.

186
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,180
Miss Qin is fine.

187
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:07,780
Rong,

188
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,300
can I see her?

189
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,060
It's not the right time.

190
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,420
What plans do you have now?

191
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:22,780
Chuan,

192
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,740
you must know nothing right now.

193
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,540
Only when you don't know anything,

194
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,980
then Father won't find anything amiss.

195
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,340
If Father finds out

196
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,860
that all this is our joint plan,

197
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,660
you know

198
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,380
the consequences, right?

199
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,860
I can tell you

200
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,100
that I have decided
to establish the Inspectorate Office.

201
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,980
I have already submitted the memorial.

202
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,620
As for the matter of the Qin Family,

203
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,420
I will have it arranged.

204
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,220
Chuan.

205
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,900
From now on,

206
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,660
you must trust me wholeheartedly.

207
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,460
Can you do that?

208
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,220
All right.

209
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,300
I trust you.

210
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:03,980
Chuan asked me

211
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,180
to pass this on to you.

212
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,740
Your Highness,

213
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,620
I know your feelings.

214
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,980
Why wasn't I braver earlier?

215

00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:13,260

You're back.

227
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,900
Tuck in the blanket.

228
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,300
Pei Wenxuan,

229
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,380
did you pass on my message?

230
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,420
What message?

231
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,380
What?

232
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,420
Have you forgotten?

233
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,180
I'll pass it on tomorrow.

234
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,860
Don't you usually have good memories?

235
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,620
I've had a lot on my plate today.

236
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,100
But tell me,

237
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,540
why did you suddenly want
to see Su Rongqing?

238
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,740
Is that hard to understand?

239
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,500
I need manpower if I want
to establish the Inspectorate Office.

240
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,700
Su Rongqing is
the Vice Minister of Justice

241
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,180
and is also involved in handling
the Qin Family's case.

242
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,700
If he cooperates with me,

243
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,380
won't this help us infiltrate
the Ministry of Justice?

244
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,020
It's not just Su Rongqing.

245
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,540
I need to visit the Ministry of War,

246
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,860
the Ministry of Revenue,

247
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,700
and the Censorate.

248
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,980
I need to find time

249
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,820
to visit all these places.

250
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,540
Is that what you really think about?

251
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,060
What else could I think about?

252
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,900
Of course,

253
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,820
it's also good to make some contacts
along the way.

254
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,580
It wouldn't hurt

255
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,300
to have some conversation

256
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,660
during the investigations.

257
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,500
Isn't that what you said?

258
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,860
To revisit

259
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,340
and see different scenery.

260
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,780
If I look at Su Rongqing
from a different perspective,

261
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,100
maybe I'll discover something new.

262
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,020
Li Rong,

263
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,220
you're learning
to speak like me pretty quickly.

264
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:32,900
Tell me.

265
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,580
Have you never considered taking
a different path?

266
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,300
Which path?

267
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,260
Not establishing
the Inspectorate Office.

268
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,580
What then?

269
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,060
I can protect you too.

270
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,140
I will just put it this way.

271
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,300
I don't like

272
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,340
to leave my fate in the hands of others.

273
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,660
I want to control my destiny.

274
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,740
With power,

275
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,140
I can protect

276
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,180
more innocent families like the Qins.

277
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,460
I can protect Chuan

278
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,260
and even you.

279
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,940
Enough talking.

280
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,420
I am sleepy.

281
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,100
Tomorrow will be a busy day.

282
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,500
Li Rong,

283
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,620
you're the one

284
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,940
who needs the most protection.

285
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,180
Rongqing.

286
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,820
Yes, Mr. Pei?

287
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,780
Rongqing,

288
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,100
I have a few words to say to you.

289
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,860
What do you need?

290
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,900
Her Highness wishes to speak with you.

291
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,100
He declined?

292
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,820
Why?

293
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,020
What?

294
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,500
Do you think you are a fairy?

295
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,140
Why would he accept your invitation?

296
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,100
We had a deal not to hit my head.

297
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,940
You said we can do it at home.

298
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,740
So tell me

299
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,220
the reason he declined.

300
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,340
I know what Her Highness wants
to discuss with me.

301
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,740
But the Qin's case involves too much.

302
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,460
I ask Her Highness not to interfere.

303
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,820
What's so funny?

304
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,500
I admit it.

305
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,140
You do seem

306
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,580
to understand me better
than I do myself.

307
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:25,980
What do you mean?

308
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,740
I do have some sentiments
for Su Rongqing.

309
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,820
Otherwise,
I wouldn't have overlooked it.

310
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,940
We're dealing
with the noble families this time.

311
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,500
How can he help me?

312
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,580
I was confused.

313
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,300
I let my emotions take over.

314
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,540
Well,

315
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,860
you don't have to feel down.

316
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,980
People learn from mistakes.

317
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,100
Just remember you were never close
with him in the first place.

318
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,820
Everything starts from self-interest.

319
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,460
Isn't this common?

320
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,940
Do you think such a trivial matter

321
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,740
can stop me?

322
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,420
You're even comforting me now.

323
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,940
Are you free this afternoon?

324
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,660
Why?

325
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,500
I'm planning to visit Shangguan Ya.

326
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,500
If you're free, come with me.

327
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,740
I may not have time.

328
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,460
I have contracts with several shops

329
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,500
to negotiate.

330
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,180
I may have to excuse myself
this afternoon.

331
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:23,900
All right, then.

332
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,220
[Jucai House]

333
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,420
This place doesn't bring me luck at all.

334
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,180
Your Highness,

335
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,780
you seem to be having a good time.

336
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,340
Not at all.

337
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,660
What are the odds?

338
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,380
Me too.

339
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,300
I came to have fun.

340
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,620
But instead of having fun,

341
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,260
you had to come after me.

342
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,900
Speaking of which,

343
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,740
That Prince Consort is not bad.

344
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,420
He is handsome and talented.

345
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,260
I like him.

346
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,380
Bold and shameless.

347
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,300
If you want one,

348
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,260
you can find someone you like.

349
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,020
I just don't know

350
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,380
how the Shangguan Family will stop you.

351
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,980
Have you heard

352
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,060
about the Qin's case?

353
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,700
Do you also think

354
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,580
the noble families meddle too much?

355
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,620
I've taken to heart
what you said last time.

356
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,860
It's just that I don't have control
over the Shangguan Family.

357
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,100
I can't make decisions.

358
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,460
If the Shangguan Family were
under your control,

359
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,380
how would you handle it?

360
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,340
Completely loyal to you,

361
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,980
assist you in supporting
the Crown Prince's ascension.

362
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,780
Then gradually withdraw from the court,

363
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,620
leaving a few people to save face.

364
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,460
The rest will return to Youzhou.

365
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,220
Why not withdraw now?

366
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,220
You already know the answer to that.

367
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,060
His Majesty has been oppressed
by the Shangguans for over a decade,

368
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,700
he's full of resentment.

369
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,820
Can the Shangguan Family even withdraw?

370
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,980
If the Shangguan Family withdraws,
there is only a dead end.

371
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,420
The only way is

372
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,900
to establish a relationship
of mutual prosperity

373
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,460
with the Crown Prince and you.

374
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,380
When the Crown Prince ascends
the throne,

375
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,620
The Shangguans will naturally withdraw.

376
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,620
It seems you've long thought

377
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,940
about becoming the master
of the Shangguan Family.

378
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,420
Have you really thought it through?

379
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,740
I'll follow your orders, Your Highness.

380
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,540
All right.

381
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:39,940
Here you are.

382
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,700
Your Highness.

383
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,860
Please help me find the best troupe.

384
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,460
I want them to perform
the injustice of the Qin Family.

385
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:52,900
Go.

386
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,060
Yes, Your Highness.

387
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,740
[Taiji Hall]
Your Majesty,

388
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,740
there's something I need to report.

389
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,340
Speak up.

390
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,780
After the Ministry of Justice
and the Censorate reviewed it,

391
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,500
the Qin family was found guilty
of treason,

392
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,540
and embezzlement of military funds,

393
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,180
with clear evidence.

394
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,820
According to our laws,

395
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,100
the entire clan
should face annihilation.

396
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,380
- Awesome!
- Marvelous!

397
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,500
Good!

398
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:49,820
Bravo!

399
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,980
General Qin Lin has triumphed
and returned victorious!

400
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,820
Great!

401
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,780
- Well done!
- Fabulous!

402
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,380
Sir, what troubles you so much?

403
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,820
The Qin Family comes
from a humble origin.

404
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,660
They even dared to vie
for military merit with me.

405
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,060
It's truly vexing.

406
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,900
Sir, you do not need to worry.

407
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,220
Listen to me.

408
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,700
If it's not you,
there's no room for argument

409
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,980
when discussing merits.

410
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,540
When someone from humble origins tries
to stand out,

411
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,380
it often leads to trouble.

412
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,180
We will just accuse them
of embezzling military funds

413
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,980
and colluding with the enemy.

414
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,140
What...

415
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,540
This is outrageous!

416
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:43,660
Please listen to me.

417
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:50,020
Cry out to the heavens!

418
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:55,580
Things are about to change.

419
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,300
Don't you all think

420
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,660
these noble families have gone too far?

421
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,540
Most importantly,

422
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,060
these accusations are baseless.

423
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:02,700
That's right.

424
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,500
In my opinion,

425
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,580
the Qin Family must be wrongly accused.

426
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,860
Don't you agree?

427
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,460
The Qin Family must be wrongly accused.

428
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,260
Don't you agree?

429
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,580
The show has only just begun.

430
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,380
It seems everything in the play is true.

431
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,300
[Injustice]
Exactly!

432
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,420
Didn't Miss Qin escape already?

433
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,500
Why has she returned?

434
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,140
She is here to plead innocence.

435
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,870
[Princess's Mansion]

436
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,260
Here comes the Princess.

437
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,660
I, Qin Zhenzhen, and my family
are wrongly accused.

438
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,540
I ask Your Highness to seek justice
on my behalf!

439
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,700
Father,

440
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,660
I have come to seek justice.

441
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,460
Whose injustice do you seek to right?

442
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,740
The Qins from Liangzhou.

443
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,460
What injustice do they suffer?

444
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,620
The Qin Family is loyal and righteous.

445
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,220
They are falsely accused
of committing treason with the Yangs.

446
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,540
When foreign enemies invaded,

447
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,940
my uncles and brothers were killed
on the battlefield.

448
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,780
Now, the border is secure.

449
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,980
For rewards and titles,
the noble families falsely accused

450
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,500
the Qin Family

451
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,180
of colluding with the Yangs

452
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,580
to betray the country.

453
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,900
I earnestly ask Your Highness
to seek justice on my behalf.

454
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,660
Miss Qin, don't be like this.

455
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,140
We cannot take a serious matter
like this lightly.

456
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,500
Even you dare not take this case?

457
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,460
- Miss!
- What?

458
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,500
Why didn't she go
and find the Crown Prince?

459
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,740
The Crown Prince is in cahoots

460
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,340
with those noble families in the court.

461
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,500
How could he possibly manage?

462
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,540
Would Princess Pingyue take on this?

463
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,380
Her Highness took the blood letter.

464
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,820
Your Highness,
you must take on this matter!

465
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,460
- Good!
- Well done!

466
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,100
We will support you, Your Highness!

467
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,020
You have our support!

468
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,060
This case was examined
by the Three Judicial Offices.

469
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,260
There was no mistake.

470
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,860
Your Highness, you don't know the truth.

471
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,980
I am afraid
the villains have misled you.

472
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,460
Mr. Shangguan,

473
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,740
would someone risk their life

474
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,060
to mislead me?

475
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:00,780
This...

476
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,580
Father,

477
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,500
this is the letter of grievance
from the daughter of the Qin Family.

478
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,180
Bring it over here.

479
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,620
I remember her dying wish.

480
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,060
She must have suffered great injustice.

481
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,820
If the Qin Family were falsely accused,

482
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,740
it would be an unprecedented injustice.

483
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,460
Father,

484
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,900
you cannot allow matters like these
to tarnish your lifelong reputation.

485
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,460
How could this happen?

486
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:32,940
Shangguan.

487
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,460
The petition presented by the Qins

488
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,660
differs greatly

489
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,380
from what you reported to me.

490
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,260
Your Majesty,

491
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,860
don't just listen
to their one-sided words.

492
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,660
Then you are not one-sided words too?

493
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,380
Your Majesty.

494
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,340
That's enough.

495
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,380
I don't want to hear your excuses.

496
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,100
Replace the personnel in the Qin's case
and re-examine it.

497
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,220
Investigate the officials involved

498
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,980
in the previous review thoroughly

499
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,220
to see if there was deliberate framing.

500
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

501
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,100
I am willing
to review this case personally.

502
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:07,980
Father,

503
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,460
he cannot.

504
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,820
This case involves many people.

505
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,620
Many of them are noble family children

506
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,780
related by marriage alliances

507
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,900
and close relationships.

508
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,700
If this case is handed over
to Mr. Shangguan,

509
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,780
I cannot trust it.

510
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,380
Your Majesty,

511
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,260
I ask that...

512
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,460
I do not trust him either.

513
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,100
If you cannot trust anyone here,

514
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,580
what exactly do you want?

515
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,660
Father,

516
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,420
the daughter of the Qing Family
died in my arms.

517
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,020
I promised her

518
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,660
to thoroughly investigate this case.

519
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,700
Please allow me

520
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,020
to investigate this personally.

521
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,940
How can this be?

522
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,780
A princess is a woman of the harem.

523
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,620
The court matters...

524
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,700
Have I never intervened before?

525
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,380
In Great Xia, there are no restrictions
on princesses participating in politics.

526
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,300
Besides,

527
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,660
I solved the Yang's case.

528
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,820
Now, the Qin's case is implicated
by the Yang's case.

529
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,260
So why can't I investigate?

530
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,580
Your Highness,

531
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,620
according to seniority,

532
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,980
I'm also considered your elder.

533
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:18,060
You should listen to my advice.

534
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,980
According to official ranks,

535
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,500
Her Highness is
His Majesty's eldest daughter.

536
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,020
You still have to bow
when you meet Her Highness.

537
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,780
Can't you listen
to Your Highness's advice?

538
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,060
Know your place!

539
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,860
Is there a place for you to speak here?

540
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,300
What do you mean by that, Mr. Shangguan?

541
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,820
I don't quite understand.

542
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,900
As the Censorate,

543
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,380
do I not even have the right

544
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,060
to speak in court?

545
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,220
You...

546
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:52,700
Your Majesty.

547
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,340
If this case is indeed
as Her Highness says,

548
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,540
it may involve

549
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,620
all the review institutions
in the court.

550
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,340
It should indeed be reviewed
by a third party.

551
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,020
Crown Prince,

552
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,780
what do you say?

553
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,220
I think

554
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,900
we should let Rong try.

555
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:16,740
Your Highness.

556
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,580
Uncle,

557
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,100
what fear do we have of an investigation

558
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,540
if we have a clear conscience?

559
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,620
The Crown Prince makes some sense.

560
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,260
Let's do it this way.

561
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,860
The Qin's case will be reopened
and re-examined by Pingyue.

562
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,620
You oversaw the Yang's case before.

563
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,580
I know your capabilities.

564
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,820
If you can handle this case well too,

565
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,420
I will establish a bureau specifically
for you,

566
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,020
called the Inspectorate Office,

567
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,580
to oversee matters
of monitoring court ministers

568
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,820
in the future.

569
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,940
Pingyue, you've grown up.

570
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,020
You want to share my burdens.

571
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,820
So, I'll give you this opportunity.

572
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:57,940
How about this?

573
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,220
Go to the city barracks

574
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,140
and select five hundred elite soldiers.

575
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,140
If you do well,
there will be rewards for you.

576
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,340
Thank you, Father.

577
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,780
All right.

578
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,020
That's settled then.

579
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:10,740
[Taiji Hall]

580
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,580
Let's go back together.

581
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,900
Sure.

582
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,100
So?

583
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,740
I did well today, right?

584
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,100
Princess Pingyue,

585
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:21,860
please stay.

586
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,420
Greetings, Uncle.

587
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,580
Greetings, Mr. Shangguan.

588
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,180
Your Highness,

589
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,220
can I speak to you in private?

590
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,020
If you want to.

591
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,380
You can wait for me at the palace gate.

592
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,540
Yes, Your Highness.

593
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,260
Uncle,

594
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,580
I'll take my leave.

595
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,100
Let's talk as we walk.

596
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,260
This way, please.

597
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:56,860
Your Highness,

598
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:01,420
why did you suddenly decide
to take charge of the Qin's case?

599
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,100
Uncle,

600
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,580
didn't I just say?

601
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,660
Miss Qin came to me.

602
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,580
I couldn't bear to see
the Qins being wrongly accused.

603
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,540
Since you've called me Uncle,

604
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,060
we needn't hide anything.

605
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,340
Your Highness,

606
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,540
why bother so much

607
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,020
now that you're married?

608
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,900
Are you saying

609
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,300
I should stay out of this?

610
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,580
The matter in the Northwest
was originally

611
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,620
a mess handed over to the Crown Prince
by His Majesty.

612
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,580
I was worried about the Crown Prince.

613
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,980
So I contacted some relatives

614
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,860
and tried various ways
to stabilize the Northwest.

615
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,380
But before the great victory,

616
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,100
His Majesty changed the general
at the last minute

617
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,780
and forcibly appointed Xiao Su
as the main general.

618
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,700
Do you know
about the list of rewards reported

619
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,540
by Xiao Su to His Majesty?

620
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,460
I would like to hear the details.

621
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:04,180
Most of the names on that list are
from humble backgrounds,

622
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,140
while the noble families' sons

623
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,860
who made great sacrifices
were hardly rewarded.

624
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,660
This is why

625
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,460
there has been controversy in the court.

626
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,580
Your Highness wants
to seek justice for the Qin Family,

627
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,980
I understand.

628
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,500
But I wonder how Your Highness plans

629
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,460
to deliver justice on my side?

630
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,660
But

631
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,100
is the Qin Family guilty?

632
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,740
I know

633
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,460
you are concerned about Chuan and me.

634
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,700
In fact, Chuan and I also care
about you.

635
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,540
The court exempts
the noble families from taxes.

636
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,300
The Shangguan Family owns nearly half
of Youzhou's land.

637
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,060
Their annual income even exceeds
the court's taxes.

638
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,620
Besides being tax-exempt,

639
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,100
they also have special privileges
like managing iron smelting.

640
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,780
However, with border disturbances

641
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,900
and natural disasters,

642
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,340
the court is having difficulties
on both fronts.

643
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,580
Father Emperor wanted
to tax the noble families.

644
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,700
It was Chuan

645
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,740
who thought of you,

646
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,260
discussed,

647
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,260
and persuaded Father not to.

648
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,820
Are you hinting at me, Your Highness?

649
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,820
That depends on how you interpret it.

650
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:43,820
Uncle,

651
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,700
I still remember
when I was little in the palace,

652
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,740
you always brought kites for me.

653
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,260
We flew them together.

654
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,500
Uncle,

655
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,500
you are my family.

656
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,580
I hope all my family can be safe.

657
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,060
When water is full, it overflows.

658
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,140
When the moon is full,
it begins to wane.

659
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,980
This is the way of the sages.

660
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,660
I hope you keep this in mind.

661
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,420
I shall take my leave now.

662
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,540
Mr. Shangguan,

663
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,420
what did Her Highness say?

664
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,860
Her Highness said a lot.

665
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:38,020
But given her age and experience,

666
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,380
she shouldn't be able
to say such things.

667
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,220
I fear I need to speak to Pei Lixian.

668
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,700
His child is indeed

669
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,620
a bit presumptuous.

670
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,020
Though they have some insight,

671
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,420
they are still young

672
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,260
and too impetuous.

673
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,340
His Majesty personally wrote
this imperial decree.

674
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,260
I shall receive the decree.

675
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,620
Your Highness,

676
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,660
this is a badge
that His Majesty ordered me to give you.

677
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,620
His Majesty said

678
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,700
to use this badge for the investigation.

679
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:22,780
Seeing this badge is like
seeing His Majesty in person.

680
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,140
Please convey to Father

681
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,300
that I will do everything possible
to handle the case.

682
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,620
Yes, Your Highness.

683
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,020
Your Highness,

684
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,060
use it well.

685
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,100
Thank you, Eunuch Fu.

686
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,580
I shall return to the palace then.

687
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,300
Take care, Eunuch Fu.

688
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:51,940
Eunuch Fu, let me show you the way.

689
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,340
Your Highness,

690
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,140
now that you have the badge,

691
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,740
what are your plans?

692
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,140
This badge seems
a bit rushed in its making.

693
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,260
The edges are not smooth.

694
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,540
It needs to be polished well.

695
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,020
Did Your Highness summon me to say this?

696
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,980
I need to introduce you to someone.

697
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,460
Your Highness.

698
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,980
I am Xun Chuan,

699
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,220
reporting as ordered.

700
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,260
This is my new personal guard,
Xun Chuan.

701
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,060
Pleased to meet you.

702
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,340
My surname is Shangguan,

703
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,500
with the given name Ya.

704
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,540
You look somewhat familiar.

705
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,540
This is my first visit to Huajing.

706
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,780
Enough with the pleasantries.

707
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:45,940
Xun Chuan,

708
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,300
the Prince Consort
will bring people over shortly.

709
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,980
These are new recruits

710
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,580
and might not be very cooperative.

711
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,700
If they don't comply,

712
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,660
take the lead.

713
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,260
Yes, Your Highness.

714
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,180
[Ministry of Justice]

715
00:36:59,180 --> 00:36:59,980
Your Highness,
this is the Ministry of Justice.

716
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,700
This is the Ministry of Justice.

717
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,620
Step aside.

718
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,020
Don't move.

719
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,820
What are you doing?

720
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,340
Go and inform Mr. Su Rongqing.

721
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:09,860
Yes.

722
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,260
What are you doing?

723
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,660
Your Highness.

724
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,740
Your Highness,

725
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,860
what brings you here?

726
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,060
My Prince Consort and I wish

727
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,900
to access the scrolls to the Qin's case.

728
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,140
Please lead the way.

729
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,340
Your Highness,

730
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,780
the Ministry of Justice has procedures.

731
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,740
To access the scrolls,
you need a special authorization.

732
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,500
However, the imperial edict states

733
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,380
that I am to investigate the case,

734
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,100
and everyone must cooperate.

735
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,500
Besides,

736
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,420
the Inspectorate Office is not part
of the Ministry of Justice.

737
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,460
Why should we follow its rules?

738
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,140
Your Highness,

739
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,740
you are putting me
in a difficult position.

740
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,700
Are you refusing to provide the scrolls?

741
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,660
Then I can only go
and retrieve them myself.

742
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,580
Your Highness,
this is against the rules.

743
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,100
Do not move.

744
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,220
Blades have no eyes.

745
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,140
Your Highness.

746
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,020
Although I hold a low position,

747
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,420
I am still an official of the court.

748
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,100
Since you are now in charge
of the Qin Family case,

749
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,500
you should follow proper procedures.

750
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,740
Even His Majesty would not allow

751
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,980
such an overbearing manner!

752
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:19,900
Very well.

753
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,820
I look forward to your memorial
to His Majesty at the morning assembly.

754
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:22,980
You...

755
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,060
Your Highness.

756
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,140
Sir.

757
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,020
Mr. Su.

758
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,620
What is going on here?

759
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,180
I am here under orders
to investigate the Qin Family case

760
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,980
and need the scrolls to the case.

761
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,220
However, he has repeatedly tried
to stop me

762
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,620
and even confronted me,

763
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,700
intending to assault me.

764
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,100
My guards acted to protect me.

765
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,060
Xun Chuan, be respectful.

766
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:55,820
Yes, Your Highness.

767
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,460
Sir,

768
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,540
they tried to access the scrolls
without authorization.

769
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,420
I was following
the Ministry of Justice's procedures.

770
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,180
Her Highness attempted
to take the scrolls by force.

771
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,300
I did not lay a hand on her.

772
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,660
There was no altercation.

773
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,180
Please seek justice for me.

774
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,220
Are you implying I am lying?

775
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,620
I did not want to accuse you.

776
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,940
But this is what he did to me just now.

777
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,580
Given my status,

778
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,020
I wouldn't injure myself on purpose.

779
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:32,820
Your Highness,

780
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,460
how can you make false accusations

781
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,500
with so many witnesses here?

782
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,380
That's enough, Xuanji.

783
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,020
Don't say any more.

784
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,100
You can leave now.

785
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,100
Mr. Su,

786
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,420
I...

787
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,100
I believe you, Your Highness.

788
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:07,140
You don't need to show me your injury.

789
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:34,980
Your Highness,

790
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,460
we found the scrolls.

791
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,060
The Imperial Secretary is usually not
at the Ministry of Justice.

792
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,580
The daily affairs of the ministry
are handled by me.

793
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,980
If Your Highness has any issues,

794
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,180
please come directly to me

795
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,140
and do not trouble the subordinates.

796
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,540
Your Highness,

797
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,180
we have the scrolls.

798
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,380
I heard you.

799
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,300
Since you've found them,

800
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,620
I will escort Your Highness out.

801
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,260
No need.

802
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,260
There are so many people here.

803
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,700
We won't trouble you.

804
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,620
We apologize for disturbing the peace
of the Ministry of Justice today.

805
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,420
I hope you can understand.

806
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,860
Her Highness is the head
of the Princess's Mansion.

807
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,740
It is only natural for her to be here.

808
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,100
But I wonder

809
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,500
in what position are you as

810
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,260
to barge into the Ministry of Justice?

811
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,260
Her Highness is new to the court.

812
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,660
She has many ideas
that need guidance from others.

813
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,900
As Her Highness's husband,

814
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,060
if she entrusts me

815
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,420
to assist her here,

816
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,060
what's wrong with that?

817
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,860
Well, if you think there's no issue,

818
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,860
let's see

819
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,780
what His Majesty has to say about it
in court tomorrow.

820
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,580
I look forward to it, Mr. Su.

821
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,220
Let's go.

822
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,770
[Ministry of Justice]

823
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,860
Just look at your temper.

824
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,220
You got this angry
when Su Rongqing wants to impeach you.

825
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,540
Slow down.

826
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,100
My people have yet to keep up with us.

827
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,300
How is your hand?

828
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,060
It is nothing. I did it myself.

829
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,540
Just a small cut from the ring.

830
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,100
Stay still.

831
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,140
What is it?

832
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,500
Hold it.

833
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,460
Don't move.

834
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:05,260
Let's go.

835
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,140
Pick the handkerchief
and return it to him.

836
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:09,660
Yes, Your Highness.

837
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:10,660
Don't pick it up.
