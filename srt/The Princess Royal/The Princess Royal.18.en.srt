In addition to these records,

I've also
asked the local soldiers and people

00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,780

75
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,060

the Qin Family

and frame the Qin Family?

110

can be fooled by you?

to check so many existing accounts?

Let me think about it.

138
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,620

to help the Crown Prince
ascend the throne

is the best path for you.

151
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,460
If the Inspectorate Office
is to be established,

152
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,860
you still need
to have a sense of proportion.

153
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,380
Power struggles involve strife.

154
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,740
Please be careful, Your Highness.

155
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,260
I don't want to be
your enemy, Your Highness.

156
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,140
I just hope you can lead a good life.

157

this one.

159

a lot of things to attend to.

160

00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,060
Nothing.

164
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,620
See you.

165
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,100
You didn't attend today's morning court,

166
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,940
but you've come
to Beiyan Pagoda for a stroll.

167
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,580
It seems like you're in a good mood.

168
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,500
I came to see Her Highness
for something.

169
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,460
It seems to be something urgent.

170
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,580
Mr. Pei,

171
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,340
you are afraid of me
meeting Her Highness, aren't you?

172
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,820
It's broad daylight.

173
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,460
What nonsense are you talking about?

174
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,060
Why am I afraid
of you meeting Her Highness?

175
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,580
You asked me

176
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,220
to be your groomsman to fetch
Her Highness on your wedding day.

177
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,940
You intended to curry favor
with Her Highness.

178
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,980
But then you found out

179
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,940
that she liked me.

180
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,580
Right?

181
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,900
So what?

182
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,060
I'm the one

183
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,860
who's with Her Highness now.

184
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,260
Pei Wenxuan.

185
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,780
How can feel at ease

186
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,420
when you say things like that?

187
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,580
Don't forget

188
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,980
that if it wasn't for His Majesty's
fear of the imperial relatives,

189
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,420
you wouldn't have even been able

190
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,260
to get close to Her Highness
in your life.

191
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,780
Not to mention

192
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,940
to be with Her Highness.

193
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,060
Let me remind you of something, too.

194
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,580
If you miss it, you miss it.

195
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,900
Since I'm with Her Highness now,

196
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,260
I won't give her up to anyone else.

197
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,100
No matter whether it's in the past
or the future,

198
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,620
you won't get another chance.

199
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,220
Aren't you curious

200
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,740
about what I told Her Highness?

201
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,500
I told Her Highness...

202
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,580
that I'd like to marry her.

203
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,500
Unfortunately, you're back.

204
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,660
Pei Wenxuan.

205
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,100
I don't know why you are so confident.

206
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,380
You think that you can
totally own Her Highness from now on?

207
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,500
But the way to protect Her Highness

208
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,940
is not to ask her

209
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,940
to against everyone
in the imperial court with you

210
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,500
or to make her take

211
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,020
on the burden
of inspecting all the officials.

212
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,860
If you ever put Her Highness

213
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,420
in this kind of danger
in the future again,

214
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,700
then remember...

215
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,060
you will forever

216
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,900
lose Her Highness.

217
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,460
Pei Wenxuan.

218
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,500
You won't always be so lucky.

219
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,220
Su Rongqing, listen here.

220
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,860
You are no one to judge

221
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,900
how I treat Her Highness.

222
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,780
Besides,

223
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,140
I don't care what you say
to Her Highness

224
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,540
because I know

225
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,660
Her Highness won't say yes to you.

226
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,580
Whether Her Highness agrees or not

227
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,740
is something you should find out
for yourself.

228
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,420
I'll still say the same thing.

229
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,140
Don't let Her Highness down.

230
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,780
Conduct yourself well.

231
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,940
Your Highness!

232
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,300
The Prince Consort...

233
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,340
The Prince Consort is at the foot
of the pagoda.

234
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,940
[Beiyan Pagoda]

235
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,740
Your Highness!

236
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,820
Your Highness, slowly.

237
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,260
Be careful.

238
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,300
You're back.

239
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,500
Pei Wenxuan.

240
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,420
Rong.

241
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,300
I'm here to take you home.

242
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,300
Well...

243
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,420
We haven't seen each other in a while
so I've forgot myself.

244
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,900
If I've offended you in any way...

245
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,660
Does it hurt?

246
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,260
Your injuries.

247
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,900
Yes, it does.

248
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,500
It hurts everywhere.

249
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,660
Mr. Tian, you'd better confess.

250
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,180
The Prince Consort is already back.

251
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,820
The evidence he obtained is enough
to put a lot of people at risk.

252
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,500
Why don't you keep yourself safe first?

253
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,900
Trying to trick me
into talking about it?

254
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,060
You're too young for that.

255
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,140
If you're like this,

256
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,060
I'll write a memorial

257
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,500
about you

258
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,300
and submit it to the Censorate.

259
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,340
Mr. Tian,

260
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,460
think about it carefully.

261
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,060
Wait.

262
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,740
Recently, Tian Zhong and the others
have disappeared one after another.

263
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,220
The situation is not encouraging.

264
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,820
I'm afraid
they've got something on them.

265
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:19,980
All these people

266
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,300
have been reported by the Censorate,
right?

267
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,500
What are you

268
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,380
going to do about them, Mr. Shangguan?

269
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,260
They've been warned to be careful
with their words and actions,

270
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,420
but they just won't listen.

271
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,140
I'm afraid they can't stand the torture

272
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,820
and will speak out of turn.

273
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,100
We need to get rid of the misfits

274
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,660
in the noble families
with Pingyue's help.

275
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,380
Is he all right?

276
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,780
Don't worry, Your Highness.

277
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,260
There is no vital injury.

278
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,740
He only needs to have a good rest
to recuperate.

279
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,780
That's good.

280
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,300
But please still prescribe
a few remedies

281
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,940
to help nurse his health.

282
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:08,740
Yes.

283
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,020
Thank you.

284
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,380
Your Highness,

285
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,220
the Qin Family's members
have been settled,

286
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,260
you can go to see them at any time.

287
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,780
I'll go over there and take a look.

288
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,820
Take care of your young master.

289
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,540
Yes.

290
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,380
General Qin.

291
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,780
Thank you, Your Highness.

292
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,100
Get up. You're still wounded.

293
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,300
No need for these formalities.

294
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,300
Your Highness,

295
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,940
you've saved my entire family.

296
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,540
You have shown us great kindness. I...

297
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,780
Get up first. Get up and we can talk.

298
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:49,620
Slowly.

299
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,300
Okay.

300
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,860
Come on. Say thank you to Her Highness.

301
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,030
- Thanks for saving our lives,
- Thanks for saving our lives,

302
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:58,540
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

303
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,100
- We'll return the favor in the future.
- We'll return the favor in the future.

304
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,580
You asked
to be expelled from the capital

305
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,500
in exchange for time
to clear my family's name.

306
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,460
You have shown us great kindness.

307
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,340
In the future, I, Qin Yun, am willing
to risk my life to repay you.

308
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,140
Please get up.

309
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,380
Please get up now.

310
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,540
Her Highness has always disliked
such formalities.

311
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,300
I just hope you can stay alive

312
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,060
to do the right thing

313
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,580
and help the country.

314
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,300
That would be enough.

315
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,860
Please suit yourselves.

316
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,020
Take care, Your Highness.

317
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,300
Come on, see Her Highness out.

318
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,540
I thought you saw me out

319
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,700
to thank me again.

320
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,860
The word "thank you"

321
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,060
never means anything.

322
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,060
What I can repay you

323
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,220
is the military power in the Northwest.

324
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,460
That's what you want the most,

325
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:08,940
right, Your Highness?

326
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,060
You're pretty confident

327
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,780
in your abilities.

328
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,020
It's not me
who has confidence in myself.

329
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,540
It's you who have confidence in me.

330
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,300
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have forced the Crown Prince

331
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,460
to go to Jiulu Mountain
several times to see me.

332
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,060
That's true.

333
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,540
Your Highness, please.

334
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,380
You must have
a lot of work ahead of you.

335
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,020
Don't get delayed.

336
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,780
His Majesty has arranged

337
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,220
for the Qin's Mansion
to be returned to you.

338
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,980
So

339
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,060
you can either stay in my mansion

340
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,460
or go back to your mansion

341
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:51,700
today.

342
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,300
Such an honest man of character.

343
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,860
[Testimonies]
Xun Chuan and I got these testimonies

344
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,700
to help you overturn the case
for the Qin Family.

345
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,020
Okay.

346
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,300
If things go on like this,

347
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,700
Uncle will think of coming to me soon.

348
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,380
But I'm sure I'll get to the bottom

349
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,940
of the military provisions
and funds case.

350
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,020
You must find a way to persuade him

351
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,300
to take this opportunity
to rectify the Shangguan Family.

352
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,060
Of course,

353
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,260
it's awkward for Uncle to do it himself.

354
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,940
When the time comes,
you can take the initiative

355
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,700
to suggest the Shangguan Family
conduct an internal investigation.

356
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,460
This way,

357
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,020
I'll be able to have a say
in the Shangguan Family.

358
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,980
I can even talk to my father

359
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,780
about letting me represent
the Shangguan Family

360
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,060
to negotiate with you.

361
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,860
How confident are you?

362
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,820
It depends on how far you will push him.

363
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,780
I got it.

364
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,540
I'll take these back and read them.

365
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,700
I'll get going now.

366
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,140
It's still early yet you're going back?

367
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,700
Why don't you stay
and we'll play several rounds?

368
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,220
I don't want to play with you.

369
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,980
Pei Wenxuan just came back today.

370
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,860
I have to go back early.

371
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,060
Your Highness, I'll stay here
to discuss the details

372
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,140
with Miss Shangguan.

373
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,500
I'm glad you guys are working
so well together.

374
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,300
Be careful.

375
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:11,980
I'm leaving.

376
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,500
What's on your mind?

377
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,340
I'm thinking...

378
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,060
Do you think Her Highness
likes Su Rongqing more

379
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,380
or the Prince Consort more?

380
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,980
Is that what you should
be thinking right now?

381
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,100
You're such a serious person.

382
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,380
It's so annoying to think
of something serious all the time.

383
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,220
It's so much fun gossiping
about Her Highness.

384
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,340
Finish your work

385
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,540
before you run into

386
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,340
Su Ronghua again.

387
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,260
You're so serious. Boring.

388
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:11,940
You scared me.

389
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,740
You scared me, too, Tong.

390
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,140
Jinglan,

391
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,940
it's been a long time
since Her Highness and my young master

392
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,500
haven't seen each other.

393
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,500
Yeah.

394
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,580
Why are they still busy
with their own businesses?

395
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,500
Haven't you noticed

396
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,180
they've been acting strange
since they got back?

397
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,180
They're strange indeed.

398
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,100
It can't go on like this.

399
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,820
I have an idea.

400
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,580
Young Master.

401
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:43,860
Young Master.

402
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,020
You've got to talk to her.

403
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,820
Talk about what?

404
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,780
Don't you know what you have to do?

405
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,780
This is really serious.

406
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,580
Get to the point.

407
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,580
Her Highness refuses to sleep.

408
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,620
She was grounded in Beiyan Pagoda
for a long time.

409
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,100
It's a humid place.

410
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,820
She's already in poor health,
but she doesn't care.

411
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,740
She's still preoccupied
with state affairs.

412
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,100
If you don't persuade her, then...

413
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,340
I got it. You can go and get some rest.

414
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:10,980
Okay.

415
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,500
Don't... Don't get too worried.

416
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,820
What are you doing?

417
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,180
Go to bed.

418
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,260
Go to bed?

419
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:27,860
Come on.

420
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:28,780
What's wrong?

421
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,500
Be careful.

422
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,340
Nothing. Just go to bed.

423
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,660
It's late now.

424
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,580
Well, why did you come over here
all of a sudden to ask me to sleep?

425
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,580
I'm worried about your health.

426
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,580
It's late
yet you're still reading the memorials.

427
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,500
But you haven't slept yet either.

428
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,620
So I'm here to keep you company.

429
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,580
Come on.

430
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,100
You're mad?

431
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,340
I'm not mad.
I'm worried about your health.

432
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,100
Let's stop.

433
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,340
You're getting more and more aggressive.

434
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,460
It's like you're trying to devour me.

435
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,260
Did I hurt you?

436
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,620
Not really.

437
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,100
Well,

438
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,940
you're really heartbroken, aren't you?

439
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,500
Today,

440
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,740
I've lived for myself once.

441
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,220
Rongqing,

442
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,620
I hope you

443
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,500
live for yourself
for the rest of your life.

444
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,340
Since Her Highness doesn't want
to give up on the Inspectorate Office,

445
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,940
I can only use Consort Rou's power

446
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,620
to balance Her Highness's power

447
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,380
and prevent her
from becoming everyone's target.

448
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,220
I told Her Highness

449
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,060
I'd like to marry her.

450
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,860
Are you unhappy

451
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,540
because you think
that I don't care about you?

452
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,220
When you weren't around,

453
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,420
they all thought you were dead.

454
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,460
But I knew...

455
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:57,940
you were not.

456
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,940
I'm grateful for your faith in me.

457
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,100
You have always been confident in me.

458
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,180
It's not just
because I was confident in you.

459
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,060
It's also because I was afraid.

460
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,220
I was afraid

461
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,340
I wouldn't know...

462
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,620
what to do if you died.

463
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,020
So whether I was confident
in you or not,

464
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,700
I had to believe you were alive.

465
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,900
What are you looking at me for?

466
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,980
It's embarrassing
to say this kind of thing,

467
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,660
so I don't like to say it.

468
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,340
What's so embarrassing about it?

469
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,980
I just want to look at you.

470
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,980
What's there to see? Sleep now.

471
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,700
Your Highness.

472
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,340
On my way to get evidence,

473
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,540
I was thinking about looking at you
like this every day.

474
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,220
No way, you...

475
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,220
Your Highness.

476
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,460
I know you have me in your heart,

477
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,060
which makes me happy.

478
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,340
What are you doing?

479
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,340
I would like to give you
the joy of the world.

480
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,340
So I can repay your favor.

481
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,460
Here.

482
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,420

I don't need it.

I don't need it.

I've heard

507
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,340
that Mr. Su has asked
for your hand in marriage.

508
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,620
Don't worry.

509
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,740
I'm just reminding you.

510
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,580
Don't be fooled by Mr. Su's good looks.

to be served,

00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:03,020
I'll be at your service at any time.

516
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,820
I got it.

517
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:18,820
I got it.

518
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,380
Please forgive me, sir.

519
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,820
I'm sorry for having failed
to do my job.

520
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,820
Don't let anyone know

521
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,580
that you'd once left the capital.

522
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:00,180
Otherwise, even I can't keep you safe.

523
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,020
Sir.

524
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,340
Yes.

525
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,420
How dare they

526
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,820
to try to advance the execution.

527
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,980
They're forcing me to make a move.

528
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,700
Pei Wenxuan is a sharpened sword now.

529
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,300
I'll try him on you.

530
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,780
What are you standing here for?

531
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,660
I'm afraid these people
will mess with you.

532
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,500
So I'm here to protect you at least.

533
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:49,980
I'll be back to my place

534
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,460
when we get inside.

535
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,580
You underestimate me.

536
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,660
They can't beat me up

537
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,060
in public.

538
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,300
As long as they don't hit me,

539
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,300
we'll see who'll win.

540
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,300
Yes, you're right.

541
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,580
Can I just stand here

542
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,700
to shield you from the wind?

543
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,580
Your Highness.

544
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,540
Mr. Pei.

545
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,020
Mr. Pei, aren't you standing
in the wrong spot?

546
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,100
Shouldn't you be over there?

547
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,300
Mr. Su,

548
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,340
As the Prince Consort,

549
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,900
what's wrong with me

550
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,060
standing next to Her Highness?

551
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,060
Enter the hall!

552
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,220
Pingyue,

553
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,500
how's the case I asked you
to investigate going?

554
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,820
Father,

555
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,060
the Qin Family's case
is basically cleared up.

556
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,100
The case originated
from the Ministry of War.

557
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,100
The Ministry of War failed
to keep the Military Record,

558
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,660
resulting in missing pages
in the record.

559
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,420
An official noticed

560
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,380
that the battle
in Huangping County was unusual

561
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,020
and blurted it out.

562
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,860
[The Qin Family's case originated]
Then, a kind man went to Mr. Wen Ping

563
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,740
[from the Ministry of War]
and reported the Qin Family.

564
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,740
So Mr. Wen worked with Mr. Cui Shuyun
of the Ministry of Justice

565
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,740
to investigate the case.

566
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:16,780
But they neglected their duties
in the course of investigating the case,

567
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,260
resulting in a wrongful conviction.

568
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,340
Now that the Qin Family's name
has been cleared,

569
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,390
I hope that you can severely punish
Wang Xi,

570
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:24,980
the Bureau Director
of the Ministry of War,

571
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,820
Wen Ping of the Censorate,

572
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,700
Cui Shuyun of the Ministry of Justice,

573
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,740
and the others involved in the case.

574
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,300
In addition to the Qin Family's case,

575
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,420
I've also sorted out the embezzlement
of military provisions and funds

576
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,220
related to this case.

577
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,580
I've also provided a list
of the names of those involved.

578
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,740
I implore you to allow me to conduct
a thorough investigation, Father.

579
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,540
Well done.

580
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,220
Look.

581
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,220
When I first wanted
to establish the Inspectorate Office,

582
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,540
you stopped me.

583
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,980
You said Pingyue was too young
to do anything.

584
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,340
So, how's the case going?

585
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,940
I think it's going very well.

586
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,340
It's been investigated clearly

587
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,060
and there's not a single mistake.

588
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,460
If it weren't for Pingyue,

589
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,420
I wouldn't know that you officials

590
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,460
were so capable.

591
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,300
Your Majesty, I think

592
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,300
it's fortunate that by the grace of God,

593
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,700
Her Highness is able
to supervise the officials

594
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,300
with great success.

595
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,700
The Shangguan Family has begun
an internal investigation,

596
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,460
and we'll get rid

597
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,340
of all those involved.

598
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:37,810
These evil actions are not

599
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:40,540
what the Shangguan Family wants,

600
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:44,100
even if it's just one man's corruption.

601
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,140
I guess Ya convinced him.

602
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,650
In that case,

603
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,860
the establishment
of the Inspectorate Office is necessary.

604
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,740
If so,

605
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,060
do you have any objections

606
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,820
to the establishment
of the Inspectorate Office?

607
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,860
I have no objection.

608
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,940
Good. It's decided, then.

609
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,340
From today on,

610
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,300
Pingyue is officially in charge
of the Inspectorate Office.

611
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,900
All affairs of the Inspectorate Office

612
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,340
can be reported directly to me.

613
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,770
No need to report
to the two Chancellors

614
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,300
and Six Ministries.

615
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,580
Pingyue,

616
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,580
you can handpick the internal staff

617
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,580
for the Inspectorate Office.

618
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,380
Allocating
Mingsheng Military Drill Ground

619
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,580
in the north of the city
as the office of the Inspectorate.

620
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,940
The Ministry of Revenue should make
a budget for the establishment

621
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,380
of the Inspectorate Office
and submit it to Pingyue.

622
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,980
Yes, Your Majesty.

623
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,140
Not less than 30,000 taels per year.

624
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:44,580
Your Majesty, isn't that too much?

625
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,900
There are many places
where money is needed.

626
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,500
Her Highness needs so much more. Well...

627
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,540
You can't even spare 30,000 taels?

628
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,940
The Ministry of Revenue collects
tens of millions of taels of tax

629
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,140
every year.

630
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,220
Now you can't even spare 30,000 taels?

631
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,220
How do you do your job?

632
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,060
Pingyue,

633
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,900
I've established
the Inspectorate Office for you.

634
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,060
You have to share my burden
in the future.

635
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,580
Yes, Father.

636
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,340
Well.

637
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,900
The Qin Family's case and the military
provisions and funds case...

638
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,580
These two cases

639
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,060
are both assigned
to the Inspectorate Office.

640
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,860
Now that the Inspectorate Office
has been established,

641
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,380
I'll find an assistant for you.

642
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,300
Assistant?

643
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,660
With so much power in your hands,

644
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,780
you'll need someone to assist you.

645
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,060
I'll choose Su Family's Young Master,
Su Ronghua.

646
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,620
Su Ronghua was Prince Su's teacher

647
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,060
and he is a member
of the noble families.

648
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,900
He'll definitely keep a close eye
on Her Highness.

649
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,900
Putting in someone from the Su Family

650
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,060
is a way to appease the noble families.

651
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,780
It's decided then.

652
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,540
Have the Secretariat prepare a decree.

653
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,700
Pingyue, pick a date

654
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,340
to establish the Inspectorate Office
as soon as possible.

655
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,180
Yes, Father.

656
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,620
I'm afraid Father has developed
a distrust of us.

657
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:11,520
[Mingyue Palace]

658
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:14,900
Sir.

659
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,060
If the ruler is not upright,
what should the ministers do?

660
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:24,060
The ministers should admonish him
with their lives.

661
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,380
And if the ruler doesn't accept it,
what then?

662
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,060
As those in front fall,
those behind take up their positions.

663
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,300
What if it still won't work?

664
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,140
If that's the case,

665
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,140
choose another wise ruler.

666
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,900
All right, that's all for today.

667
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,460
Mr. Su, thank you for the lesson today.

668
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,540
Your Highness.

669
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,820
Come on, bow to Mr. Su.

670
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:54,940
Your Highness.

671
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,140
I accept this honor on one condition.

672
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,980
I wonder what you can offer me.

673
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,180
What do you want?

674
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,100
But Your Highness

675
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:14,850
and Prince Su may not agree
to my condition.

676
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,860
Just tell us.

677
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,140
From now on...

678
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,940
you will do whatever I say.

679
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,100
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

680
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,940
It's in my mansion.

681
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,660
Uncle, you don't need to be so formal.

682
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:49,740
Please sit down.

683
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,100
Thank you, Your Highness.

684
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,980
Your Highness, there are so many things
in the Shangguan Family

685
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,460
that I can't handle them all.

686
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,380
Now that a mistake has been made,

687
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:15,100
I'm here to ask you

688
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,980
to close the Qin Family's cases.

689
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:28,060
Now, the Qin Family is involved
in two cases,

690
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,100
the military provisions and funds case

691
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,100
and the case of framing.

692
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:36,620
How much do you know
about these two cases?

693
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,940
Your Highness,

694
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,740
my father didn't know anything
about them.

695
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,100
To be honest, Your Highness,

696
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,580
the Qin Family's case was already
a case with solid evidence

697
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,620
when it came to my father's attention.

698
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,500
Despite his selfish motives,

699
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,660
he's not a man who can't distinguish
between right and wrong.

700
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,220
What's going on then?

701
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,620
His Majesty takes sides with Mr. Xiao

702
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,500
in the fight for military power
in the Northwest.

703
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,580
My father was afraid that His Majesty
would hear and believe slanders,

704
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,460
so he sent someone
to investigate the Qin Family.

705
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,380
My father's intention was
to rectify any mistakes

706
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,100
and let them go
if there were no mistakes.

707
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:13,740
And then what happened?

708
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,300
But the word then became

709
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,460
finding out the Qin Family's fault.

710
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,940
The Ministry of War found nothing
after the investigation.

711
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:22,740
So they tore up the Military Record
and submitted it to the Censorate

712
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,940
for reporting
on the fulfillment of their duties.

713
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,020
The Censorate

714
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,300
saw that Yang Quan was a traitor.

715
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,260
The Qin Family was working
under him at that time.

716
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,660
In the battle to defend the city,
our soldiers and enemies

717
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:34,180
were in equal numbers,
yet we lost the war.

718
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,380
It was very strange.

719
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,580
Hence,

720
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:42,180
the Censorate made evidence
out of nothing

721
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,260
and made Luo Juan a witness.

722
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,300
In fact, even if the Ministry of Justice
had got Luo Juan's testimony,

723
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,180
it would not have been enough
to convict the Qin Family.

724
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,020
But the Ministry of Justice thought

725
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,780
that my father wanted
to thoroughly investigate the Qin Family

726
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,900
and the Qin Family seemed
to have deserved it.

727
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,140
So the Ministry of Justice
added another piece of evidence.

728
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,220
During the search,

729
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,580
the taels of gold and forged letters
were planted in the Qin's Mansion

730
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,260
to form a complete evidence and clues

731
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,420
together with Luo Juan's testimony.

732
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,660
And Uncle, you felt

733
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,780
that Father had gone too far this time,

734
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,780
so you wanted to give Father a warning

735
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,700
and decided to go ahead
with this big case.

736
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,740
When I started looking into it,

737
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,060
they started panicking,

738
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,180
trying desperately
to cover up their guilt.

739
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,860
And Uncle, you thought

740
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,580
I was being used

741
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,100
and deceived,

742
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,020
right?

743
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,580
Now that things have come to this,

744
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,580
I don't want to argue any further.

745
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:43,100
I just hope that you can stop here

746
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,060
and discontinue the stalemate.

747
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,580
I understand your determination.

748
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,740
But the Shangguan Family

749
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,940
is the foundation of you
and the Crown Prince.

750
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:56,740
Your Highness.

751
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,940
You must be clear about this.

752
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,540
How can you call a group of people

753
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,380
who can't be controlled

754
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,220
and want to cause you trouble
your foundation?
