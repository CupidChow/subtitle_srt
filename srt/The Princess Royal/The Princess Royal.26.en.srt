Slowly.

7
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,020
This looks so pretty.

8
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,340
Given your young master's foul temper,

9
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,820
they're going to split soon or later.

10
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,740
And I will stand a chance by then.

flicking that lock of hair

15
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,180
My young master should have

16
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,500
split you in half earlier

17
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,340

make sarcastic comments.

18
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:05,860
Fine.

19
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,500
We'll see if my prediction
turns out correct.

20
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,500
It won't.

22
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,300

Don't tell me you scratched my face too.

29
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,380
I didn't.

30
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,460
I made sure to be careful.

31
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,780
Does that sound like

32
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,180

33
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,100

Who are you calling a shrew?

35
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,660
I got you some river lanterns.

36
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,780
You like them, don't you?

37
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,660
Later, you can put the lanterns
on the river

38
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,020
and make a wish.

39
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,020
I thought you didn't
believe in these things.

40
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,620
I didn't.

41
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,900
These are just something
made to fool naive little girls.

42
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,740
Why would a man like me believe them?

43
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,820
What are you doing, then?

44
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,700
But ever since I met you,

45
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,940
I'd rather believe in every Immortal.

46
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,420

47

most people around you

49
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,900
would sacrifice love for power.

50
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,700
You may also think

51
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,420
that your future

52
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,460
is more important than feelings.

53
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,180
But, if I really do that,

54
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,980
you would never know

55
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,980
that some feelings

56
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,340
cannot be traded for power.

57
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,700
I became a court official

58
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,060
and fought for power

59
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,700
just to get closer to you.

60
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,740
So,

61
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,940
if I were to leave you
to gain more power...

62

even if it's just temporary

63
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,940
or just mentioning the idea,

64
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,740
I would never do so.

65
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,500
So, you didn't want to get a divorce

66
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,740

that might happen afterwards?

67
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,260
Yes,

68

00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,180
However, you're the Prince Consort,

190
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,900
and Pingyue has been offending
many officials lately.

191
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,580
There are many officials
from the Xie Family

192
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,700
working in The Ministry of Personnel.

193
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,980
I'm afraid you'll have a hard time
being transferred there.

194
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:44,820
How about this?

195
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,340
I'll transfer you
to the Ministry of Rites

196
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,940
to make your life easier,
what do say you?

197
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,420
Your Majesty.

198
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,700
Please seek justice for me.

199
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,700
What justice do you want me
to seek for you?

200
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,780
Your Majesty.

201
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,340
I would like to request

202
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,020
for a divorce.

203
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,380
I hope you will approve it.

204
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,340
What did you say?

205
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,100
You want a divorce?

206
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,820
What's wrong with my daughter?

207
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,580
Why do you want to divorce her?

208
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,540
Pei Wenxuan, how dare you!

209
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,340
Your Majesty.

210
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,620
I... I... I've suffered.

211
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,140
Look.

212
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,820
It's the Princess' doing.

213
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,980
Why were you two actually fighting?

214
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,020
She even hurt you badly.

215
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,340
You didn't hit her, did you?

216
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,660
I...

217
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,700
No, no!

218
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,860
The Princess is so noble.
I wouldn't dare.

219
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,460
Get up.

220
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,780
Tell me

221
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,580
what happened exactly.

222
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,060
It started

223
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,140
with a talisman.

224
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,420
When the Princess
returned home yesterday,

225
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,020
I went to fetch her,

226
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,900
but she told everyone outside

227
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,780
that I sought a talisman randomly

228
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,340
that made her fall
into Consort Rou's trap.

229
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,580
Your Majesty.

230
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,620
Why would I do such a thing?

231
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,780
Here it is.

232
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,020
This isn't even my handwriting.

233
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,940
Actually, I believe

234
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,820
that you probably

235
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,500
have your own judgment now.

236
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,500
I don't wish to talk more about it,

237
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,340
but what I'm going to say next

238
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,300
is something I cannot
tolerate any longer.

239
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,140
Your Majesty, you do know

240
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,780
that I suggested to the Princess
to establish the Inspectorate Office

241
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,460
to share your burden.

242
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,500
But now,

243
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,380
many officials in the palace,

244
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,540
including the Crown Prince
and the Empress,

245
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,260
are unhappy

246
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,980
towards the Princess because of this.

247
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,060
Last night,

248
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,700
the Princess and I got into an argument.

249
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,500
In anger, she actually called me

250
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,590
a lowly and despicable man.

251
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,700
She even said

252
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,900
I was worse than the entertainers
from Nanfeng House.

253
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,060
Isn't that humiliating?

254
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,540
I indeed came from a humble background,

255
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,260
but I am a man after all.

256
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,260
Even though she is the Princess,

257
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,060
she can't insult me like that.

258
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,660
I married the Princess

259
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,340
to fulfill your command

260
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,460
and my duty as an official.

261
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,180
Why am I

262
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,660
getting humiliated instead?

263
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,500
Let's take a step back.

264
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,260
No matter how unreasonable
Her Highness is,

265
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,340
I can tolerate her behaviors.

266
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,940
But now, I have to say

267
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,420
as her husband and your official,
I have remained loyal.

268
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,060
But what about the Princess?

269
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,340
She went on a lantern night cruise

270
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,940
together with a dozen entertainers.

271
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,020
How am I...

272
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,260
How is everyone else

273
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,820
going to think of me?

274
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:53,820
Your Majesty.

275
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,460
I know I'm wrong

276
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,580
and I have disappointed you.

277
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,020
But, I implore you

278
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,620
that for the sake of my diligent father

279
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,140
and my loyal service,

280
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,220
please permit me
to divorce Princess Pingyue.

281
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:20,420
Your Majesty,
I really can't live like this anymore.

282
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,580
If that's the case,

283
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,900
since Pingyue has been
overbearing indeed,

284
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,820
and you're set on a divorce,

285
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,460
I shall not force you.

286
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,620
How about this?

287
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,460
You go home first

288
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,780
while I draft a decree.

289
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,860
Thank you, Your Majesty.
You're brilliant.

290
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,220
I'll take my leave.

291
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,500
Consort Rou said

292
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,980
that the talisman was fake.

293
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,580
Princess Pingyue took it with her.

294
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,500
What if they try to verify it?

295
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,660
Hongde has been taken away as well.

296
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,340
Mr. Su,

297
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,860
if he ever babbles,

298
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,460
Consort Rou would be implicated.

299
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,860
He won't get to talk.

300
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,340
Tell Consort Rou to rest assured.

301
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,900
What about the talisman?

302
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,060
Since the Princess took it,

303
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,340
even if they find out that it's fake,

304
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:08,900
what can they do?

305
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,620
What if they tell His Majesty

306
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,900
that the Princess told a lie?

307
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,700
Then why would the Princess do that?

308
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,580
If His Majesty has his doubts,

309
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,340
he would try to test
Pei Wenxuan and the Princess.

310
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,940
Pei Wenxuan

311
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,620
would expose himself by then.

312
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,500
Why are you so sure, Mr. Su?

313
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,340
Pei Wenxuan might just agree

314
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,100
to get a divorce instead.

315
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,170
He'd never agree to it.

316
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,540
Because he won't.

317
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,020
He dares not.

318
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,860
And he doesn't even want to.

319
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,460
Everyone has weaknesses.

320
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,860
Pei Wenxuan has always

321
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,660
maintained a clean reputation,

322
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,500
and he's good at building relationships.

323
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,940
That's why he has all sorts
of talents and tricks at his disposal.

324
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,420
It's not easy to thwart

325
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,740
his political career.

326
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,940
If you try to take him down directly,
it'd cost us even more.

327
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,460
He cares about the Princess.

328
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,980
He cares about their relationship.

329
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,260
He would never abandon
the Princess for power.

330
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,100
As long as he doesn't get a divorce,

331
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,980
His Majesty will remain doubtful,

332
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,140
and Pei Wenxuan will feel hard
to turn the tide.

333
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,580
What if he does agree
to divorce the Princess?

334
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,940
Then he deserves to die.

335
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,780
Anyone who lets the Princess down...

336
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,700
shall be killed.

337
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,300
Your Majesty.

338
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,220
The writing on the talisman is fake.

339
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:45,820
Fulai.

340
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,580
Do you know what's the toughest thing
about being a ruler?

341
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,060
Your Majesty, how would I know

342
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,140
the answer to that?

343
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,100
Everyone around you
may be deceiving you.

344
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,180
While anyone else
can obtain the truth easily,

345
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,940
as the Emperor,

346
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,660
I have to search for the truth
amid a trove of lies.

347
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,220
What's more, these truths

348
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,820
are often consisting of the half-lies

349
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,460
they tell me.

350
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,940
But, you're the wisest man
in the country, Your Majesty.

351
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,140
The wisest man?

352
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,860
How am I wise?

353
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,260
The talisman is fake.

354
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,140
Then is Pei Wenxuan completely innocent?

355
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,500
Tell me

356
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,540
who do you think is speaking the truth?

357
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,660
Your Majesty,
you're putting me in a spot.

358
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,380
I remember that when I was a boy,

359
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,300
someone kept stealing my persimmons.

360
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,420
I investigated it for a long time,

361
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,780
and just as I thought,

362
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,540
you were the thief.

363
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,660
Do you remember that?

364
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,740
Of course.

365
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,900
How could I ever forget?

366
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,140
Actually, there's something else

367
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,100
that I've been hiding from you.

368
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:18,980
There's more?

369
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,300
Back then,

370
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,380
I was punished, so I got angry.

371
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,740
No amount of persimmons
could quell my anger.

372
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,020
So,

373
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,060
I stole something else from you.

374
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,980
How dare you.

375
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,860
What else did you steal?

376
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,660
Crab meatballs,

377
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,260
your favorite dish when you were young.

378
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,100
So,

379
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,140
even back then,

380
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,260
you were already getting cheeky

381
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,060
and fat at that time.

382
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,660
Those were the good old days.

383
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,820
There was nothing much
to be concerned about.

384
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,540
Even if I couldn't guess it right,

385
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,460
I'd just lose a few persimmons at worst.

386
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,420
But, it's different now.

387
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,820
If I make the wrong guess,

388
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,860
I'd be losing the entire country.

389
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,580
Your Majesty, about the Prince Consort
and Princess Pingyue's divorce,

390
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,540
should I draft a decree now?

391
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,540
Just put it aside for now.

392
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,860
Your Majesty, Consort Rou
has always been gentle.

393
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,220
She's always obeyed your commands.

394
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,180
Now that she brought
Hongde into the palace,

395
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,340
I'm afraid someone
must be manipulating her.

396
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,100
I'm worried...

397
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,340
Well,

398
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,180
get someone to investigate this.

399
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

400
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,540
Young Master!

401
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,380
Her Highness is resting.

402
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,020
I know.

403
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,100
Tell everyone
in the inner courtyard to leave.

404
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,260
Go.

405
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,580
Why would I stay
in the sleeping chambers?

406
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,940
I'm sleeping in the study from now on!

407
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,700
Young Master!

408
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,340
The study is this way...

409
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,820
Don't make everyone else hear you.

410
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,660
I'm having a falling-out
with Her Highness.

411
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,700
No one could see me meeting her.

412
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,540
Why?

413
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,340
You...

414
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,340
Guard the study's entrance.

415
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,180
If anyone asks,

416
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,260
tell them I'm in the study.

417
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,980
Thoughtful indeed.

418
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,140
Rong.

419
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:55,980
Rong.

420
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,460
You're back.

421
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,780
How was today?

422
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,060
What did my father say?

423
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,980
Did he approve our divorce?

424
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:20,860
He didn't say that.

425
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,500
But

426
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,580
I complained about you.

427
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,860
You, little cat,
bit and scratched me.

428
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,660
I don't want you anymore.

429
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,900
This little cat is going
to apologize to you.

430
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,500
How?

431
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,900
How?

432
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,340
Seriously, what happened next.

433
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,660
Then, I complained about Consort Rou.

434
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,900
I said

435
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,260
she tricked you with a talisman.

436
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,900
His Majesty should realize

437
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,060
that someone might be using him.

438
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,020
Then, His Majesty said

439
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,980
he would draft a decree
to allow us to divorce,

440
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,900
and I came back.

441
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,380
But, Father has always
favored Consort Rou.

442
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,220
What you did

443
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,100
probably won't be very effective.

444
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,180
If His Majesty feels

445
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,860
that Consort Rou is being used
to bring him down,

446
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,500
he wouldn't forgive her.

447
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,500
You mean

448
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,580
my father needs to realize

449
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,500
that Consort Rou is manipulated
by the noble families.

450
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,580
Your complaint alone won't be enough.

451
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,780
That's alright.

452
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,900
Even in weiqi, you play
one move after another.

453
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,380
Do you think when someone tricked me,

454
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,940
I would not trick them back?

455
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,580
Anyone can bluff.

456
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,380
Mr. Pei, you need
to show me what you've got.

457
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,380
We'll see.

458
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,100
Ms. Du.

459
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,700
Mr. Pei?

460

[Tunyu Study]
You're already

461
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,060
a skilled calligrapher yourself,

462
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,020
and it's been quite some time
since you last came for lessons.

463
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,300
What brings you here today?

464
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,620
Ms. Du, I have a favor to ask of you.

465
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,960
[Dispel all misfortunes]
Do you think

466
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,460
you can replicate this handwriting?

467
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,540
This person has a solid foundation
in the clerical script.

468
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,020
It's not that hard,

469
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,980
but

470
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,060
you know my rules.

471
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,980
I don't forge letters and documents.

472
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,540
Yes.

473
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,820
But, what if

474
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,860
it's for the sake of justice?

475
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,660
For justice?

476
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,380
Your Highness.

477
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,860
Why do you look so tired?

478
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,620
Did you not sleep last night?

479
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,420
I'm fine. Take a look at this.

480
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,100

[Testimony]

483
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,460
You went out early in the morning

484
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,060
to forge Hongde's handwriting?

485
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,500
Read the content carefully.

486
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,740
You actually wrote

487
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,140
that Su Rongqing went
to Qingfeng Taoist Temple

488
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,820
and threatened Hongde with his power

489
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,060
to deceive Consort Rou

490
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,540
to frame us.

491
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,820
Why did you leave Consort Rou
out of this, though?

492
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,380
We're offering His Majesty
a way out through Consort Rou.

493
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,820
If we don't leave her out of this,

494
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,940
His Majesty wouldn't be able to act.

495
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,500
It's just that,

496
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,220
by doing this,

497
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,940
we're literally declaring war
against Su Rongqing.

498
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,020
I'm afraid he already has.

00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,540
Your Majesty.

that Princess and the Prince Consort
are sleeping separately.

502

Let them be.

503
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,660
Then, what about the divorce?

00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,140
It's tough for a lady to remarry.

You said someone tricked you.

All I know

527
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,780
is that a nobleman came
to Qingfeng Taoist Temple that night

528
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,540

who he is.

00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,260
I didn't even get
to see his guard's face.

532
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,460
But, he kidnapped my son.

533
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,420
I had no choice.

00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,700

Go on. What happened next?

536
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,860
Then, he tied me up

537
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,100
and put me into his carriage.

538
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,700
He told me

00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,380
that he would expose

This isn't a lie, is it?

00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,220
That itself is a lie.

543
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,220

00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,100
Yes.

545

that you have never called for me.

from asking me to die?

00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,780
I know what you're thinking.

560
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,180
You think

561
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,060
that your son
is in someone else's hands,

562
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,100
and I have nothing to coerce you

563
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,220
other than your own life.

564
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,300
Given your background,

565
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,220
if you identify Su Rongqing,

566
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,180
the Su Family would never let you off.

567
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,260
Since you're going to die,

568
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,780
you might as well keep your son alive.

569
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,900
But, only I...

570
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,940
can protect the both of you.

571
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,020
I'll tell you something else I know.

572
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,460
Tell me if I'm wrong.

573
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,820
Five years ago,

574
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,220
you conned a young lady

575
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,060
for thousands of taels

576
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,740
by telling her that she needed

577
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,900
to change her fate on your popularity.

578
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,370
Four years ago,

579
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,580
you had an affair
with an official's wife.

580
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,260
While she visited Qingfeng Taoist Temple
every month to pray,

581
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,060
she was actually in your bedroom.

582
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,220
Three years ago...

583
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,340
Your Highness.

584
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,620
How did you know so much?

585
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:20,380
If you don't want people to know
your wrongdoings, then don't do it.

586
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,220
You've deceived
and harmed so many people.

587
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,660
Don't you feel guilty at all?

588
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:26,780
Guilty?

589
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,380
Why should I feel guilty?

590
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,980
There are tons of other people
who are more evil than me.

591
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,220
You must have seen people who would kill

592
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,300
for a meager sum of money.

593
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,620
That's pure evil.

594
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,980
People like me

595
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,980
commit sins once in a while.

596
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,780
You may say that bad guys like us

597
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,780
don't deserve to live in this world.

598
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,660
But, what if there are plenty
of people like me?

599
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,380
Would that be mankind's fault

600
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,060
or the society's fault?

601
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,260
That's why I hope

602
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,460
that my efforts can make

603
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,580
the noblemen and commoners
live together in harmony,

604
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,860
and the world at peace.

605
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,420
Your Highness.

606
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,940
I admit that this country isn't perfect,

607
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,460
but this shouldn't be

608
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,900
a reason or excuse for your sins.

609
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,980
If as the Princess said,

610
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,820
I can't afford to offend

611
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,140
both the Princess and the Su Family.

612
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,220
Your Majesty.

613
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,420
Princess Pingyue
is requesting an audience.

614
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,540
Why is she here at this late hour?

615
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,420
Father.

616
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,940
Father, please seek justice for me.

617
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:39,900
What is it?

618
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,380
Father, you need
to discipline Pei Wenxuan for me.

619
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,700
He's gone too far.

620
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,260
What exactly happened?

621
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,220
A few days ago,

622
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,580
Pei Wenxuan and I had a quarrel.

623
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,460
He's been ignoring me since then,

624
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,940
and he even said he wanted a divorce.

625
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,900
He said you've already drafted a decree.

626
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,420
I don't believe him.

627
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,740
Why would a father
order his daughter to get a divorce?

628
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,060
If I do get a divorce,

629
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,780
who else can I look for?

630
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,380
If you don't want to get divorced,

631
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,820
then why were you cruising
with those men from Nanfeng House?

632
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,820
I was just trying to cross him.

633
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,700
Father, I've realized my mistake.

634
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,700
Please persuade him for me.

635
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,380
He can't ignore me forever.

636
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,580
He's even moved to the outer courtyard.

637
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,380
How about you command him to come back?

638
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:33,940
Ridiculous!

639
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,100
I appointed you as the Supervisor
of the Inspectorate Office,

640
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,580
and now you're indulging yourself

641
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,380
in debauchery

642
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,580
instead of fulfilling your duties.

643
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,100
What's wrong with you?

644
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,740
You've wronged me, Father.

645
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,540
We may quarrel sometimes,

646
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,780
but I still do my work.

647
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,100
In fact,

648
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,220
you haven't replied to my memorial

649
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,500
that I submitted a few days ago.

650
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,140
What are you planning to do?

651
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,340
What memorial?

652
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,780
Hongde's testimony.

653
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,340
I submitted all the evidence
several days ago.

654
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,140
We just need a word from you

655
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,340
to start investigating Su Rongqing.

656
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,980
How is Su Rongqing related to this?

657
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,540
Well...

658
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,260
Hongde said

659
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,020
it was Su Rongqing who went to him

660
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,420
to tell Consort Rou all that.

661
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,940
Haven't you read my memorial?

662
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,260
Fulai.

663
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,580
Go to the Remonstration Office

664
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,140
to bring the Princess' memorial here.

665
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,380
I want to review it now.

666
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

667
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,500
As soon as Father reads the memorial,

668
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,100
he will find out that Su Rongqing

669
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,260
has been using Consort Rou
for the noble families' benefit.

670
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,340
Father will start to get suspicious,

671
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,900
and Su Rongqing can
no longer associate himself

672
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,860
with Prince Su.

673
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,460
If this memorial gets submitted,

674
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,340
you would be implicated, Mr. Su.

675
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,380
On the occasion of the assessment
for the position of Minister,

676
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,580
Everyone has high hopes on you.

677
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,740
I was worried that this memorial
may hinder you,

678
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,980
so I took it out secretly.

679
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:55,980
Xuanji.

680
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,100
I transferred you there,

681
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,100
and it seems that my plan has backfired.

682
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,180
This round...

683
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,220
We have lost.

684
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,340
[Testimony]
This testimony is a fake.

685
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,020
It's fake?

686
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:21,100
The Princess deliberately
submitted this fake testimony

687
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,020
for you to steal.

688
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,500
If my guess is correct,

689
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,940
the Princess must be already
in the palace now.

690
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,060
And His Majesty

691
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,860
must have already sent someone
to retrieve this memorial.

692
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,300
Go back now.

693
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,020
I'll put it back right away.

694
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:41,620
No need.

695
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,260
Even if you do,

696
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,540
the Princess would claim
that her memorial has been switched.

697
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,180
Once they start investigating,

698
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,180
you'd be implicated as well.

699
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,780
By then,

700
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,340
you'd lose your job.

701
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:57,940
What should I do then?

702
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,980
Leave this thing here.

703
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,500
Pretend that you don't know anything.

704
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,820
Are you supposed to be on shift now?

705
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:08,980
No.

706
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:10,780
That's great.

707
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,260
Go back home and sleep.

708
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,620
Pretend that you've never been here.

709
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,100
I'll take my leave.

710
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,460
I plotted and schemed

711
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,220
to make Hongde accuse the Princess
of delaying the Crown Prince's wedding.

712
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,900
I even prepared a marriage talisman

713
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,380
to undermine His Majesty's trust
in Pei Wenxuan and the Princess.

714
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,860
But the Princess used this
to her advantage instead.

715
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,380
Mu Hong.

716
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,620
Young Master.

717
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,820
Get a servant

718
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,060
to sneak into the palace

719
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,940
and burn the Remonstration Office.

720
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,540
When the fire starts to burn,

721
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,860
make sure he doesn't leave.

722
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,980
Just leave him there.

723
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,180
You want to burn
the Remonstration Office?

724
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,740
Isn't that a bit too much?

725
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,100
It's not just too much.

726
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,060
It's the boldest and craziest idea ever.

727
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,100
Young Master...

728
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,140
Just do as I say,

729
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,940
and wait for the results.

730
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,340
Whatever will be, will be.

731
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,180
Go.

732
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,180
Yes, sir.

733
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,290
[Li Rong, Supervisor
of the Inspectorate Office]

734
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,700
[Su Rongqing, Vice Minister
of Personnel]

735
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,340
Your Majesty, bad news!

736
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,540
The Remonstration Office is on fire!

737
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:52,860
Your Majesty!

738
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,780
Say that again.

739
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,060
What's on fire?

740
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:55,980
The Remonstration Office.

741
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,180
It was already burning

742
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,500
while I was on my way there.

743
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,180
Many officials are still trapped inside.

744
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,300
How did the fire start?

745
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,820
We don't know yet.

746
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,260
Father, let me take a look there.

747
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,420
The building itself is nothing,

748
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,500
but we need to save
the people and memorials inside.

749
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,220
No need.

750
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,300
I will go there myself.

751
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,340
Split into two teams!

752
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,140
Team One, take water from the wells
to put out fire!

753
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,980
Team Two, save the people
and memorials inside!

754
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,900
Go!

755
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,900
Your Majesty!

756
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,540
Your Majesty, why are you here?

757
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,500
It's dangerous here. You should go back.

758
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,180
Yes, we'll handle the situation here.

759
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,100
Does any of you know who set fire
to the Remonstration Office?

760
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,620
I just received the news,

761
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,820
and I came over right away.

762
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,580
Perhaps someone knocked
over a candle stand.

763
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,140
I'm asking who is this bold in court
to burn the Remonstration Office!

764
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,180
Your Majesty.

765
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:49,780
Your Highness.

766
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,580
The Remonstration Office is on fire.

767
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,900
The Remonstration Office
has always been patrolled

768
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,460
every night since it was established.

769
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,940
Why the sudden fire?

770
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,300
His Majesty summoned
the Princess earlier

771
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,340
and wanted to retrieve Hongde's
testimony from the Remonstration Office.

772
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,700
Not long after that,
the Remonstration Office was on fire.

773
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,460
He's even burning
the Remonstration Office.

774
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:09,260
Looks like Su Rongqing
is really cornered.

775
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,020
Go to the Princess's Mansion

776
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,380
and devise a counterplan
with the Prince Consort.

777
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,100
Yes, Your Highness.

778
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,740
Greetings, Father.

779
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,460
You may rise.

780
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,860
You said Official Su was involved,

781
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,100
and your memorial was burned.

782
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,100
Thus, I called you here

783
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,700
to confront each other directly.

784
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,300
Su Rongqing said

785
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,660
he did not know Hongde.

786
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:40,980
What do you have to say?

787
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,420
Whether Su Rongqing knows him or not,

788
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,820
Hongde has confessed everything.

789
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,380
It's just that his testimony,
together with the Remonstration Office,

790
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,900
has suspiciously perished in the fire.

791
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,460
The material evidence
may have been gone,

792
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,740
but he's still there.

793
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,540
Summon Hongde here.

794
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,140
I have done nothing wrong.

795
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,340
Your Highness, someone must have

796
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,060
instigated you to make you
come to this conclusion.

797
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,580
I also agree we should call Hongde over

798
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,860
to ask him in person.

799
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,380
Summon Hongde here?

800
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:18,380
I couldn't persuade him
that day in prison.

801
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,460
After all, his son is still
in Su Rongqing's hands.

802
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,180
He wouldn't help me at this point.

803
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,860
But I have no other options now.

804
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,060
Summon him.

805
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

806
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,300
While we're waiting,

807
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,180
Pingyue, tell me

808
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,780
why you said

809
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,620
Official Su had instigated Hongde
to accuse you.

810
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,020
For some reason,

811
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:40,980
Mr. Su went to Hongde.

812
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,220
He kidnapped Hongde's illegitimate son

813
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,060
and used him to coerce Hongde

814
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,620
to accuse me

815
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,660
of trying to delay
the Crown Prince's wedding.

816
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,100
Then, he took advantage
of his position as Prince Su's tutor

817
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,060
and cajoled Consort Rou

818
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,940
into bringing Hongde to the palace.

819
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,380
Mr. Su.

820
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,300
I have no grudge against you.

821
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,220
Why are you framing me?

822
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,580
Official Su, what say you?

823
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,740
Your Highness, you're claiming

824
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,380
that I was trying to set you up

825
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,900
by making Hongde say

826
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,900
that you were trying to delay
the Crown Prince's wedding.

827
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,380
They why didn't I ask him
to accuse you of treason.

828
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,180
You should ask yourself that question,
Mr. Su.

829
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,540
The Crown Prince is all grown up now.

830
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,020
It's imperative that he get married
as soon as possible.

831
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,340
If I want the best for him,

832
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,460
I would have chosen

833
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,940
a suitable noble lady for him instead.

834
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,420
Why would I want to delay his wedding?

835
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,100
As his elder sister,
why would I harm him?

836
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,180
Only you can answer that.

837
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,900
So, you're saying

838
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,180
that Su Rongqing burned
the Remonstration Office down.

839
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,140
Now that the evidence is destroyed,

840
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,180
Hongde will be summoned to the palace.

841
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,380
Won't he expose everything by then?

842
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,420
Would Hongde dear to enter the palace?

843
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,460
Thank you.

844
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,940
[Zhengwu Gate]
Just hand him over to us.

845
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,380
Thank you, Eunuch Fu.

846
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,100
This way, Daoist Hongde.

847
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,860
Eunuch Fu, you have to vouch for us.

848
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,660
He was alive
when he left the Inspectorate Office.

849
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,460
It's true, Eunuch Fu.

850
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,540
This is not the time to talk about this.

851
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,060
I need to report this to His Majesty.

852
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:47,780
Your Majesty,

853
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,900
Hongde was killed on the way here.

854
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,740
What did you say?

855
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,260
Bring me there.

856
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,180
I'd like to go there too.

857
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,540
None of you shall leave!

858
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,100
Let the post-mortem examiner
examine his body.

859
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,020
Yes, Your Majesty.

860
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,580
Now that Hongde is dead,
no one can prove the truth anymore.

861
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,300
But now, in Father's eyes,

862
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,620
Su Rongqing's reputation
has been tainted.

863
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,300
If Hongde dies,

864
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,140
both human testimony
and the material evidence will be gone.

865
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:18,940
No.

866
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,460
If there's no evidence,

867
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,060
Father won't be able
to convict Su Rongqing.

868
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,460
He may be doubtful,

869
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,660
but while he doubts Su Rongqing

870
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,420
He will also suspect you and Rong.

871
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,540
That's when the next step comes in.

872
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,540
If His Majesty begins to suspect

873
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,580
the truth in the Princess's words,

874
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,580
the only thing left to investigate

875
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,900
would be the whereabouts
of Hongde's son.

876
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,140
The results would be interesting.

877
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,500
You said Hongde had a son?

878
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:48,860
Yes, Father.

879
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,580
And he's in Su Rongqing's hands?

880
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,660
That's right.

881
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,300
Your Majesty...

882
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,060
Silence.

883
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,580
Fulai, investigate now.

884
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,220
Yes, Your Majesty.

885
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,580
His Majesty may not be able

886
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,140
to find out
where exactly Hongde's son is,

887
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,700
but he'd discover

888
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,660
how the child was taken away.

889
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:18,020
There must be traces of the abduction.

890
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,700
For example, a passerby
might have accidentally witnessed

891
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,620
the child's kidnapping,

892
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,300
and recognized the Su Family's emblem.

893
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,140
That's a common possibility, isn't it?

894
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,500
So what?

895
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,180
Even if my father knows
the child was abducted by the Su Family,

896
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,460
so what?

897
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,300
Since His Majesty already knows

898
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,180
that someone brought Hongde
into the palace,

899
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,620
and that Hongde's son

900
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,420
was taken by the Su Family,

901
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,780
who do you think

902
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,860
His Majesty would suspect

903
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,140
when there's no evidence?

904
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,620
Hongde cannot afford to offend

905
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,420
both the Su Family and the Princess.

906
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:55,220
This is the last kind act he can do

907
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,620
to protect his son.

908
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,420
Your Highness.

909
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,860
I need to go to the palace
to pick up your sister.

910
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:08,100
Shouldn't you be pretending
that your marriage is on the rocks?

911
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,300
We're pretending that we're seemingly
in harmony but actually at variance.

912
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,180
So, sometimes we need
to pretend we're in harmony.

913
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,060
I'll take my leave, then.

914
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:17,700
Take care, Your Highness.

915
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,140
Guard this area.

916
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,620
No one else may come near.

917
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,020
Yes, Eunuch Fu.

918
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:27,940
Sir,

919
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,500
please tell me what happened

920
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,260
that night.

921
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,540
I was working my shift
as a night watcher that night.

922
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,420
When I passed by the street
where the Taoist Temple is,

923
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,660
I saw a boy
being abducted by several men.

924
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,900
I recognized one of them.

925
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,780
He's from the Su Family.

926
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,460
Eunuch Fu, I have
completed my investigation.

927
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:58,580
Your Majesty,

928
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,740
this is
the post-mortem examiner's result.

929
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,420
The post-mortem examiner
said it was suicide.

930
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,460
And the Su Family...

931
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,460
Su Rongqing.

932
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,700
Hand over Hongde's son now.

933
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,340
Your Majesty, I'm wronged.

934
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,740
I don't know where you heard this from.

935
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,420
Why don't you summon him here

936
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,060
so I can confront him directly?
