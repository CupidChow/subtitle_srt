[Episode 14]

5
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,940
No need to take the whole kit

6
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,060
for a small cut.

7
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,620
Your Highness,

8
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,820
I have an idea.

9
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,140
It might be very blunt,

10
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,460
but it's just a suggestion.

11
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,460
You can keep it to yourself
if it's blunt.

12
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,540
No, I should say it out loud.

13
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,620
What about Su Rongqing

14
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,900
as a potential candidate?

15
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,300
Look at me. Why would I bring him up?

16
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,620
Mr. Pei is here.

17
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,300
You're the Prince Consort, after all.

18
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,180
You can continue.

19
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,580
Mr. Pei is very generous.

20
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,220
Right?

21
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,460
Yes.

22
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,060
Feel free to speak your mind,
Miss Shangguan.

23
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,940
I observed Mr. Su's reaction today,

24
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,380
and I believe he has
some feelings for you, Your Highness.

25
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,860
If we can persuade him
to join the Inspectorate Office,

26
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,900
it will be easier

27
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,980
for us to make moves in the future.

28
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,620
What do you mean, Miss Shangguan?

29
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,380
See?

30
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,740
I offended Mr. Pei here.

31
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,260
It's fine. Please continue.

32
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,700
Feelings can be developed.

33
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,980
If you don't mind, Your Highness,

34
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,180
I can arrange it for you.

35
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,140
Arrange what?

36
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,060
Her Highness's marriage

37
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,940
shouldn't be mixed together
with those things.

38
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,260
Furthermore,

39
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,420
my marriage with Her Highness

40
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,700
is a scheme.

41
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,180
If we had a second chance,

42
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,420
shouldn't we avoid
making the same mistake?

43
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,540

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,100
I beg to differ.

47
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,940
It's not right to sacrifice love

48
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,260
for power, of course.

49
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,580
But if Her Highness fancies him,

50
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,620
isn't that making use of an opportunity
to help them get together?

51
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,780
We're both Her Highness's friends.

52
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,140
As her besties,

53
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,900
we must act in her best interest.

54
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,540

74
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,500
that she makes sense.

so we might as well play along.

78
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,580
It's impractical
to visit the Ministry of Justice

79
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,100
all the time to make a scene.

80
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,340
We need an intermediary.

81
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,380
I should talk to him.

82
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,860
I can negotiate with him on your behalf.

83
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,260
If you don't want

84
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,300
to visit the Ministry of Justice,

85
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,020
we can seek an alternative.

86
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,700
I'm willing to help.

87
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,260
Why do you keep stopping me

88
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,460
from seeing him?

89
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,780
Didn't you tell me

90
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,660
to give him a chance?

91
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,540
Li Rong.

92
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,100
We got married
because we wanted to gain power.

93
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,420
Even if we're getting a divorce,

94
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,740
I still hope you'll find

95
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,500
a man you like,

96
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,220
not a random person.

97
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:14,980
If you're

98
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,540
approaching Su Rongqing for power,

99
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,980
then there will be no difference
from the situation we are in now.

100
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,300
Of course, there's a difference.

101
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,540
I'm not saying I'll be with him now.

102
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,780
I'll wait until I know
that I'm in love with him.

103
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,940
Why don't you find out the answer now?

104
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,020
How?

105
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,060
What's wrong with you today?

106
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,100
You are never this temperamental.

107
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,260
Don't they say the older you get,

108
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,460
the more childish you become?

109
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,580
You cut yourself today

110
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,700
because of a recording officer.

111
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,740
That is inappropriate of you.

112
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,420
Don't do this again.

113
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,500
I know.

114
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,100
While people do say
that I carry a noble body,

115
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,980
I'm still a human.

116
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,860
You don't have to patch me up
like this for a small cut.

117
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,460
This is ridiculous.

118
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,660
Not at all.

119
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,620
You have to keep yourself safe.

120
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,020
What are you implying?

121
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,100
Nothing.

122
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,700
I'm just worried that Su Rongqing

123
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,020
might complain about me

124
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,780
in the court tomorrow.

125
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,460
Aren't you two sworn brothers
or something?

126
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,380
Enough.

127
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,620
Don't worry.

128
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,780
Father

129
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,580
will only punish you lightly
and deduct your salary.

130
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,060
You know what?

131
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,820
I'll pay you back

132
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,420
what my father will take from you.

133
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,580
If that's still not enough,

134
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,420
once I really establish a relationship
with Su Rongqing,

135
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,860
I'll ask him to pay you back tenfold.

136
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,220
Should I thank you then?

137
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,020
No need.

138
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,220
Don't worry.

139
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,580
Such a trivial matter
will not bother me at all.

140
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,140
I should go.

141
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,060
Where are you going?

142
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,660
Just do what you're supposed to do.

143
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,380
I'll ask Chuan to communicate
with your superior tomorrow

144
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,660
so that he won't give you extra work.

145
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:27,980
I won't take no for an answer.

146
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,020
All right.

147
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,260
Don't stay out too late.

148
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,420
Rest early.

149
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,500
I will.

150
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,860
The case files contain three parts.

151
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,900
The first one contains

152
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,020
the background of the Qin Family's case.

153
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,900
The second one contains
the investigation methods

154
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,380
and the reports issued and approved
by the officers involved.

155
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,700
The third one contains

156
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,380
the transcripts of all the witnesses's
testimonies and the evidence.

157
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,620
The testimonies and the evidence
are kept elsewhere.

158
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,460
We won't have access to them
for the moment.

159
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:21,980
However,

160
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,660
there's a breakthrough.

161
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,060
And that is this case is found

162
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,300
by Wen Ping, an investigating censor

163
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,900
from the Censorate.

164
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,300
Wen Ping received a report letter

165
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,860
claiming that when the Great Xia
and the enemies went to war,

166
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,740
the Qin Family
was defending Huangping County.

167
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,420
Three thousand soldiers stayed to defend

168
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,020
while three thousand enemies
came to invade.

169
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,780
[Military Record]
Yang Ye later asked the Qin Family

170
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,060
to feign surrender and flee the city.

171
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,140
After Wen Ping received the letter,

172
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,100
he retrieved

173
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,180
the official record of the battle
from the Ministry of War.

174
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,020
Three thousand soldiers
defended the city.

175
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,900
Three thousand enemies came invading.

176
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,180
The city was then abandoned.

177
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:54,860
Someone!

178
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,060
By right,

179
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,180
the invaders can only claim the city
if they outnumber

180
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,100
the defenders.

181
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,140
When both factions are of equal power,

182
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,700
this shouldn't be the outcome.

183
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,380
Luo Juan.

184
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,260
Confess now.

185
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,500
What truly happened in the battle
occurred in Huangping County?

186
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,260
Come clean!

187
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,780
Otherwise, you'll suffer more.

188
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,860
Back then...

189
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,380
the Qin Family could win.

190
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,620
Or at least, they wouldn't lose.

191
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,060
They abandoned the city.

192
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,100
Someone.

193
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,620
Ask the Ministry of War to assist us

194
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,460
in retrieving the military record
of the battle

195
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,780
so we can verify the situation.

196
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,060
Sirs,

197
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,820
this is the conclusion I've arrived at.

198
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,820
All evidence indicates
that the Qin Family

199
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,100
colluded with the enemies,
and betrayed the nation.

200
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,300
Then

201
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,460
seize the Qin's Mansion

202
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,860
and detain all personnel
according to the law.

203
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,620
Yes, sir.

204
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,140
The Qin Family is found guilty
of embezzling military funds,

205
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,500
colluding with enemies
and committing treason

206
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,780
with the Yang Family.
The evidence is clear.

207
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,620
Arrest
the entire Qin Family immediately.

208
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,380
Stop.

209
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:08,860
Qin Lang.

210
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,740
The evidence is clear.

211
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,900
Will you plead guilty or not?

212
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,460
Continue.

213
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,260
Stop.

214
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,540
Will you plead guilty or not?

215
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,220
Yes.

216
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,660
They've put a lot of effort into it
and tried to take the lives

217
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,140
of the entire Qin Family
with a mere one thousand taels of gold.

218
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,140
What a low price.

219
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,020
There are three entry points.

220
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,780
First,

221
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,260
find out the one who wrote the letter.

222
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,620
Then, it's Luo Juan.

223
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,980
Luo Juan must have
given a false testimony.

224
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,980
We need to find out more people

225
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,740
who participated in the battle.

226
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,860
Then, it's Yang Ye's letter.

227
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,340
We need to see it
to verify its veracity.

228
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,500
Lastly, that 1,000 taels of gold.

229
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,340
We need to locate those
who raided the Qin's Mansion.

230
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,900
Only they know

231
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,660
how the money got inside.

232
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,500
Tomorrow, I'll ask Xun Chuan

233
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,140
to go to Luo Juan and the veterans
who fought in the battle.

234
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,020
As for Yang Ye's letter and those
who raided the Qin's Mansion...

235
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,500
it'd be best if Su Rongqing
could help us with them.

236
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,740
Is she going
to go to Su Rongqing again?

237
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,740
But

238
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,980
what if Su Rongqing
refuses to cooperate?

239
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,540
I believe

240
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,660
we should avoid
having too much interaction with him.

241
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,900
After all, we don't know
if he's an ally or an enemy.

242
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,260
Then

243
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,100
We'll have to find out if we can
find another ally

244
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:50,860
in the Ministry of Justice.

245
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,220
Or, we take the normal procedures.

246
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,100
I'll give those who don't show us
the evidence a hard time

247
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,140
until they find us the evidence.

248
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,260
This is a much better option
than going to Su Rongqing.

249
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,740
You don't like him, do you?

250
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,740
It's not like that.

251
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,020
It's also...

252
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,140
Young Master?

253
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,540
Your Highness?

254
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,020
Never mind that.

255
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,860
Tell Miss Shangguan

256
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,340
that she can arrange it for me
as she wants

257
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,340
as soon as possible.

258
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,300
Ask Xun Chuan

259
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,980
to gather 12 elite ones

260
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,460
to be Her Highness's guards.

261
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:33,900
Yes, sir.

262
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,250
[Censorate]

263
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,580
Stop.

264
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,580
Who are you?

265
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,580
Mr. Wen.

266
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,660
I am Pei Wenxuan,
with Wujin as my courtesy name,

267
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,340
a palace attendant in the Censorate.

268
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,580
Oh?

269
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,660
You're from the Censorate?

270
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,060
Why didn't I see you

271
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,580
when I did the roll call today?

272
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,580
I am terribly sorry.

273
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,100
I was accompanying Princess Pingyue...

274
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,860
Are you the prince consort

275
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,900
or a palace attendant?

276
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,100
Both.

277
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,060
For your family,
you are the prince consort.

278
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,980
For your nation,
you are the palace attendant.

279
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,820
What's more important,
your family or your nation?

280
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,420
I believe
I don't need to give you the answer.

281
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,180
Duly noted, sir.

282
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,860
If you do not want to work,

283
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,100
I will write to His Majesty

284
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,420
and have you transferred away.

285
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,860
I am sorry, Mr. Wen.

286
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,140
I will make sure
to perform my duty in the future.

287
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,660
Words

288
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,580
don't hold any weight.

289
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,980
If you mean what you said,

290
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,980
why don't you handle the memorials

291
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,660
submitted by all 78 counties

292
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,780
under the five southwestern provinces?

293
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,820
What do you think?

294
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,300
Thanks for enlightening me, Mr. Wen.

295
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,060
Yongzhi, you're still here.

296
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,900
Wenxuan,

297
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,020
I'll be done soon.

298
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,980
Then, I'll go home.

299
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,420
Did you forget something?

300
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:03,780
No.

301
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,660
I need to handle these memorials.

302
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,820
There are so many of them.

303
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,540
You'll have to pull an all-nighter.

304
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,420
I am planning to do so.

305
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,540
Wenxuan.

306
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,740
Do you see what's happening?

307
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,940
They are making your life difficult

308
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,180
because Princess Pingyue and you
are investigating them.

309
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,940
I know.

310
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,180
And you're fine with that?

311
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,980
If I can't fulfill my duty,

312
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,700
how can I handle the work

313
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,580
outside my duty?

314
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,060
How admirable.

315
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,420
If you, a prince consort,
work this hard,

316
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,660
an unmarried commoner like me...

317
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,300
I should stay here and work with you.

318
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,100
Yongzhi.

319
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,940
Will you believe me

320
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,140
if I tell you there's a world...

321
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,780
where only your capability matters

322
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,020
rather than your family background?

323
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,100
Everyone there

324
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,140
can compete fairly.

325
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:25,980
Really?

326
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,380
Yes. We will make that happen.

327
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,300
We can eliminate the unfair system
of the imperial examination

328
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,020
and change the official system

329
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,340
to choose the competent ones

330
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,100
to serve our nation.

331
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,260
[Su's Mansion]
This is my dream

332
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,980
as a commoner.

333
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,300
Ronghua,

334
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,100
you're still as childish as ever.

335
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,620
What's on your mind?

336
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,500
You were so focused.

337
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,100
I was thinking about you.

338
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,340
Father is making arrangements
for your marriage.

339
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,260
You cannot

340
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,540
escape it forever.

341
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,340
Ronghua.

342
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,780
Is there anyone you adore?

343
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,060
If you do, let me know.

344
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,180
I'll help you convince Father.

345
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,300
Like I said,

346
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,300
I can handle the court affairs.

347
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,140
You can just do

348
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,660
whatever you want to do.

349
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,460
Sure.

350
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,780
Don't worry.

351
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,420
I won't go overboard.

352
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,500
You, however,

353
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,300
have been more sensible
than others since young.

354
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,580
You keep everything to yourself.

355
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,460
If there's something troubling you,

356
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,900
just share it with me.

357
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,300
I know.

358
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,500
Ronghua,

359
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,980
it's getting late.

360
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,460
You should go back and rest early.

361
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,220
You too.

362
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,140
I'll lend an ear if you need me.

363
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,380
See you.

364
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,100
Your Highness,

365
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,940
you're back.

366
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,060
Her Highness prepared this for you.

367
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,300
She's still awake?

368
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,380
She said you worked hard today,

369
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,660
and she's waiting for you.

370
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,300
You should have persuaded her to rest.

371
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,460
Don't

372
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,140
let her stay up that late again.

373
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,780
Otherwise, she'll fall sick.

374
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,060
We can't do that.

375
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,940
Why don't you persuade her personally,
Your Highness?

376
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,380
Right.

377
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,740
Let me talk to her.

378
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,180
Suddenly, I've realized

379
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,180
that whether in the past or at present,

380
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,900
what I've been longing for,

381
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,380
missing,

382
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,580
and yearning for

383
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,860
is the feeling of home.

384
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,580
It's precisely this moment

385
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,940
when I come home with a weary soul

386
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,100
to see someone waiting for me.

387
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,420
Rong.

388
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,340
You're back.

389
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,700
Finally.

390
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,060
No need to wait for me next time.

391
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,540
I didn't want you to get angry again.

392
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,300
Let me take the pillow away for you.

393
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,300
Your head.

394
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,020
Can you...

395
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:27,300
stop getting mad at Su Rongqing
when you see him?

396
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,580
You asked me

397
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,580
to go to him.

398
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,780
But then you got mad at me.

399
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,140
What am I supposed to do?

400
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,060
Then don't go to him.

401
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,780
Pei Wenxuan.

402
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:03,940
Calm down.

403
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,260
Pei Wenxuan.

404
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,540
In the past, Su Rongqing
could not have Li Rong

405
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,300
because he came from a humble background

406
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,540
and was castrated.

407
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:21,700
Furthermore,

408
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,980
Li Rong and he had a huge grudge.

409
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,140
So they could merely

410
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,700
snuggle up to each other at night.

411
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,940
Li Rong

412
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,300
was still my wife.

413
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,700
But it's different now.

414
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,300
The present Su Rongqing
gets all the advantages.

415
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,340
[Jucai House]
I was trying my luck here.

416
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,020
I can't believe I'd run into you here.

417
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,020
You visit a gambling house
this early in the morning.

418
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,540
You sure are a bit insane.

419
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,060
Likewise.

420
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,460
You're a noble lady

421
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,780
who is proficient in four arts.

422
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,340
Yet, you've always
spent your time here too.

423
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,780
Compared to you, Miss Shangguan,

424
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,460
what I've done

425
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,820
is nothing.

426
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,300
Besides, I'm just
a seventh-ranked official.

427
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,140
I'm not an official member
of the Censorate,

428
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,140
so I don't have to attend
the morning court.

429
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,260
It's normal
that I come here to have fun.

430
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,580
Let's cut to the chase.

431
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,580
Her Highness wants to see your brother.

432
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,060
Can you bring him here

433
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,060
for a meal together?

434
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,300
You will get benefits for that.

435
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,580
I know you and Mr. Xie

436
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,780
are having a cockfight next month.

437
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,780
He possesses

438
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,540
the strongest cock in Huajing.

439
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,060
Therefore, you are looking

440
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,580
for another cock that can defeat his.

441
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,820
Coincidentally,
I have the undefeated cock

442
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,060
from Youzhou.

443
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,300
I can give it to you for free.

444
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,540
You'll win easily.

445
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:46,700
What do you think?

446
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,780
Miss Shangguan,

447
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,540
trading a cock for my younger brother?

448
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,340
Is this a joke or what?

449
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,540
What do you want then?

450
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,100
Let's gamble.

451
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,860
On what?

452
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,780
Big or small.

453
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,460
Best two out of three.

454
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,100
Hold on.

455
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,060
Let's not play that.

456
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,100
Let's play wooden cards.

457
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,540
Sure.

458
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,940
If you win, I'll give you what you want.

459
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:11,780
If I win,

460
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,620
you'll have to wear women's clothes
for me three days later.

461
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:15,780
Qian Ning.

462
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,540
Yes, sir?

463
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,980
Wait for Princess Pingyue
at the palace gate.

464
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,580
When she's done with the morning court,

465
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,060
ask her to dress up

466
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,060
because I want to have a meal with her.

467
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,300
Yes, sir.

468
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,540
Are you in?

469
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,820
Distribute the cards.

470
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,060
You lost again.

471
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,300
Your Highness.

472
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,100
Prince Consort.

473
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,060
Your Highness.

474
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,100
Mr. Pei.

475
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,140
How's the game?

476
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,620
Miss Shangguan and I agreed

477
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,340
to gamble with wooden cards.

478
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,460
And she lost.

479
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,060
Miss Shangguan,

480
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,540
Her Highness is here,

481
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,860
and you lost many rounds.

482
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,260
You'll keep your promise, right?

483
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,220
Promise?

484
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,300
What promise?

485
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,020
You promised
to wear women's clothes for me

486
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,300
three days later.

487
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,540
No, I will win.

488
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,540
I'll win the next round.

489
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,460
All right.

490
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,540
Let's go.

491
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,300
If you continue,
the game will never end.

492
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,060
Let's go.

493
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,380
What about this?

494
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,060
You can have one round
with Wenxuan.

495
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,060
If you win, you want a meal
with Rongqing?

496
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,300
Yes.

497
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,220
If Wenxuan loses,

498
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,620
Ya will dine with you.

499
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,500
Wonderful.

500
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,540
Mr. Pei, please.

501
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,100
Pei Wenxuan.

502
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,580
Show Mr. Su what you're capable of.

503
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,100
Play it well.

504
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,060
If you win, you'll be awarded.

505
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,020
Mr. Pei,

506
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:46,980
what do you want to play?

507
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,300
Pai Gow.

508
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:51,980
Anything.

509
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,100
I'll deal the cards.

510
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,540
Mr. Su,

511
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,300
do you want one?

512
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,780
Ten points.

513
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,140
No need.

514
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,740
You have big points
on your card, Mr. Su.

515
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,620
You too, Mr. Pei.

516
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,820
Prince Consort,

517
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:27,860
do you want one?

518
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,340
Do you want to win?

519
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,300
Of course.

520
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,220
Two cards.

521
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,100
Two?

522
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,580
How bold, Mr. Pei.

523
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,020
Ten points too.

524
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,260
But each point on his cards
is smaller than yours.

525
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,100
So, Mr. Su?

526
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:57,980
Mr. Su.

527
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,700
Where are we having the meal?

528
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:02,860
Let's have it tonight.

529
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,780
Let's have the meal
at Mingyue Restaurant.

530
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,140
Now that we have settled
on the time and location,

531
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,820
Her Highness and I will get going.

532
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,100
See you.

533
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,380
See you.

534
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,860
It seems like

535
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,740
my view of the Prince Consort
will be changed.

536
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,860
He is so handsome!

537
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,540
Now I know

538
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,300
why Ya loves to gamble.

539
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,380
When you revealed the last card,

540
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,700
I was so nervous,

541
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,020
and my heart was beating so fast.

542
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,420
Nevertheless,

543
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,140
you were kind of handsome just now.

544
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,660
You actually find me attractive,
Your Highness?

545
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,700
Judging by your face,

546
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,260
you are attractive most of the time.

547
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,580
Anyway, how did you happen to know

548
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,140
that \the numbers
on those two cards were one?

549
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,140
I did the math.

550
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,580
It's not that difficult.

551
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,140
Not that difficult?

552
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,540
I can't even remember the numbers.

553
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,060
You're smart.

554
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,980
No wonder you ranked first
in the examination.

555
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,300
Your Highness, you don't need
to learn this.

556
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,900
Your shrewdness appears
in the grand scheme of things.

557
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,500
What are you doing next?

558
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,620
Returning to the bureau?

559
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,300
What about you?

560
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,300
Are you going back?

561
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,300
Yes, I have to get ready.

562
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,100
Ya finally got us the opportunity.

563
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,740
I can't let her down.

564
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,380
I'll get changed

565
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,340
and dress up.

566
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,540
Must you go?

567
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,700
I mean

568
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,020
the Qin Family's case files...

569
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,820
I've read them.

570
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,420
Then Luo Juan

571
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,900
and the people involved in the battle
occurred in Huangping County...

572
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,980
Xun Chuan is investigating that.

573
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,860
When I meet Su Rongqing later,

574
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,100
we'll see what we can learn from him.

575
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,860
Do you have other concerns?

576
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,740
No.

577
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,220
Don't worry. I'll come home early.

578
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,900
You have to be careful too.

579
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,180
Many people in the court
are keeping an eye on you.

580
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,180
Don't worry.

581
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,580
I will be cautious.

582
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,340
May your plan go smoothly,

583
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,500
Your Highness.

584
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,900
I'll go back now. Enjoy the food.

585
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:50,660
Mr. Pei.

586
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,580
Young... Young Master!

587
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,820
What are you doing here?

588
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,540
Young Master,

589
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,740
the Pei family sent a message

590
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,500
claiming that your mother was sick.
They want you to go back.

591
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,660
Mother is sick?

592
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,860
Why wasn't I informed?

593
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,980
Right.

594
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,380
You asked me to keep a close watch

595
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,620
and I did.

596
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,340
But there was no news whatsoever.

597
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,660
The messenger said

598
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,100
that your mother intentionally
concealed her illness

599
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,220
so as not to burden you.

600
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,220
An hour ago,

601
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,500
she fainted.

602
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,780
They couldn't get a physician in.

603
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,100
I suspect someone in the family
didn't want to get her any help.

604
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:24,820
Do you see it?

605
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,420
Let's go.

606
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,180
Head to Mingyue Restaurant.
Once Her Highness is done,

607
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,620
ask her to come to the Pei's Mansion
to pick me up.

608
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,060
I... I...

609
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,740
Ask her to bring more men with her.

610
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:42,940
Okay.

611
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,500
Go now.

612
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,300
Wait.

613
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,340
Wait for her by the entrance.

614
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,900
Do not disturb Her Highness.
Do you hear me?

615
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,460
Go now.

616
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,700
Yes.

617
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,500
Ronghua, you mean

618
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,860
Her Highness asked you
to invite me to a private meeting?

619
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,820
To be precise,

620
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,100
she asked Shangguan Ya
to make the request.

621
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,860
And

622
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,140
Pei Wenxuan is aware of this?

623
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,700
It seems like it.

624
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,180
Everyone alleges

625
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,060
that Princess Pingyue
betrothed Pei Wenxuan

626
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,300
out of convenience.

627
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,900
It seems like

628
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,980
that is the truth.

629
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,060
I think

630
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,660
you can meet Her Highness.

631
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,580
All right.

632
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,300
Please tell Her Highness

633
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,620
that I'll be there.

634
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,540
What are you doing here?

635
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,220
I am here to escort you.

636
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,140
You just don't want to be left out.

637
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:58,860
What do you think?

638
00:29:59,180 --> 00:29:59,860
Do I look good?

639
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,580
Yes,

640
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,460
just a bit too formal.

641
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,100
It shows a sense of oppression.

642
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,540
It seems like

643
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,820
you are condescending.

644
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,420
For this meeting,

645
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,540
it's best to present yourself

646
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,980
as equals.

647
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,660
But I am a princess.

648
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,780
No matter how I dress,
I can't hide my temperament.

649
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:26,940
Your Highness,

650
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,340
I may give you some advice.

651
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,620
Let's start with your way of speaking.

652
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,300
When you talk to a man,

653
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,780
avoid speaking in a bossy manner.

654
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:39,620
Do not move.

655
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,540
That's it.

656
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,020
You always lift your chin
when you speak.

657
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,500
That's what a princess does.

658
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,860
But for ordinary women,

659
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,860
we lower our heads

660
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,700
and brows.

661
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,740
And when we speak,

662
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,460
- we do this.
- We do this.

663
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,700
I know,

664
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,340
but that's not me.

665
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,260
Your Highness...

666
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:01,860
Enough.

667
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,260
Your Highness.

668
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:05,900
Your Highness.

669
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:07,860
Rongqing,

670
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,300
I can't walk further.

671
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,300
You've been browsing for an hour,

672
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,500
and you still can't make up your mind.

673
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,500
It's rare for Her Highness
to invite me for a meal.

674
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,100
I must pick a fitting gift
for the occasion.

675
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,780
I have an idea.

676
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,220
What about food?

677
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,980
The lamb stew
from Hongqing Restaurant is good.

678
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,420
It comes with a fancy package too.

679
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,580
No.

680
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,020
Food is too common.

681
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,220
It lacks sincerity.

682
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,740
Rongqing,

683
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,020
what about an accessory?

684
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,260
You can't go wrong with a hairpin.

685
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,060
An accessory?

686
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,180
No.

687
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,100
Her Highness will refuse
an expensive gift.

688
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,940
Besides, it is inappropriate for me

689
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,700
to give her accessories
with my current identity.

690
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,140
Sirs!

691
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,500
Come take a look.

692
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,900
Fresh flowers I plucked this morning.

693
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:00,980
Take a look.

694
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,220
Pick anything you like.

695
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,020
Rongqing,

696
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,100
I remember you said

697
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,500
that Her Highness
loved peonies the most.

698
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,300
For a lady of such mesmerizing beauty,

699
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,700
only a peony can match her charm.

700
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:16,780
All right.

701
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:17,740
I'll take this one.

702
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:18,660
Sure.

703
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,100
Greetings, Grandfather.

704
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,380
Greetings, Mother.

705
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,380
Greetings to all.

706
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,460
I was told Mother fell ill,

707
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,740
so I rushed back.

708
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,340
It seems like

709
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,900
you are fine, Mother.

710
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,100
I...

711
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,420
I summoned you here.

712
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,460
I knew you wouldn't heed my call,

713
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,420
so I asked your mother
to bring you here.

714
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,060
Why would you say that, Grandfather?

715
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,700
If the elderly in the family needs me,

716
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,260
I wouldn't dare not to come back.

717
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,100
However,
lying about my mother falling sick

718
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,620
has made me terribly worried.

719
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,500
If you were truly
concerned about this family,

720
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,660
you wouldn't have urged Her Highness

721
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,860
to do those obstructive things.

722
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,700
I do not understand,

723
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,460
Second Uncle.

724
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,340
You asked Her Highness to establish

725
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,060
the Inspectorate Office, didn't you?

726
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,900
I see it now.

727
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,340
You brought everyone here
for this matter.

728
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,820
Second Uncle, you may direct

729
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,860
your dissatisfaction to Her Highness.

730
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,500
Wenxuan,

731
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,740
you are the Prince Consort.

732
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,860
She may be reckless

733
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,380
but you cannot afford that.

734
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,940
Other families have come
and questioned us.

735
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,860
In the past, she couldn't
care less about the state affairs.

736
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,420
After she betrothed you,
she meddled in everyone's affairs.

737
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,140
This must have something
to do with you.

738
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,260
Even if we could believe you,

739
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,060
no one from the outside would.

740
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,100
So,

741
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,020
what do you want me to do?

742
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,060
Wenxuan.

743
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,500
Listen to us.

744
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,580
Talk to Her Highness and tell her

745
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,100
not to be enemies
with the noble families.

746
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,580
If our family is implicated,

747
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,740
Her Highness will remain untouched,

748
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,500
but our family will...

749
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,460
Our family will what?

750
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,260
Mother,

751
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,780
how could you believe
whatever they told you?

752
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,380
I...

753
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,860
What do you want me to do?

754
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,660
Go back

755
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,100
and tell Her Highness
to stay out of the affairs.

756
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:10,780
Just...

757
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:11,900
Just...

758
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,580
Just forget about the Qin Family's case.

759
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,540
So, it's all about
the Qin Family's case, isn't it?

760
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,020
I see.

761
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,620
Anything else?

762
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,180
You...

763
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,740
What is

764
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,540
that attitude?

765
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,460
Do you have no respect for me?

766
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,300
I do.

767
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:40,980
But do you?

768
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,180
I...

769
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,020
My sister-in-law,

770
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,580
look at your child.

771
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,100
You must discipline him.

772
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,620
He... He...

773
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,180
How dare you defy us?

774
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,660
Punish him. Punish him.

775
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,260
Someone!

776
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,020
Punish me?

777
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,620
Mother.

778
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,740
Was it that they told you
that by punishing me,

779
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,500
the other noble families
would be appeased,

780
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,300
and that Her Highness would back off?

781
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,900
In the future, if I ever
urge Her Highness to do anything,

782
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,260
you'll punish me again,

783
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,180
until I cease.

784
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:19,740
Is that so?

785
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:30,500
I knew this would happen.

786
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,860
I just didn't expect you...

787
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,100
to follow through
with their plan, Mother.

788
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,100
Don't just stand there.

789
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,380
Get him

790
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,700
and punish him.

791
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,660
Wenxuan.

792
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,580
I...

793
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,180
I...

794
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,260
I know you cannot bear
to see this scene.

795
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,580
You may turn around.

796
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,140
Stop!

797
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,100
My child...

798
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,500
just admit that you are wrong.

799
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,860
I am not wrong.

800
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,620
Not wrong?

801
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:45,900
Come on, Father.

802
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,860
Hit him until he admits that he's wrong.

803
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,660
Continue.

804
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,740
Her Highness was right downstairs,

805
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,620
but she had to leave
because something came up.

806
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,100
Go and tell Mr. Su

807
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,100
so that he won't wait in vain
and get mad at Her Highness.

808
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,700
Quickly.

809
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,180
My poor brother.

810
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,700
No one has ever

811
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,460
taken him for a fool like this.

812
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,140
Perhaps

813
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,020
I should tell him the truth.

814
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:10,540
Wait.

815
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,060
I'll dine with you three times.

816
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,580
You can pick the restaurant.

817
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,500
Deal.

818
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,660
Young Master told me
not to disturb you, Your Highness.

819
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,420
Where were you doing?

820
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,700
I was waiting for you.

821
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,900
Young Master told me
to tell you after the meal.

822
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,740
Enough.

823
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,180
Your Highness.

824
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,140
They won't let us in.

825
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:33,700
Move aside.

826
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,380
Barge in.

827
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,180
Let's go.

828
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,940
Master!

829
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,020
Bad news.

830
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,100
Her Highness barged in.

831
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:09,860
Xun Chuan.

832
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,780
Why is the Prince Consort kneeling?

833
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,380
Help him up.

834
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,100
Yes.

835
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,140
Your Highness.

836
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,980
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

837
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,220
I have some harsh words to say

838
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,380
in front of the ancestors

839
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,100
of your family today.

840
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,500
Your Highness,

841
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,580
perhaps you can keep...

842
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,700
I was having a meal.

843
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,620
And you tricked my consort
into serving a punishment here.

844
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,620
May I remind you
that he is the Prince Consort

845
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,740
and a member of the imperial family?

846
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,780
You've humiliated him like this.

847
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,020
Have you ever thought
about the imperial family's reputation?

848
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,940
Who hit him?

849
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,220
Who sanctioned the punishment?

850
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,060
Come clean at once.

851
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,540
Your Highness,

852
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,500
I know you want

853
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,100
to protect your consort.

854
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,460
But Wenxuan is part of the Pei family.

855
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,180
In this nation, being a prince consort

856
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,660
doesn't mean he is not part
of his paternal family.

857
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,060
I am handling a familial matter.

858
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,940
So I pray for your understanding,
Your Highness.

859
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,580
Understanding?

860
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,540
For what?

861
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,140
For you being ungrateful
and shortsighted?

862
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,180
I know very well

863
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,500
why you brought him here.

864
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,620
You believed that punishing him

865
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,780
could appease other noble families

866
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,500
and issue a warning to me

867
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,140
so that I wouldn't establish
the Inspectorate Office.

868
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,620
You want me to back off.

869
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,620
Your family

870
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,740
is the new rising family
in the imperial court.

871
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,580
Pei Lixian,
you are the Vice Minister of Revenue.

872
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,100
Pei Liming,
you are the Vice Minister of Justice.

873
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,300
Your other kins can also be found
in other civil functions.

874
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,260
Does that make you think
you're part of the noble families?

875
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,220
They want you to give me trouble,

876
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,860
and you're eager to prove your worth.

877
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,460
If I may recount your origin,

878
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,900
the Pei family came from a humble origin
in Luzhou.

879
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,540
Before this generation,

880
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,060
your ancestors had never
risen above a fifth-ranked official.

881
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,180
Pei Wenxuan's father, Pei Lizhi,

882
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,460
brought your kins
to Huajing from Luzhou,

883
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,740
promoting you into the higher echelon.

884
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,780
He died not long ago,

885
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,580
yet you're already bullying
his son and his wife.

886
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,100
Your Highness,

887
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,380
your criticism

888
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,260
is unjustly harsh.

889
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,300
Unjustly harsh?

890
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,100
Pei Wenxuan was the top one
in the Royal Selection.

891
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,260
He is more than capable

892
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,460
of occupying an important position.

893
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,380
If he hadn't betrothed me,

894
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:38,780
he would've still been

895
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,700
a lowly official
who's inferior to a prison guard.

896
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,580
What did you do?

897
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,740
You used the excuse
that a scion of a noble family

898
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,100
must start from the ground

899
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,940
to silence his mother.

900
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,380
When he was sick,

901
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,140
you actively stopped him
from seeing a physician.

902
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,860
When he needed money
to interact with other officials,

903
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,100
you made his life more difficult.

904
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,220
He works for the imperial court

905
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,900
in hopes of escaping this predicament,

906
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,260
yet you continue to impede him.

907
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,220
He can turn a blind eye to you,

908
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:08,860
but don't ever think I will do the same!

909
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,580
I want to establish
the Inspectorate Office,

910
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,100
and so does His Majesty.

911
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,860
Even if you kill him today,

912
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,100
His Majesty or I

913
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,660
will not stop.

914
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,380
Remember

915
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:38,020
your root.

916
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,140
Don't get too complacent

917
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,420
in your lofty position.

918
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:43,780
Your Highness,

919
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,700
even though you are a princess,

920
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,780
you are nonetheless a junior member
in this family.

921
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,580
Should I inform His Majesty

922
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,940
about your unruly behavior

923
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,060
in my family's

924
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,860
ancestral shrine?

925
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,420
Who hit him?

926
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:05,300
Xun Chuan.

927
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:06,580
Yes, Your Highness?

928
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:07,860
Break his arm.

929
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:08,620
Yes.

930
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,500
No.

931
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:11,540
You mustn't do this.

932
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,140
I'll reiterate this.

933
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:16,740
Pei Wenxuan

934
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,980
is the Prince Consort,

935
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,100
my husband.

936
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,140
If this family doesn't like him,

937
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,100
hurry up

938
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,460
and expel him already.

939
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,660
I'll give him a family.

940
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,460
If you want to keep him,

941
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,220
then, from now on,

942
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,380
treat him

943
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,700
like how you will treat me.

944
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,060
As for you, Mrs. Wen...

945
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,580
if you do not know

946
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:48,460
how to love

947
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:52,180
or protect your child,

948
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,220
please stay in the family hall
for worshipping the Immortals

949
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,620
and mourn for your husband forever.

950
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,260
Pei Wenxuan has a new home.

951
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,060
Someone will protect and love him.

952
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,660
If you can't care for him as a mother,

953
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,660
then at least don't hurt him.

954
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:09,940
He can allow you to do so.

955
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,700
But I won't.

956
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,100
Am I clear?

957
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:35,140
Let's go home.

958
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:37,580
Come on.

959
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:38,700
