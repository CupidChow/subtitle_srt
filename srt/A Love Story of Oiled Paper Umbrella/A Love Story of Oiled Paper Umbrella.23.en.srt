[A Love Story of Oiled Paper Umbrella]

2
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:39,200
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,270
Following the destiny and the times,

4
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,580
behold the message of the Emperor.

5
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:48,550
The Demon Queen, Meng Xizhou, has traveled south to provide disaster relief and aid the poor,

6
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,830
achieving outstanding merits.

7
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,670
I hereby decree that she shall be

8
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,680
the Imperial Advisor of Dazhou.

9
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,009
Thus, I declare.

10
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,130
I thank Your Majesty for your grace.

11
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,539
Your Majesty,

12
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,140
even if Meng Xizhou

13
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,340
has good intentions,

14
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,430
she is

15
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,430
still a demon, after all.

16
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,230
To appoint her as the Imperial Advisor,

17
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:17,510
I oppose.

18
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:18,910
Indeed.

19
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,470
The Demon Queen's power is boundless,

20
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,100
yet she's willing to submit

21
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,310
to the human race.

22
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,840
Can't you see

23
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,829
her sincerity?

24
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,390
Could it be because

25
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,870
she wants to obtain the Scroll of Mountains and Seas

26
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,220
to save all the demons?

27
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,750
What's wrong with opening the Scroll of Mountains and Seas?

28
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,800
Humans have good and bad among them,

29
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,910
The same goes for demons.

30
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:49,750
Her subjects

31
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,610
should be under her rule.

32
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:57,400
That must not happen!

33
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,710
Your Majesty, that absolutely cannot be!

34
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,350
Your Majesty, that absolutely cannot be!

35
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,450
What exactly do I need to do

36
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,010
for you to eliminate

37
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,200
the hatred towards demons?

38
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,620
Haven't I said that it is my wish to achieve the equality

39
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,820
between humans and demons?

40
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,590
None of you support me.

41
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,190
What do I need you for?

42
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,829
Unless…

43
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,430
the Demon Queen is willing to marry Your Majesty.

44
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,550
Only in that case

45
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,530
will her subjects

46
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,760
not dare to provoke our Dazhou.

47
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,390
That's unacceptable!

48
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,750
Her marriage

49
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,540
is naturally her own decision.

50
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,200
If on the wedding day,

51
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,520
Your Majesty,

52
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,510
you're willing to open the Scroll of Mountains and Seas for me,

53
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,940
I'm willing to marry you.

54
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:47,190
♫The wind hesitates, not daring to smooth the furrowed brow♫

55
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,870
Goddess,

56
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,320
you know my feelings.

57
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,530
♫The rain hesitates, reluctant to burden the tear-streaked eyes beneath the umbrella♫

58
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,550
You don't need to feel burdened.

59
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,680
I am the ruler of Dazhou.

60
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,670
Even if it's not for my own feelings,

61
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,450
♫The closer you are to me, the clearer the pain becomes♫

62
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,480
both officially and personally,

63
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,420
I will always treat you well.

64
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,070
Meng Xizhou.

65
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,240
♫The most painful separation means you can't even miss her♫

66
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,320
You have lost your soul.

67
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,930
Your heart is now a wasteland.

68
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,870
Only obsession remains.

69
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,670
This is your only chance

70
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,720
♫In silence, the world's grudges weave a web of entanglement♫

71

72
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,350
Don't miss it again.

73
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,080
♫Under the clouds, the smoke from cooking rises and spreads freely♫

74
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,270
♫It's the love doomed by fate♫

75
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,230
Your Majesty, just tell me

76
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,430
if you're willing.

77
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:27,160
♫Under the umbrella, your profile is gently framed by the soft strands of your hair♫

78

79

00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:49,220
Choose an auspicious day

85
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,600
for me to marry Meng Xizhou

86

Ten thousand taels of silver.

130
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,360
Sixty fine horses.

131
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,870
Come on. Put them here.

132
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,910
A hundred gold and silver tea canisters.

133
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:13,660

134
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,230

Here.

136
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,390
A thousand bolts of brocade.

137
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,390
Twenty sets of armor.

138
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,590
Come, move this way.

139
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,590
Twenty pieces of jade.

140
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,110
Uncle Nan.

141
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:33,870
Dan Qian,

142
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,240
why did you

143
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,750
come with Uncle Nan?

144
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,110
Chirp,

145
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,630
I don't want to hide this from you anymore.

146
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,990
Actually, on the day Father turned into a demon,

147
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,550
it was Uncle Nan who took me in at the umbrella shop,

148
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,990
not the Emperor.

149
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:51,670
Uncle Nan,

150
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,230
why was it you?

151
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,990
Because of Yi.

152
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,550
That day at the Demon Locking Pagoda,

153
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,510
he risked his life to save you.

154
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,520
Wasn't I saved by the Emperor?

155
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,600
Yi begged the Emperor

156
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,050
not to tell you.

157
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,060
I know

158
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,670
you hate him.

159
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:25,910
Indeed,

160
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,940
he did kill your adoptive father.

161
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,590
A pair of white jade combs with floral patterns.

162
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,910
A pair of ebony carved and embroidered screens.

163
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,670
Chirp,

164
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,990
the Demon Queen's responsibilities are indeed important,

165
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,070
but the happiness of His Majesty,

166
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,790
Nan Fengyi, and you

167
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,380
is also important.

168
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,060
I hope you'll consider it carefully.

169
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:51,910
If...

170
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:52,700
Unfortunately,

171
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,290
there are no "ifs."

172
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,590
Make sure everything is in place.

173
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,540
Indeed.

174
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,140
In this world,

175
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,020
there are no "ifs."

176
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,260
Why do I feel

177
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,750
so much pain inside,

178
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,780
yet I can't shed a tear?

179
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,790
Chirp.

180
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,150
Xi.

181
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,110
You gave your soul to Nan Fengyi.

182
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:52,990
Gradually,

183
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,300
your joy,

184
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:55,270
anger,

185
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:56,270
sorrow,

186
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,150
and happiness

187
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,340
will all be borne by him on your behalf.

188
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,870
You can't cry now

189
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,620
because at this moment,

190
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,790
your tears

191
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,510
are in his eyes.

192
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,860
My tears

193
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,150
are in his eyes?

194
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,870
The railing twists twelve times,

195
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,420
With hands hanging down, as bright as jade.

196
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,420
The curtain rolls up, the sky rises high,

197
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,500
And the sea waters sway in a green expanse.

198
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,050
♫The wind hesitates, not daring to smooth the furrowed brow♫

199
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,790
Master,

200
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,410
didn't you say

201
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,380
♫The rain hesitates, reluctant to burden the tear-streaked eyes beneath the umbrella♫

202
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,150
that when I got married,

203
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,280
you would make an umbrella for me?

204
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,310
♫The closer you are to me, the clearer the pain becomes♫

205
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,130
Then, I

206
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,070
will fulfill that promise now.

207
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:36,100
♫The most painful separation means you can't even miss her♫

208
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:41,580
♫In silence, the world's grudges weave a web of entanglement♫

209
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:45,940
♫Under the clouds, the smoke from cooking rises and spreads freely♫

210
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:50,130
♫It's the love doomed by fate♫

211
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,270
This umbrella is beautiful.

212
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,020
♫Under the umbrella, your profile is gently framed by the soft strands of your hair♫

213
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,420
However,

214
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,640
what is the meaning

215
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,860
of the painting on it?

216
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,330
♫Should my heart belong to someone for ten thousand years♫

217
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:04,080
♫Through endless lifetimes, softly and quietly, it flows on♫

218
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,630
♫I won't lose you♫

219
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,510
♫I'll sacrifice myself to help you♫

220
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:17,800
♫With a single lamp and a thousand books, alone I'm restless through the night♫

221
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:24,430
♫Give me a fleeting moment of rain, to be held captive by your side♫

222
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,540
The sea dreams vast and endless,

223
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,950
Your sorrow mirrors my own distress.

224
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,150
The southern wind knows my heart's plea,

225
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:37,910
And carries dreams

226
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,360
to Xizhou for me.

227
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:58,080
♫The wind hesitates, not daring to smooth the furrowed brow♫

228
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,410
♫The rain hesitates, reluctant to burden the tear-streaked eyes beneath the umbrella♫

229
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:12,340
♫The closer you are to me, the clearer the pain becomes♫

♫Under the clouds, the smoke from cooking rises and spreads freely♫

Your humble servant

246
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,780
humbly welcomes Your Majesty, the Empress.

247
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:34,540
Qian,

248
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,180
I'm leaving.

249
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,030
Uncle Nan.

250
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:45,690
I'm counting on you.

251
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,950
Off we set!

252
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,420
Lift the sedan chair!

253
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,830
Chirp!

254
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,140
Chirp!

255
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,370
Chirp!

256
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:04,070
[Taiji Gate]

257
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:48,820
Your Majesty,

258
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,190
I've

259
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,270
escorted Her Majesty back to the palace.

260
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,390
Thank you, Nan.

261
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,590
You may all rise.

262
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,960
Your Majesty,

263
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,030
I

264
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,350
will escort you to the Taiji Palace.

265
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,860
I promised you.

266
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,110
Today,

267
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,940
I will return the Scroll of Mountains and Seas to you.

268
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,790
Thank you, Your Majesty.

269
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,220
Nan.

270
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,540
I am here, Your Majesty.

271
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,150
Where is the Scroll of Mountains and Seas?

272
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:23,990
Help the Empress

273
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,340
release the ten thousand demons.

274
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,660
I was worried

275
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,940
someone might have ill intentions toward the Scroll of Mountains and Seas,

276
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,260
so I hid it

277
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,500
inside this umbrella.

278
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:34,430
Indeed, a clever move.

279
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:35,590
Let me see it.

280
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,540
When you get married,

281
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,510
I will make you an umbrella

282
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,250
to marry you.

283
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,870
Master, are you that confident

284
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,470
I will marry you?

285
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,390
Seems that I don't behave well enough.

286
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,850
I have to work harder in the future.

287
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,150
Do you still want to learn talismanic formations?

288
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,070
Of course.

289
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,350
Then, be my disciple.

290
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,670
Really?

291
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,260
Me?

292
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,070
Can I really be your disciple?

293
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:46,830
I

294
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,230
will open the map for Your Majesty.

295
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,470
Big Dipper Seven Stars Sword Technique, break!

296
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:18,870
Quick, look!

297
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:19,910
Look!

298
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,470
Withdraw!

299
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,110
Father,

300
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,340
Mother,

301
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,540
I did it!

302
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,070
All demons, heed my command!

303
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,510
The Emperor of the human race

304
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,440
granted the azure clouds to our demon race，

305
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,050
excluding any subjugated territories.

306
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,040
Mountains and rivers serve as the boundary between inner and outer lands.

307
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,830
In the remote and isolated domain,

308
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,390
laws and governance differ from those of Dazhou.

309
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,470
Goddess.

310
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,220
Goddess?

311
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,070
Goddess!

312
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:28,910
Quickly escort the Emperor away!

313
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,220
Goddess!

314
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:29,570
Your Majesty.

315
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,390
Hurry, Your Majesty!

316
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:30,710
Goddess!

317
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,060
Run!

318
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:31,830
Hurry!

319
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:32,830
Goddess!

320
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:34,860
Run!

321
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:35,900
Run quickly!

322
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:36,830
Goddess!

323
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:37,910
Help!

324
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:40,910
Chirp.

325
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:41,710
Chirp.

326
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:42,860
What's wrong with you?

327
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,520
I'm not your Chirp.

328
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,870
My name is

329
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,550
Ren

330
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:52,870
Guang.

331
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,590
You…

332
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,700
How did you come out of the dream?

333
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,050
Xi.

334
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,030
What are you doing?

335
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,570
I'm using the realm of bliss

336
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,670
to exchange obsessions with the human race.

337
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,590
It helps our physical bodies

338
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,930
gain more powerful strength.

339
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,830
Why do we need more powerful strength?

340
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,260
With just this little power,

341
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,990
how can we eliminate all of humanity?

342
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,150
Chirp.

343
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,380
I'm different from you,

344
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:40,810
Miao Yun,

345
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,830
or Situ Hanshan.

346
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,190
My wish is

347
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:47,870
that in this world,

348
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,060
only our demon race exists!

349
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,310
Not a single

350
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,580
living human can remain.

351
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,230
Have you gone mad?

352
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,850
Your mother

353
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,150
was too soft-hearted.

354
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:06,060
Her mind was full of petty love affairs.

355
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,510
In the end, she was

356
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,750
killed by the one she loved most.

357
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,670
To think I loved her so deeply,

358
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,110
it's utterly ridiculous!

359
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,310
Utterly ridiculous.

360
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,320
Since your mother's death,

361
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,510
I have sworn

362
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,410
to raise you

363
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,510
into the strongest Demon Lord

364
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,100
to avenge her

365
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,540
and eliminate all future threats!

366
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:38,670
So,

367
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,460
since I was young,

368
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,830
you've been

369
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,420
constantly teaching me in my dreams,

370
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,430
just so that one day,

371
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,990
you could use me!

372
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,780
Chirp,

373
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,870
we are one, aren't we?

374
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,190
Being tied to you

375
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,460
simply disgusts me!

376
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,110
Disgust?

377
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,870
Don't you think this is

378
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:12,590
the greatest blessing I'm bestowing upon the human race?

379
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,230
To exchange

380
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,590
the desires and troubles that torment them

381
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,620
for an eternal immersion

382
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,590
in the illusion of their cravings.

383
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,190
Listen.

384
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,340
Listen to these laughs.

385
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,070
I've made it!

386
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,670
I've made it!

387
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,830
They're expressing their gratitude to me.

388
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,140
If they knew

389
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,430
that this illusory happiness

390
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,510
would soon

391
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,070
cost them their lives,

392
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,710
I don't believe they would be willing

393
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,190
to make this exchange with you, you devil.

394
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,340
Chirp,

395
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,230
are you still so naive?

396
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,860
It doesn't matter.

397
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,350
Anyway,

398
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,790
your physical body

399
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,100
is already mine.

400
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:06,860
Xi.

401
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,340
Xi!

402
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,060
What should I do?

403
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,220
What should I do?

404
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:12,880
Xi!

405
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,350
No!

406
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,790
Your mother was useless.

407
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,340
I didn't expect you to disappoint me, too.

408
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,590
Then, I'll take your place

409
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,980
and eliminate all of humanity!

410
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,100
Stop it right now!

411
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,150
Come on, come on.

412
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,670
So much money!

413
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,270
Good wine.

414
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,140
Don't go easy on me anymore.

415
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,190
Alright.

416
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:15,870
Miss,

417
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,020
wake up.

418
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,900
Everything you see is fake.

419
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:20,550
Miss.

420
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:21,750
Miss.

421
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:23,870
Miss.

422
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,980
-Wake up!
-Father!

423
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:26,660
Father.

424
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,460
Old man?

425
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,590
Du Fenglei!

426
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,780
Stop fooling around.

427
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,140
Come out now.

428
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,500
I'm not fighting with you anymore.

429
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:40,980
Father!

430
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,230
Father!

431
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,070
Father!

432
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,880
Father!

[Quan Yanhe, Leader of the Dog Clan]

434
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,340
Guo Ji?

435
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,710
Aren't you dead?

436
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:02,790
I...

437
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,780
If you bring that knife down,

438
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,420
I'll really die.

439
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:10,940
What are you?

440
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,180
I am the leader of the Dog Clan.

441
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,390
I just came out of the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

442
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,760
If I didn't

443
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,420
bring you out of the illusion,

444
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,990
you would have died in there.

445
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:23,750
So, you're a dog demon.

446
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,020
What's going on now?

447
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,630
They…

448
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:32,000
seem to have been put under a spell

449
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,070
and entered an illusion.

450
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,510
-Look at them.
-The illusion…

451
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:36,330
Why are you unaffected?

452
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,630
I'm a demon!

453
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,980
This spell

454
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,070
seems to be a blissful illusionary technique targeting only your human race.

455
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,420
I just saved you,

456
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,630
and you didn't even say thank you.

457
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,750
You humans are so impolite.

458
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:57,830
Thanks.

459
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:58,830
Doggy.

460
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,180
Wake them all up quickly.

461
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,070
What's with this "doggy" nonsense?

462
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,260
My name is Quan Yanhe.

463
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,380
Or,

464
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,170
you can call me Lord Yanhe.

465
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:09,950
Stop wasting time.

466
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,500
Are you going to help or not?

467
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,740
My magical powers are weak.

468
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,310
When I saved you earlier,

469
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,790
I've already used them all up.

470
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:21,860
You, a leader of the Dog Clan,

471
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,190
have such low magical powers?

472
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:25,860
Oh no,

473
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,030
I need to go protect the Emperor.

474
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,630
Where are you going?

475
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,100
Master.

476
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,500
Master!

477
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,670

is trapped in the illusion,

00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,020
unwilling to wake up.

00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,910
I transferred my soul to you,

565
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,070
while my body

566
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,040
was possessed by Ren Guang's remnant soul,

567
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,720
which caused today's disaster.

568
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,460
It's too late.

569
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,440
Now, only if my three souls reunite

570
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,790
can I break all the illusions

571
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,030
and wake everyone up.

572
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,020
Nan Fengyi,

573
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:23,660
wake up quickly!

574
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,190
So,

575
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,060
your living soul is inside me?

576
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,750
Yes.

577
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:28,830
Please wake up quickly!

578
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:29,510
There's no time left.

579
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,180
Hurry!

580
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:37,870
Chirp.

581
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:41,710
Nan Fengyi.

582
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:44,700
Guo Ji?

583
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:45,800
He is not Guo Ji.

584
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:46,740
He is a dog demon.

585
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,020
Do you know what happened?

586
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:49,590
Our human race

587
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,390
has been trapped in a realm of bliss.

588
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,430
What's going on?

589
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,470
It's a long story.

590
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,500
Chirp has been possessed by an evil demon.

591
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,750
He created a realm of bliss.

592
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,100
Then, by consuming the obsessions of humans,

593
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,740
he will ultimately destroy the human race.

594
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,500
Is there any way to break this now?

595
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:09,870
I have

596
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,540
a strand of Chirp's soul with me.

597
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,090
Only when the three souls are reunited

598
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,540
can Chirp break the realm of bliss

599
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,150
and awaken everyone.

600
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,510
I know how to do this.

601
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,260
Nan Fengyi,

602
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,830
have you really thought it through?

603
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,750
Once the Soul-locking Formation extracts your soul,

604
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,930
you will inevitably be severely weakened.

605
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,990
My life is coming to an end anyway.

606
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,220
Might as well make the most of it.

607
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:36,780
Well,

608
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:37,830
I'll begin, then.

609
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,860
You stand guard.

610
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:02,150
Nan Fengyi!

611
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,230
Don't worry about me.

612
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,340
Quickly go find Chirp.

613
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,710
What's going on?

614
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:24,300
This...

615
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:26,330
My souls have returned to its rightful place.

616
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,140
From now on,

617
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:32,060
you can no longer control my body.

618
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,350
It's time…

619
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,570
to end all of this.

620
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,660
Here, let me hug you one more time.

621
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:02,030
Yaoniang,

622
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:03,230
this...

623
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:06,630
Yaoniang.

624
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,400
Yaoniang!

625
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,050
Yaoniang…

626
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:19,140
I don't want you to go.

627
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,500
Come back!

628
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:24,750
Hui Fang.

629
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,430
Hui Fang!

630
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:27,830
Hui Fang!

631
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,880
Hui Fang, don't go! Hui Fang!

632
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,390
This can't be fake.

633
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,110
It's me.

634
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:40,190
I've dispelled the illusions for all of you.

635
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,800
That was the plot of the shadow demon, Ren Guang,

636
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,420
to bring death upon your human race.

637
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,880
Who asked you to break my illusion?

638
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:47,670
Curse you, Demon Queen!

639
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,110
Who told you to meddle in our affairs?

640
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,130
Give me back my illusion!

641
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:51,700
Give it back to me!

642
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,630
Get out of here!

643
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,950
You stinking Demon Queen!

644
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,190
Who told you to interfere?

645
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:55,950
By what right?

646
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:56,740
How dare you!

647
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,300
Give it back to me! Give it back to me!

648
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,150
Give it back to us!

649
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,350
I want to go back!

650
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,540
You'd rather die in the realm of bliss

651
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,020
than return to reality?
