[Nan's Umbrella Shop]

4
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,110
I didn't expect the umbrella you made

5
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,920
would be so beautiful.

6
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,030
When you get married,

7
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,580
I will make an umbrella

8
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,910
to marry you.

9
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,110
Master, are you that confident

10
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,230
I will marry you?

11
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,270
Seems that I don't behave well.

12
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,980
I have to work hard in the future.

13
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,460
Chirp.

14
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,800
It's me.

15
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,840
You brat.

16
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,470
All you think about is that woman.

17
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,470
She's on your mind all the time.

18
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,790
A man will indeed fall in love with a woman when he comes of age.

19
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,260
What's wrong?

20
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,000
You seem down.

21
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,290
You trusted Chirp to His Highness.

22
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,560
Do you regret it?

23
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,990
In this world,

24
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,920
only His Highness can protect her.

25
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,560
Why would I regret it?

26
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,070
You

27
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,980
cleared the name of the Baize family,

28
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,930
having become the hero of the people.

29
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,360
But

30
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,230
it

31
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,190
is different

32
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,870
in the girl's heart.

33
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,680
I

34
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,670
don't understand

35
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,320
why you

36
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,120
would serve Her Majesty.

37
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,870
After all, His Majesty is still alive.

38
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,910
Her Majesty is a demon.

39
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,240
Then why don't you seize time to get rid of her?

40
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,030
She's a menace if you keep her!

41
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,990
Her Majesty's power is unfathomable.

42
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,060
I'm afraid she's better

43
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,270
than Situ Hanshan.

44
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,659
I suspect

45
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,270
she is the mastermind of Situ Hanshan.

46
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:42,670
Judging from my strength

47
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,260
and the strength of other demon hunters,

48
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,710
we're unable to take her down.

49
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:49,710
What should we do then?

50
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,770
We just keep her like this?

51
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,190
We just let such a strong demon

52
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,090
live in the palace?

53
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:57,950
Of course not.

54
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,390
As long as I find the Scroll of Mountains and Seas,

55
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,180
I can wipe her out.

56
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,880
All Du Yuelian and I did

57
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,080
is to protect His Majesty.

58
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,180
Isn't the Scroll of Mountains and Seas

59
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,560
in her hand?

60
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,230
It's a fake one.

61
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,070
I haven't mastered the Big Dipper Primordial Spell.

62
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,320
But when I caught Chirp,

63
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,480
the scroll was opened.

64
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,470
The strange thing is,

65
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,200
the scroll can also catch demons.

66
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,590
So I asked His Highness to swap it,

67
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,070
in case of hurting the innocent.

68
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,390
That day, Her Majesty

69
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,200
must have known

70
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,490
I knew it was a fake one.

71
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,030
Yi.

72
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,270
I used to hope

73
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,810
you can master the Big Dipper Primordial Spell

74
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,060
and get the Scroll of Mountains and Seas back.

75
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,590
But now,

76
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,630
I've changed my mind.

77
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,470
The hatred between humans and demons

78
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,970
can't be overcome by us.

79
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,270
Let's stop looking for the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

80
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,510
Let's leave these all behind.

81
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,790
For the sake of me,

82
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,350
your own uncle,

83
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,150
well,

84
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,190
this old man,

85
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,350
let's not get involved again,

86
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,150
okay?

87
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,390
It's too late.

88
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,080
You must

89
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,630
stay safe

90
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,190
and alive.

91
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,190
Can you promise me that?

92
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,950
Since you didn't say anything,

93
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:51,710
I

94
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,909
will take it

95
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,480
as a promise.

96
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,310
That tadpole kept looking for her,

97
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,150
never stopping doing so.

98
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:55,790
Then,

99
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,310
did it find its mother?

100
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,330
Why would you, an old man over 200 years old,

101
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,180
like such a childish story?

102
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,790
Are you going to tell me the story or not?

103
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:10,590
If not,

104
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,520
I won't teach you his illusionary technique.

105
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,240
You...

106
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,030
Of course,

107
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,830
the tadpole found its mother.

108
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,860
All right, stop crying.

109
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,470
You're an old man over 200 years old.

110
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,350
If you

111
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:37,990
keep crying,

112
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,919
aren't you ashamed?

113
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,909
All right. All right.

114
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,390
The puzzle

115
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,430
has been solved.

116
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,110
Goddess.

117
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,350
Goddess.

118
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:01,630
How are you doing?

119
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:02,900
Did you get hurt?

120
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,550
Iron.

121
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,640
I've solved your puzzle.

122
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,070
The Demon Queen

123
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,190
was the wife of Li Shiyi.

124
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,790
After she gave birth to a baby girl,

125
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,140
she showed the original form of Kunpeng.

126
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:29,790
In the end,

127
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,180
she was killed by Li Shiyi by mistake.

128
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:35,790
Isn't...

129
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,240
Isn't the baby girl you?

130
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,150
You are the daughter of Li Shiyi and the Demon Queen?

131
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,830
Yes.

132
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,190
I am their daughter.

133
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,110
I, the painting fanatic,

134
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,830
have

135
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,490
really been blessed.

136
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,850
Li Shiyi's daughter

137
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,830
has been sent to me.

138
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:08,660
Cut the crap.

139
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,620
Since we saved you,

140
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,600
you should find a way

141
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,670
to save my uncle.

142
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,310
What's the hurry?

143
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,950
I have something

144
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,310
to ask you.

145
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,390
The painting in your hand

146
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,870
was drawn based on the tears of the mermaid,

147
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,410
my beautiful disciple.

148
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,720
I gave it to her.

149
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,550
But why do you have it?

150
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,440
Mermaid's tears?

151
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,270
What painting?

152
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,800
Beautiful disciple?

153
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,150
Isn't this

154
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,710
the Scroll of Mountains and Seas?

155
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,580
Old man, don't open it!

156
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,870
That's the Scroll of Mountains and Seas!

157
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,670
What Scroll of Mountains and Seas?

158
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,030
How can this stupid thing

159
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,510
be compared to the Scroll of Mountains and Seas?

160
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,990
Scroll of Mountains and Seas was made with the flesh and blood of the Demon Queen.

161
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,670
And this painting

162
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,710
is just a fake one

163
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,260
I painted with the tears of the mermaid.

164
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,710
Fake one?

165
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,790
I drew it myself.

166
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,750
Of course, I know.

167
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,830
Then who is

168
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,390
the beautiful disciple

169
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,480
you mentioned?

170
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,660
Her nickname is Miao Yun.

171
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,950
She's now the Empress of Dazhou.

172
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:38,850
Miao Yun?

173
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,390
Miao Yun is a mermaid demon?

174
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,440
She fooled all of us

175
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,630
with this fake painting.

176
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,380
Mermaid demon?

177
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,990
Why couldn't I recognize her with my Demon-Recognizing Pupils?

178
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,140
Iron,

179
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:51,910
do you know this?

180
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,750
Maroon lip balm.

181
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,700
Of course.

182
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,950
This is the famous imperial beeswax

183
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,310
in Xizhou.

184
00:11:58,910 --> 00:11:59,990
I even used it

185
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,890
to develop an illusionary technique.

186
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,510
Illusionary technique?

187
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,950
What kind of illusionary technique?

188
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,190
This beeswax

189
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,820
has another name,

190
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,270
called The Kiss of Death.

191
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,710
If a woman kisses someone with some of it applied to her lips,

192
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,120
he'll transform into a demonic form

193
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,670
in one or two days,

194
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,470
without being aggressive.

195
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,310
But

196
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,390
this trick

197
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,310
can only remain effective for seven days.

198
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,270
After seven days,

199
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,150
when the illusionary technique is invalid,

200
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,150
he'll return to his original appearance.

201
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,240
Those from the Xizhou Acrobatics Troupe

202
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,230
always asked me to make it for them.

203
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,150
The Kiss of Death.

204
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,190
In other words,

205
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,260
the sea demons were actually humans?

206
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,500
If so,

207
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,670
from the appearance of the first sea demon

208
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,550
to the demon slaughter action of the Celestial Master's Mansion,

209
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,430
there was only one day left

210
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,110
for them to get their human forms back.

211
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,070
Just one day.

212
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,390
Just by waiting for another day,

213
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,870
I could have stopped Nan Fengyi from killing Uncle Wu.

214
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,630
I found many painters to make comparisons.

215
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,880
This Scroll of Mountains and Seas

216
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,750
is proven to be painted by His Highness.

217
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,590
So,

218
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,910
what's the use of you

219
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,050
keeping your mouth shut?

220
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,470
His Highness stole the Scroll of Mountains and Seas!

221
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,170
Where did he go?

222
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,870
He went to Xizhou

223
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,390
to find his uncle.

224
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:28,910
What?

225
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:31,710
Go.

226
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,310
Get His Highness and the scroll back.

227
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,830
I'll do it right away.

228
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:36,840
Wait.

229
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,470
Calm down, Your Majesty.

230
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,470
His Highness's uncle has military power.

231
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,060
Since His Highness has gone to find him,

232
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,530
if we make any move,

233
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,950
we will alert them.

234
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,870
Baize Yi.

235
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,870
His Highness left with the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

236
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,250
Yet you didn't know it at all?

237
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,730
Of course, I didn't.

238
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,680
Are you gonna save your uncle or not?

239
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,190
I...

240
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,390
Of course.

241
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,190
Of course.

242
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,430
Go.

243
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,430
Remember,

244
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,130
don't reveal your identity.

245
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,150
Hanshan, Zhai Yue is missing.

246
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,430
Princess, I'm back.

247
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,470
How would I become a woman?

248
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,660
What happened?

249
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:55,710
Zhai Yue!

250
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,390
Run!

251
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:57,710
Zhai Yue?

252
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:58,670
Yun,

253
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,430
you go first.

254
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,840
I'm now in Aunt Zhai Yue's body.

255
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,590
Let's go together.

256
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,350
Yun,

257
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,550
take Zhai Yue away.

258
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:03,980
No.

259
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,300
I don't want to be apart from you.

260
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,600
You're the princess of the merfolk.

261
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,710
I can't let anything happen to you! Leave now!

262
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,560
I don't want to leave you.

263
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,550
You two...

264
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,870
I can't bear being without you.

265
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,110
Stop!

266
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,350
What a beautiful voice.

267
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,830
Go and check out

268
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,350
who was singing.

269
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,750
Who was singing just now?

270
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,750
Fa...

271
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:46,790
Your Majesty.

272
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,110
Yes.

273
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,070
I'm Aunt Zhai Yue now.

274
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,710
I was singing.

275
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,070
My name is Miao Yun.

276
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,070
I've been separated from my brother for days.

277
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,590
I'm homeless

278
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,270
and have lost in this forest.

279
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:02,750
You said you were not gonna leave Situ Hanshan

280
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,130
on the beach just now.

281
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,580
Now he's become your brother.

282
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,670
So I sang to let out emotions.

283
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,950
I didn't know Your Majesty was visiting this place.

284
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,000
Sorry to make trouble for you, Your Majesty.

285
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,510
Your Majesty.

286
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,190
She just sang part of it just now.

287
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,110
The middle part.

288
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:21,240
La la la.

289
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,380
I sang it.

290
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,750
My name

291
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:25,750
is Zhai Yue.

292
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,950
It's good.

293
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,710
La la la.

294
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,470
La la la.

295
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,960
Stop it.

296
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:35,800
You,

297
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,990
raise your head.

298
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,470
That's great.

299
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,030
Poor girl.

300
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,230
What a poor girl.

301
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,030
All I hope is that

302
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,760
you can bring me to the palace.

303
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:07,589
I'm willing to do any dirty and arduous work.

304
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,109
Your Majesty.

305
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:09,750
If you bring her with you,

306
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,829
you might as well bring me too.

307
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,480
Take me with you as well.

308
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,550
It...

309
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,990
It is against the palace rules, isn't it?

310
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:25,290
[Empress Qingyuan, Crown Prince's Birth Mother]

311
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,620
Your Majesty...

312
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,030
She's my birth mother.

313
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,150
She's real and alive.

314
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:40,990
Your Majesty!

315
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:41,810
How dare you!

316
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,190
How dare you offend Her Majesty!

317
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,510
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

318
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:49,550
Legend

319
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,710
has it that

320
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,630
Your Majesty

321
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,350
just looks like Guanyin,

322
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,670
the Goddess of Mercy.

323
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:58,660
Seeing you today

324
00:17:58,990 --> 00:17:59,910
just proves what they said about you.

325
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,310
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

326
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:05,870
This girl

327
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,590
looks rude,

328
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,640
but she's quite honey-tongued.

329
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,230
If you like her...

330
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,410
I don't want this stinky sister.

331
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,150
[Young Beigong Shuo]

332
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,030
Stinky. Stinky.

333
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,100
Isn't that me?

334
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,910
You brat.

335
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,970
How could you despise yourself?

336
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,790
Forget it. I'm Aunt Zhai Yue now.

337
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,190
The first thing is to learn to adapt to my new identity.

338
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,580
Your Highness,

339
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,940
I

340
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,110
may look a little messy now.

341
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,590
But I'll be well-groomed after cleaning myself up.

342
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,510
Besides,

343
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,550
I excel in painting

344
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,170
and have read many folk tales.

345
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,590
I can tell stories for you for days and nights,

346
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,490
without drinking any water.

347
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,590
Do you want to hear stories?

348
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,110
You can tell stories?

349
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,110
I like it.

350
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:57,870
I want her.

351
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,590
Brat,

352
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,870
dealing with you is a piece of cake.

353
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,310
I don't want to leave my sister.

354
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,150
Well,

355
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:06,590
Sister,

356
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,200
isn't Hanshan still waiting...

357
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,830
Only when the mountains lose their peaks and the heavens and earth unite

358
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,940
will I dare to part from you.

359
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,440
They're deeply connected to each other.

360
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:13,730
They're both poor girls.

361
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:14,960
How about...

362
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,390
Why don't

363
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,500
we take both of them back?

364
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,260
They can serve me by my side.

365
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,030
What do you think, Your Majesty?

366
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,680
That should be fine.

367
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:24,950
Then,

368
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
they'll go back with us.

369
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,310
Thank you, Your Majesty.

370
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:29,590
Come on.

371
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,750
Let's play together.

372
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,650
Let me tell you a story, okay?

373
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,190
In the past,

374
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,580
there was a bunch of tadpoles.

375
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,440
Rise.

376
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,550
These tadpoles were looking for their mother.

377
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:41,820
This girl

378
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,590
is so clever.

379
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:51,070
Do you want her to tell you a story?

380
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:53,630
Shuo.

381
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:54,910
Do you want to hear one?

382
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,830
Keep telling me the story.

383
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,510
Okay.

384
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,500
Shuo, good boy.

385
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:07,870
Finally,

386
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:08,630
tadpoles

387
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,530
finally found their own mother.

388
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,500
And then?

389
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,110
Then the tadpoles

390
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,950
became

391
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,030
the Crown Prince.

392
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,580
[Zhaoqing Hall]

393
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:40,830
Nan Fengyi is here.

394
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:41,710
Don't move.

395
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,800
Turn around. Turn around.

396
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,230
Come here.

397
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:43,790
Your Majesty.

398
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,350
Watch carefully.

399
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,140
Don't move.

400
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:51,150
Hurry.

401
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:52,510
Take the new one in.

402
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,990
In case Her Majesty can't hear any sounds.

403
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:54,790
Yes.

404
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:55,470
Hurry. Hurry.

405
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:57,430
Come here.

406
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:57,830
Go.

407
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:58,270
Go.

408
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,670
Your Majesty, please spare my life!

409
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,270
Your Majesty.

410
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,770
If you think it's not enough,

411
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,460
I'll find you some more

412
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:12,730
to have them castrated

413
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,790
and make you laugh.

414
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,970
Let me ask you.

415
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,940
Will you stay by my side forever

416
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,270
and never betray me?

417
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,220
Of course.

418
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,390
Bring me another one.

419
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,350
Of course.

420
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,030
Of course.

421
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,940
I will always be loyal to you.

422
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,790
Then...

423
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,310
Will you die for me?

424
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:45,350
Of course.

425
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:45,940
Of course.

426
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:46,580
Of course.

427
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,890
This life,

428
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:48,510
next life,

429
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,630
and all my lifetimes

430
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,450
will be yours.

431
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:51,670
As long as...

432
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,950
As long as you're willing to support me.

433
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,760
I won't let you die.

434
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,060
But...

435
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,350
I'm afraid of being betrayed.

436
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,790
So,

437
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,410
I want something from you.

438
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,360
In this way,

439
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,190
I will trust you forever.

440
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:15,950
My...

441
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,270
My life is yours.

442
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,950
What do you want, Your Majesty?

443
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,350
You should go in too.

444
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,910
Scream for me.

445
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,510
No!

446
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,350
No, Your Majesty!

447
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,550
Take him in!

448
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:33,990
No!

449
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,790
Your Majesty, no!

450
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,750
I beg you, Your Majesty!

451
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,670
Please spare me, Your Majesty!

452
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,430
No!

453
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,070
Your Majesty!

454
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,880
Your Majesty! You can't do this to me!

455
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,070
Your Majesty!

456
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:41,470
Go.

457
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,750
Your Majesty!

458
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:44,910
Let go of me!

459
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:46,430
Your Majesty!

460
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,470
Please spare me!

461
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,390
Come up.

462
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:48,990
Don't touch me!

463
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:49,490
Your Majesty!

464
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,270
Your Majesty, please spare me! Your Majesty!

465
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,170
Don't you fall in love with Du Yuelian?

466
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,590
No!

467
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,590
Let go of me!

468
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,370
Yet you're still flattering me like this.

469
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:56,980
Don't touch me!

470
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:57,830
Your Majesty!

471
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:00,030
You just want to get promoted and make a fortune

472
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,240
and lead a wealthy life, don't you?

473
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,910
Since I can't get the love I want,

474
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,950
not a single girl in this world

475
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,830
can!

476
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,530
Nan Fengyi.

477
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,960
I want something from you.

478
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,830
If you can give it to me,

479
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,350
today,

480
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:37,010
I'll help you master the Big Dipper Primordial Spell.

481
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:38,950
What do you think?

482
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:45,300
You've known I am a demon since earlier, right?

483
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,160
Do you know what you need

484
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,300
to master the Big Dipper Primordial Spell?

485
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,630
The aura of slaughter.

486
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,020
Your hands are clean.

487
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,900
Then how can you master the Big Dipper Primordial Spell?

488
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,870
As you said,

489
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,010
you asked me to kill the sea demons that day

490
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,070
to increase the aura of slaughter?

491
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,630
You think

492
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,220
you can master the Big Dipper Primordial Spell

493
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,100
if you remain innocent?

494
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,340
You are too naive.

495
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:17,350
Back then, to master the last level

496
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,070
of the Big Dipper Primordial Spell,

497
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,270
your father killed countless demons in my clan.

498
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,470
Is this what my father said to you back then?

499
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,510
I saw with my own eyes

500
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,500
your father and Li Shiyi kill demons

501
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,370
to cultivate their internal power.

502
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:34,900
Then...

503
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,350
What do you want me to do, Your Majesty?

504
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,190
Do you know

505
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,960
why no one found out I am a mermaid demon

506
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,840
even though I've been with His Majesty for so many years?

507
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,740
You don't have a Demon Pill.

508
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,910
I've lost it for a long time.

509
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,000
That's why

510
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,870
Meng Xizhou didn't notice the demonic aura in me.

511
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,910
And that's why

512
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,610
I can gather enough aura of slaughter.

513
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,230
And the aura of slaughter

514
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,750
is the thing you need

515
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,050
to master the last level of the Big Dipper Primordial Spell.

516
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:18,710
Your Majesty, what do you

517
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:19,730
want me to do then?

518
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,920
I'll inject the aura of slaughter

519
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,510
into the Shigu Scale

520
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,140
and then integrate it into your meridian system, bones, and blood.

521
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,350
In the end,

522
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,190
it will be injected into your entire body.

523
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,350
In this way,

524
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,490
you will master the Big Dipper Primordial Spell

525
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,710
and become my real slave.

526
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:44,950
Of course,

527
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:46,950
you can also reject me.

528
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,340
I'm willing to do it.

529
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,230
I've mastered it.

530
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,840
Since you've mastered the Big Dipper Primordial Spell,

531
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:28,570
you

532
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,430
should give me what's inside you!

533
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,510
What is it?

534
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,350
You don't even know

535
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,630
what's in your body?

536
00:26:59,270 --> 00:26:59,920
What's going on?

537
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,740
I controlled him with the Shigu Scale,

538
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,590
but why can't I take out his Internal Pill?

539
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,150
Your Majesty,

540
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:07,710
I think

541
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,590
the Internal Pill of Baize Yi

542
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,230
is far from simple.

543
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,390
Why?

544
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:14,220
Back then, you and I destroyed our Demon Pills to enter the palace.

545
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,520
We can survive now

546
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,340
thanks to the Primordial Internal Pills

547
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,250
secretly provided by the Situ's Mansion as the tribute.

548
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,070
The Internal Pill in Baize Yi

549
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:23,950
doesn't look like the one that comes from a human.

550
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,260
It seems to come from our demons.

551
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,190
He has a Demon Pill in his body?

552
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,590
But he is a human.

553
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,350
Unless...

554
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,400
The Demon Pill has another host.

555
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:39,820
Besides,

556
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,190
in my opinion,

557
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,030
its ability to gather demonic power

558
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,430
might be above yours.

559
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,220
[Zhaoqing Hall]

560
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,110
Miao Yun cherishes her voice as if it were her life!

561
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,110
But you damaged her voice

562
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,350
because of jealousy!

563
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:05,580
Your Majesty.

564
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,520
We've been married

565
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,630
for more than ten years.

566
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,680
Now you only listen to her side of the story.

567
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,520
You don't believe me at all?

568
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,830
You still don't admit your mistake.

569
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,300
By my decree,

570
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:23,650
as the Empress,

571
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,550
Sun Yuan'er

572
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,970
should have been virtuous and benevolent

573
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,480
and set an example for other concubines in the imperial harem.

574
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,630
But now,

575
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,540
she harbors resentment,

576
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:33,790
harming others in the imperial harem.

577
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:35,390
I hereby announce

578
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:36,630
she is stripped of her title

579
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,470
and now is a Noble Lady,

580
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,310
who will be sent away to Lengcui Palace.

581
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,630
Your Majesty.

582
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,110
I swear with my life

583
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,380
that Her Majesty is innocent.

584
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,350
Shuo!

585
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,220
Shuo!

586
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,720
Shuo!

587
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,050
Since Shuo is still young

588
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,500
and can't leave me,

589
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,110
please forgive me!

590
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,430
How can I allow the Crown Prince

591
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,110
to stay by your side?

592
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,230
From now on,

593
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,990
the Crown Prince will be raised by Miao Yun.

594
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:11,590
Your Majesty.

595
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,150
Shuo!

596
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:12,710
Let's go.

597
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,030
Zhai Yue,

598
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,270
you must take good care of His Highness for me.

599
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,150
Zhai Yue!

600
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:17,600
Your Majesty!

601
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,230
You must take good care of him for me!

602
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,870
Now I finally understand

603
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:25,190
that you were forced away by Miao Yun.

604
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,230
This is the story drawn in the painting.

605
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:28,520
I'm just a part of the painting.

606
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,470
Although I can't change my fate,

607
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,110
I must figure out

608
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,170
who killed you.

609
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,630
Do you miss your mother?

610
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:39,870
Yes.

611
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:41,750
She's sick.

612
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,170
When she recovers,

613
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:44,870
she will come back.

614
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,030
Your Highness,

615
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,110
I'll be your mother from now on.

616
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,950
I'll cook a lot of delicious food for you

617
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,580
and give you all the interesting things.

618
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,000
I can also teach you how to draw a painting.

619
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,670
Can you

620
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:02,430
stop thinking about her?

621
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:07,870
Matron,

622
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,410
take His Highness out to play.

623
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,990
Here comes His Majesty!

624
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,390
Your Majesty.

625
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,680
My beloved consort,

626
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,510
don't be so courteous.

627
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:22,980
How's your throat? Is it better?

628
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,470
Much better.

629
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,390
I'm here today

630
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,550
to bring you a special gift.

631
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,260
A gift?

632
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,230
Come in.

633
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,630
I'm Situ Hanshan,

634
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,150
Your Majesty.

635
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,240
In order to get close to Miao Yun,

636
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,030
Situ Hanshan actually...

637
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,080
Since...

638
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,600
[Lengcui Palace]

639
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:06,950
M...

640
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,590
Zhai Yue.

641
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:10,710
Your Majesty.

642
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:15,790
Zhai Yue.

643
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,570
I'm grateful to you for coming to see me

644
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,990
since you served me for some time.

645
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:23,470
Now,

646
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,030
she's the chief of the imperial harem.

647
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:27,670
Later,

648
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,430
please

649
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:31,290
take care of Shuo.

650
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,190
Don't come to Lengcui Palace

651
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,710
again.

652
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:38,730
It's nothing.

653
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,310
Here.

654
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:48,110
You...

655
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,310
You still remember my birthday?

656
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:53,310
Of course.

657
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,030
Shuo.

658
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,770
How is Shuo?

659
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:12,950
He has grown taller.

660
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,750
And he likes drawing.

661
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,030
He behaves well.

662
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,500
He has a temperament like yours.

663
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,300
Tell Shuo

664
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,910
I'll love him forever.

665
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,630
Don't worry.

666
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,620
He has always kept it in his mind.

667
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:51,950
Your Majesty.

668
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,270
What's wrong?

669
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:54,340
Your Majesty.

670
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:56,750
Your Majesty!

671
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,220
Your Majesty!

672
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:00,590
Your Majesty!

673
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,670
Your Majesty!

674
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:12,990
The noodles...

675
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,750
The noodles were poisoned.

676
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:20,710
Zhai Yue,

677
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,100
thank you

678
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,530
for seeing her off on her final journey for me.

679
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:25,790
Miao Yun,

680
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:28,870
I'll kill you!

681
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:36,770
Your Majesty!

682
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:37,590
Your Majesty!

683
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:38,990
Uncle...

684
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:39,280
His...

685
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:42,660
I...

686
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:44,240
[Sun Ju, Nation-Defending General]

687
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:46,520
Do you know

688
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,190
how your mother died?

689
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,110
Do you know how my sister died?

690
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:00,950
His Highness.

691
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:01,630
Shuo.

692
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:03,840
Shuo.

693
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,090
Tell me.

694
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,010
How did your mother die?

695
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,699
My mother was framed by Miao Yun

696
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,350
and sent away to Lengcui Palace.

697
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,790
She suffered a lot.

698
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,139
On her birthday,

699
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,320
Miao Yun poisoned her longevity noodles

700
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:19,880
and killed her.

701
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:23,949
After all these years,

702
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,670
I feel ashamed in front of my mother.

703
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,630
How could it be your fault?

704
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,340
My poor sister.

705
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:39,630
If we hadn't entered into the painting,

706
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,989
who would have known

707
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,310
the evil queen is so vicious?

708
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,920
Seems that Empress Miao Yun

709
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,790
has been up to no good since the very beginning.

710
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,030
She first used the fake Scroll of Mountains and Seas to win the people's hearts

711
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:54,070
and then used the imperial beeswax

712
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,679
to turn those who are in love against each other.

713
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:58,230
What does she want?

714
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,100
Of course, she wants revenge.

715
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,870
Miao Yun and Situ Hanshan

716
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,950
grew up together when they were little.

717
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,830
In order to stay with her,

718
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,910
Situ Hanshan had himself castrated

719
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,470
to become a eunuch in the palace.

720
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,230
In the end,

721
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,030
he died a tragic death.

722
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,310
Miao Yun lost the one she loved,

723
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,790
so she used the imperial beeswax

724
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,320
to make those who love each other

725
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,750
to fall apart.

726
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,830
When will the cycle of vengeance

727
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,750
ever end?

728
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,620
I see.

729
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:41,830
We have to

730
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:42,910
go back to Changle City

731
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,350
and reveal her identity.

732
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:46,110
Shuo.

733
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,310
I planned to take the Sun's Army

734
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,390
away from Changle City

735
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,540
and guard the border in Xizhou,

736
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,720
in case His Majesty is wary of us,

737
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,570
which may harm your position as the Crown Prince.

738
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,070
But now the evil queen

739
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,300
has brought chaos to the imperial court.

740
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,650
How can I turn a blind eye to the great peril threatening Dazhou?

741
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,430
I'm going back now

742
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:03,320
to organize the Sun's Army.

743
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:03,990
After that,

744
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,030
I'll return with you.

745
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:14,510
Mother,

746
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,190
I will avenge you.

747
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:20,910
Mother,

748
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:22,470
Father,

749
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,270
I'm back.

750
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,880
Unfortunately,

751
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,150
the person who promised

752
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,550
to come back with me

753
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,180
can't come.

754
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:39,830
But

755
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,670
it's worth coming back this time.

756
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,550
I met Mother.

757
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:47,710
I finally know

758
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,390
what kind of person you were.

759
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,390
Mother, tell me.

760
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,190
Am I a human

761
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,060
or a demon?

762
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,070
In humans' view,

763
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,190
being a demon

764
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,360
is the original sin.

765
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:06,990
Iron,

766
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:08,950
you eavesdropped on me.

767
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,350
In my opinion,

768
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,310
you'd better stay in Xizhou.

769
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,750
Let me tell you a secret.

770
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:14,550
Many good demons

771
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:16,670
are

772
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:17,630
hidden here.

773
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:21,750
Are we demons safe

774
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,110
in Xizhou?

775
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,000
We're demons.

776
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,870
It's not safe wherever we go.

777
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,710
As long as the human race sees our true form,

778
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:33,880
we will be killed.

779
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,590
Not everyone

780
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,950
will treat us

781
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,030
as kindly as His Highness and General Sun do.

782
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:40,830
Yeah.

783
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,390
This is also my mother's wish.

784
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,030
But...

785
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:46,910
Legend has it that

786
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:48,390
once the Scroll of Mountains and Seas is opened,

787
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,710
ten thousand demons will slaughter the city.

788
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:50,990
Slaughter the city?

789
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,780
If we can live a peaceful life,

790
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,310
no one

791
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,670
would choose to fight against each other.

792
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,500
Iron,

793
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,070
I've always wanted to know

794
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,320
how my father died.

795
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,810
In the fifth year after my mother passed away,

796
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:10,030
my father

797
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,430
sent me away.

798
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,870
Then I heard that he died at home.

799
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,030
After so many years,

800
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,770
I've always wanted to ask him

801
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,330
why he abandoned me

802
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,270
and who killed him.

803
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,830
So,

804
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,550
your father died at home?

805
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:31,310
Yes.

806
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,710
He was found dead three months later.

807
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:38,830
Your father

808
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,780
was so pitiful.

809
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,390
Father.
