[Episode 20]

3
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,460
Father!

4
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,229
Xi.

5
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,390
Come over and watch the kid for me.

6
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,910
Okay.

7
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:58,810
You've grown up.

8
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:10,560
The Scroll of Mountains and Seas?

9
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,510
Don't worry.

10
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,620
It concerns my son's life.

11
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,960
How could I give you a fake one?

12
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,350
Senior,

13
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,870
are you really willing to use the Scroll of Mountains and Seas

14
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,829
to exchange for your son's life?

15
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:33,790
Really?

16
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,950
I also want to ask you

17
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,710
if you're really willing

18
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,150
to use your daughter's Demon Pill

19
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,710
to exchange for the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

20
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,630
Without the Demon Pill,

21
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,670
she'd lose her demonic aura.

22
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,829
From then on,

23
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:54,230
she can blend in the crowd

24
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,870
and be a normal person.

25
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,120
So, Father exchanged my Demon Pill

26
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,280
for the Scroll of Mountains and Seas with Baize Gong.

27
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,670
My Qi Core has had a defect since I was little.

28
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,670
I couldn't practice.

29
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,710
The whole Baize family was executed due to the loss of

30
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,610
the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

31
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,270
Everything can be traced back to this deal.

32
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,600
Without the Demon Pill,

33
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,030
Meng Xizhou's Qi Core would be leaking

34
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,360
and she wouldn't be able to practice the magic.

35
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,070
And Baize Gong,

36
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,920
if you lose the Scroll of Mountains and Seas,

37
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,610
aren't you afraid the Emperor will blame you?

38
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:25,820
You servant!

39
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,260
Shut up!

40
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,020
All right, Xi.

41
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,800
Senior and I have agreed

42
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,770
that I'll come to Baize's home

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,240
to get the Demon Pill back

44
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,980
when Chirp is twenty years old.

45
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:40,930
Senior,

46
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,730
you're not going back on your word, are you?

47
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,390
Rest assured.

48
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,190
The Baize family has been hunting demons for generations.

49
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,120
As long as she comes here at that time,

50
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,190
she will definitely find Yi.

51
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,340
I'm almost 20 now.

52
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,720
If Chirp still doesn't have the Demon Pill

53
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,390
when she's 20,

54
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:01,840
will she die?

55
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,320
Xi.

56
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,650
Don't jinx it.

57
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,630
I understand your servant is eager to protect his masters.

58
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:09,510
Actually,

59
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,060
after I knew your daughter was the Demon Queen,

60
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,400
I didn't pursue it further.

61
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,200
I'm the Demon Queen?

62
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,550
Because I believe that

63
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,829
without the Demon Pill,

64
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,310
she might really become

65
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,230
a healthy and happy ordinary girl.

66
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,030
Yi is dying now.

67
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,150
Without the Demon Pill of Demon Queen's descendants,

68
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,360
he won't survive tomorrow.

69
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,000
Then, many years later,

70
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,110
if Nan…

71
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,270
if Baize Yi

72
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,159
gave the Demon Pill back to Chirp,

73
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,790
will he die?

74
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,070
Stop it.

75
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,950
Chirp.

76
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,700
There's a worm in your stomach.

77
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:52,990
I'll give you a candy

78
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,790
to get the worm out.

79
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:55,710
Okay?

80
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,030
Hurry.

81
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,720
Before he goes back on his word,

82
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,470
let's go.

83
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,210
Yi.

84
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,520
I'd rather betray the whole world

85
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,830
than let anything happen to your life.

86
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,190
But he will be in pain all the time in the future

87
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,470
because of your choice today.

88
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,910
Is there really no other way?

89
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,190
The truth has come to light.

90
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,240
It turns out that the reason why Nan Fengyi and I

91
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,260
could attract each other

92
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,550
and being together could make our power stronger

93
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,150
is not because of fate at all.

94
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,190
It's all because

95
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,750
he has my Demon Pill inside him.

96
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,070
[Li's Mansion]

97
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,150
Chirp has a stomachache.

98
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,150
Yet you ignored her.

99
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,610
Why are you still making an umbrella here?

100
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,720
Isn't this my little umbrella?

101
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,070
Are you confused?

102
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,880
You integrated the Scroll of Mountains and Seas into it!

103
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,310
So,

104
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,400
the real Scroll of Mountains and Seas

105
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,940
is in my little umbrella!

106
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,080
So, the power of the little umbrella

107
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,710
was injected by my father.

108
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:00,910
What is he trying to do?

109
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,920
This is my lifelong skill.

110
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,860
I'll give it all to you today.

111
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,750
Without the Demon Pill,

112
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,710
the power will eventually be dispersed.

113
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,270
However,

114
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,710
it can guarantee

115
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,950
you live to 20 healthily.

116
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:20,830
Xi,

117
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,780
get me the money I prepared.

118
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,340
I'll entrust my kid

119
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,270
to you.

120
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,790
Kid,

121
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,230
come with me.

122
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,390
This umbrella

123
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,070
is considered a magical weapon.

124
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,440
She must carry it with her

125
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,000
and never

126
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,710
leave it ever.

Don't worry.

130
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,910
Chirp will be fine with me.

131
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,630
I will…

00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,630
and fulfill her mother's wish

189
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,510
of saving all demons.

190
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,650
♫In silence, the world's grudges weave a web of entanglement♫

191

192
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:42,830
Actually,

193
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,460
Chirp already knew.

194
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,190
♫It's the love doomed by fate♫

195
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,510
What did you say?

196
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,070
Xi!

197
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,110
Senior.

198
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,040
I knew it.

199
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,510
A villain like you

200
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,410
will definitely come back.

201
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:17,750
However,

202
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,910
you can't find the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

203
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:23,750
Junior,

204
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,630
hand over the Scroll of Mountains and Seas,

205
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,190
and I'll spare your life.

206
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,490
You might as well take my life.

207
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,030
Since you won't give it to me,

208
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,240
I'll find it myself.

209
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,570
Xi.

210
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,640
What did you just say?

211
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,150
I said

212
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,150
Chirp

213
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,190
will definitely fulfill your wish.

214
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,960
Thank you, Xi.

215
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,120
Ren Guang.

216
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,250
Who are you?

217
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,260
Why did you use my mother's name—

218
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,800
Ren Guang.

219
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,130
I'm your mother's guard.

220
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,840
No.

221
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,750
To be exact,

222
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,840
I'm the guardian of all Demon Lords.

223
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,590
My name is Gong Xi.

224
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,230
As you saw,

225
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,680
I died with Li Shiyi.

226
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,990
After I died, I became a glimmer of obsession, stayed in your mind,

227
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:17,870
and grew up with you.

228
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,910
I used the name Ren Guang

229
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,140
to remind myself not to forget

230
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,190
how the Demon Queen died.

231
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,110
You've always known my identity.

232
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,250
Why did you encourage me to be a demon hunter?

233
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,720
What is your purpose?

234
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,470
Chirp.

235
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:34,990
Calm down.

236
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,990
So, you knew everything.

237
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,700
There's a Demon Pill in Nan Fengyi's body.

238
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,670
To approach him,

239
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,120
you must become a demon hunter.

240
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,350
So,

241
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,990
the Demon Pill is in his body.

242
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,480
Do I have to take it back?

243
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:56,990
Of course.

244
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,750
Whether the demons in the Scroll of Mountains and Seas

245
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,430
or the ones

246
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,600
wandering about in this world

247
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,340
are all waiting for you

248
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,390
to restart the power of the Demon Queen

249
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,590
To activate the power of the Demon Queen,

250
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,990
you need the Demon Pill

251
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,180
to return to your body.

252
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,310
Then...

253
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,560
if I take the Demon Pill back from him,

254
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,990
will he die?

255
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:21,990
Of course.

256
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,270
What if I don't take it back?

257
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,390
Then, you will die.

258
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,770
All the demons

259
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,760
will die with you.

260
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,820
I...

261
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,590
After this journey,

262
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,790
I'm no longer the young boy

263
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,450
who was obsessed with storybooks anymore.

264
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,430
How I wish that in the future,

265
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:03,950
humans and demons

266
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,420
can get along peacefully

267
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:07,440
like you and me.

268
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,390
As long as you want,

269
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,030
you can achieve it.

270
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,360
After all, good demons like me

271
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,230
are still the majority

272
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,580
among the demon clan.

273
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,350
As long as we have a place

274
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,470
to live happily

275
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,190
and without worries.

276
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:26,950
Then tell me,

277
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,510
do the demons in the Scroll of Mountains and Seas

278
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,060
also think like that?

279
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,710
All the living things in the world

280
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,150
are the same.

281
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:42,830
Goddess.

282
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,350
Goddess.

283
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,390
Do you know

284
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,030
the truth about your father's death?

285
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,440
Tell me who it is.

286
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,590
I'll stand up for you.

287
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,990
Now…

288
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:59,830
I don't really want to say it.

289
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,310
The past can't be changed.

290
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,870
We have to look forward bravely,

291
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,660
right?

292
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,790
Look forward?

293
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,110
But I am the Demon Queen.

294
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,590
You...

295
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,280
I didn't expect that!

296
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,470
A human-demon

297
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,790
hybrid

298
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,130
can actually inherit the bloodline of the Demon Queen!

299
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,640
Goddess Chirp,

300
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,300
you are the hope of our demon clan.

301
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,720
I couldn't even accept

302
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,170
the fact that I'm a demon.

303
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,460
Now I'm the Demon Queen,

304
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,480
I'm even more at a loss.

305
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:49,600
No matter who you are,

306
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,480
who you will become,

307
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,050
you'll always be yourself.

308
00:16:58,890 --> 00:16:59,900
In my heart,

309
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,030
you are always

310
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,870
the righteous and kind Goddess.

311
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,109
I believe

312
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,400
you won't hurt anyone.

313
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:11,950
Really?

314
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:12,790
Yes.

315
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,470
I'm the future king of the human race.

316
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,680
You are the future queen of the Demon Clan.

317
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,510
Let's work together

318
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,150
to get rid of the evil queen of Miao Yun

319
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,050
and release all the demons

320
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:24,829
in the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

321
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,030
I'll govern my people,

322
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,740
while you teach your subjects,

323
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,110
so that everyone can put down their resentment

324
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,370
and the conflicts between humans and demons can be changed.

325
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:34,750
I believe

326
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:35,910
a time of peace and prosperity

327
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,310
will inevitably come.

328
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,750
Great!

329
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,550
Great!

330
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,710
Nan Fengyi.

331
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,310
Nan Fengyi, wake up!

332
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:00,550
Nan Fengyi!

333
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:02,980
Nan Fengyi, how are you?

334
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,390
Let me help you up.

335
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,150
[Nan's Umbrella Shop]

336
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,550
I've been organizing my father's belongings.

337
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,030
I found many stories about the past.

338
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,430
These things

339
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:19,610
are related to you.

340
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,830
So, I've been hesitating

341
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:22,710
whether I should tell you.

342
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,430
So,

343
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,270
your father,

344
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,360
my father,

345
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,050
and Li Shiyi

346
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,670
are fellow apprentices.

347
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,190
Yes.

348
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,290
After your Baize family

349
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,630
was executed,

350
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:37,870
my father

351
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,350
wrote this letter

352
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,680
to Li Shiyi,

353
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,890
But he didn't receive any reply.

354
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,230
Until a few months later,

355
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,750
his body was found

356
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,310
at home.

357
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,150
He had a horrible death.

358
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,960
My father immediately went

359
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:53,950
to Xizhou to collect his body,

360
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,220
but he found

361
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,790
he was killed by the Feibai Brush.

362
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,390
Feibai Brush?

363
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,830
I can't believe it was my father who killed Li Shiyi.

364
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,460
Your father had always been competitive.

365
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,430
Among the three fellow apprentices,

366
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,350
he loved fame and fortune the most.

367
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,740
And Li Shiyi

368
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,630
was a carefree man.

369
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,390
They hunted demons together.

370
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:21,990
Later,

371
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,230
Li Shiyi was tired of this kind of life.

372
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,350
And my father

373
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,150
became slack in work

374
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,350
because of my mother's accidental passing away.

375
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,550
Then, why did he go to Xizhou

376
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,470
to kill Li Shiyi?

377
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,030
Because of you.

378
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,590
Because of me?

379
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,470
This is the letter your father wrote to Li Shiyi.

380
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,370
[To Li Shiyi]

381
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,030
Take a look.

382
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,270
In order to save my son,

383
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,280
I'm willing to give you the Scroll of Mountains and Seas

384
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,750
in exchange for the little Demon Queen's Demon Pill.

385
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,110
You were born with incomplete heart meridians.

386
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,830
Baize Gong searched everywhere for famous doctors

387
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:58,880
but still couldn’t save you.

388
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,710
But he learned from my father

389
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,310
that the Demon Queen's Demon Pill

390
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,750
could extend your life.

391
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,150
So, he killed all demons

392
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,650
to find the Demon Queen.

393
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:10,910
Later,

394
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,830
he learned that Li Shiyi killed the Demon Queen

395
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,670
and that he had had

396
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,300
a baby girl with the Demon Queen.

397
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:17,960
So,

398
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,790
he made a deal with Li Shiyi:

399
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,430
swapping the Scroll of Mountains and Seas

400
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,630
for the little Demon Queen's Demon Pill.

401
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:27,910
That's why you're still alive.

402
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,560
Little Demon Queen?

403
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,390
It's Chirp.

404
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,310
Chirp.

405
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,120
Of course your father knew

406
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,150
it was a big deal to lose the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

407
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,230
So, after he swindled Chirp's Demon Pill,

408
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:43,930
he went back to Xizhou immediately

409
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,320
and threatened Li Shiyi to hand over the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

410
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,820
But Li Shiyi was prepared for that.

411
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,590
However,

412
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,830
in the end,

413
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,560
he was still killed

414
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,110
by your father's Feibai Brush.

415
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,510
Chirp has

416
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,750
the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

417
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:15,870
You...

418
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:16,930
You've seen it?

419
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,970
You've seen it, too.

420
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,270
Could it be...

421
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,390
Chirp's power is extremely weak,

422
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,610
but with that Umbrella,

423
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,330
she came safely out of danger many times.

424
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,390
Moreover, after catching a demon,

425
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,070
her power became stronger.

426
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,790
The real Scroll of Mountains and Seas

427
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,430
should be hidden

428
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,330
in the shabby umbrella of Chirp.

429
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,790
The Scroll of Mountains and Seas…

430
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:48,950
Nan Fengyi.

431
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,310
Although

432
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,960
I'm not a qualified Demon Queen,

433
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,830
and I've even let down

434
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,190
all my fellow demons down,

435
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:26,870
well,

436
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,590
I want to be

437
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,150
a good mother.

438
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,320
I will be killed

439
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,030
by the demon hunter from Dazhou.

440
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,420
I'll be skined,

441
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,310
my bones will be removed,

442
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,150
and my blood will be used to make the Scroll of Mountains and Seas

443
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,320
so that my fellow demons are trapped?

444
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,710
Those thousands of

445
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,830
clanspeople who are suppressed

446
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,200
in the Scroll of Mountains and Seas

447
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:02,080
have been waiting for me to save them.

448
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:06,550
They've been waiting for me to save them!

449
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:11,190
Help me get back the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

450
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,300
you must

451
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,280
release them.

452
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,790
They are just like me.

453
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,170
like me.

454
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,870
I am the Demon Queen.

455
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,190
The ancient Demon Queen

456
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,780
was my grandmother.

457
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:43,490
So

458
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,650
the Qi Sword and the Scroll of Mountains and Seas

459
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,270
were all made from the flesh and blood

460
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,550
of the ancient Demon Queen.

461
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,310
Whether it's the demons in the Scroll of Mountains and Seas

462
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:54,110
or the ones who are wandering in the world,

463
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,670
they are all waiting for you to restart the power of the Demon Queen.

464
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,250
To restart it,

465
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,830
you need the Demon Pill to return to your body.

466
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,460
if I take the Demon Pill back from him,

467
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,920
will he die?

468
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:06,590
Of course.

469
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,140
What if I don't take it back?

470
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,200
Then, you will die.

471
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:10,550
Besides,

472
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,830
all demons

473
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,500
will die together.

474
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,110
Why you?

475
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,730
[Celestial Master's Mansion]

476
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:35,910
Baize Yi.

477
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,030
Do you know?

478
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,110
The Scroll of Mountains and Seas that the Crown Prince had

479
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,330
was forged by me.

480
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,390
Really?

481
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,710
Since you have mastered the Big Dipper Primordial Spell,

482
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,870
you must…

483
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,830
have found the Scroll of Mountains and Seas, right?

484
00:24:58,910 --> 00:24:59,510
Your Majesty,

485
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,670
I am

486
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,580
still trying to find it.

487
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,350
Baize Yi.

488
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,870
Isn't Meng Xizhou's oil paper umbrella

489
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,330
the Scroll of Mountains and Seas

490
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,730
What?

491
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,950
You could tell Du Yuelian about this,

492
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,170
but you don't want to tell me?

493
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:23,790
Your Majesty,

494
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,350
I really don't know what you're talking about.

495
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,230
Your father killed Meng Xizhou's father,

496
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,820
yet you loved Meng Xizhou deeply.

497
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:36,880
This is really interesting and exciting.

498
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,050
When were you planning to

499
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,600
tell me about this?

500
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,390
Your Majesty,

501
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:46,610
I...

502
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,350
Baize Yi, let me tell you.

503
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,120
Doing things under me,

504
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,480
obedience is more important than loyalty.

505
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,030
I have 10,000 ways

506
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,630
to punish those who are unfaithful to me.

507
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,270
But if one isn't obedient,

508
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,830
he will be useless to me.

509
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,270
What do you want me to do, Your Majesty?

510
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:33,400
Go.

511
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,800
Get Meng Xizhou

512
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,510
and the real Scroll of Mountains and Seas back for me.

513
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,260
The Shigu Scale

514
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,910
can not only control me

515
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,250
but also listen to all the words I say.

516
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,110
From now on,

517
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,990
I have to be careful with my words and actions.

518
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,230
The document.

519
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,970
My Lord, here.

520
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,160
How long do we have to wait.

521
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:08,990
Next.

522
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:11,870
The document.

523
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,420
Go in.

524
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,900
I am Sun Ju, Guardian General of Xingcheng Pass.

525
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,340
Guo Ji, the Director of the Court of Judicature and Revision.

526
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:24,830
May I ask

527
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,590
if you, General Sun, have an decree?

528
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,680
The envoys of Baise

529
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,730
were robbed by bandits at Xingcheng Pass.

530
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,730
They especially asked the garrison of Dazhou for help.

531
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,030
The report of the King of Baise entering Changle

532
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,440
was sent to His Majesty

533
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,700
half a month ago.

534
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,470
You don't have a decree?

535
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,030
Then...

536
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,390
Please forgive me for not being able to receive you.

537
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,910
I am the biological uncle of the Crown Prince.

538
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,270
If you dare to delay the King of Baise from entering Changle

539
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:51,880
and attending the ceremony of the tribute from all nations,

540
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,710
as a mere Judicial Director,

541
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,100
can you bear the responsibility?

542
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,230
I…

543
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,180
Forgive me for being ignorant.

544
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,070
Please.

545
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:04,970
Please.

546
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:10,630
Let's go.

547
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,200
Wait.

548
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,790
Her Majesty has issued an order:

549
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,040
To prevent the demons

550
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,750
from sneaking into Changle City,

551
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,870
all those who enter the city

552
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,920
must be checked by the Celestial Master's Mansion.

553
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,510
Lantern Boy.

554
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,250
Do you want to go with us?

555
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,510
Little Demon Queen,

556
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,990
Changle City is dangerous.

557
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,110
I've discussed with Iron.

558
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,320
He allowed me to give you

559
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,070
this illusionary lantern.

560
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,190
The illusionary lantern?

561
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,470
Where is it?

562
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,190
Touch your ears.

563
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:26,990
Thank you.

564
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,770
Miao Yun is Iron's disciple.

565
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,030
So,

566
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,540
you can break her illusionary technique

567
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:32,960
with my lantern.

568
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:34,800
The future of our Demon Clan

569
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,130
depends on you.

570
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:36,690
Take care.

571
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:37,630
You too.

572
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:39,960
I have no more questions.

573
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:40,780
Goodbye.

574
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:42,630
Thank you.

575
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:45,510
Let them go.

576
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:45,750
Go.

577
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:57,470
Goddess,

578
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,030
do you think

579
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,400
the big demon they captured

580
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:01,950
can be bigger than you?

581
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,330
Maybe

582
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,990
the one they are looking for is me.

583
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:08,420
Isn't that perfect?

584
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:09,650
You want to take the Demon Pill.

585
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,190
I was just worried about how to find them.

586
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,190
What do you want to eat?

587
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,260
I'll buy some for you.

588
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,030
Anything will do.

589
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,150
Be careful.

590
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:21,560
Okay.

591
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,070
Who is it?

592
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,920
Her Majesty ordered

593
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,670
We, the official detectives, are ordered to search all courier stations in Changle City.

594
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,130
All visiting envoy groups must be checked.

595
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,360
It's him.

596
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,930
I hope she can find her Demon Pill,

597
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,640
become the Demon Queen,

598
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,200
and fulfill her mother's wish

599
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,010
of saving all demons.

600
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,120
Search thoroughly.

601
00:30:59,150 --> 00:30:59,670
Yes.

602
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,700
Let's go over there.

603
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:03,790
Let's go.

604
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,510
There may be a big demon in Changle City recently.

605
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,630
We, the official detectives,

606
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,740
can only follow orders.

607
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,280
It's really you.

608
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,070
What are you staring at?

609
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,990
Don't think I can't recognize you

610
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,490
just because you used the illusionary technique.

611
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:06,500
What are you doing?

612
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:10,950
Even if you turn to dust,

613
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,030
I can still recognize you.

614
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,830
Don't hurt her!

615
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:24,190
Go.

616
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,380
Will you confess?

617
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,460
Where is the Scroll of Mountains and Seas?

618
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,550
Say it!

619
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,830
Where is the Scroll of Mountains and Seas?

620
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,480
I'd rather die

621
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,990
than tell you where it is.

622
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,380
Just confess!

623
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,760
♫The wind hesitates, not daring to smooth the furrowed brow♫

624
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,200
Say it!

625
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:57,570
Did you get the result?

626
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,190
My Lord,

627
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,030
not yet.

628
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,590
You useless fools!

629
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:06,090
♫The rain hesitates, reluctant to burden the tear-streaked eyes beneath the umbrella♫

630
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,230
Get lost!

631
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:04,520
Get lost!

632
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:13,020
♫The closer you are to me, the clearer the pain becomes♫

633
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,810
♫The most painful separation means you can't even miss her♫

634
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,300
Nan Fengyi…

635
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,290
♫In silence, the world's grudges weave a web of entanglement♫

636
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:28,110
You finally show your true colors.

637
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,650
♫Under the clouds, the smoke from cooking rises and spreads freely♫

638
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,940
You're a demon;

639
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:33,840
♫It's the love doomed by fate♫

640
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,030
I'm human.

641
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,870
We were born in different positions.

642
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:38,730
♫Under the umbrella, your profile is gently framed by the soft strands of your hair♫

643
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,680
You should have known it long ago.

644
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:42,040
♫Should my heart belong to someone for ten thousand years♫

645
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:47,790
♫Through endless lifetimes, softly and quietly, it flows on♫

646
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:45,470
You and your father

647
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:52,410
are both shameless villains.

648
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,340
♫I won't lose you♫

649
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,230
♫I'll sacrifice myself to help you♫

650
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,260
My father?

651
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:01,510
♫With a single lamp and a thousand books, alone I'm restless through the night♫

652
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,600
He outsmarted Li Shiyi

653
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,990
and took your Demon Pill.

654
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,210
It is the most touching fatherly love for me.

655
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:08,139
♫Give me a fleeting moment of rain, to be held captive by your side♫

656
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:06,830
Unfortunately,

657
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,880
he didn't get the Scroll of Mountains and Seas back.

658
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,310
Today,

659
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,659
let me make up for this regret.

660
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,429
So...

661
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,190
You knew about it?

662
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:25,870
Of course I knew.

663
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,480
Otherwise, how could I

664
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,350
keep a demon like you by my side?

665
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,590
My purpose was to get

666
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,810
the Scroll of Mountains and Seas you have.

667
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:39,670
That day,

668
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,550
you said

669
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,530
you didn't mind that I was a demon.

670
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,690
It's a lie.

671
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:54,790
You said you wanted to be with me no matter where we were.

672
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:58,750
It's a lie.

673
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:03,060
You said you loved me.

674
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,610
It's also a lie.

675
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:10,880
Right?

676
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:13,750
How could I

677
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,850
really fall for a demon like you?

678
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,660
If you want to suffer less,

679
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,430
just tell me where the Scroll of Mountains and Seas is.

680
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:26,710
By the way,

681
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,710
thank you for your Demon Pill.

682
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,310
It allowed me to live peacefully

683
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,350
for so many years.

684
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:42,080
The Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

685
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,110
The Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

686
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,890
Nan Fengyi.

687
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,200
I'd rather die than tell you

688
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,710
where it is!

689
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:21,630
I didn't expect

690
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,430
Her Majesty's Shigu Scale

691
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,760
would be able to monitor Baize Yi.

692
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:28,400
This way,

693
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:31,460
we don't need to worry that he might betray you.

694
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,350
Thank you for your hard work

695
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,370
these days.

696
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,150
Is the ointment I gave you

697
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,660
any good?

698
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:43,550
Yes.

699
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,070
It's very useful!

700
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:46,250
Well,

701
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,790
it doesn't hurt anymore.

702
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,200
Once I get the Scroll of Mountains and Seas,

703
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,300
I will give you the Minister of the Court of Judicature and Revision.

704
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,230
Thank you, Your Majesty.

705
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:04,670
Thank you, Your Majesty.

706
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:07,480
Go.

707
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,430
Tell Baize Yi

708
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,150
that I want to see Meng Xizhou.

709
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,120
Nan Fengyi.

710
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,200
You will get your comeuppance!

711
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,310
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

712
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,860
Don't talk nonsense

713
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,230
when you see Her Majesty later,

714
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:08,930
or you'll get tongue pulled out.

715
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:17,660
No.

716
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,100
You're wrong.

717
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,070
What did I do wrong?

718
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:40,060
You underestimated me.

719
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:43,800
I underestimated you?

720
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,300
Don't forget

721
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,800
I found you first when you entered the city.

722
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:56,310
You didn't find me first.

723
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,790
It was me

724
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,150
who found you first.

725
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,150
Master.

726
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,480
I'm no longer that little girl

727
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,630
who used to follow you around.
