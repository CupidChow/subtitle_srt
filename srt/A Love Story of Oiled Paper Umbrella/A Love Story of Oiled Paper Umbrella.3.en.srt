Father,

[Meng Xizhou's Sister, Dan Qian]

10
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,190
Actually, they're becoming harder and harder to buy.

11
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,710
In these times,

12
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,700
if you want to buy a house,

13
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:07,130
it'll cost you most of your parents' life savings.

14
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,110
Our houses

I'm sorry.

24
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,870
These past few days, while I was away,

25
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,530
I must have delayed the sale of quite a few ghost-free houses, right?

26
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,190
Even if we post these listings, they won't sell.

27
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,310
There's nothing to delay.

28

I won't force you to go on blind dates anymore.

If you really want to stay single,

then you can...

33
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,630
stay single for life then.

34
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,340
If it comes to that, I will

You want to be a demon hunter,

59

yet you sympathize with demons.

60
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,790
Then what's your point in insisting on being a demon hunter

61
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,670

62
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:20,670
Yeah.

Why do I want to become a demon hunter?

Why did he tell me

68

that both humans and demons are living beings?

69

191

I have no grudge against you.

194
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,060
Father, could you please stop causing trouble?

195

How am I causing trouble?

Who would want to get tangled up with someone from the Court of Judicature and Revision?

200
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,220
I'm just an honest agent,

202
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,980
I've been dragged into Chief Minister Pei's case for no reason.

203

I'm just as unfortunate, okay?

204
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,070
Father.

205
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,460
That young lady was here to help us with the case.

206

Well,

209
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,490
I was wrong.

210
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,070
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

211

00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,670
who is also a suspect in the Pei Xun case!

374
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,710
After a Puppet Worm from Dongzhou transforms into a Puppet Spirit, it doesn't have any demonic aura.

375
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:33,750
Such powerful demonic energy

376
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,940
couldn't possibly come from a Puppet Worm.

377
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,400
But if what he says about the Puppet Worm is true,

378
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,120
the consequences would be unimaginable.

379
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,510
Why is Lord Situ so eager

380
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:42,550
to deny it?

381
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,630
Could it be

382
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,780
that he is indeed involved in this matter?

383
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,750
Your Majesty.

384
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,340
Shut up.

385
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,710
The Puppet Worms in Situ's Mansion

386
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:50,560
haven't been fully investigated yet.

387
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,360
It's not the right time.

388
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,340
If I don't prove my innocence now,

389
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,710
I'll be on the defensive later.

390
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,100
The Puppet Worm from Chief Minister Pei's body

391
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,890
is now in my possession.

392
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:02,230
I'm willing...

393
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,400
to demonstrate it to everyone here.

394
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,660
Don't, don't.

395
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,590
Your Majesty.

396
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,230
I wonder...

397
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,780
may I borrow the cranes outside the hall?

398
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:15,570
Okay.

399
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,230
Remember the incantation I taught you

400
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,650
on our way here?

401
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,440
You're on your own now.

402
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,040
Okay.

403
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:34,080
Your Majesty, look!

404
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,070
This is the Puppet Worm, who can possess bodies.

405
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:52,630
Your Majesty,

406
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,130
this is

407
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,050
the crane that is possessed by the Puppet Worm.

408
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:57,910
Your Majesty,

409
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,030
within the realm,

410
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,670
there indeed exist Puppet Worms.

411
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:04,900
Your Majesty,

412
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,750
beneath the skin of this crane,

413
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,640
lies the Puppet Worm, a demon from Dongzhou.

414
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,190
So, you're saying

415
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:13,140
that the one you killed that night

416
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,099
was Lord Pei with Puppet Worm inside his body?

417
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:15,790
Yes.

418
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,890
That's utterly ridiculous.

419
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,349
Since the worm possessed his body,

420
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,520
how did you know he was a Puppet Spirit?

421
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:27,099
I...

422
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,670
I have Demon-Recognizing Pupils.

423
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,870
No demon

424
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,940
can escape my eyes.

425
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,080
Demon-Recognizing Pupils?

426
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,100
I've never heard of such a thing in my life.

427
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,950
How can you prove that you have Demon-Recognizing Pupils?

428
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,060
Meng Xizhou.

429
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:40,390
Stop talking.

430
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,380
No.

431
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,960
Everyone, take a look.

432
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,190
In this sky,

433
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:45,750
which one

434
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,710
is the crane that has just been possessed by the worm?

435
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,400
Lord Du!

436
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,230
Your Majesty.

437
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,150
There's no demonic aura on the Puppet Worm.

438
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,990
Even if we use magical artifacts,

439
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,710
we can't distinguish them.

440
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,350
It must be that one.

441
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,180
Evil stems from the heart.

442
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,790
All techniques return to their origin.

443
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,330
This girl can actually use talismans.

444
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,490
Just a few days ago, she had no internal power at all.

445
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,110
She was nowhere near this level.

446
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,130
However,

447
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,200
the way she was just now

448
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,680
reminded me exactly of how my Senior used to be.

449
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,220
If I may trouble you, Lord Du,

450
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,520
please extract the Puppet Worm.

451
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,540
It's right around the neck area.

452
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:26,600
Good!

453
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,470
Good, good, good.

454
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,080
Your Majesty, do not be deceived by this sorcery.

455
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,350
She brought the Puppet Worm herself,

456
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,990
so naturally she can make any claims she wishes.

457
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,480
Right Chancellor, that's not right.

458
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,960
This young lady has indeed

459
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,590
proven the existence of the Puppet Worm just now.

460
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,950
However, where Puppet Worm came from

461
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,640
needs to be thoroughly investigated.

462
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:45,740
Nan Qing,

463
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:46,990
in your opinion,

464
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,550
where did the Puppet Worm come from?

465
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,430
I do not know, Your Majesty.

466
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,910
Why don't you tell the truth?

467
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,470
After playing tricks for so long,

468
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,880
you still can't make your story add up, can you?

469
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,340
Your Majesty.

470
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:05,990
In my opinion,

471
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,920
this woman is the culprit in the Pei Xun case.

472
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,180
Those Puppet Worms

473
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,350
were merely brought from Dongzhou by Director Nan

474
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,590
to be scapegoats for this woman.

475
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,950
These two have shown disrespect in the imperial hall,

476
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,670
using sorcery to bewitch you, Your Majesty.

477
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,750
Their crimes warrant execution.

478
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:20,790
Lord Situ!

479
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:21,990
Meng Xizhou.

480
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,470
Stop talking.

481
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:24,510
Right Chancellor,

482
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,270
there's no need to escalate things like this.

483
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,950
The matter hasn't been fully investigated yet...

484
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,180
Today, not only do I have this suggestion,

485
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,940
but all the officials share this idea.

486
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,250
We concur!

487
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,920
Throw Nan Fengyi,

488
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,950
along with this woman,

489
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,030
into the imperial prison!

490
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:47,620
Await further judgment!

491
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:48,920
Is anyone there?

492
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:49,790
We've been wronged!

493
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,310
We are innocent!

494
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,270
We've been wronged!

495
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,070
Don't waste your energy.

496
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,220
This is the imperial prison.

497
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,270
There's no way out.

498
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,090
We're completely finished now.

499
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,250
We've offended the all-powerful Right Chancellor Situ.

500
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,950
Even the Emperor wouldn't listen to my explanation.

501
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,720
We're done for.

502
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:10,830
Oh, right.

503
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,940
Don't you have strong internal power?

504
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,220
That night in the mortuary,

505
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,970
you went "ha"...

506
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:21,550
and then

507
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,990
put out all the fires in the Court of Judicature and Revision,

508
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,270
right?

509
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,150
That internal power isn't something I can control.

510
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,430
You can control it?

511
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,560
Then it seems your technique

512
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,910
isn't very stable.

513
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,270
Lord Du also said...

514
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,830
that internal power

515
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,430
is...

516
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,700
demonic power.

517
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,510
Do I look like a demon to you?

518
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:18,910
No, no.

519
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,870
Absolutely not.

520
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,140
My Demon-Recognizing Pupils can see you very clearly.

521
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:22,920
You

522
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:23,990
are human.

523
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,890
Anyway...

524
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,030
today Situ Hanshan

525
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,690
set up that trap in the court.

526
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:35,910
No matter what we do,

527
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,070
he will lock us up.

528
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,950
We'd better stay put.

529
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:40,900
Especially since...

530
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,680
you've exposed your Demon-Recognizing Pupils.

531
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,030
The first one he wants to kill

532
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,350
is you.

533
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,170
It's here.

534
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:02,750
Let's go.

535
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:03,910
Let's go out and meet it.

536
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,070
What is this?

537
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:12,970
Smoke Dragon.

538
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,150
The Smoke Dragon of legend?

539
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:15,990
Yes.

540
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,990
It seems that besides that cat demon in Changle City,

541
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,430
there are indeed many more demons hidden.

542
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,350
That Celestial Master's Mansion is just a facade?

543
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,880
Are all those celestial masters just for show?

544
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,710
I'm not bad, am I?

545
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:42,820
Being with me,

546
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,720
your skills have improved quite a bit.

547
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,620
Tell me,

548
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,650
did Situ Hanshan send you?

549
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,980
[Smoke Dragon]

550
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,230
Cut the crap.

551
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,930
Go ahead and kill me, if you dare.

552
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,470
You're in our hands now.

553
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,150
Still acting tough, huh?

554
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:03,350
Director Nan,

555
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,190
torture him.

556
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,100
Why are you staring at me?

557
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,030
Torture him.

558
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,390
That technique of yours works.

559
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,120
Let me go.

560
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,600
How many demons like you, who haven't achieved a stable human form,

561
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,480
are there in Changle City?

562
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,310
Where are they all hiding?

563
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,110
More than you think.

564
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,390
Let go of me.

565
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,030
Let go of me!

566
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,540
Tell me,

567
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,240
what's your connection to the "Scroll of Mountains and Seas"?

568
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,190
The "Scroll of Mountains and Seas" again.

569
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,550
Why is he so concerned about

570
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,750
the whereabouts of the Scroll of Mountains and Seas?

571
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,230
I'll tell you.

572
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,070
We are the demons who escaped when the Scroll of Mountains and Seas

573
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,710
was used to seal us away.

574
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,280
Lord Situ gave us refuge

575
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,590
in Changle City.

576
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,150
So,

577
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,390
you are the demons that were missed when the Scroll of Mountains and Seas

578
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,230
sealed away demons back then,

579
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,520
rather than demons inside the scroll.

580
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,870
Have you seen the Scroll of Mountains and Seas since then?

581
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,640
I...

582
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,710
I've never seen it.

583
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,400
Please let me go.

584
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,360
Where has Situ Hanshan been hiding all of you?

585
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:09,610
Tell me!

586
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,210
Tell us now!

587
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:11,270
In...

588
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,550
In...

589
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,460
In...

590
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,260
In...

591
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,950
[Nine-Tailed Fox]

592
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,070
The Nine-Tailed Fox ranked tenth on the Hundred Demons List.

593
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:28,930
The Nine-Tailed Fox?

594
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:31,270
What...

595
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,350
What's the Hundred Demons List?

596
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,510
My father's demon-catching journal.

597
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,500
Who's your father?

598
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,150
Fortunately, I arrived in time.

599
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,850
Otherwise, our years-long secret

600
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,220
would have been completely revealed by that Smoke Dragon.

601
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,650
What are these? They're so cute.

602
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,160
Paper Control Technique.

603
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,750
I want to learn it too.

604
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:58,250
I won't teach you.

605
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,900
You're being too stingy.

606
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:06,710
Oh no, it's the illusionary technique.

607
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,430
What's the illusionary technique?

608
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:10,840
There's no time to explain.

609
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,710
The key to resisting the illusionary technique is to go against your natural thoughts.

610
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,950
Don't follow your own thoughts at all.

611
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,100
Don't go along with people's thoughts...

612
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,190
Director Nan,

613
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,420
I think you're...

614
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,470
Let me out.

615
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,940
Let me out!

616
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,020
Xiaolin?

617
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:36,960
Help me.

618
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,010
Help me out.

619
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,990
Am I not good enough?

620
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,510
Why can't you like us?

621
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,670
You're just a sick woman!

622
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:44,710
You don't deserve it at all!

623
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,950
You don't deserve it!

624
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:46,870
If they saw your true self,

625
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,390
who would really like you?

626
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,310
Your mother died giving birth to you!

627
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,150
Your father abandoned you and died for no reason!

628
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,750
You have no talent for anything you do!

629
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,870
You're the most unnecessary person in this world.

630
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,960
She doesn't deserve it at all!

631
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,390
Why did you deceive our love?

632
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,710
You're destined to die alone!

633
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,000
No one will like you, even if they die!

634
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,910
You're heartless and ungrateful!

635
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:05,790
You don't deserve it at all!

636
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,900
Stop it! Stop it!

637
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,470
Yeah.

638
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,940
The real me...

639
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,790
is not worthy of being loved.

640
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,140
Let me be alone...

641
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,330
for the rest of my life.

642
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,540
It's better this way.

643
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,270
So, what if you have Demon-Recognizing Pupils?

644
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,550
Someone like you, with no redeeming qualities

645
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,080
and such low self-esteem and self-deprecating,

646
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,390
doesn't deserve to truly possess them.

647
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:42,440
Meng Xizhou.

648
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,750
You need to believe

649
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:45,330
that you deserve to be loved.

650
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,840
You are a unique existence in this world.

651
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,390
A unique existence?

652
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,420
Yes.

653
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,430
You are.

654
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,020
As long as you don't care,

655
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,870
no one can hurt you!

656
00:26:59,570 --> 00:26:59,950
Right.

657
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,220
I am

658
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,720
a unique existence in this world.

659
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,750
No one can dictate whom I should like

660
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,200
or who should like me.

661
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,700
These choices should all be mine to make!

662
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:31,820
I apologize for the offense.

663
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,750
I broke through the Nine-Tailed Fox's illusion?

664
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:41,880
More or less.

665
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,910
Then in that illusion,

666
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,510
was it really you talking to me?

667
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,110
No, it wasn't.

668
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,640
It indeed doesn't sound like something he would say.

669
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,910
I understand now.

670
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,510
It must be that you've had another outburst

671
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,710
of that mysterious internal power,

672
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:00,490
then saved me

673
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,440
and broken through the illusion, right?

674
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,950
Because at the end of the illusion,

675
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,550
I also saw the same red light

676
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,070
as the one on your body.

677
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,190
But how can I control this internal power?

678
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,000
I don't know when it will suddenly erupt

679
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,600
or when it will disappear again.

680
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:14,790
Could it be...

681
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,630
related to her?

682
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,950
You guys keep talking back and forth.

683
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,230
Am I invisible to you?

684
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,630
How could she

685
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,950
break my illusion?

686
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:33,880
How could she?

687
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,740
Can't you see?

688
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,590
Because she's more powerful than you.

689
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,620
Now,

690
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,070
I will use your own methods

691
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,430
against you.

692
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,150
No, no.

693
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,740
No! No!

694
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,450
Has she...

695
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,090
fallen into the illusion that she created herself?

696
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,290
Brilliant,

697
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,090
Director Nan.

698
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:02,810
Tell me,

699
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,980
what are Situ Hanshan's next plans?

700
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,200
You have to act fast,

701
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,270
or it will be too late.

702
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,910
You have to act fast,

703
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,310
or it will be too late.

704
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,120
What will be too late?

705
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,550
The Puppet Worms won't survive for more than half a day.

706
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,160
Lord Situ must act tonight.

707
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:17,790
It's too late. It's too late.

708
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:18,610
Then tonight

709
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:19,710
is Situ Hanshan's

710
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,430
final chance to possess all the officials.

711
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,420
I've come

712
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,050
to specifically request punishment from you, Your Majesty,

713
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,500
and to admit my wrongdoings.

714
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,730
I

715
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,470
have failed your trust over the years,

716
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,580
allowing demons to run rampant in the world.

717
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,050
Your Majesty, I humbly request

718
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:43,910
that you punish me.

719
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,190
So,

720
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,020
in the hall today,

721
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,870
you believed Nan Fengyi

722
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,460
and that demon-discerning girl?

723
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,640
Yes.

724
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,650
It's quite clear

725
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,800
that the Right Chancellor

726
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,110
is hiding something.

727
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:57,730
Good.

728
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,480
I haven't misplaced my trust in you.

729
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:02,380
Could it be

730
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,210
that Your Majesty also believes

731
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:05,570
that in the imperial hall,

732
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,630
we wronged him?

733
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,650
It's more than just wronging him.

734
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,790
That Nan Fengyi

735
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,270
volunteered to be imprisoned.

736
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,950
I was merely cooperating with him

737
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,260
in putting on this act.

738
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,630
The Right Chancellor is in such a hurry

739
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,610
to punish and imprison both Meng Xizhou and me.

740
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,230
It seems he must have some urgent matters to do.

741
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,150
I might as well go along with his plan

742
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,670
and give him what he wants.

743
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,850
So this was a play staged by the Emperor

744
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,030
and you in the imperial hall?

745
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:35,380
Yes.

746
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,800
That really scared me.

747
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:37,830
Yeah.

748
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,640
However,

749
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,420
thanks to your Demon-Recognizing Pupils,

750
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,340
Situ Hanshan sent those two

751
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,260
to eliminate us.

752
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:45,310
But

753
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,510
also thanks to you,

754
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,130
your profound and mysterious technique...

755
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:51,600
I'll tell you again,

756
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:54,090
my technique is of great importance.

757
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,440
It's a secret between the two of us.

758
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,140
You must never tell another soul.

759
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:01,640
It seems...

760
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,480
this secret is

761
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,840
very important to you.

762
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,910
As for me,

763
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,090
I'm known for having a big mouth,

764
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:13,560
so I need some powerful incentive to keep my silence.

765
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:17,680
What do you want?

766
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,730
First,

767
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,750
teach me how to use talismans and formation techniques,

768
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,010
and also that cute little paper-man technique.

769
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,500
Second,

770
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,590
help me deal with the unofficial and official deeds

771
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:28,670
for Sikong She's house.

772
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,670
If you agree to these two conditions,

773
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,930
I'll take your secret to my grave.

774
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,160
How about it?

775
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,930
Your haunted house business is doing well.

776
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,110
Why do you insist on learning demon-catching techniques?

777
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,920
Becoming a demon hunter has always been my dream.

778
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,280
Moreover,

779
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:46,770
staying by your side

780
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,930
can help repair my leaked Qi Core.

781
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,730
With this woman by my side,

782
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,650
I'll have the chance to activate

783
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,080
that mysterious and powerful internal power within me

784
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,340
to fight against Situ Hanshan.

785
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,540
In addition,

786
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,750
if this woman happens to wander around me,

787
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,950
I might be drawn away as soon as I use my powers.

788
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:02,460
Right,

789
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:03,790
I can't let her leave.

790
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:04,650
I must keep her around me.

791
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,430
She'll be useful at crucial moments.

792
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,990
Well? Well? Well?

793
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:09,670
Alright.

794
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,830
Tonight, I'll test

795
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,510
whether you're qualified to learn from me or not.

796
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:16,700
You...

797
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,140
You can't be asking me

798
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,770
to catch those hundreds of Puppet Worms by myself, can you?

799
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,190
Then forget it.

800
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,320
My magical powers are weak.

801
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,210
I'm no match for them.

802
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,510
It's not up to you anymore at this point.

803
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,430
If you can't catch those demons,

804
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,770
you can wait and be thrown back in prison.

805
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:33,650
Again?

806
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,360
[Situ's Mansion]

807
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:37,740
Cheers.

808
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:39,790
Good wine.

809
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,180
The Right Chancellor has arrived!

810
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,010
Right Chancellor.

811
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:51,790
Right...

812
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,910
Thank you, Right Chancellor.

813
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:57,690
Gentlemen,

814
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,850
would you like to know

815
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:02,070
what true nectar of the gods tastes like?

816
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,120
Nectar of the gods?

817
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:06,180
That's a fine drink

818
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,950
served at the Peach Banquet of the Queen Mother

819
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,110
of the Western Heaven.

820
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,640
Please, gentlemen, come with me

821
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,840
to taste this nectar of the gods.

822
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:14,920
Okay, okay.

823
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:15,550
Let's go. Let's go.

824
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,970
Nectar of the gods. Nectar of the gods.
