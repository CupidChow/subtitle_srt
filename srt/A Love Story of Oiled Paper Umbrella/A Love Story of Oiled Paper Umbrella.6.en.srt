Thunder overcomes wind. Wind overcomes thunder.

5
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:51,750
Thunder overcomes earth.

6
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,840
Earth overcomes water.

7
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,550
Water overcomes fire.

00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,789
Ma...

9
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:00,990
Uncle Nan,

10
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:01,550
Morning.

11
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:03,790
Girl,

12
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:04,840
you're awake?

13
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,910
You're a pretty good drinker.

14
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,350
Let's drink together again some other time.

15
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,810
Sure thing.

16
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,270
Uncle Nan,

17
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,660
where's my Master?

18
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,880
He left for the Court of Judicature and Revision early this morning.

19
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,430
He really doesn't care about me anymore.

20
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:24,640
Well,

21
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,430
Yi said

22
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,180
that the sesame pastries on the table

23
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,030
are all for you.

24
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:29,990
Okay.

25
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,260
I'll take them then, Uncle Nan.

This is terrible.

28
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,710
Nan Fengyi is not here.

29
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,150
I was born with a defective Qi Core.

30
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,540
It has already leaked a lot.

31
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,860
Now, relying on my limited skills,

32
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,870
I'm afraid it's going to be tough.

Earth Control Technique?

38
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,230
It's a bit far.

39
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,640
The Five Elements Technique

40
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,930
is about fire, water, earth, thunder, and wind

41
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,630
transforming into each other in a cycle.

42
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,520
Fire overcomes wind. Wind overcomes thunder.

43
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,030
Thunder overcomes earth. Earth overcomes water.

44
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,790
Water overcomes fire.

45
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,720
To deal with the Five Elements Earth Technique,

46
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,590
what I need to use is...

47
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,390
the Five-thunder Flame Formation.

48
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:19,660
I summon the thunder.

49
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,560
Make ghosts lose their courage at the sight of the fires.

50
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,230
Five-thunder Flame,

51
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,710
break!

52
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,320
This girl

53
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,550
can actually use talismans.

54
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,409
This is the long-lost technique of the Baize family.

55
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,610
How could she possibly know it?

56
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,150
You're young and full of potential.

57
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,960
I am sincerely impressed.

58
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,290
As expected of Li Shiyi's daughter.

59
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,270
She indeed has some of my Senior's

60
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,100
talent from back then.

61
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,380
How's that?

62
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,470
Something's not right.

63
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,470
You were clearly so weak before.

64
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,080
People always grow and improve, you know.

65
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,030
If this is your true strength,

66
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,910
you can naturally pass.

67
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,230
Du Yuelian,

68
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,230
what do you mean by that?

69
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,620
You're just a real estate agent who sells haunted houses

70
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,990
and has caused deaths.

71
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,260
You've failed

72
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,150
the level one demon hunter exam for years.

73
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,830
How did you suddenly become capable of catching demons?

74
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,360
There must be

75
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,090
something fishy going on here.

76
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,430
Demon hunting

77
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,470
is extremely dangerous.

78
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,110
I will never allow anyone

79
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,510
without real ability

80
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,440
to pass the test.

81
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:38,470
Do you dare

82
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,510
to have another one-on-one fight with me?

83
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,830
Yuelian!

84
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,630
That's enough.

85
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,850
Our Celestial Master's Mansion is in need of talents now.

86
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,830
Master, that's not right.

87
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,020
That Agent Meng

88
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,370
is indeed a bit strange.

89
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:51,830
Previously,

90
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,830
she couldn't even pass

91
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,630
the level one demon hunter exam.

92
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,190
Du Yuelian,

93
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,630
now that I have passed the test,

94
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,470
your Celestial Master's Mansion should accept me.

95
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,620
That was a sneak attack!

96
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,430
It's still too far.

97
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,030
I can't help you.

98
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,060
Did you get hit?

99
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,510
At least

100
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,120
she finished the entire test by herself.

101
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:27,950
You sneak attacked me!

102
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,650
I wasn't trying to make things difficult for you.

103
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,130
I just wanted to test your strength.

104
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,350
Nan Fengyi?

105
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,170
My disciple?

106
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,659
What took you so long?

107
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,659
Since when did Meng Xizhou...

108
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,960
become your Master?

109
00:06:58,990 --> 00:06:59,510
Yes.

110
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,870
Meng Xizhou is my Master.

111
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,620
From today on, whoever goes against her

112
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,870
is going against me, Nan Fengyi.

113
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:09,870
My disciple...

114
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,350
Let's go.

115
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:10,750
Hold on!

116
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,860
Meng Xizhou has just defeated Master Bai.

117
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,950
I just wanted to test her real strength.

118
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:18,770
But she has proven herself.

119
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,580
She, a mere level one demon hunter,

120
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,910
yet managed to dodge an attack from me, a level three demon hunter.

121
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,080
Compared to these useless ones,

122
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,210
she's much stronger.

123
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,900
I have nothing more to say.

124
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,640
Agent Meng,

125
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,200

The purpose of our gathering today,

159
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,590
I believe you all know very well.

160
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,890
To capture Situ Hanshan and his accomplices!

161
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,070
Isn't that right, Junior?

162
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,800
As well as the body-possessed Puppet Spirits.

163
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,420
And the Mother of Puppet Worms.

164
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,710
You just had to add that.

165
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,190
That's right.

166
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,880
We recruit new members

167
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,770
to gather talented individuals from all over.

168
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,430
Everyone, we should pool our wisdom

169
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:03,360
and think about

170
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:04,710
what method we can use

171
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:05,970
to capture Situ Hanshan

172
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,710
and those Puppet Spirits who might have possessed others' bodies.

173
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,230
As you all know,

174
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,430
these Puppet Spirits

175
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,350
are puppets that wear human skins controlled by mermaid demons.

176
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,600
Their magical powers are not very high,

177
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,840
but the difficulty in catching them

178
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,230
lies in their lack of demonic aura.

179
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,030
Moreover,

180
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,350
they're all wearing human skin

181
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,260
and blending in with the city's population.

182
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,430
Even magical tools have trouble locating them.

183
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,680
As for this Situ Hanshan,

184
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,800
he's a mermaid demon

185
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,190
with extremely powerful magic.

186
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,330
Even if Lord Du and I were to combine our powers,

187
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,830
we'd still struggle to match him.

188
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,540
Finding Puppet Spirits is easy.

189
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:35,900
I have Demon-Recognizing Pupils.

190
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,330
Changle City is so big.

191
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,230
How can you cover it all alone?

192
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:41,990
Furthermore,

193
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,550
we're at a crucial moment.

194
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,170
These Puppet Spirits surely won't be running around everywhere.

195
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,110
Yuelian is right.

196
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,090
Now that the Puppet Worms have possessed human bodies,

197
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,900
they'll certainly be hiding in their homes.

198
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,000
Without clear targets,

199
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,830
even with Demon-Recognizing Pupils,

200
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,010
we have no way to search for them.

201
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,470
We should now focus our search

202
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,950
on Situ Hanshan

203
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,390
and his subordinate, Han Qi.

204
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,850
On the night the incident occurred at Situ's Mansion, Changle City

205
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,640
immediately implemented a curfew.

206
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,590
During the day,

207
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,670
there are also Director Nan

208
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,780
and the people from the Court of Judicature and Revision

209
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,070
guarding each city gate with Demon-Exorcising Talismans.

210
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,630
With such severe injuries, Situ Hanshan

211
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,980
couldn't possibly escape from Changle City.

212
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,710
Behind him,

213
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:20,910
there must be a powerful person protecting him.

214
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,430
Right,

215
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,350
just like that day...

216
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,600
You all saw it—

217
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,220
that purple mist came

218
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,460
and took away both Situ Hanshan and Han Qi.

219
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:30,950
But

220
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,230
Changle City is so big.

221
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,750
Where would that powerful person

222
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:34,910
hide him?

223
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,080
I think

224
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,130
someone like Situ Hanshan,

225
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,790
accustomed to comfort,

226
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:42,910
certainly can't endure hardship.

227
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,430
Come here.

228
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,160
If you ask me,

229
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,740
we should first search all the major restaurants in Changle

230
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:46,790
thoroughly.

231
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,080
We'll definitely find him.

232
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,390
What are you talking about?

233
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,190
You're completely wrong.

234
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,050
Let me tell you,

235
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,630
since that old guy is a mermaid,

236
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,510
he must be hiding in some obscure corner.

237
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,000
What lousy restaurant are you talking about?

238
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,560
Stop arguing, will you?

239
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,040
I think

240
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,340
he must still be hiding in the Celestial Master's Mansion.

241
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,470
As they say, "The darkest place is under the lamp,"

242
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:01,830
right?

243
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,620
Master,

244
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,680
these people

245
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,310
are good at catching demons,

246
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,140
but not so sharp with their minds.

247
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,910
Don't get involved in their discussion.

248
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:09,870
Come on, come on.

249
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,780
There's nothing to argue about!

250
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,330
I'm on your side!

251
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,730
Everyone, please don't resort to violence.

252
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,300
Harmony is the best, okay?

253
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,740
That's enough.

254
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:18,830
Exactly!

255
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,310
What he's saying doesn't make sense!

256
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:20,830
Enough!

257
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,430
Stop bickering!

258
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,470
Let's hear what Junior has to say.

259
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,670
Junior, go ahead.

260
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,470
I called you here

261
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,630
to discuss

262
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,670
how to find Situ Hanshan!

263
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,820
Not for you to act like headless chickens,

264
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:32,780
bumping around aimlessly!

265
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,450
It's truly disappointing.

266
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:35,770
Yuelian,

267
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,270
don't be too angry.

268
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,530
Everyone here means well.

269
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,630
If you ask me,

270
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,140
we should just show our own abilities.

271
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,910
You all,

272
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:46,860
did you hear that?

273
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,150
Junior!

274
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,060
Junior, wait for me!

275
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,770
That's good.

276
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,550
Since we're all demon hunters,

277
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,440
let's rely on our own abilities.

278
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,070
My disciple,

279
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:56,740
let's go.

280
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,710
M-Master,

281
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,830
Master Meng.

282
00:11:58,830 --> 00:11:59,470
Why are you...

283
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,380
Why are you also...

284
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,550
Lord Du.

285
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,110
We're going to catch demons too.

286
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,780
We'll report to you if there are any updates.

287
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,630
I, Nan Fengyi, from the Court of Judicature and Revision,

288
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,500
will surely assist Master Meng from the Celestial Master's Mansion

289
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,870
in capturing Situ Hanshan.

290
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:10,690
Goodbye.

291
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,770
You and I together

292
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,400
will find Situ Hanshan's whereabouts

293
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,370
faster than they will.

294
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,190
Master,

295
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,470
you're already amazing,

296
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,470
but

297
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,990
why do you still practice higher-level spells?

298
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,310
Could it be...

299
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,540
that you also want to become the world's best demon hunter?

300
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:30,820
That's your dream.

301
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,870
I'm not interested in titles or fame.

302
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:35,670
Master!

303
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,920
What is your dream then?

304
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,190
Being all pretentiously mysterious.

305
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,270
[Dan Wu Agency]

306
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,470
We're here.

307
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,990
Aren't we supposed to be looking for Situ Hanshan?

308
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,670
Why are we at my family's real estate agency?

309
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,320
To borrow the geomantic map from your agency.

310
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,460
Geomantic map?

311
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,460
On the night Hui Fang died,

312
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,480
I used a formation to immobilize Situ Hanshan.

313
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,690
Yet, he was rescued right under our noses

314
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,380
and vanished without a trace.

315
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,950
Don't you find that strange?

316
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,630
So, Master, you mean

317
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,420
that beneath the Situ's Mansion,

318
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,430
there must be secret passages?

319
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,090
Speaking of Chirp,

320
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,300
the poor child has had a tough life.

321
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,590
When she came from Xizhou to Changle,

322
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,260
she was only about four or five years old.

323
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,670
She couldn't even speak the official language fluently.

324
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,750
Every day, she followed me from dawn until dusk,

325
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,340
begging on the streets,

326
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,560
posting notices, and delivering name cards.

327
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,790
She did all sorts of menial tasks

328
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,280
and was often beaten and scolded.

329
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,480
Later, she began selling haunted houses,

330
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,150
and people called her a harbinger of death,

331
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,350
saying she was unlucky.

332
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,710
Fortunately, you were there

333
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,910
and didn't look down on her.

334
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,070
I found it!

335
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:58,670
Look.

336
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,240
The Situ's Mansion

337
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,110
is situated on East Market Street in Changle City,

338
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,540
the most expensive area of the city.

339
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,920
The street is flat and easily accessible from all directions,

340
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,390
surrounded by flowing water.

341
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,980
It's a prime location

342
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,020
that countless officials and nobles are dying to get into.

343
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,470
The layout of Situ's Mansion faces south.

344
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,710
Its artificial mountains in the northwest corner

345
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,380
connect the wine cellar and the kitchen.

346
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,910
If one modifies the kitchen

347
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,690
to create a flue,

348
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,680
it could lead directly to

349
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,720
Gou Street in the Taiping District, which is just a wall away.

350
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,340
This street is frequently passed by

351
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,240
carts carrying waste and night soil,

352
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,400
with few people passing by.

353
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,500
If Situ Hanshan had taken the passage through the artificial mountain...

354
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,140
I've carefully examined the artificial mountain

355
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,880
and found no traces of a secret passage.

356
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:36,550
This route isn't viable.

357
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,070
Not viable?

358
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,510
Then what about this area?

359
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,270
The Princess's Mansion and the Situ's Mansion

360
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,590
are both situated in the three-prestigious area of Tongyi District,

361
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,880
and between them,

362
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,180
there are many adjacent courtyards.

363
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,270
Moreover, the Princess's Mansion has remained abandoned for years.

364
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,390
So, could it be...

365
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,040
After the Situ's Mansion was broken down,

366
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,600
the guards stationed in Changle City

367
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,160
immediately moved into the Princess's Mansion

368
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,830
to respond to any situation.

369
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,710
Even if Situ Hanshan escaped there,

370
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:01,540
he would be walking into a trap.

371
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:02,920
So, this route...

372
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,250
They wouldn't take this route either.

373
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,470
So today...

374
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,900
we've achieved nothing?

375
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,380
How could that be?

376
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,150
Today, we at least learned

377
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,460
that even if Situ's Mansion had a secret passage,

378
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,990
it would be very difficult for them to escape.

379
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:19,670
Uncle Wu,

380
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,970
can I borrow this map?

381
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,540
She's in charge of everything in this agency.

382
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,670
It's yours.

383
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,790
Then I'll take it.

384
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,630
Uncle,

385
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,650
I'll take Chirp with me then.

386
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,310
Uncle Wu.

387
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,470
Master.

388
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:43,470
Where are we going?

389
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,710
I'm taking you to eat something delicious.

390
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,390
Let's go.

391
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,240
Master.

392
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,630
If Situ Hanshan

393
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,730
didn't escape through a secret passage,

394
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,880
does that mean we

395
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,010
really have to search every household?

396
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:19,990
Yes,

397
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,220
we need to search if necessary.

398
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,740
But I can't shake the feeling

399
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,730
that we've missed some clues.

400
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,030
Fresh vegetables here!

401
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,310
Come and take a look!

402
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,050
Situ Hanshan is a mermaid.

403
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,100
He doesn't need a secret passage.

404
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,940
There are all kinds of vegetables and fruits.

405
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,350
Fresh vegetables!

406
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,520
Master, you mean

407
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,460
he might have used the waterway?

408
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,430
[Map of Changle City]

409
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,690
It's the dry season now.

410
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,670
The water level is so low.

411
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,360
How did they manage to swim out?

412
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,590
Do you remember

413
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,120
there was a heavy rainstorm that night?

414
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,720
This secret canal

415
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,230
flows through the East Market's Release Pond

416
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,560
and continues through five districts: Guanghua, Tongyi, Tonghua, Kaihua,

417
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:09,599
and Chongyi.

418
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,440
Right now, it looks like the water level is low,

419
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,119
but after that night's heavy rain,

420
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,190
it would swell into a canal.

421
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:15,859
I see.

422
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,069
These mermaids

423
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,550
took advantage of that night's heavy rain

424
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,390
and swam through this hidden canal.

425
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,160
That's how they escaped the pursuit

426
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,349
of the Court of Judicature and Revision and the Celestial Master's Mansion.

427
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,589
Moreover, these mermaids don't need to surface for air at all.

428
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:27,900
This hidden canal is a natural escape route for them.

429
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:29,290
Impressive.

430
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,630
Then, let's follow this lead

431
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,790
and search house by house.

432
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,700
[General's Mansion]

433
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,320
General Sun's physique

434
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,600
is truly imposing and sturdy.

435
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,520
Is there a Puppet Spirit on him?

436
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,340
Is there a Puppet Spirit, or not?

437
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,370
No, there isn't.

438
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,110
If there isn't, then why did you stare at him for so long?

439
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,710
I...

440
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:05,470
-No.
-Next household.

441
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,000
Let's go.

442
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,390
Who's there?

443
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,390
Let me add some hot water for you.

444
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,150
This is the public bathhouse of the Ministry of Revenue.

445
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,210
It's not appropriate for a young lady like you to check this place.

446
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,530
Let's wait until they have finished bathing.

447
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,890
I'm doing this to capture the Puppet Spirits

448
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,340
to protect the Changle City.

449
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,900
Even if I see something indecent,

450
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,080
I shouldn't back down, right?

451
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,110
Wait here.

452
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,470
I think you're the type

453
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,910
who wants to stand at the top of the world

454
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,690
and overlook everything else.

455
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,040
Who's there?

456
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,750
-Who is it? 
-Who's there?

457
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,150
Well...

458
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,150
This arrogant?

459
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,620
It wasn't me, sir.

460
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:00,670
You can check now.

461
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,630
Master,

462
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,200
you're quite the talent.

463
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,270
So, are there any Puppet Spirits or not?

464
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,270
No.

465
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,580
We've searched all the places along the secret canal.

466
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,790
How come we haven't found any yet?

467
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:23,440
Let's keep looking.

468
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,470
[Fa'en Temple]

469
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:38,830
We almost got caught.

470
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:39,810
It's all your fault, Can.

471
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,080
Can't you put on some weight?

472
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,770
[Maid of the Crown Prince,  Bottle]

473
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,510
[Eunuch of the Crown Prince, Can]

474
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,470
You can't even block me. What kind of man are you?

475
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,250
How could you hit such a sore spot?

476
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,190
Bottle,

477
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,910
as the Crown Prince's attendants...

478
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,550
We, as the Crown Prince's personal attendants,

479
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:54,660
are hiding and sneaking around like this.

480
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,040
This is not how we should behave.

481
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,010
Keep your voice down.

482
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,920
You'd love for the whole world to know

483
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,700
that our Crown Prince has sneaked out, huh?

484
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:04,320
Here, Your Highness.

485
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,340
Bottle,

486
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:10,470
our Crown Prince

487
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,540
is truly a learned scholar.

488
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,050
Sneaking out of the palace to come here,

489
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,280
just to appreciate the works of renowned artists.

490
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,430
No, no.

491
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,330
It's clear you don't understand.

492
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,390
Then, why did he come here?

493
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,230
To make rubbings, of course.

494
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,070
What are rubbings?

495
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,810
Rubbings

496
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,510
are made by transferring the image of a painting

497
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,770
onto xuan paper, which you can take back and appreciate.

498
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,330
This is a refined pursuit unique to scholars and literati.

499
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,720
Oh, that adds up then.

500
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,690
So, our Crown Prince is indeed a learned scholar.

501
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,270
If His Majesty and Her Majesty

502
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,070
were to know about this,

503
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,330
they'd be overjoyed.

504
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,420
Before you praise him,

505
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,140
take a look at what he's actually making rubbings of.

506
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,820
[Crown Prince of Dazhou, Beigong Shuo]

507
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:07,710
Goddess,

508
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,730
I can finally see you day and night.

509
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,690
Who is the Goddess?

510
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,790
The Goddess is His Highness's latest object of affection.

511
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,090
His Highness is completely infatuated with her.

512
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,760
He feels miserable when he doesn't see her for a day.

513
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,210
That's why he took us with him

514
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,870
to make rubbings of the Goddess's portrait to bring back

515
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,180
to ease his lovesickness.

516
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,310
Wait,

517
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,100
why has His Highness fallen for a paper girl again?

518
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,150
Before, he was obsessed with the fictional girls

519
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,560
in folk stories.

520
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,660
Then he started appreciating

521
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,050
the beauties in paintings from previous dynasties.

522
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,480
And now...

523
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,150
Now,

524
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,240
I suppose this is kind of progress.

525
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:41,000
Look,

526
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,960
the texture of this stone figure

527
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:43,590
is at least better than

528
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,650
those flimsy paper girls, right?

529
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,710
Then, if it's rubbed onto paper,

530
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,940
it's still just a paper girl, isn't it?

531
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,630
What are you two whispering about out there?

532
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:55,950
Sorry, Your Highness.

533
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:57,710
Master,

534
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,210
something feels off here.

535
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,630
The temperature keeps fluctuating between hot and cold.

536
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,950
Just based on this geomantic map,

537
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,930
the Fa'en Temple should be at the end of the waterway.

538
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,590
It's not the Fa'en Temple.

539
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,500
It's the house next to it.

540
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:13,790
Who's there?

541
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:14,870
Who's there?

542
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:15,830
Your Highness, Your Highness!

543
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,670
What should we do? What should we do?

544
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,870
The usual plan.

545
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,160
You help me lead them away,

546
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:20,730
and later,

547
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,670
I'll get you out.

548
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:22,870
Hurry.

549
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:23,790
Your Highness!

550
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:24,500
Don't forget me!

551
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:25,630
Stop right there!

552
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,210
Go, go.

553
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,790
Freeze!

554
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:30,140
[Imperial Armory]

555
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,490
Fortunately, the rubbing wasn't damaged in the fall.

556
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:54,670
The Imperial Armory.

557
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,740
It's the place where the imperial court produces weapons.

558
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,710
Then this place should be heavily guarded.

559
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:02,830
Situ Hanshan

560
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,630
wouldn't be desperate enough to hide here, would he?

561
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:06,350
Unless this place

562
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,910
has long been Situ Hanshan's territory.

563
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,790
There's a dragon aura inside.

564
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:19,880
Could it be the Emperor?

565
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,390
Stay here and wait for me.

566
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,290
Don't go anywhere.

567
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,150
What about you?

568
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,350
I have to go in.

569
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:26,990
We agreed

570
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,170
to catch demons together.

571
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,900
The situation inside is complicated.

572
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,710
You stay here

573
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:31,370
and wait for me to come back.

574
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,430
Who are you?

575
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:46,780
I...

576
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,170
am Beigong Shuo, the Crown Prince.

577
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,790
You're really the Crown Prince?

578
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:52,830
Of course, I am.

579
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,420
You, lowly demon, are no match for me.

580
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,470
I advise you to surrender

581
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,040
and escort me back to the palace.

582
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,670
Then why are you sneaking into the Imperial Armory?

583
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:00,790
Insolent.

584
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,010
My purpose here is none of your business.

585
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,470
No matter who you are,

586
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,040
now that you've seen my true form,

587
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,360
you must die!

588
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,310
Help!

589
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,140
I, Nan Fengyi, Director of the Court of Judicature and Revision, apologize for my late arrival, Your Highness.

590
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,280
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

591
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:24,680
Nan Fengyi,

592
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,070
he...

593
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:26,510
He's a demon!

594
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:27,790
Your Highness,

595
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,120
you have the dragon aura to protect you.

596
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,540
Demons can't harm you in any way.

597
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,030
Please wait here.

598
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,230
Leave the rest to me.

599
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,760
You're saying

600
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,610
that the golden glow surrounding me just now was the dragon aura?

601
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:37,230
Yes.

602
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,510
In the entire realm,

603
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,270
only His Majesty and you are protected by the dragon aura.

604
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,070
Nan Fengyi!

605
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:48,040
You persistent pest, you've managed to chase me here.

606
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,070
Han Qi,

607
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,590
since you're here,

608
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,550
your master, Situ Hanshan,

609
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,830
must also be in the armory.

610
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,030
Capture him.

611
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,170
Take him back for a thorough interrogation.

612
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:58,790
Yes, Your Highness.

613
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,230
I...

614
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,550
am...

615
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:06,630
here.

616
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,070
Goddess?

617
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:25,830
Why are you here?

618
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,510
It's dangerous here.

619
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,380
Didn't we agree

620
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,630
to catch demons together?

621
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,070
No,

622
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,540
I absolutely won't leave you alone.

623
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,350
Absolutely not!

624
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,520
This isn't some dire situation.

625
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,550
I'm just going down to scout.

626
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,450
But who knows what's down there?

627
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,820
You're no longer the same

628
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,950
talentless Chirp you used to be.

629
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:45,200
Protect him.

630
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,760
Notify the Celestial Master's Mansion for rescue.

631
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,520
You shouldn't go.

632
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,260
Hurry and inform the people at the Celestial Master's Mansion.

633
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,190
That makes sense.

634
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,440
Hold this for me.

635
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,510
Go notify the Celestial Master's Mansion quickly.

636
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:09,130
Okay.

637
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,160
Goddess, you're so powerful.

638
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,860
Young man,

639
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,410
the Fa'en Temple is just on the other side of that wall.

640
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,310
You should escape first.

641
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,190
Then... what about you?

642
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,510
I have to go save him.

643
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:18,190
Don't...

644
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:19,660
Watch out!

645
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,630
It's alright.

646
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:26,310
It's fine.

647
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,870
I, the Crown Prince, am here.

648
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:38,700
Kneel down now.

649
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,310
What a joke.

650
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,400
How could the Crown Prince possibly be here?

651
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,990
Strange.

652
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,030
Master isn't around,

653
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,440
but how can my Demon-Recognizing Pupils still...

654
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:49,960
Do you believe I...

655
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:50,510
Watch out!

656
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:52,950
They are Puppet Spirits,

657
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,110
not humans.

658
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,180
Then, you take care of them.

659
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,630
Where are we going?

660
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,290
They've entered the Underground Palace.

661
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:04,510
It doesn't matter.

662
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,290
Going down there is just courting death.

663
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,500
Let go of me.

664
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,390
Let go of me.

665
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,550
Don't call me "Goddess" anymore.

666
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,070
Just call me Chirp.

667
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:27,900
Okay.

668
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,880
Goddess Chirp.

669
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,430
I thought I was going to drown.

670
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,070
Unexpectedly, at the bottom of this pool,

671
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:38,830
there's no water at all.

672
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:39,960
Instead, there's a city.

673
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,190
This Situ Hanshan

674
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,190
has been hiding the remnants of the demon clan in Changle City.

675
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:45,360
Unexpectedly,

676
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,060
he has been hiding them under the Imperial Armory.

677
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,180
He's even replaced all the guards with Puppet Spirits.

678
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:52,310
No wonder the Celestial Master's Mansion's demon-capturing formation couldn't find them.

679
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,680
You're a demon hunter.

680
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,470
Then you must be able to protect me.

681
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,510
You trust me that much?

682
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:03,430
Of course.

683
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:05,420
Alright.

684
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:06,610
Let's go.

685
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,750
Let's go check out what's ahead.

686
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,640
What's your name?

687
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:11,630
Where are you from?

688
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,610
My name is Beigong Shuo.

689
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,550
I am the Crown Prince.

690
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,210
Don't pretend to be the Crown Prince in front of me.

691
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,280
Do you know

692
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,430
how stupid that looks?

693
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,310
I'm not pretending.

694
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:22,990
I really am the Crown Prince.

695
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:26,070
Would the Crown Prince really need to sneak into the Imperial Armory?

696
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,790
Actually, I'm here for making a rubbing.

697
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,970
What's a rubbing?

698
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:32,310
Goddess,

699
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,070
look.

700
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:48,920
As expected of the Goddess,

701
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:49,870
you're amazing.

702
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,460
Then, what should we do now?

703
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:54,880
I need to save him.

704
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,710
Director Nan said

705
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,190
that you just need to protect me.

706
00:28:59,510 --> 00:28:59,950
Here's what we'll do.

707
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,580
You wait here for the people from the Celestial Master's Mansion.

708
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,550
I'll go in first to save him.

709
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,550
Don't.

710
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,680
It's too dangerous here.

711
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,020
Wait for me. I'll go with you!

712
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:15,710
There are so many entrances.

713
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,390
Which one is the real one?

714
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,510
What is this place?

715
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,190
I don't know.

716
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:30,630
But it looks like

717
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,870
a place where Puppet Worms possess human bodies.

718
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:36,990
Goddess, look.

719
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,190
What do these mean?

720
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,670
Gouging out hearts, eyes,

721
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:43,510
stripping scales, and collecting tears,

722
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,070
and finally, drawing blood.

723
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,750
This mural depicts the story of

724
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,480
how the mermaid clan has been

725
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,330
brutally killed by humans for the past hundred years.

726
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,510
Look, this small figure is...

727
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,200
A young mermaid demon.

728
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:56,630
Looks like

729
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,870
it's still a cub.

730
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,960
Although Situ Hanshan

731
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,750
and the Puppet Spirits didn't do anything good,

732
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,100
not all demons are bad.

733
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,030
You think so?

734
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:10,310
Of course.

735
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,540
There are good demons,

736
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,310
just as there are bad humans.

737
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,790
Situ Hanshan, come out!

738
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:22,990
Nan Fengyi?

739
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,030
Nan Fengyi!

740
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,110
Where are you?

741
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,150
Goddess, wait for me!

742
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:30,630
Nan Fengyi!

743
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:31,260
Chirp?

744
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,160
Where are you?

745
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,250
Han Qi?

746
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:43,630
Good.

747
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:51,990
It's you again.

748
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:52,910
Tell me,

749
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,030
where is Nan Fengyi?

750
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,120
Of course, he's gone to see my master.

751
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:56,910
Take me to see him.

752
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:58,010
You humans...

753
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,030
have to pay the price for the wrongs

754
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:02,480
you've committed against us demons!

755
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,670
I...

756
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,790
I killed a demon?

757
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,510
Meng Xizhou!

758
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:22,840
Nan Fengyi.

759
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,430
Nan Fengyi!

760
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:26,590
Nan Fengyi!

761
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:27,980
Meng Xizhou!

762
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,630
Nan Fengyi, where are you?

763
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,470
Nan Fengyi!

764
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,030
-Nan Fengyi.
-Meng Xizhou!

765
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,270
Nan Fengyi.

766
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,150
It seems

767
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,930
she's the one you love.

768
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,600
Too bad, she's already fallen into my trap.

769
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:47,480
Aren't you curious about

770
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,440
where that woman is now?

771
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,680
You can clearly hear her voice,

772
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,240
but you just can't see her.

773
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,230
Nan Fengyi.

774
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,680
Why can I hear his voice,

775
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:57,930
yet I can't find him?

776
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,200
Why can't I hear anything?

777
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:00,960
Could we fall for an illusionary technique?

778
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,630
Impossible.

779
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,270
I can sense him.

780
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,710
He's definitely nearby.

781
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,630
Is there a possibility...

782
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,070
that there exist

783
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,420
two parallel spaces, Yin and Yang?

784
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,200
Two parallel spaces, Yin and Yang?

785
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,510
It's a common setting in storybooks.

786
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,750
Yin and Yang, two parallel spaces.

787
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,630
Only by finding the connecting object that links them

788
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,870
can one make the two spaces

789
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,080
rotate with each other

790
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,030
or even merge.

791
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,130
Connect.

792
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,100
Have you heard of the ancients building the Seven Star Altar

793
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,540
to summon the east wind?

794
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,150
Of course.

795
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,920
That was a famous battle in history.

796
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:33,060
The ancients commanding wind and rain were quite impressive.

797
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,700
The wind-summoning technique was just a saying of the ancients.

798
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,470
In reality, it relied on astronomical calendars

799
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,180
and other mathematical knowledge to operate.

800
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,160
Master, you mean

801
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,460
that during that battle,

802
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,440
there was wind blowing from the east,

803
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,140
and he just used magic to borrow it?

804
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,300
Humans cannot truly control natural elements.

805
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,920
Only by learning astronomy, geography,

806
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:52,850
and the laws of the seasons

807
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,140
can one borrow the power of nature

808
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,970
to maximize the effect of techniques.

809
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,030
In that case,

810
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,680
I've also borrowed your power, Master.

811
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,030
If you can borrow it,

812
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,190
then it's your own ability.

813
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,760
Let me tell you.

814
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,430
She's actually right beside you.

815
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,920
But she just can't see you.

816
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,300
If you dare to lay a finger on this woman,

817
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,760
I'll make your life a living hell.

818
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,170
I won't let you die.

819
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,480
I'll make you become a Puppet Spirit,

820
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:22,710
living a miserable life...

821
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,470
Nan Fengyi, where are you?

822
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,570
Serving me.

823
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,480
Nan Fengyi!
