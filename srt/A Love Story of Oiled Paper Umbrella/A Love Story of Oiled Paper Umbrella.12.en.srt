1
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,789
My real name

2
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,920
is Baize Yi.

3
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,430
I'm the only descendant

4
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,070
of the Baize family,

5
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,840
once prominent demon hunters eliminated by the imperial court over ten years ago.

6
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,840
All these years, I’ve endured humiliation

7
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,560
just to get back

8
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,870
the Scroll of Mountains and Seas

9
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,710
that my father accidentally lost back then,

10
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,310
to suppress ten thousand demons.

11
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,150
Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

12
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,560
To suppress ten thousand demons.

13
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,190
Chirp, you're here.

14
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:32,840
Come on.

15
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,560
Okay.

16
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:36,990
Have a seat.

17
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,680
Why do you look troubled?

18
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,310
What happened?

19
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,190
Nothing.

20
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:48,910
Let's eat, Master.

21
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:51,590
Here.

22
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,520
Lately,

23
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,750
I've found little birds increasingly cute.

24
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,150
What's wrong?

25
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,280
Is it not cooked

26
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,120
or too hot?

27
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,590
Master,

28
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,470
if you master the Big Dipper Primordial Spell,

29
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,910
will you

30
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,400
catch me

31
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,310
with the Scroll of Mountains and Seas?

32
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:27,790
We haven't found the Scroll of Mountains and Seas

33
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,310
yet.

34
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,400
What if it is found?

35
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,430
Even so, I won't do it.

36
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,360
Talk is cheap.

37
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,000
How can I trust you?

38
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,079
I saw you

39
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,590
catch nine water demons at once

40
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,520
without mercy.

41
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,470
If I hadn't killed them,

42
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,870
they would have killed you and other innocent people.

43
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:46,790
Chirp,

44
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,310
I did it to protect you.

45
00:03:59,150 --> 00:03:59,870
All right.

46
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,630
Don't overthink it.

47
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,910
Don't push me away again.

48
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:06,870
Do you hear me?

49
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,910
If he can't master the Big Dipper Primordial Spell

50
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,840
and can't find the Scroll of Mountains and Seas for his life,

51
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,510
perhaps,

52
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,480
it'll be a good thing.

53
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,040
Situ Hanshan,

54
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,150
you are so cruel.

55
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,510
To my surprise, you killed your own kinds

56
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,110
to use their Demon Pills to repair yourself.

57
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,680
But unfortunately,

58
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,950
their Demon Pills in my body

59
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,680
still can't avoid my influence.

60
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,560
If you don't agree

61
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,480
to fulfill my wish,

62
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,950
I will keep pestering you

63
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,000
until

64
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,310
you die here.

65
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,159
Wish. Wish.

66
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,720
Don't you just want your daughter to call you father?

67
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,390
Fine,

68
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,920
I promise you.

69
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,480
If my wish is fulfilled,

70
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,750
my obsession

71
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,870
will disappear forever.

72
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:07,680
Tell me.

73
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,680
What should I do?

74
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,480
My father

75
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,920
is not in Changle City these days.

76
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,430
If you're in a hurry,

77
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,080
I'll fix the umbrella.

78
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,240
But

79
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,800
why do you suddenly come to repair the umbrella?

80
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,310
Well,

81
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,310
Yuelian

82
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,560
is going to celebrate her eighteenth birthday.

83
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,240
You mean giving her a broken umbrella to celebrate her birthday?

84
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,950
To be honest,

85
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,510
it is something left by her mother.

86
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,390
I want to fix this umbrella

87
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,190
and give it to her

88
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,870
to ease our tense father-daughter relationship.

89
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,040
In that case,

90
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,390
I'll fix this umbrella.

91
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,040
Master.

92
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,550
The plum blossoms on the umbrella

93
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,680
have blossomed.

94
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,560
When you get married,

95
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,390
I will make you an umbrella

96
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,120
to marry you.

97
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,830
Master, are you that confident

98
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,120
I will marry you?

99
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,240
Seems that I don't behave well.

100
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,870
I have to work hard in the future.

101
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,120
Meng Xizhou.

102
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,720
Why did you ask me to come to the umbrella shop?

103
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,360
Why do you

104
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,630
have this umbrella?

105
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,040
This is the umbrella

106
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,750
that your father asked Nan Fengyi to fix for you.

107
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,040
Du Fenglei?

108
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,390
Why...

109
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,040
Why would he come here to fix it?

110
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,950
I can see

111
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,310
that your father

112
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,040
loves you.

113
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,390
Do you know what Du Fenglei was like

114
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,480
when he was young?

115
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,560
He should be the same as he is now.

116
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,720
He is not ambitious,

117
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,430
always acting like

118
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,150
he's not interested

119
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:35,510
in anything.

120
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,270
When he was young,

121
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,360
he only cared about

122
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,480
his demon-catching career.

123
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,080
Dazhou was not peaceful at that time.

124
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,630
There were always endless demons left outside.

125
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,030
So my mother and I

126
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,270
gradually got used to loneliness

127
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,320
while we were waiting for him.

128
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,910
And then?

129
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,000
Mother,

130
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,080
where are you going?

131
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,750
Stay at home with me.

132
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,790
Silly girl,

133
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,390
your father finally got time today.

134
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,800
He asked me to go to Xunyang Restaurant

135
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,360
to watch a play with him.

136
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,910
Father finally got time to accompany you once.

137
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,960
I won't make a scene.

138
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,720
I'll wait for you to come back.

139
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,030
I'll bring you delicious food,

140
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:35,910
okay?

141
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,150
Gao Sheng.

142
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,630
Bring Master's favorite Biluochun.

143
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,390
Got it.

144
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,510
Madam, it's ready.

145
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,630
Madam,

146
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,080
here's your hot tea.

147
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,840
Enjoy yourself.

148
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,120
I'll drink it when Master comes.

149
00:09:59,320 --> 00:09:59,840
Madam,

150
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,600
Master...

151
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,440
Master has something else to do.

152
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,200
He can't come again.

153
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,000
I see.

154
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,510
It's raining outside.

155
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,710
Master said

156
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,630
you can use his umbrella on your way back.

157
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,510
Madam.

158
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:15,870
Okay.

159
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,030
Master

160
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,510
also said,

161
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,200
in a few days,

162
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,360
he'll find time

163
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,240
to watch the play ”A Wish for the Next Life” with you.

164
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,030
Okay.

165
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,030
Look,

166
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,390
I didn't lie to you, did I?

167
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,840
Your mother is back.

168
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:47,960
Mother!

169
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,550
Madam!

170
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,790
Mother!

171
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,510
Madam!

172
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,600
Madam, please hang in there.

173
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,840
Master will be here soon.

174
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,750
Madam, hang in there. Madam.

175
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,150
It's not Du Fenglei.

176
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,790
I killed the wrong person?

177
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,920
Mother!

178
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,880
Mother!

179
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,790
No wonder Nan Fengyi said,

180
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,360
after Lord Du killed the Scorpion Spirit,

181
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,720
he couldn't pull himself together.

182
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,790
Turns out

183
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,790
there is such a story.

184
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,720
But maybe,

185
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,790
you're not the only one

186
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,200
who is in great agony.

187
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,000
Would Du Fenglei

188
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,670
be in agony?

189
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
Maybe tears

190
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,960
didn't run down your father's face

191
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,000
but in his heart.

192
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,910
Your father said

193
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,510
your mother's surname was Mei.

194
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,030
So he specially asked us

195
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,270
to turn the traces of the blood

196
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,630
into the pattern of plum blossoms.

197
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,030
This umbrella

198
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,480
can be with you

199
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,240
for a longer time

200
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,840
after the repair.

201
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,360
Mother.

202
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,000
Mother.

203
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,510
No wonder Du Yuelian hates demons so much.

204
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,870
If this happens to me,

205
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,600
I might not be able to let it go.

206
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,390
The endless hatred

207
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,960
between humans and demons

208
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,630
is hard to resolve.

209
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,320
Junior,

210
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,670
happy birthday.

211
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,270
Today is my birthday.

212
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,120
I even forgot about it.

213
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,670
You did,

214
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,870
but Master didn't.

215
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,320
Let's go.

216
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,280
Let me show you.

217
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,870
Today

218
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,840
is your birthday.

219
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,270
Master started to arrange this

220
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,630
a few months ago.

221
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,480
Look at these dishes.

222
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,840
These are all your favorite dishes.

223
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,720
Especially this longevity porridge.

224
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,080
Master

225
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,630
specially asked the cook from Huyu Restaurant here to cook it.

226
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,030
Yuelian,

227
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,630
I'll be glad if you like it.

228
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,320
Don't just stand here.

229
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,200
Sit down, please.

230
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,440
Here.

231
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,390
I haven't seen you for a few days.

232
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,240
I was worried just now.

233
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,240
I thought

234
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,630
I couldn't see you again tonight.

235
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,150
The flood control of the Lingshan Guard

236
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,270
is almost over.

237
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,120
I've been busy with these things lately.

238
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,790
30% of the refugees

239
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,870
have been placed in the refugee camp.

240
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,840
The rice provisions given by His Highness

241
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,480
have been distributed by porridge shops.

242
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,550
Junior,

243
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,550
today is your birthday.

244
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,270
Let's talk about these things tomorrow.

245
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,000
You

246
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,550
are a birthday girl today.

247
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,320
You should enjoy your birthday.

248
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,320
In doing so,

249
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,480
Master's efforts

250
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,840
will mean something.

251
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,960
Am I right, Master?

252
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:29,550
Yes.

253
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,840
You're right.

254
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,030
Tonight,

255
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,510
I just want you to be happy.

256
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,360
I fetched the umbrella

257
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,390
you wanted to fix.

258
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,840
Show me.

259
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,960
It's so beautiful.

260
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,390
It's like the withered trees welcome a revival.

261
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,910
Plum blossoms are blossoming.

262
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,030
In that case,

263
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,960
your mother

264
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,840
will be with us forever.

265
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:17,630
Thank you.

266
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,120
From now on,

267
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,880
can you call me father?

268
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,120
How about

269
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,080
you say it now?

270
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,200
It's okay. It's okay.

271
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,720
We can't force her.

272
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,670
She can call me father

273
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:42,480
when she wants to.

274
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,120
Then... Let's eat something.

275
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:44,840
Let's eat something.

276
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,320
Junior,

277
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,960
try this longevity porridge.

278
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,000
Try it.

279
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,200
You should try it too.

280
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,110
What's wrong?

281
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,630
You don't like it?

282
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,630
Coriander tastes weird.

283
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:37,870
Junior,

284
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,630
let me propose a toast to you.

285
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,600
Happy birthday

286
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,550
to you.

287
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,910
I've thought about it for a long time.

288
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,240
I have to do something.

289
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,349
I'll teach you how to break the demon-catching techniques.

290
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:10,880
Master,

291
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,310
each technique has its weaknesses.

292
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,400
If I master it,

293
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,480
in the future,

294
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,440
even if you master the Big Dipper Primordial Spell,

295
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,440
it

296
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,160
may be broken by me.

297
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,720
Even so, I'm willing to make you feel safe.

298
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,640
Although

299
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,150
this is against the right way of catching demons,

300
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,800
I'm willing to do so

301
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,640
to protect you.

302
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,350
First of all,

303
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,720
I will teach you

304
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,640
how to change the shape of being a human and a demon.

305
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,310
This is a practical lesson.

306
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,590
You manifested a demon shape,

307
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,400
so I cast a spell on you

308
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,070
to help you maintain your human shape

309
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,240
and keep away the demonic aura.

310
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,720
If someone breaks the spell

311
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,550
and you show a demon shape,

312
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,960
you can recite a spell:

313
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,120
Moduonan,

314
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,200
Dulu Dulu,

315
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,310
Diwei Suoha.

316
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,110
Then you can resume a human shape.

317
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,440
On the contrary,

318
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:08,680
if you manifest a human shape,

319
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,200
by reciting this spell,

320
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,200
you can instantly change into a demon shape.

321
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,750
Moduonan,

322
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,440
Dulu Dulu,

323
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,070
Diwei Suoha.

324
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,590
Got it, Master.

325
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,920
I'll try it

326
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:24,840
now.

327
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,790
Moduonan,

328
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,000
Dulu Dulu,

329
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,350
Diwei Suoha.

330
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,310
Tonight, I've enhanced the formation

331
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,640
around.

332
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,680
No one will see you.

333
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,310
Just fly freely.

334
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,200
I'll be with you.

335
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,350
It's the best Biluochun.

336
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,030
Please have a taste.

337
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,000
You've given up the habit of not drinking tea

338
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,200
for many years.

339
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,550
Why

340
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,830
have you picked it up again lately?

341
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,440
You haven't washed your sweaty feet

342
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,920
for more than ten years.

343
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,880
But now you wash them every day.

344
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,680
I've become more hygienic lately.

345
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,400
What's wrong with that?

346
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,880
You used to

347
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:08,880
feel hot,

348
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,960
but now you're afraid of coldness.

349
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:11,920
Of course,

350
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,750
even though you

351
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,960
have given up these trivial habits,

352
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,070
you even forgot

353
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,110
coriander is your favorite.

354
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,310
Are you still my master?

355
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,480
Or,

356
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,640
are you a human

357
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,960
or a demon?

358
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,200
Just cut to the chase.

359
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,310
No matter what you are,

360
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,270
I

361
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,920
only want to pursue my career.

362
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:11,720
Keeping me

363
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,520
will be good for you.

364
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,790
If there's something inconvenient to do in the future,

365
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:15,550
I

366
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,880
will follow you and serve you well.

367
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,350
Aren't you afraid of death?

368
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:24,510
Yes.

369
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm most afraid of living a mediocre life and achieving nothing.

370
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,160
I'm also afraid that Junior...

371
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,350
If I can live a wealthy life

372
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,640
with you,

373
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,400
I'm not afraid of death.

374
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,440
I can help you get rid of Nan Fengyi,

375
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,790
as well as Meng Xizhou with Demon-Recognizing Pupils.

376
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,270
Are you so sure

377
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,880
you can get rid of both of them?

378
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,270
Do you want to know

379
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:00,200
who Nan Fengyi really is?

380
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,670
You've found it?

381
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:17,550
Guo Ji.

382
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,270
Yes.

383
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,640
I now order you

384
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,830
to thoroughly investigate the case of Nan Fengyi colluding with the demon.

385
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,240
Yes, My lord!

386
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,880
Du Fenglei!

387
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,750
You jerk!

388
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,720
I did what you said!

389
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,790
Why are you still torturing me?

390
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,030
Have you forgotten?

391
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,030
Once Yuelian calls me father,

392
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,750
I'll disappear.

393
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,830
If she doesn't do so,

394
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,680
what can I do with her?

395
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,000
I couldn't make it realized all my life,

396
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,720
let alone you.

397
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,510
Yuelian,

398
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:35,920
what’s wrong?

399
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,030
Why are you looking at me like that?

400
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,070
Today

401
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,000
is Mother's death anniversary.

402
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,440
Have you forgotten?

403
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,750
I've been too busy lately.

404
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,350
I even forgot such an important matter.

405
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,350
It's my fault. It's my fault.

406
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,440
It's okay.

407
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,110
I burned joss paper for Mother this morning.

408
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,680
I was careless.

409
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,720
On my way back,

410
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,160
I passed by Xunyang Restaurant.

411
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,790
The play you and Mother didn't get to watch

412
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,000
is put on again.

413
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,110
Really?

414
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,590
Do you still remember the name of the play?

415
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,750
Of course not.

416
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,070
Once Yuelian

417
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,590
calls me father,

418
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,240
I'll disappear.

419
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:44,960
Yuelian,

420
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,830
how about

421
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,920
we go to watch the play together?

422
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,510
Just take it as compensation

423
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,750
for your mother.

424
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,680
Really?

425
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:58,830
Yes.

426
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,110
Okay.

427
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,000
Back then,

428
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,480
Mother also booked the entire place.

429
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,880
She just sat where we're sitting now.

430
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,680
Today,

431
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,590
we're sitting where she used to sit.

432
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,640
Wanping,

433
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,550
today,

434
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,030
I came here with Yuelian

435
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,200
to watch the play with you.

436
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,240
What's the name of this play?

437
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,640
"A Wish for the Next Life."

438
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,400
What is it about?

439
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,920
A poor scholar

440
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,030
falls in love with a rich girl.

441
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,240
After they make a solemn pledge of love to each other,

442
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,640
the scholar goes to take the exam.

443
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,880
But he never comes back.

444
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,510
It's said

445
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,920
he must have passed the exam and forgotten her.

446
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,680
The rich girl is left alone.

447
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,750
Liang Sheng,

448
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,680
I've waited for you for the rest of my life.

449
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,270
Maybe, you

450
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,480
have long forgotten the promise

451
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,590
to marry me.

452
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,070
After drinking this bowl of Soup of Oblivion,

453
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,550
I

454
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,880
will let you go.

455
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,510
Mengru,

456
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,960
I've never

457
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,110
forgotten our promise.

458
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,480
Liang Sheng.

459
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,960
I didn't go anywhere.

460
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,310
After leaving you,

461
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,270
I went to the capital to take the exam.

462
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,510
But I met a robber on the way.

463
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:22,590
I died tragically.

464
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:24,880
In order to wait for you,

465
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,960
I gave up the chance for reincarnation.

466
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,110
By the Bridge of Oblivion,

467
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,160
I've waited for you for six decades.

468
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,110
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

469
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:41,680
I drank the Soup of Oblivion.

470
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,400
Once you walk over the bridge,

471
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,830
you can reincarnate into the next life.

472
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,070
I don't want to start over!

473
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,720
I don't want you

474
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,510
to stay here forever!

475
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,200
To meet with someone who truly understands you is already fulfilling.

476
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,590
Isn't that what you said?

477
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,590
I can't forget you.

478
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,240
Hanshan,

479
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,000
let's go home.

480
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,400
Master,

481
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,390
do you really want to do so?

482
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,640
How could I

483
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,350
forget our promise?

484
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:25,960
Master,

485
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,550
I really miss you.

486
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,590
I've never left you.

487
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,030
What's going on here?

488
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,160
Yuelian,

489
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,400
what are you doing?

490
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,440
Situ Hanshan,

491
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,480
you want me to believe that you are Du Fenglei?

492
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,440
No way.

493
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:08,880
Situ Hanshan,

494
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,030
your men

495
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,190
are either taken away by Nan Fengyi,

496
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:11,960
or

497
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,880
guarded by those from the Court of Judicature and Revision

498
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,030
outside Xunyang Restaurant.

499
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,510
There are only three of us

500
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,160
left here.

501
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,350
Turns out you asked Nan Fengyi

502
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,590
to take Guo Ji and my men away.

503
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,480
If not,

504
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,240
how could you come with me?

505
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,350
You've known something is wrong with me since earlier,

506
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,350
right?

507
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,240
Of course.

508
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,920
In the case of the Lingshan Guard,

509
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,640
as planned, you took Nan Fengyi away

510
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,640
and lured me out.

511
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:38,000
You almost got us killed underwater.

512
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,200
At first, we thought

513
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,240
it was just a certain demon that did this.

514
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,440
But when we saw the bodies of Fan Yong

515
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,030
and the nine demon children,

516
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,790
and when the Demon Pill disappeared,

517
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,400
we assumed

518
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,790
the mastermind

519
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,720
was not simple.

520
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,310
Du Fenglei and I

521
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,960
had a promise.

522
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,240
Only if one of us dies

523
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,160
one day,

524
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:09,160
Mother's umbrella will be sent for repair.

525
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,440
But if Du Fenglei were alive,

526
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,960
he wouldn't have had it repaired.

527
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,640
I knew

528
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,000
Du Fenglei

529
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,360
was not that simple.

530
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,720
He asked me to fulfill his wish

531
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,830
just to deliver information to you.

532
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,350
Although you use his skin,

533
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,920
you will never become him!

534
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,830
Since my mother passed away,

535
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:42,110
Du Fenglei stopped drinking Biluochun.

536
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,360
He even stopped drinking tea.

537
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,480
Everyone in Changle City knows

538
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,480
what Right Chancellor Situ Hanshan hates the most

539
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,400
is coriander.

540
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,880
You two little girls

541
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,830
want to kill me?

542
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:09,720
Dream on!

543
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,070
Five-thunder Flame.

544
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,400
Break!

545
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:36,920
Yuelian!

546
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,310
Du Fenglei!

547
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,550
Du Fenglei.

548
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,440
Du Fenglei?

549
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:44,550
Yuelian,

550
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,310
attack my leg.

551
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,440
My leg is his weakness.

552
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,270
I've trapped his flesh body

553
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,480
with Five-thunder Flame.

554
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,550
Du Yuelian,

555
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,830
hurry up!

556
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,550
It...

557
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,720
It hurts so much!

558
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,350
Stop, Yuelian!

559
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:00,830
Yuelian,

560
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:01,790
don't listen to him!

561
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,240
Today is the best time to kill him!

562
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,830
Kill my flesh body!

563
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,590
Yuelian,

564
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,790
are you willing

565
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,790
to watch me die without doing anything?

566
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,070
I'm your only family

567
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,070
in this world!

568
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,920
Yuelian,

569
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,510
don't bother about me.

570
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,510
Kill him

571
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,160
with my Qi Sword!

572
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,310
Yuelian,

573
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,550
what should you do if I die?

574
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,640
I can't hold on any longer!

575
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:31,680
No.

576
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,150
I can't do it!

577
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,480
Situ Hanshan,

578
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,960
a protective barrier formation has been set up here

579
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,160
by Nan Fengyi.

580
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,750
You can't escape!

581
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:57,790
Du Yuelian,

582
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,350
I didn't expect

583
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,400
that you would be so useless at such a critical moment!

584
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,310
He is Situ Hanshan!

585
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,240
Don't let your father die in vain!
