[Episode 7]

3
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,310
I won't let you die.

4
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,509
I'll make you a puppet spirit.

5
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,710
You'll have a miserable life.

6
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,550
Nan Fengyi, where are you?

7
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,509
To be used by me.

8
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,110
White Dew 936.

00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,710
Autumnal Equinox 714.

Goddess.

11
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,590
What are you talking about?

12
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:02,910
After the Autumnal Equinoxay, night is longer.

13
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:03,830
Everything has a living soul.

14
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:04,910
Thunder and lightning.

15
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,830
Earth shaking.

16
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:06,710
Nan Fengyi.

17
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,550
I'm transmitting all my powers to you.

18
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,080
If you can sense it,

19
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,430
link up with me now.

20
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,990
You are a demon.

21
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,310
I should have known.

22
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,680
On the day the Court caught fire,

23
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,800
it was also a sudden burst of demon powers

24
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,550
that alerted the demon-capturing formation of the Celestial Master's Mansion.

25
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,800
Although I was born a demon,

26
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,030
we're not two of a kind.

27
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,270
Then why do you have such strong demon powers?

28
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,550
It's not demon powers.

29
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,110
It's the internal power I've been honing for years.

30
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,220
Situ Hanshan,

31
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,270
your time has come.

32
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,320
I told you not to come.

33
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:18,950
What are you doing here?

34
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,350
I actually transmitted all my powers to you.

35
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,920
I'm good.

36
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,510
Chirp.

37
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,750
Goddess.

38
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,300
Your Highness.

39
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,640
Chirp passed out.

40
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,900
Please take good care of her.

41
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,710
Goddess.

42
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,590
How could she break my Yin and Yang Realms?

43
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:44,950
That's impossible.

44
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,350
You killed one of my best men.

45
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,190
I'll kill you all!

46
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,230
Situ Hanshan.

47
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,380
I've been looking for you.

48
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,190
What is this?

49
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,830
The Annihilative Formation,

50
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,190
especially designed for mermaid demons.

51
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,070
You'll be lucky

52
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,280
to die in it.

53
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,680
Your master's paperman

54
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,510
lost its power halfway.

55
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,010
Luckily, I was on patrol.

56
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:13,920
I arrived early.

57
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,510
Looks like Chirp still needs to practice her spells.

58
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,120
There's someone behind him.

59
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,030
I got her.

60
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,830
Wait.

61
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,510
What are they doing?

62
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,510
Your Highness, we should go!

63
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:43,550
Wait.

64
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,750
What's your relationship with her?

65
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:45,830
Master and apprentice.

66
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,600
It doesn't seem that way.

67
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,270

73

Are you okay?

74
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,150
We were so scared.

75
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,830
Are you okay?

76
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:57,710

Chirp, are you okay?

81
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,190
Are you dead?

82
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,000
She fainted.

83
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,060
Are those Bottle and Can?

84
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:19,430
Yes.

85
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,350
That's strange.

86
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,070
When did it happen?

87
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,430
Why didn't I know?

88
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,830
Those clothes are not mine.

Anomaly in the sky.

90
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,540
That can't be good.

I'm taking my master home to rest.

98
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,550

00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,430
Have you caught him?

118

No.

119
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,510
He ran away again.

120
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,460
Is it possible that the Imperial Armory

121
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,480
isn't Situ Hanshan's last hideout?

122
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:43,710
I'm afraid

123
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,150
there's a bigger force behind him.

124
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,540
Why do you say that?

125
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,550
When we got out yesterday,

126
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,310
there was an anomaly in the sky.

127
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,430
Although they were in the Yin and Yang Clouds,

128
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:56,950
they had no recollection

129
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,950
of that happening.

130
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,190
Things that never happened.

131
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,360
So what does it

132
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:06,670
indicate?

133
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,190
It indicates

134
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,510
something is wrong in the palace.

135
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,110
What if the demons are after His Majesty?

136
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,810
His Majesty and His Highness are both protected by the dragon aura.

137
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,580
Demons can't hurt them.

138
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:22,910
It won't do them

How about this, Master?

141

00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:35,630
Stay here.

147
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,390
How many times did I tell you

148
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,440
not to go down there?

149
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:43,909
But you had to.

150
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,150

00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:55,870
I was

155
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,710
worried.

156
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,320
I was afraid…

157
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,680
I'd never see you again.

158
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,390
Besides,

159
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,390
I killed Han Qi.

160
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,430
Am I awesome or what?

161
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,230
You killed Han Qi?

162
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,530
I also broke Situ Hanshan's

163
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,510
Yin and Yang Realms.

164
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,190
What do you think, Master?

165
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,970
I didn't embarrass you, right?

166
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,390
She actually broke the Yin and Yang Realms.

167
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,190
If I said you got lucky,

168
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,190
would you think it's unfair?

169
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,150
Of course I would.

170
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,309
The Yin and Yang Realms are not connected.

171
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,110
Unless the realm you are in

172
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,669
is connected to something

173
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:42,990
in the other realm.

174
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,140
You and I are connected.

175
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,510
You and I

176
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,270
are not even real master and apprentice.

177
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,320
We are definitely not connected.

178
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,790
We'll be drawn to each other

179
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,030
if we're within ten meters.

180
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,910
That's real connection.

181
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,740
I could hear it and feel if

182
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,630
when you were fighting with

183
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,630
Situ Hanshan.

184
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,310
What about you?

185
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,260
Did you feel nothing?

186
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,830
Nan Fengyi, where are you?

187
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,470
Nan Fengyi.

188
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,160
Don't talk about our relationship

189
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,550
as if it's special.

190
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:20,870
All this time,

191
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,710
you've been contradicting yourself.

192
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,220
You've been practicing at night until you cough up blood.

193
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,270
You've been hiding the fact

194
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,790
that you have great powers.

195
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,310
You don't let anyone know your actual strength.

196
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,020
Don't pretend to know.

197
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,870
You don't know what I'm hiding.

198
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,550
I know you're hiding a lot.

199
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,510
You

200
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,830
bought me new shoes,

201
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,030
but lied to me that you had a sister.

202
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,210
You bought me sesame pastry,

203
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,350
but you said

204
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,230
it was for your friends at the Court of Judicature and Revision.

205
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,590
You clearly care about me and worry about me.

206
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:01,860
Put me down.

207
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,080
You're heavy.

208
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,670
My shoes are already wet.

209
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,870
Can't let your shoes get wet too.

210
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,870
But you always push me away.

211
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,480
Master,

212
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,150
do you have feelings…

213
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,990
No.

214
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:20,950

345

in the middle of the night?

346
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,069
I told you,

347
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,670
I went to Fa'en Temple to relax.

348
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,150

349
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:28,940

355
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,270
A few days ago,

356
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,720
His Highness went to Fa'en Temple

357
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,950
and saw a painting of the Goddess.

358
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:46,830
Started to

359
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:47,900
thinking about her day and night.

360
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,060
Do you have to tell the truth?

361
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,110
So, His Highness disguised himself and went there.

362
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,260
The guards found us soon after

363
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,910
we finished making a rubbing from the painting.

364
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,230
So we had no choice

365
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,790
but to climb over the wall and go to the Imperial Armory next door.

366
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,340
I was wrong about you.

367
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,500
You used to buy a lot of bad novels.

368
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,690
Now, it's all because of a stupid painting.

369
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,110
Burn them all!

If you burn those,

372
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,350
I'll lose my connection

374
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,350
I can only learn what the people like

375
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,150
or hate

376
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,980
from other people,

377
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,070
instead of judging for myself.

378
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,950
Ridiculous!

379
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:22,950

00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,150

381
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,750
There are demons in Changle City.

382
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,070
Demons in the Imperial Armory.

383
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,510
It's obvious that Situ Hanshan has

384
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,940
so much clout in Changle City.

385
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,390
As the Crown Prince,

386
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,230
you indulge in novels all the time.

387
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,590
How can the officials find you convincing?

388
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,550
Just a few days

389
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,710
before his coming-of-age ceremony.

390
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,510
I think

391
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,230
we should cancel it.

392
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,640
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

393
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,510
It's my fault.

394
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,950
I've been indulging him too much.

395
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,950
I didn't stop him when I found out

396
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,270
he only likes women on papers,

397
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,790
which led to this.

398
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,260
The Crown Prince's Coming-of-Age Ceremony

399
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,870
concerns the royal family's dignity and Dazhou's future.

400
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,530
You can't cancel it.

401
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,260
Besides,

402
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,330
he just likes novels and paintings of Goddesses.

403
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,340
It's not the worst hobby in the world.

404
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,600
How about this?

405
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,070
After the ceremony,

406
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,650
I will make arrangements for him to choose someone to marry.

407
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,450
I'll pick someone as talented and beautiful

408
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,950
as the Goddess in the painting.

409
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:33,570
Okay?

410
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,940
Getting married?

411
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,390
I'm way too young.

412
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:36,990
I don't want to.

413
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,150
Shut up!

414
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,680
A man will grow up after getting married.

415
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,390
Am I right?

416
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,030
Miao Yun,

417
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,410
you understand me.

418
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,440
Although you're not his biological mother,

419
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,110
you really care about him.

420
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,860
Thank you.

421
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:02,590
Come on,

422
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:03,930
apologize to your father.

423
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,380
Father.

424
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,870
Father, I know I was wrong.

425
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,460
I know.

426
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,000
From now on,

427
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,350
I'll never leave the palace without permission again.

428
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,590
You really made me worried.

429
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,270
Your Majesty.

430
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,330
Director Nan is here.

431
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,060
What is Nan Fengyi doing here?

432
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,060
Bring him in.

433
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:38,790
Yes.

434
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:39,710
Nan Fengyi.

435
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,810
His master

436
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,470
saved my life in the Imperial Armory.

437
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,600
He has a master?

438
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,470
A woman named Meng Xizhou.

439
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,500
She came down from the sky with a paper umbrella,

440
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,070
like the Goddess.

441
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,310
You're talking about

442
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,870
that girl who has Demon-Recognizing Pupils?

443
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,340
Yes, that's her.

444
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,630
Her father was the world's greatest demon hunter,

445
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,630
Li Shiyi.

446
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:05,990
She's promising.

447
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,630
Even Your Majesty knows her.

448
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,750
We should thank her.

449
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,480
I think so too.

450
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,260
Greetings, Your Majesty.

451
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,390
Your Majesty.

452
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:22,710
Your Highness.

453
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,270
Nan Fengyi.

454
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,240
How is Goddess's injury?

455
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,910
Master has fully recovered.

456
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,710
There's nothing to be worried about,

457
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,750
Your Highness.

458
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:43,590
Your Majesty must have something important to discuss with Director Nan.

459
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,620
I'll leave you to it.

460
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:49,110
Okay.

461
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:49,830
I shall take my leave, Father.

462
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,590
You have a really big mouth.

463
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:55,930
How's it going?

464
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,780
We found out

465
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:58,910
more than

466
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,510
40 officers and guards of the Imperial Armory

467
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,150
had been made into puppet spirits.

468
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,000
So many people.

469
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,040
And the Court raided Situ's Mansion,

470
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,070
the Ministry of War and other departments

471
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,020
from the Ministry of War and other departments

472
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,710
Found a total of more than 30 people

473
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,190
had colluded with Situ Hanshan.

474
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,340
All have been punished according to law.

475
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:17,750
Good.

476
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:18,790
Nan Fengyi.

477
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,170
I appreciate your abilities.

478
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,300
You are so much better than those

479
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,070
from the Celestial Master's Mansion.

480
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,040
But you know,

481
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,590
with your real identity,

482
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,660
there's nothing else

483
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,250
I can do for you.

484
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,510
It's my duty

485
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,910
to serve Your Majesty.

486
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,750
There's one more thing

487
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,440
that's been disturbing me.

488
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,000
I'd like to report it.

489
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:45,790
Go ahead.

490
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,270
The night of the Imperial Armory raid,

491
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:49,510
Yin and Yang Clouds

492
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,490
appeared at the same time.

493
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,390
A crack in the sky.

494
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,040
And a mirage.

495
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,070
What did it mean?

496
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:03,790
It meant…

497
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,930
[Prince's Palace]

498
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,590
What are you doing here?

499
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,510
We've got the Goddess's information, Your Highness.

500
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,920
Come on, read it to me.

501
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,230
Meng Xizhou, born in Xizhou.

502
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,810
Followed her foster father to Changle City at 6.

503
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,800
Has a foster sister

504
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,630
named Dan Qian.

505
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,990
Registered agent in the metropolitan prefecture.

506
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,790
Engages in

507
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,390
purchasing murder houses at a low price and reselling.

508
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,330
Became a witness in the Puppet Spirit Case after getting involved

509
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:01,350
when trying to do an exorcism in a murder house.

510
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,180
Has the only Demon-Recognizing Pupils in the world. Became famous in her first battle.

511
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,690
Admitted to the Celestial Master's Mansion

512
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,360
and became a professional demon hunter.

513
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:09,990
Talented.

514
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,790
Inspiring.

515
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,460
According to the rumors,

516
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,780
her father was the world's greatest demon hunter,

517
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,990
Li Shiyi.

518
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,110
But

519
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,040
there is no evidence.

520
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,230
We don't need evidence.

521
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:22,680
Even Father approves of her.

522
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,900
Besides, she's so talented.

523
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,420
She can live up to her father's name.

524
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,940
It's all in her resume.

525
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,680
She made a name by herself

526
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,930
instead of using her background.

527
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,070
She's a role model

528
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,100
for women in Dazhou!

529
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:35,750
Bottle.

530
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,230
Yes.

531
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:37,730
What's her relationship with Nan Fengyi?

532
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,390
According to reliable neighbors,

533
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,810
they met during the Puppet Spirit Case.

534
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,970
Nan Fengyi has Meng Xizhou with him at all times

535
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,520
because she has Demon-Recognizing Pupils.

536
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,230
They call each other master and apprentice.

537
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,630
They're now living in Nan's Umbrella Shop together?

538
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,410
Together?

539
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,070
Together.

540
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,180
How?

541
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,460
Well,

542
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,670
Nan Fengyi lives in the east room.

543
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,200
Meng Xizhou lives in the west room.

544
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,270
Then there's

545
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,060
Nan Fengyi's father, Nan Sixu.

546
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,150
He's an experienced umbrella maker.

547
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,670
Nan Sixu has told

548
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,750
all the matchmakers nearby

549
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,830
that Nan Fengyi…

550
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:18,990
Say it.

551
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,800
That Nan Fengyi has a defect.

552
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,310
He can't go near women

553
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,810
or get married.

554
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,450
A defect?

555
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,780
Now I feel bad for him.

556
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:40,990
Your Highness.

557
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:41,760
You should

558
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,950
sympathize with me, not him.

559
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:43,430
Shut up.

560
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:49,710
Bottle.

561
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:51,870
Can.

562
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:54,910
I

563
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:56,950
want to

564
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,190
leave the palace.

565
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,840
Your Highness,

566
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,420
His Majesty just talked to you today.

567
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,870
It's probably

568
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,630
inappropriate.

569
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,530
You

570
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,090
always say

571
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,100
you're worried about my marriage.

572
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,420
You're afraid I'll marry someone on papers.

573
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,380
Now, this girl

574
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,020
is a real person.

575
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,270
I finally met someone I fancy.

576
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,410
And you're backing down?

577
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,710
For the happiness of Your Highness,

578
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,410
we're willing

579
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,090
to risk our lives.

580
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:42,750
Good.

581
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:43,950
Good.

582
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:45,520
Good.

583
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,030
Your Highness.

584
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,830
Her Majesty

585
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,530
[Zhai Yue, Her Majesty's personal maid]

586
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,430
wants you to go to Zhaoqing Palace tomorrow.

587
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,770
Zhai Yue,

588
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,150
why does Mother want to see me?

589
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,990
Probably for the coming-of-age ceremony.

590
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,090
The ceremony?

591
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,470
[Parasol]

592
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,430
I wonder if Uncle Nan is asleep.

593
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,710
I need him

594
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,160
to fix this umbrella.

595
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,800
It's the middle of the night.

596
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,800
What weird spells is he secretly practicing this time?

597
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,900
Have compassion for all beings. Seek for forgiveness.

598
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,110
Confess your sins.

599
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,890
Find Dao and be free from pain. The Big Dipper Spell.

600
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,260
Is this

601
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,280
the legendary

602
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,530
Big Dipper Primordial Spell?

603
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,000
Oh no, I'm being drawn again.

604
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:03,830
What are you doing here?

605
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:05,300
I...

606
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,230
My umbrella is broken.

607
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,560
I wanted to ask Uncle Nan to fix it.

608
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,870
I just took a closer look. I didn't expect

609
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,430
I'd…

610
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,190
How many times have I told you?

611
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,230
We need to keep a distance of ten meters.

612
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,240
You can't go near my room

613
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,260
or peep at me when I'm practicing.

614
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,350
We're master and apprentice.

615
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,830
And we live together.

616
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,830
It's inevitable.

617
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,790
What are you afraid of?

618
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,190
You can fool others but not me.

619
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,130
The books my father left

620
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,550
clearly record

621
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,390
the Big Dipper Primordial Spell.

622
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,660
It's exactly like what you said

623
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,760
and done back there.

624
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,510
And, the Big Dipper Primordial Spell

625
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,030
requires the body of a virgin.

626
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:35,810
Please.

627
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,180
Don't tell anyone.

628
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,710
This is my biggest secret.

629
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,560
So…

630
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,530
Why did you sacrifice so much

631
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,840
to practice the Big Dipper Primordial Spell?

632
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,270
Actually, your spells

633
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,660
are already

634
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,950
the best ones in the world.

635
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:57,990
I'm not doing it

636
00:28:58,810 --> 00:28:59,730
for fame or fortune.

637
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,510
Then why?

638
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,630
How many more secrets do I not know

639
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,670
about him?

640
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,130
[Zhaoqing Palace]

641
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,510
Li Hong'an.

642
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,670
Is the robe for His Highness for the Coming-of-Age Ceremony ready?

643
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,010
Your Majesty,

644
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,630
it'll be ready soon.

645
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:33,940
Are the embroidered robes for the servents ready?

646
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,160
Your Majesty,

647
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,630
they'll be ready soon.

648
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,100
Why is the Ministry of Rites so inefficient?

649
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,870
-The ceremony is coming.
-Your…

650
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:45,810
Your Majesty,

651
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,110
I have a bold idea.

652
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,340
Why don't we ask some private umbrella shops

653
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,070
to make the tribute umbrellas?

654
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,070
What?

655
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,650
The tribute umbrellas are royal sacrifices.

656
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,710
We can't just ask some private shops

657
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,030
to make them.

658
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,360
Umbrella? Private shop?

659
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,830
Meng Xizhou lives in an umbrella shop.

660
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:06,950
Li Hong'an.

661
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,820
As the Minister of Rites,

662
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,500
you can't even take care of

663
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:12,330
the tribute umbrellas?

664
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:13,670
You're here.

665
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:15,870
Greetings, Mother.

666
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:16,890
You heard everything?

667
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:19,920
Li Hong'an.

668
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:21,780
I have an idea

669
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:22,510
that can help you.

670
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,070
But it's up to Mother.

671
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,590
What is it?

672
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,230
I have a friend

673
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,780
who owns an umbrella shop.

674
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,110
Exquisite workmanship.

675
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,070
How about

676
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,760
we let my friend

677
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,260
make the tribute umbrellas?

678
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,860
To share the burden with Lord Li.

679
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,130
A private umbrella shop?

680
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,390
Can they do it?

681
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,030
Welll…

682
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:47,620
Your Majesty.

683
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,190
Actually, as long as the basic skills are solid,

684
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,270
no one will be able to tell the difference as long as

685
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,070
they follow the pattern I provide.

686
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,160
Is this friend Your Highness mentioned

687
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,950
a man or a woman?

688
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,400
A

689
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,230
woman.

690
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:12,510
I've heard you talk about the Goddess a lot lately.

691
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,780
Is it her?

692
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:16,510
Mother.

693
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,000
You're so smart.

694
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,510
The woman who saved your life.

695
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:25,030
In that case,

696
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,870
I agree.

697
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,510
Thank you, Mother.

698
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:29,730
Thank you, Your Majesty.

699
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,550
Since she saved the Crown Prince's life,

700
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,670
I'll also award her a palace banquet.

701
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:35,510
Bring it with you,

702
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,770
as a token of our gratitude.

703
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,590
Mother,

704
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:43,800
am I

705
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,700
allowed to leave the palace?
