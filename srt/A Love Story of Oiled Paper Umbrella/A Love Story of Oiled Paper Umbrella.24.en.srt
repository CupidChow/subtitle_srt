[A Love Story of Oiled Paper Umbrella]

00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,090
[Episode 24]

3
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,990
You'd rather die in this realm of bliss

4
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,630
than return to reality?

5
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:45,990
Give it back to me!

6
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,270
Give it back to me!

7
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:48,509
Whether it's humans

8
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,390
or demons,

9
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,150
joy

10
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,200
or sorrow...

11
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:56,590
Give back my beautiful moments!

12
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,220
These are all part of our life's journey.

13
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,110
Even though reality can be cruel at times,

14
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,390
as long as we're alive,

15
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,750
there will always be hope!

16
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,870
Give it back to us!

17
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,310
Who told you to do this?

18
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,230
See?

19
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,180
Even knowing it's fake,

20
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,900
they refuse to wake up,

21
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,070
let alone thank you!

22
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,390
Instead, their obsession will only deepen.

23
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,510
How could this happen?

24
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,550
I've already...

25
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,270
Wake up from your idealistic dreams!

26
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,470
How could this be?

27
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:55,990
How could this happen?

28
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,110
Meng Xizhou, look.

29
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,190
Mercy cannot save the human race in the end.

30
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,070
Humans have attachments,

31
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,970
and with those attachments comes obsession.

32
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,790
And these obsessions

33
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,230
will ultimately make us stronger.

34
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,410
Let my Dark Nightmare

35
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,080
end all of this!

36
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,190
All humans...

37
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,870
die

38
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,280
in my nightmare!

39
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,030
No!

40
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,500
Demon,

41
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,590
surrender now!

42
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,620
With just you few,

43
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,760
let's see if you can kill me.

44
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,670
We of the Dog Clan aren't weak either!

45
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,070
A bunch of useless demon hunters.

46
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,050
A group of demon traitors.

47
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,880
Rushing to your deaths.

48
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,990
How presumptuous.

49
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,550
Chirp.

50
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,550
Nan Fengyi.

51
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,110
With just this little magic power,

52
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,700
you think you can kill me?

53
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,510
Don't forget,

54
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,510
although my magical power is weak,

55
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,720
I am the only one in this world who can open

56
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,560
the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

57
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,390
Nan Fengyi,

58
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:41,070
are you out of your mind?

59
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,990
I am also...

60
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,000
Meng Xizhou.

61
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:25,870
Chirp!

62
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,350
Chirp.

63
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,310
Nan Fengyi,

64
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,110
hurry.

65
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,870
Activate the Big Dipper Primordial Spell and kill me!

66
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,340
Only in this way

67
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,610
will Ren Guang die and disappear with me!

68
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,550
Chirp.

69
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,310
Hurry.

70
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,420
I've already restrained him with my mind,

71
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,990
but soon

72
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,360
he will awaken!

73
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,070
There's no time left!

74
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,430
Hurry!

75
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,430
If I die,

76
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,450
he will die too!

77
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:27,450
Then, the true peaceful world

78
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,680
for both humans and demons

79
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,230
will finally come!

80
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,990
Hurry, time is running out!

81
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,310
Hurry!

82
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:43,670
Hurry!

83
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,470
Hurry!

84
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,870
Hurry!

85
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,600
Nan Fengyi!

86
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,070
Nan Fengyi,

87
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,910
look at me.

88
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,920
Can you really bring yourself

89
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,010
to kill the person you love the most?

90
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,270
Don't listen to him.

91
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,190
Gather your power

92
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,440
and concentrate it at the center of my brow.

93
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,430
Kill me!

94
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,299
Nan Fengyi,

95
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,669
she is Meng Xizhou after all.

96
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,000
Can you really bring yourself to do it?

97
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,070
Nan Fengyi.

98
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,910
I believe you...

99
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,670
can do it.

100
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,790
Hurry!

101
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,790
Nan Fengyi!

102
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,010
Chirp.

103
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,070
Chirp.

104
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,230
Rather than having people live with their obsessions and suffering,

105
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,710
it's better to let them remain in this illusion.

106
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:40,990
And in doing so, it can also eliminate

107
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,510
all prejudices against demons in this world.

108
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,780
Isn't this also a form of mercy?

109
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,750
I can't accept this.

110
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,000
I can't accept this.

111
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,230
I can't accept this.

112
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,940
Master.

113
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,110
I...

114
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,270
have finally returned to my original form.

115
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,870
I'm no longer the Demon Queen.

116
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,040
Master.

117
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,140
Do you remember...

118
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,110
how I looked the first time you saw me?

119
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,310
Of course, I remember.

120
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,520
Just like you are now.

121
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,230
Chirp.

122
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,710
Let's have a proper...

123
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,180
farewell.

124
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,350
Chirp.

125
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,540
I have many ways.

126
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,740
I can surely get you out of here.

127
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,990
Master.

128
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,100
It seems...

129
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,190
I have to forgive you.

130
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,540
♫The wind hesitates, not daring to smooth the furrowed brow♫

131
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,210
Otherwise,

132
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,270
even if I die,

133
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,030
I'll leave with regrets.

134
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,880
♫The rain hesitates, reluctant to burden the tear-streaked eyes beneath the umbrella♫

135
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,790
I'll always think about you, Master.

136
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:10,810
♫The closer you are to me, the clearer the pain becomes♫

137
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,070
Chirp.

138
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:17,600
♫The most painful separation means you can't even miss her♫

139
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,440
You must not forgive me.

140
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,080
♫In silence, the world's grudges weave a web of entanglement♫

141
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,970
You must hate me forever.

142
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:27,430
♫Under the clouds, the smoke from cooking rises and spreads freely♫

143
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,620
♫It's the love doomed by fate♫

144
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,880
Master.

145
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:36,520
♫Under the umbrella, your profile is gently framed by the soft strands of your hair♫

146
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,830
♫Should my heart belong to someone for ten thousand years♫

147
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,720
Love for you is carved in my heart,

148
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:45,580
♫Through endless lifetimes, softly and quietly, it flows on♫

149
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,230
while hatred for you is embedded in my bones.

150
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,580
It's so hard.

151
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,120
♫I won't lose you♫

152
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:53,010
♫I'll sacrifice myself to help you♫

153
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:59,310
♫With a single lamp and a thousand books, alone I'm restless through the night♫

154
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,310
Chirp.

155
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,930
♫Give me a fleeting moment of rain, to be held captive by your side♫

156
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,750
I'm sorry.

157
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,220
So, this is what it's like inside

158
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,710
the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

159
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,640
It's somewhat similar

160
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,500
to Xizhou.

161
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,310
♫The wind hesitates, not daring to smooth the furrowed brow♫

162
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,840
I guess...

163
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,700
I've come home in a way.

164
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:46,650
♫The rain hesitates, reluctant to burden the tear-streaked eyes beneath the umbrella♫

165
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,690
Master.

166
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,570
♫The closer you are to me, the clearer the pain becomes♫

167
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,820
Take care of yourself.

168

♫The most painful separation means you can't even miss her♫

169
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,440
In the rest of your life...

170
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,840
♫In silence, the world's grudges weave a web of entanglement♫

171
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,510
slowly...

172
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,010
forget about me.

173
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:10,200
♫Under the clouds, the smoke from cooking rises and spreads freely♫

00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,230
Chirp!

178
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,600
Chirp.

179
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:01,910
Chirp.

180
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,530
Chirp.

181
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,390
Don't leave me.

182
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,190
Chirp.

183
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,760
Please don't leave me.

Chirp.

185
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:29,160
I'm taking you home now.

186
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,030
Nan Fengyi.

187
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,720
Where is the Goddess?

188
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,990
Nan Fengyi, answer me.

189
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,120
Where is the Goddess?

190
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,540
Where's the Goddess?

191
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,790
Goddess!

192
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,100
Goddess, where are you?

193
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,750
Goddess!

194
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,710
Where are you?

195
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:26,310

198
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,030
Only after losing you did I realize

199
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,910
that a world with you,

200
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,430
even if it's not real,

201
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,080
is one I never want to wake up from.

202
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:37,760
Who is there?

203
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,790
Yi,

204
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:41,550
you're awake?

205
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,670
That's wonderful.

206
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,280
Lord Du!

00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,470
Yi is awake!

208

Yi is awake!

209
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,790
That's wonderful, Nan Fengyi.

210
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,140
You've finally woken up.

211
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,990
His Majesty has sent me to watch over you.

212
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,030

213
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,840

215
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,270
What is this?

216
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,590
This is the fragment of Chirp's soul...

217
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,930
which I desperately held onto before she dispersed.

218

There's something...

222
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,990
I wonder if you could

223
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,450
help me with it?

224
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,110
What is it?

225
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,110
Du Yuelian,

226
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,650
actually, on that day at the Celestial Master's Mansion,

227
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,140
I'd merely contained all the sea demons

228
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,510
within my Feibai Brush.

229
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,680
I'm willing to use all my magical power and cultivation

230
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,180
to restore their human forms.

231
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,110
Nan Fengyi,

232
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,720
you need to think this through.

233
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,310
If you do this,

234
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,270
you will certainly die.

235
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,590
I should have died long ago.

236
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,880
Keeping this life

237
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,740
is meant to atone for the sins committed by the Baize family.

238
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,910
Now that both humans and demons have returned to the right path,

239
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,010
it's time for me to repay these debts.

240

252
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:37,990
This is not your fault.

life and death...

255
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,270
are just a dream.

256
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,470
The dream will always end,

257
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,910
and people will always part.

258
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,100
This...

259
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,400

will I really see you again?

380
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,190
Chirp,

381
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,050
we've come to see you.

382
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,320
What?

383
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,370
A sesame pastry stall?

384
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:32,990
Come and take a look at the oil-paper umbrellas.

385
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,270
The latest designs!

386
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,250
Come and take a look!

387
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,350
Well played, Minister Du,

388
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,830
making me sell pastries.

389
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,440
Let's go quickly.

390
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,200
These pastries smell so good.

391
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,040
Sir,

392
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,110
I'd like thirty sesame pastries.

393
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,920
Why are you staring at her? Just make your sesame pastries.

394
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,900
Thirty pastries, right?

395
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:34,960
Coming right up.

396
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,800
But thirty pastries

397
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,230
are too many.

398
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,270
Director Nan, I couldn't eat that many either.

399
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:44,080
I'm buying them for my men at the Court of Judicature and Revision.

400
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:45,450
They've been working hard lately.

401
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,790
If you're man enough,

402
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,870
just tell Meng Xizhou

403
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,350
how you feel about her.

404
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,440
Why beat around the bush?

405
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:07,270
What nonsense are you talking about?

406
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,270
How do you know her name?

407
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,710
Who in Changle City

408
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,480
doesn't know that Miss Meng Xizhou is a great beauty?

409
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:29,739
Her suitors

410
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,670
could line up from here all the way to Xizhou.

411
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,940
Even I, as a woman,

412
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,179
am very...

413
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:39,870
very

414
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:41,040
impressed by her talent.

415
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,850
You, as the esteemed Judicial Director,

416
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,389
what's the big deal with buying a few sesame pastries?

417
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:52,800
Look,

418
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,510
the owners of this pastry stall

419
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,679
are so reasonable.

420
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:58,800
However...

421
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:01,690
Miss,

422
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,500
do you have something I can hold against you?

423
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:07,070
You don't need to praise me like this.

424
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,160
Nan Fengyi.

425
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,180
If you don't cherish her properly,

426
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,880
even the Emperor of Dazhou

427
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,130
will fight you for her.

428
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,320
Stop speaking recklessly.

429
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:30,740
It's alright.

430
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,260
It's just a sesame pastry.

431
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,320
I can buy it myself.

432
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,680
This pastry is for you.

433
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,360
I've already fallen for you.

434
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,270
If you like it,

435
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,260
I'll buy all the pastries

436
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:49,790
from the stall for you.

437
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,650
Director Nan.

438
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,810
Actually...

439
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,280
I've also...

440
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:05,320
I...

441
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,350
I'm just worried.

442
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,210
I'm just worried—

443
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,100
what if you lose interest in me instead?

444
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,320
Worrying about this and that.

445
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,280
Watch me.

446
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,910
Meng Xizhou!

447
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,590
I like you!

448
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,110
Nan Fengyi,

449
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,020
what do you like about me?

450
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,110
I li...

451
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,020
I don't know either.

452
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:23,950
But...

453
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,260
but I just like you.

454
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,040
I want to be with you forever.

455
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,370
Alright.

456
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,310
Then let's...

457
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,870
be together forever.
