[Episode 15]

3
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:39,930
We can do an autopsy.

4
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:41,229
But

5
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,190
we have to avoid the coroner.

6
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,170
Huo.

7
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,020
What are you doing here?

8
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:48,340
I came back after noon.

9
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,120
Did you catch the demon

10
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:50,800
that appeared at the Eastern Market?

11
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,430
Yes.

12
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,870
He was taken away by people from the Celestial Master's Mansion.

13
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,100
Okay.

14
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,479
And there are demons as well.

15
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:56,229
There's nothing going on here in the morgue.

16
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,789
Go patrol the east side.

17
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,270
Yes.

18
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,090
Nan.

19
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:08,949
Brother.

20
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:09,710
Don't worry.

21
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,289
They're all gone.

22
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,300
The coroners have a two-hour break at noon.

23
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,350
We need to act fast.

24
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,030
According to the coroner's report,

25
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,550
there is a wound on Ms. Wang neck.

26
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,590
There are tears and scratches on her body.

27
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,960
Therefore,

28
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,670
she struggled and fought before she died.

29
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,750
Why is she smiling with opened eyes?

30
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,440
Don't be afraid.

31
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,400
This is because

32
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,870
her facial muscles contracted after she died.

33
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,220
But it doesn’t seem like

34
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:35,110
she have fought with a human being.

35
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,140
It looks more like she was hurt by an animal.

36
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,350
By an animal?

37
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,270
No wonder you were the former
Director of the Court of Judicature and Revision.

38
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,410
You saw the problem right away.

39
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:51,770
Peirong

40
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,190
So you are

41
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,780
the mythical new coroner 
of the Court of Judicature and Revision.

42
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,710
Yes, of course.

43
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,960
The widow of a coroner

44
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,190
is often despised at any workplace

45
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,610
for being considered bad luck.

46
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,750
But I have to support my family.

47
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,130
What else can I do?

48
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:08,870
Doesn't the Court of Judicature and Revision

49
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,590
send you pension every month?

50
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,500
Nan,

51
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,610
after Guo Si took office,

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,240
he took away the pension.

53
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:16,910
He said

54
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,610
it was against the rules.

55
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,870
I never thought my resignation

56
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,910
would harm you.

57
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,430
Fortunately, I learned a lot

58
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,550
from my husband

59
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,510
while he was alive.

60
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,470
Your judgment

61
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:32,670
is similar to mine.

62
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,590
The wound on the victim's neck

63
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,280
must have been made by a beast.

64
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,600
Why didn’t you tell Director Guo

65
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,230
about such an important matter?

66
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,030
Because later,

67
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,590
when I returned to the crime scene,

68
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,110
I didn't find large amount of blood

69
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,170
on the ground

70
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,710
or on the victim's body.

71
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:49,790
So

72
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,910
I couldn't prove

73
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,590
that she was hurt by a beast

74
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,700
and died because of that.

75
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,140
If there was no large amount of blood,

76
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,710
it means

77
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,190
that she was already dead

78
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,590
before the animals appeared.

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,510
By the way,

80
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,510
although she was smiling,

81
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,790
there was a trace

82
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,640
of unspeakable fear in her eyes.

83
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,630
Her heart shrunk.

84
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,350
And there are blood spots all over her heart.

85
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,850
She was indeed scared to death.

86
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:03,870
She…

87
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,590
Her eyes are closed.

88
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:06,710
Maybe…

89
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,750
we were right?

90
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,090
I don't know about that.

91
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,390
But her eyes

92
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,350
can be closed

93
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,750
is because your candles

94
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,670
near her face

95
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,310
increased the temperature,

96
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,290
causing the stiff eye muscles to contract.

97
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,910
That's why.

98
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,550
I see.

99
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,310
What exactly did she see

100
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,040
before she died?

101
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,580
I don't know. But it

102
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,750
was frightening enough to scare her to death.

103
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,590
It rained last night.

104
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,050
So the Louyi Alley was very muddy.

105
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,750
Our men searched thoroughly,

106
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,550
but no trace of Zhang Sanlang leaving was found.

107
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,780
There were only the footprints of a person with uneven steps.

108
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,110
Peirong,

109
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,800
thank you for helping us.

110
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,550
This is what I should do.

111
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,630
If my husband were here,

112
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,430
he would do the same.

113
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:08,990
Take the money

114
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,660
and buy some delicious food for your child.

115
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,450
From now on,

116
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,190
I'll send you money every month.

117
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,620
Hui Fang's child

118
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,750
is my child as well.

119
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:32,350
Thank you.

120
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,920
You offender!

121
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,040
How dare you intrude into the morgue

122
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,630
of the Court of Judicature and Revision?

123
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,700
Guo Ji.

124
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,710
Nan Sixu has admitted his crime

125
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,550
of murdering Ms. Wang and Zhang Sanlang.

126
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,430
How can you use Uncle Nan's

127
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,430
crazy remarks as testimony?

128
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,159
Director Guo.

129
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,270
I just found out

130
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,870
that the cause of Ms. Wang's death

131
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,290
was tremendous shock.

132
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,380
I'm afraid this case

133
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,750
is more complex than we thought.

134
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,700
Complex?

135
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,470
This is simply a crime of passion.

136
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,710
Case closed.

137
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,310
If you don't want your job anymore,

138
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,890
you can pack your things and leave tomorrow.

139
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,520
This has nothing to do

140
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,440
with Coroner Pei

141
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,500
and Huo Xiao.

142
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,680
It's all my fault.

143
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,670
I insisted on coming here.

144
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,400
It's good you have some self-awareness.

145
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:29,910
Baize Yi,

146
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,350
Nan Sixu is your uncle.

147
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,700
I can make you a suspect as well

148
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,750
if I want to.

149
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,030
Do you understand?

150
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,390
From now on,

151
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,150
anyone who brings up a reversal

152
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,240
for Nan Sixu's case is against me.

153
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,060
They can pack up and leave.

154
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:01,650
Brother.

155
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:03,780
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,290
We have no choice.

157
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:07,790
It's okay.

158
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,190
From now on,

159
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,480
let's not see each other again.

160
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,220
Huo Ting,

161
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,260
what do you mean by that?

162
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:22,810
Are you

163
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,320
breaking up the brotherhood now?

164
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:25,550
Chirp.

165
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,250
Don't get me wrong.

166
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,550
He meant that Nan

167
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,460
and Uncle Nan are family in this case.

168
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,870
So he has to avert suspicion.

169
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,110
I'm planning to do that as well.

170
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,610
I decided not to see you guys again in future.

171
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,840
I've made this decision

172
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,659
since my identity was revealed.

173
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:44,930
It's just that

174
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,830
my uncle is still in prison.

175
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,470
And I hope you

176
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,790
can protect him for me.

177
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,180
[Nan's Umbrella Shop]

178
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,840
When you worked at the Court of Judicature and Revision,

179
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,840
you were so kind and loyal to them.

180
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,270
But now,

181
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,270
the two of them

182
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,610
even want to distance themselves with you.

183
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,350
It's a cold world.

184
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,360
I'm really upset.

185
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,750
Both Huo Xiao and Huo Ting's mothers

186
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,100
are seriously ill and bedridden.

187
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,550
They need the money for their treatment every day.

188
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,720
They have their difficulties.

189
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,970
I'm fine without this job,

190
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,060
but they're not.

191
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,020
The same goes for Peirong.

192
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,070
But

193
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,610
we can't just watch Uncle Nan

194
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,870
being wronged, can we?

195
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,550
We need to find a way to continue the investigation.

196
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,550
Yes, of course.

197
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,190
I'm thinking

198
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,120
that since Ms. Wang was scared to death,

199
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,840
could it be that my uncle

200
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,070
saw the same thing

201
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,930
and it caused his hysteria?

202
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,310
That makes sense.

203
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,870
Uncle Nan

204
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,070
must be at the scene then.

205
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,430
That's why he got scared

206
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,480
and fell down.

207
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,230
No matter what they saw,

208
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,750
it must be something very frightening.

209
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,080
Now we need to find a way

210
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,040
to cure Uncle Nan's hysteria first.

211
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,910
The physicians hired by the Court of Judicature and Revision

212
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,400
are the best in Changle City.

213
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,920
If they can't do anything about my uncle's condition,

214
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,210
what can we do?

215
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,070
Yeah.

216
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,230
We need to figure something out.

217
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,200
Chirp.

218
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,680
What's going on?

219
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,370
Chirp.

220
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,310
Mr. Ren Guang,

221
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,910
what are you doing here?

222
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,990
I came here

223
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,800
because I can sense you need help.

224
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,150
What is it?

225
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,200
Do you want to know

226
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,630
how to cure Nan Sixu?

227
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,350
You know how to perform the 13 Needles of the Ghost Sect?

228
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,630
The the 13 Needles of the Ghost Sect

229
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,050
was an acupuncture treatment 
created by the Bian family back then,

230
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,480
which specializes in treating hysteria.

231
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,450
Thirteen acupuncture points to 13 crucial acupoints of the human body.

232
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,590
But the treatment is very dangerous.

233
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:35,910
Every needle

234
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,130
you place

235
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,200
is a deal made with the spirits,

236
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,740
using your intelligence.

237
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,910
A deal?

238
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,550
What do you mean?

239
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,790
It means

240
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:51,030
that if anything goes wrong with any needle,

241
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,970
the patient will die instantly.

242
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,230
The person performing the acupuncture

243
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,500
will also die of exhaustion.

244
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,150
It seems like

245
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,200
I will have to learn on the go.

246
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,430
But Mr. Ren Guang,

247
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,790
I've never studied medicine,

248
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,230
and I don't know the acupoints on the human body.

249
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,520
If something goes wrong,

250
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,950
I'm afraid I can't even save myself.

251
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:12,510
This...

252
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,720
This is too risky.

253
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,310
There is a way of not taking the risk.

254
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,030
Would you like to try?

255
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,030
What is it?

256
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,590
Tell me about it.

257
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,230
Lend your body

258
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,550
to me.

259
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,900
And I'll perform the acupuncture treatment for Nan Sixu.

260
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,220
Are you afraid that if you lend me your body,

261
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,710
I won't return it to you?

262
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,850
No, I'm not.

263
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,380
Since I was young,

264
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,390
you have guided

265
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,920
and encouraged me in my consciousness.

266
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,030
In my mind,

267
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,740
you are my teacher and a good friend.

268
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,790
You're not the kind of person who lies.

269
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:50,790
You decide for yourself.

270
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,230
Chirp.

271
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,150
Chirp.

272
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,910
Chirp.

273
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,270
Chirp.

274
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,540
Chirp!

275
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,990
What happened to your eyes?

276
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,630
I'm fine.

277
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,940
Maybe I'm just too tired.

278
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,550
I just need some good rest.

279
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,630
You go back and have some rest too.

280
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,030
Okay.

281
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,160
Get some rest now.

282
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,110
[Court of Judicature and Revision]

283
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,670
Who are you?

284
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,190
Someone asked me

285
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,300
to help you.

286
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,830
The first needle: the acupoint of Guigong.

287
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,120
The second needle: the acupoint of Guisin.

288
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:45,010
The third needle: the acupoint of Guilei.

289
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,110
The fourth needle: the acupoint of Guixin.

290
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,450
The fifth needle: the acupoint of Guilu.

291
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,500
What just happened?

292
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,030
Nothing.

293
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:09,820
Go look around again.

294
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,070
Okay.

295
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,520
Are you crazy?

296
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,710
Why didn't you hide when you saw them?

297
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,130
Mr. Ren Guang.

298
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,780
I can't move suddenly.

299
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,790
Where am I?

300
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:17,940
Have you forgotten about it?

301
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,330
You lend your body to me temporarily.

302
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,000
Yes.

303
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,140
These are all hallucinations.

304
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,600
None of this

305
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,050
is true.

306
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,190
Where's Uncle Nan?

307
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,190
Did you perform the treatment
 of the 13 Needles of the Ghost Sect on him?

308
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,750
Why did you push me?

309
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,800
The work is done.

310
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,370
I should

311
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,260
return your body to you.

312
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,870
The feeling of being possessed

313
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,020
is really strange.

314
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:06,599
I don't remember anything.

315
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:09,790
But

316
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,940
he said he cured Uncle Nan.

317
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,150
He probably did.

318
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,030
I need to tell Master now.

319
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:23,030
Where is Master?

320
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:24,520
Master.

321
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,190
I...

322
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,900
What are you doing here?

323
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,190
Didn't you say

324
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,390
we should never meet again?

325
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,070
Nan…

326
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,750
Nan was taken by people 
from the Court of Judicature and Revision.

327
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,020
Why?

328
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,070
What happened?

329
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,950
It's because you two went to the morgue yesterday.

330
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,580
Director Guo has made you

331
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,180
the suspect of the case today.

332
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,750
Why are you going there?

333
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,270
If you go, you're walking into a trap.

334
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,000
I...

335
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,470
So,

336
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,580
Guo Ji sent you to arrest me?

337
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,080
Yes.

338
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,960
But I promised Brother Nan.

339
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,670
I will tell Director Guo

340
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,350
that you ran away

341
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,320
when I report to him later.

342
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:07,910
It doesn't matter.

343
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,350
Someone will tell the truth of this case.

344
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,680
Who?

345
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,110
Baize Yi,

346
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,870
why don’t you

347
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,340
kneel before me?

348
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:26,950
Lord Guo,

349
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,510
what crime have I committed?

350
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,040
Why are you

351
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,890
treating me like a suspect of murder?

352
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,790
Suspect or not,

353
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,830
you should kneel before me

354
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,860
when you see me.

355
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,390
Do you still think you are the Minister 
 of the Court of Judicature and Revision?

356
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,780
To the people of Changle City, you're now a sinner.

357
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,890
His father lost the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

358
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,460
It has nothing to do with Lord Nan.

359
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,720
Why should he kneel?

360
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,260
Kneel down.

361
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,910
Baize Yi,

362
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,720
Ms. Wang, the owner of the martial arts centre died.

363
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,520
Nan Sixu admitted to the crime of killing her.

364
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,820
But Nan Sixu

365
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,360
is a weak old man.

366
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,110
How could he kill both

367
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,230
Zhang Sanlang, a strong man, and Ms. Wang,

368
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,370
the owner of a martial arts centre, all by himself?

369
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,320
In my opinion,

370
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,150
he must have an accomplice.

371
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,070
And you

372
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,230
intruded into the morgue
of the Court of Judicature and Revision

373
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,910
without authorization

374
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,780
after Nan Sixu was arrested yesterday.

375
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,930
Were you planning to destroy some evidence?

376
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,750
Lord Guo,

377
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,750
I asked Nan Fengyi

378
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,600
to go to the morgue to examine the body yesterday

379
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,620
to uncover the truth,

380
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,560
not to tamper with the evidence.

381
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,400
Huo Xiao,

382
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,380
you're defending him.

383
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,850
Could it be that you’re his accomplice as well?

384
00:19:58,910 --> 00:19:59,550
Lord Guo,

385
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,160
the current evidence has proved

386
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,180
that Ms. Wang was scared to death.

387
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,010
The living can lie,

388
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,390
but the dead cannot.

389
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,010
How dare you!

390
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,710
Lord Guo.

391
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,680
This is Zhang Sanlang's father, isn't it?

392
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:18,670
Lord Guo,

393
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,370
please grant my son, Sanlang, justice.

394
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,770
My son was scared to death.

395
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,350
He was actually scared to death by this man and his uncle.

396
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:29,750
Nan Sixu

397
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,280
never got along with my son.

398
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:33,810
He always

399
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,830
picked on Sanlang.

400
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,600
That's not right.

401
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,160
I had a fight with Zhang Sanlang as well.

402
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,580
Why didn't you say I killed him?

403
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:41,240
No, no.

404
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,580
What you've said is groundless.

405
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,150
The Court of Judicature and Revision

406
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,810
has already examined those details you could think of.

407
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,170
I wasn't even at the scene

408
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,550
on the night of the murder.

409
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,830
Nonsense.

410
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,580
Although you are no longer 
the Director of the Court of Judicature and Revision,

411
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,700
you could still bribe your former subordinates

412
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,000
to provide false testimony for you.

413
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,070
That's possible.

414
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,060
Maybe Nanfeng Yi killed him first.

415
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,470
I don't think he did.

416
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,470
Baize Yi,

417
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,940
it seems that you won’t confess

418
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,190
unless I use torture.

419
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:11,930
Guards.

420
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,950
Flog Baize Yi

421
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,290
twenty times as punishment.

422
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,200
Guo Ji,

423
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,240
is this how you work as the Director 
of the Court of Judicature and Revision?

424
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,590
Don't touch me.

425
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,970
I can stand up myself.

426
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:30,950
What a joke.

427
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,390
Is this how you solve a case?

428
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,740
Do you agree with me?

429
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,630
Yeah.

430
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,950
You criminal, a descendant of Baize Gong,

431
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,670
is finally receiving your punishment today.

432
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:39,570
That's right.

433
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,670
See?

434
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,390
Baize Yi,

435
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,940
I’m the Director of the Court of Judicature and Revision,
the one people look up to,

436
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,120
not you, a hypocrite.

437
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,790
Nan has done his best

438
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,510
to protect the citizens of Changle City.

439
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,150
He is never a bully.

440
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,230
Yeah, exactly.

441
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,070
He's right.

442
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:00,560
Lord Guo,

443
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,020
please don't make a rash decision and torture him.

444
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,030
Huo Xiao.

445
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:07,790
You...

446
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,580
get out of my way.

447
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,270
If you don't,

448
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,930
you'll be tortured as well.

449
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,070
Guards!

450
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,790
Flog Guo Xiao 20 times

451
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,270
for shielding the suspect.

452
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:22,790
Lord Guo,

453
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,790
Huo Xiao has nothing to do with this.

454
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,110
Please only punish me.

455
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,350
Nan.

456
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,950
Great.

457
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:34,070
Your brotherhood is so moving.

458
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,310
Since you love to protect your brother,

459
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,950
I'll let you take his punishment for him

460
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,670
and flog you 40 times.

461
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,790
Let's see who else dare to shield him?

462
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,550
Nan,

463
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,510
I'm sorry.

464
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,320
Wait a moment.

465
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:55,880
Lord Guo,

466
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,110
Meng Xizhou is here.

467
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,430
Good.

468
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,590
Perfect timing.

469
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,630
Let's interrogate them together.

470
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:06,950
Chirp.

471
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:09,670
Master.

472
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,070
Are you okay?

473
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,740
Didn't Huo Ting let you go?

474
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,630
What are you doing here?

475
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,140
Master, don't worry.

476
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,610
I've got an idea.

477
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,350
Lord Guo,

478
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,920
I have something to tell you.

479
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,590
What is it?

480
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,550
I heard

481
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,630
that you convicted Nan Sixu of murdering

482
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:28,640
Zhang Sanlang and Ms. Wang

483
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,750
based on one thing he said

484
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,020
as he was suffering from hysteria.

485
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,270
He has admitted the crime himself.

486
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,510
Do you have any objection to this case?

487
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:38,620
What if…

488
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,880
he denies it now?

489
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,210
Should this case be reopened?

490
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,620
That's impossible.

491
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,790
Nan Sixu's hysteria

492
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,940
can't be cured.

493
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,430
But

494
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,550
I heard that

495
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,100
Nan Sixu has not only recovered

496
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,920
from his hysteria,

497
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,490
but also wants to tell everyone

498
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,080
what actually happened that night.

499
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,110
Lord Guo,

500
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,400
don't you want to hear it?

501
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,040
What kind of nonsense is this?

502
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:04,490
Don't worry.

503
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:05,380
My Lord,

504
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,410
Nan Sixu is here.

505
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,570
Nan Sixu.

506
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,350
Isn't he suffering from hysteria?

507
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,390
It seems that he has recovered suddenly.

508
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,310
He said he would only talk to you in person

509
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,990
about the case and Sanlang.

510
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,070
Lord Guo,

511
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,330
since he has something to say,

512
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,590
could you let him

513
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,550
come to the court

514
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,860
and say it to everyone?

515
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,100
Bring him in.

516
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,430
Yes.

517
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,210
Lord Guo,

518
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,470
the person concerned

519
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,990
is coming here to clarify what happened.

520
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:39,870
So you don't need to torture him

521
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,270
for confession anymore, do you?

522
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,070
Go.

523
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,030
That's him.

524
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:49,990
Uncle. Uncle Nan.
Uncle Nan.

525
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,330
He is the killer.

526
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,170
The murderer.

527
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,220
Yes.

528
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,080
Uncle,

529
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,540
are you really recovered?

530
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,110
Yes, I am.

531
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,030
I remember

532
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,190
everything that happened that night.

533
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,710
Lord Guo,

534
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,320
you must investigate thoroughly

535
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,470
for my son,

536
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,430
and find out who the killer is.

537
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,330
Lord Guo.

538
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,950
Lord Guo.

539
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,020
I,

540
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,490
Nan Sixu,

541
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,620
manager of Nan's Umbrella Shop

542
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,970
at the East Market,

543
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,770
greet you,

544
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,140
Lord Guo.

545
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,510
Criminal Nan Sixu,

546
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,670
since you've regained your memory,

547
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,210
you must confess your crime of killing

548
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,550
Ms. Wang and Zhang Sanlang right now.

549
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,860
My Lord,

550
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,030
I didn't

551
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,750
kill Ms. Wang.

552
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:43,990
A monster did.

553
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:45,470
Monster!

554
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:46,240
Monster.

555
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:47,000
Monster.

556
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:47,730
Monster.

557
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,860
Right now,

558
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:51,930
I have to tell you everything

559
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,830
to prove

560
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,550
my innocence.

561
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,100
I'd like to go further

562
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,880
in our relationship.

563
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,520
I cook for you and Yi

564
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,980
because we are good neighbours.

565
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,910
Don't… don't misunderstand me.

566
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,990
Is it because of

567
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,210
Zhang Sanlang, the butcher?

568
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:13,670
He's younger

569
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:14,360
and stronger than me.

570
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,100
Right?

571
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:19,710
I won't

572
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:20,830
come to your umbrella shop anymore.

573
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,540
You must be impatient right now.

574
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,230
The black tiger's heart.

575
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,550
The white crane's wings.

576
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,610
The white snake's tongue.

577
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,150
The golden rooster.

578
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,440
The Xuling power.

579
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,000
Ms. Wang!

580
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:06,220
My Lord,

581
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,150
everything I've said

582
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,030
is true.

583
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,060
Please investigate thoroughly, My Lord.

584
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,670
Zhang Sanlang became a monster overnight.

585
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,510
What a great story that you've come up with

586
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,710
to deceive me.

587
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:26,870
I raised my own son.

588
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:28,060
How could I not know?

589
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,390
It's impossible that Sanlang was a monster.

590
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,760
This is slander.

591
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,790
You probably made that up

592
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:35,850
to clear your name.

593
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:36,870
I think

594
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,520
the Celestial Master's Mansion has the final say
 on whether there are monsters.

595
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,470
It's not for you to say.

596
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,360
It's completely true.

597
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,060
Otherwise,

598
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,280
I wouldn't suffer from hysteria because of that.

599
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,090
The most important thing for now

600
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,710
is to find that monster.

601
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,520
I just remembered.

602
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,890
A monster appeared at the East Market last night

603
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,560
and was beaten to death 
by the new Lord of Celestial Master's Mansion.

604
00:27:58,790 --> 00:27:59,560
Yes.

605
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,740
That was not a monster.

606
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,550
It was a demon.

607
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,090
Junior.

608
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,050
You're here.

609
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,480
It really was a demon.

610
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:20,510
What's that smell?

611
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:22,970
So monsters do exist.

612
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,130
This bandit demon

613
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,700
is what you're refering to, isn't it?

614
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:26,780
Well…

615
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:27,790
Yes, it is.

616
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,370
I saw it with my own eyes.

617
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,850
Zhang Sanlang, a living man,

618
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:33,840
transformed into…

619
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,950
this demon suddenly

620
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,320
and scared Ms. Wang to death.

621
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,200
This… this…

622
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,120
How can my son

623
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,460
be this ugly thing?

624
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,910
He's not my son.

625
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,360
This… this is not my son.

626
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,190
This isn't…

627
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:46,790
This isn't my son.

628
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,800
This can't be my son.

629
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:56,930
It's strange.

630
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,060
Why is there no demonic aura?

631
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,430
My Lord.

632
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:07,410
Everyone.

633
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,310
This demon's footprints  perfectly matches

634
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,050
another animal's footprints from the crime scene

635
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,460
on that day.

636
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,710
That is totally nonsense!

637
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,430
Humans and demons

638
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:18,380
have different bodies.

639
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,630
How is the transformation possible?

640
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,910
Previously,

641
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,430
Situ Hanshan used

642
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,310
the Puppet Worm technique from the Eastern Region

643
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,250
to replace humans with the Puppet Spirits.

644
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,950
If this case is connected to demons,

645
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,530
some kind of evil magic must have been used.

646
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,170
Then...

647
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,350
In that case,

648
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,030
Junior,

649
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,430
Do you have proof

650
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,640
that this bandit demon

651
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,070
was transformed from Zhang Sanlang?

652
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:47,550
Du Yuelian,

653
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,970
when did you catch it?

654
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,680
Last night.

655
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:53,990
Lord Guo,

656
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,710
please send a coroner

657
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:56,510
to examine the body

658
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:57,960
and prove its identity.

659
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,070
How dare you.

660
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,450
Why should I listen to you?

661
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:03,830
Now this case

662
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,140
has something to do with demons.

663
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,950
The Celestial Master's Mansion

664
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:07,860
must get an answer.

665
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,470
You're just the Director 
of the Court of Judicature and Revision.

666
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:11,990
How dare you defy me,

667
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,310
the Lord of the Celestial Master's Mansion?

668
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,460
Do it now.

669
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:15,760
Okay. Okay.

670
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,330
Junior,

671
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,720
don't be upset.

672
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:21,730
Guards!

673
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,310
Take this body

674
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:24,670
to the morgue.

675
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,040
Du Yuelian,

676
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:35,320
do you think

677
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,990
he was truly a demon?

678
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,200
You don't trust my judgment?

679
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,800
I have Demon-Recognizing Pupils.

680
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,710
I used to be able to

681
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,270
detect the demonic aura around a demon

682
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,400
as soon as I saw one.

683
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,650
But I don't know why

684
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,550
I can't sense any demonic aura

685
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,340
from that demon today.

686
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,060
Maybe…

687
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,470
Maybe because he has been dead overnight,

688
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,140
the demonic aura has vanished.

689
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,430
Could it be that my Demon-Recognizing Pupils

690
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,820
no longer detect demons?

691
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,270
My Lord,

692
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,910
the autopsy results are in.

693
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,330
My Lord,

694
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,600
after my comparison,

695
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:17,570
the food residues

696
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,280
in the bandit demon's stomach

697
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,680
match those in Ms. Wang's stomach

698
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,870
and the leftovers found

699
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,660
in Zhang Sanlang's room.

700
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,550
So the bandit demon

701
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,310
was indeed transformed from Zhang Sanlang.

702
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,150
I'll be taking my leave.

703
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,220
We've been neighbors

704
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,220
for many years, and I didn't expect

705
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,050
him to be a bandit demon.

706
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,060
I even set up a blind date for him.

707
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,100
Now that I think about it, I'm really scared.

708
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,530
Is he your son?

709
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,160
Are you a demon too?

710
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,550
He's not a demon.

711
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,040
He is not my son.

712
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:54,610
My son is not a demon.

713
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,350
He's not?

714
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,030
He is not my son.

715
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,970
He is indeed your son.

716
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,300
That's right.

717
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,140
Yes, Uncle.

718
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:03,720
Even if he is a demon,

719
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,360
he is still your son.

720
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:08,580
I don't have a son like this.

721
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,230
My lord.

722
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,670
I… I am not a demon.

723
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:13,510
I'm not a demon.

724
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,990
My lord, I'm not a demon.

725
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,630
I'm not a demon.

726
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:21,860
Lord Guo,

727
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,240
since the evidence has proved

728
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,490
that Ms. Wang was scared to death by a bandit demon.

729
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,800
Zhang Sanlang became one

730
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,070
and was captured by the Celestial Master's Mansion.

731
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,010
So could you release my uncle first?

732
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,510
Fine. I can

733
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,120
release Nan Sixu.

734
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,950
But I'm still going to punish you.

735
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,120
What crime did I commit?

736
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,870
As we all know,

737
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:52,990
there haven't been any demons in Changle City for a long time.

738
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,680
A bandit demon suddenly appeared

739
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,660
on the street, after the Puppet Spirit Case was solved.

740
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,520
I have reason to suspect

741
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:01,400
that you, Baize Yi

742
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,190
have secretly hidden the Scroll of Mountains and Seas,

743
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,870
and unleashed the demons,

744
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,750
which caused chaos in the world.

745
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:08,670
It's him!

746
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,190
If the demon is connected to Lord Nan,

747
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,140
the chaos would have happened a long time ago.

748
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,310
What you said doesn't make sense.

749
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:12,990
It's all their fault.

750
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,830
Lord Guo, which sentence

751
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,100
did you said

752
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,670
was based on facts?

753
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,380
The facts are that

754
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:20,390
Baize Yi

755
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,050
is a descendant of Baize Gong.

756
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,310
He lost everything he had

757
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,030
because of

758
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:29,030
his identity.

759
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,060
Doesn't he

760
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,720
hate us?

761
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:35,670
Hiding it secretly?

762
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:39,060
The Scroll of Mountains and Seas has been

763
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,800
the tool for demon suppression
 in our Baize family for generations.

764
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,630
There's no such thing as hiding it secretly.

765
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,150
More than anyone, I wish

766
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,290
it had never been lost.

767
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,080
All these years,

768
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,740
I’ve done so much

769
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,870
to protect the people of Changle.

770
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,150
If I truly wanted to harm people,

771
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:56,750
I wouldn't have ended up in this situation.

772
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,350
Who knows if you did it for the people of Changle

773
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,310
or to hide your identity?

774
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,310
That is cruel.

775
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,190
Have you forgotten

776
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:03,830
how Lord Nan protected us?

777
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:04,870
You’re a descendant of Baize.

778
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,310
Even if you die,

779
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,350
it wouldn't take away the anger of the citizens of Changle.

780
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,070
Don't arrest him.

781
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:09,750
Arrest him.

782
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:10,750
Arrest them.

783
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,469
Arrest him.

784
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:12,989
Don't arrest him.

785
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:13,610
Arrest him.

786
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,659
Arrest him.

787
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:15,340
Arrest him.

788
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,830
Because I lost the Scroll of Mountains and Seas,

789
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:21,489
it has become my original sin.

790
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:23,260
Hasn't it?

791
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:24,730
Rumor has it that

792
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,909
when Changle City experiences 
the heaviest rain in a hundrend years,

793
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,320
the Demon Lord will return with an umbrella.

794
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,670
It must be the Demon Lord.

795
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,270
coming back to get the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

796
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,070
If you lock up Lord Nan,

797
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,429
who's going to protect Changle City?

798
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:34,389
Exactly.

799
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:35,130
How can you assure people if you do that?

800
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:35,909
Right.

801
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:36,510
Arrest him.

802
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:37,989
Don't arrest him.

803
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:39,690
Don't arrest him.

804
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,429
Arrest him.

805
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,460
Be quiet. Be quiet.

806
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:47,230
Since

807
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,870
things have come to this,

808
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,820
I must do what people want

809
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:54,960
and detain Baize Yi, who has secretly hidden

810
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:56,840
the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

811
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,780
We’ll make a decision

812
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,820
after we reported this to His Majesty tomorrow.

813
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,340
That's our local magistrate.

814
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,270
He is a good man.

815
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,230
A good man.

816
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,400
You can't arrest him.

817
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,460
You guys don't know right from wrong.

818
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:09,590
Great.

819
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,550
I won't let you arrest him

820
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,830
without foundation.

821
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,790
What are you waiting for?

822
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,360
Do you still want this job at the Court of Judicature and Revision?

823
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,790
Guo Ji.

824
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:20,790
Don’t move.
Chu

825
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:21,430
Don't touch him.

826
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,020
Chirp.

827
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,080
Don't fight pointless battles for me.

828
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:27,830
If they want to convict me,

829
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,320
they'll say anything.

830
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,520
Take care of yourself.

831
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,710
Be gentle.

832
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,450
Yi.

833
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:44,550
Du Yuelian,

834
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,750
what should we do?

835
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,090
If we want to save Nan Fengyi,

836
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,830
we have to find the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

837
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,450
Do you have any clue?

838
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:57,620
[Celestial Master's Mansion]

839
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,110
Look.

840
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,560
[Book of Demon Slaying]

841
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:58,920
Book of Demon Slaying.

842
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,070
So

843
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:14,150
the Qi Sword 
and the Scroll of Mountains and Seas

844
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,200
were both made by the blood and flash

845
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,260
of the ancient Demon Lord.

846
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,210
It sounds

847
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,120
so cruel.

848
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,350
That is the grievance our people held

849
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,710
against the demons two generations ago.

850
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,110
My father's Qi Sword

851
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,590
was passed down by his forefather.

852
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,790
So, are you saying

853
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,880
that this Qi Sword

854
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,390
can sense the Scroll of Mountains and Seas?

855
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:36,290
That's right.

856
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:37,930
Also,

857
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:39,090
recently,

858
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,520
this Qi Sword is starting to sense something.

859
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,390
No wonder…

860
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,110
No wonder?

861
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,950
No wonder what?

862
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:52,800
A few days ago,

863
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,790
when Nan Fengyi was practicing

864
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:54,910
the Big Dipper Primordial Spell,

865
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,760
he mentioned that he sensed the scroll as well.

866
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,790
Oh, really?

867
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,420
Is it possible

868
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,230
that the Scroll of Mountains and Seas

869
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,800
is in Changle City?

870
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,400
Once it is opened,

871
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:08,820
we will all be taken out.

872
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,600
Why?

873
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,670
Rumor has it

874
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,080
that when Changle City experiences 
the heaviest rain in a hundrend years,

875
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,960
the Demon Lord will return with an umbrella.

876
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,780
The day that the Scroll of Mountains and Seas

877
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,610
is opened is the day

878
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,130
the Demon Lord appears.

879
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,070
Darling,

880
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,600
is that you?

881
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:15,440
Come in, please.

882
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:17,670
Bad news, My Lord.

883
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,620
Many demons have appeared outside Changle City.

884
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:20,790
What?

885
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,060
Why?

886
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,990
This demon-catching formation is not working at all.

887
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:30,320
That's weird.

888
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,360
I did fix it.

889
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,390
Demons!

890
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:36,550
Demons!

891
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,160
What's going on?

892
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:58,780
Why are there so many demons?

893
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:00,250
Hurry.

894
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:01,910
Have someone go to the Celestial Master's Mansion for help.

895
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,130
They already have.

896
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,570
Help us.

897
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:09,120
Why do I hear humans' voices...

898
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:09,830
Help us.

899
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,190
in the bandit demons' screaming?

900
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,700
Du Yuelian, wait.

901
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,390
What are you doing?

902
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:14,620
They are all humans,

903
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:15,220
not demons.

904
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:16,710
What?

905
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:21,750
Meng Xizhou,

906
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:22,830
you can't make up this ridiculous lie

907
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,080
just to save them.

908
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,030
I'm not lying.

909
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:27,490
Let go of me.

910
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,510
No.

911
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,670
Why?

912
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:30,450
These are humans.

913
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:31,790
They haven't been fully transformed into demons.

914
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,030
They can be saved.

915
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:34,350
Du Yuelian,

916
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,390
just give me some time.

917
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:36,220
We are in danger from demons.

918
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,340
If you dare stop me again,

919
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,430
don't blame me for catching you as well.
