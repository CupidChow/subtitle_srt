Then, be my disciple.

7
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,229
Really?

8
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,070
Me?

9
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,840
Can I be your disciple?

10
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:56,470
Yes.

you need to cover for me.

What do you think?

Cover for you?

17
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:09,800
I thought you were sincere

18
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,150
to take me as your disciple.

19
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,390
I didn't realize that

20
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,510
you just want a long-term shield.

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,900

29
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,630
I figured it out.

30
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,150
Initially, I was obsessed with being a demon hunter

31
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:43,660
because I wanted to demonstrate

32
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,370
that I was Li Shiyi's daughter.

33
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,050

From what we've experienced so far,

00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,310
I was reckless

168

I don't know if your daughter will agree.

I might have misheard.

196
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,670
You must have misheard.

197
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,430
There are only two of us in our family,

198
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,480
two bachelors.

199
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:13,830
Father.

200
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:14,580
Father.

201
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,340
Well,

202
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,750
the pastry is cold.

203
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:17,830
Please warm it up.

204
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,230
Okay, okay, okay.

205
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,230
I'll let you two chat.

206
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:20,840
Take your time.

207
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,690
Master, Master.

208
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,360
What

209
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,390
does "virginity" mean?

210
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,030
You overheard my conversation with my father?

211
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:34,750
I

212
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:35,850
happened to hear it.

213
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,740
Why do you ask this question deliberately?

214
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,050
Tell me.

215
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,790
Why would an energetic man

216
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,900
insist on safeguarding his virginity?

217
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,370
Are there some

218
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,880
unspeakable difficulties?

219
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,510
Or is there a

220
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,990
secret that can't be revealed?

221
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:51,910
That's my own business.

222
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,150
Is it related to

223
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,190
your strong internal power?

224
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,620
None of your business.

225
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,700
Why are you mad?

226
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,440
I won't inquire about it anymore.

227
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,660
So sweet.

228
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,020
I'll save the rest

229
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,350
and eat them later.

230
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,130
By the way,

231
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,220
your father said

232
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,370
you don't have a sister.

233
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,700
So, did you buy these shoes

234
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,390
for me?

235
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,610
Don't flatter yourself.

236
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,550
He just didn't know

237
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,240
that I

238
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,050
am close with the lady of our neighbor.

239
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,740
Lady of your neighbor?

240
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,030
Alright.

241
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,660
After I move to the Nan's Umbrella Shop,

242
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,370
I'll have a chat with her.

243
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,690
Will you really move in with us?

244
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,300
Of course

245
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,790
not.

246
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,680
If I move to the Nan's Umbrella Shop,

247
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:56,780
Uncle Wu won't be happy.

248
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,150
Really?

249
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,550
Here comes the sesame pastry!

250
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:03,980
Yi

251
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,840
queued up

252
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,230
to buy it for you in the early morning.

253
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,750
Eat it.

254
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,190
Have it.

255
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,190
Thank you, Father.

256
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,070
Thank you, Uncle Nan.

257
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,990
Thanks for Nan…

258
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,470
Thank you, Master.

259
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:17,980
Eat up quickly.

260
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:18,910
After that,

261
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,150
we need to go to the palace.

262
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,450
Again?

263
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:24,520
This time,

264
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,100
there would be good news, right?

265
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,140
I have heard

266
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,810
the coroner from the Court of Judicature and Revision

267
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,960
died in the line of duty

268
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,860
during the raid on Situ's Mansion.

269
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,070
Nan,

270
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,160
why did the Court of Judicature and Revision

271
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,630
let a coroner handle cases?

272
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:44,930
Your Majesty,

273
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,870
it's

274
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,320
my fault.

275
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,550
I didn't mean to blame you.

276
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,660
The Court of Judicature and Revision

277
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,140
is not a professional department for demon-hunting, after all.

278
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,010
In my opinion,

279
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,080
this issue

280
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,420
should be entirely handed over to the Celestial Master's Mansion.

281
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:02,790
Your Majesty,

282
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,520
demon-hunting

283
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,040
is indeed the responsibility of the Celestial Master's Mansion.

284
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,790
However, the case of Situ Hanshan

285
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,220
is full of doubts and conspiracies.

286
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,250
The Celestial Master's Mansion

287
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,480
may not be capable of dealing with it alone.

288
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,280
But this matter involves demons.

289
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,520
Your methods won't be effective.

290
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,470
Lord Du

291
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,090
is Dazhou's best demon hunter.

292
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,830
With him in charge of the Celestial Master's Mansion,

293
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,030
the citizens can feel at ease.

294
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,870
-You are wise, Your Majesty.
-You are wise, Your Majesty.

295
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,310
Yes, Your Majesty.

296
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,270
Your Majesty,

297
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,540
I want to say something.

298
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,070
Go ahead.

299
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,630
In this case,

300
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,500
after Chief Minister Pei was murdered,

301
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,840
it was the Court of Judicature and Revision that discovered the existence of the Puppet Worms

302
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,860
and identified the Puppet Spirit in front of you.

303
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,550
Director Nan,

304
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,390
at the risk of opposing all the officials,

305
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,510
went to the imperial prison

306
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,870
to investigate

307
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,800
the mermaid demons' conspiracy

308
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,190
and the hiding place of demons.

309
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:56,260
Moreover,

310
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,760
he prevented

311
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,140
Situ Hanshan's skin-changing plot last night.

312
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,380
If necessary,

313
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,330
you can seek assistance from the Court of Judicature and Revision.

314
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:04,990
Your Majesty,

315
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,990
I wonder if you could approve

316
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,350
the Celestial Master's Mansion to recruit more officials.

317
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,040
Okay.

318
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,000
I commend the Celestial Master's Mansion

319
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:12,740
to recruit

320
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,930
talented demon hunters

321
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:14,840
across the nation.

322
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,110
You're wise, Your Majesty.

323
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,170
Since then,

324
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,790
I possess Demon-Recognizing Pupils.

325
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,100
Would it be possible

326
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,630
for me to join the Celestial Master's Mansion?

327
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:23,840
Your Majesty,

328
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,460
the demon hunters of the Celestial Master's Mansion

329
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,870
are all rigorously selected.

330
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,150
Even if you have Demon-Recognizing Pupils,

331
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,430
you have to pass the test to join us.

332
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,350
If you were to be directly appointed,

333
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,580
it would cause criticism.

334
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,510
I believe

335
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,470
Miss Meng, with her talent,

336
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,050
will easily pass the test.

337
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,200
Young Master Du is reasonable.

338
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,190
Miss Meng,

339
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,290
you should participate in this assessment.

340
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,030
Yes, Your Majesty.

341
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,610
[Court of Judicature and Revision]

342
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,710
From now on,

343
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,430
the Court of Judicature and Revision will hand over all case files related to the Puppet Spirit

344
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:54,930
to the Celestial Master's Mansion,

345
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,660
and will no longer handle this case.

346
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,710
We object to this!

347
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,590
Our men died for the case.

348
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,320
Why will we hand it over to others and let them reap the rewards?

349
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,320
Nonsense!

350
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,730
Guarding the safety of Changle City's citizens

351
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,310
is the duty of the Court of Judicature and Revision.

352
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,430
If you're eager for credit,

353
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,990
just leave here and join the Celestial Master's Mansion.

354
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,480
What about Chief Minister Pei and Hui Fang?

355
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,990
Did they die in vain?

356
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,850
Of course not.

357
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,380
I understand your dissatisfaction,

358
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,570
but it won't help.

359
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:25,760
The Celestial Master's Mansion

360
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,620
has experts in demon-hunting.

361
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,290
Tomorrow, I will take the entrance exam for the Celestial Master's Mansion.

362
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,490
If I pass the exam,

363
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,120
we can legitimately

364
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,830
pursue Situ Hanshan.

365
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,380
We?

366
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:44,840
You,

367
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,970
the members of the Court of Judicature and Revision,

368
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,420
and me.

369
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,720
There will still be twenty-nine people.

370
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,800
I am willing to follow the spirits of Chief Minister Pei

371
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,140
and Hui Fang

372
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,790
to guard the safety of the people of Changle City

373
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,650
with all my might.

374
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,230
I am willing to do so, too.

375
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,750
Spare no effort

376
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,630
to achieve our goals.

377
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,990
Spare no effort

378
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,630
to achieve our goals.

379
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,670
Spare no effort

380
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,150
to achieve our goals.

381
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,990
Spare no effort

382
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,710
to achieve our goals.

383
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,150
From today,

384
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,320
we'll work in groups of two to three

385
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,440
to be stationed in each ward of Changle City.

386
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,830
Seal off the entrances and exits.

387
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,950
We will fully cooperate with the Celestial Master's Mansion

388
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,580
to jointly search for Situ Hanshan's whereabouts.

389
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,430
Yes, sir.

390
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,480
[Imperial Armory]

391
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,730
Master sent me here

392
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,010
to deliver the Mermaid Blood Pearl to Lord Situ.

393
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:33,960
Taking it

394
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,760
will help you recover faster.

395
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,200
If it weren't for Master's rescue this time,

396
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,480
I would have died.

397
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,700
You have been friends for so many years.

398
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,000
He will not abandon you.

399
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,290
But now

400
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,390
it's not convenient for you to meet.

401
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,630
I see.

402
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,910
How's the situation outside?

403
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,990
There are spies everywhere in the city.

404
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,850
Tomorrow, the Celestial Master's Mansion will recruit demon hunters from all over the world.

405
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:06,000
They're determined to find your whereabouts.

406
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,990
They are daydreaming.

407
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,470
I hope so.

408
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,119
What's the next step?

409
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,430
The Puppet Worms in the wine cellar

410
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:16,880
have all been confiscated.

411
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:23,990
Where are the worms from?

412
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:25,500
As you know,

413
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:28,030
Master never puts all his eggs in one basket.

414
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,690
Does he have a new plan?

415
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,200
We can't use the skins of officials.

416
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,440
Maybe using the skin of a specific person

417
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,580
can help us achieve our goals faster.

418
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:38,910
However,

419
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,910
this time, you have to take action.

420
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,790
Go back and tell Master that

421
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,820
I will make amends for my mistakes.

422
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,470
When will the master return?

423
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:55,120
[Dan Wu Agency]

424
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,100
She will be back soon.

425
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,440
Everyone, please calm down,

426
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:53,530
The master is mighty.

427
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,210
As for the demons that even the Celestial Master's Mansion couldn't detect,

428
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,010
she spotted them at a glance.

429
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:58,690
Please wait a moment.

430
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,990
Can we ask the master to check our houses?

431
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,290
-Is it my agency?
-No problem.

432
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,230
Let's go.

433
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,830
The master is back.

434
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:09,680
Excuse me.

435
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,470
Chirp.

436
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:12,990
Chirp.

437
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:13,800
Dan Qian.

438
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:14,840
What's going on?

439
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,150
Why did I become a master?

440
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,430
Chirp,

441
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,520
the news that you hunted demons in front of the Emperor

442
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,870
has spread throughout Changle City.

443
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,240
Wow.

444
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,400
They believe there are demons in Changle City.

445
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,030
Everyone wants to invite you to cleanse their homes.

446
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,950
You're finally back.

447
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,640
Hurry up, hurry up.

448
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,140
We have important matters to discuss with you.

449
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:36,660
Okay.

450
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,070
Calm down, everyone. Please calm down.

451
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:39,550
Line up.

452
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,420
Line up.

453
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,470
Tell them there are no quotas today.

454
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,350
Ask them to come here tomorrow.

455
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,910
The master has some issues to deal with today.

456
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,010
Please come here tomorrow.

457
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,680
Director Nan,

458
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,110
Chirp

459
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,230
is incapable of

460
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,370
anything.

461
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,160
Since she worked for the Court of Judicature and Revision,

462
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,680
she has been glamorous

463
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,170
of hunting demons and solving cases.

464
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:05,790
Moreover,

465
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,510
we can

466
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,180
use the talismans authorized by the Court of Judicature and Revision.

467
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,290
So I'll leave her in your care.

468
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:18,680
Uncle,

469
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,850
I'm

470
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,430
a renowned demon-hunting master now.

471
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,500
What do I need their talismans for?

472
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,920
Don't you know

473
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,270
your ability?

474
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,690
I know what you are exactly.

475
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,920
You've learned demon-hunting for so many years.

476
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,950
How did you suddenly become a demon hunter this year?

477
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,560
Isn't it because of Director Nan's help?

478
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,360
I am

479
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,860
counting on you

480
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,590
to kill Situ Hanshan

481
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,160
and restore peace

482
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,850
for the people of Changle City.

483
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,630
What's this?

484
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,190
I have packed all your belongings,

485
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:56,320
clothes and shoes for you.

486
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,870
Father and I

487
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:01,190
want you to learn skills with Director Nan.

488
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,300
Don't bully your sister.

489
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,630
Director Nan

490
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,870
has agreed

491
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,970
to hire you as a clerk at the Court of Judicature and Revision.

492
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,960
They will give you

493
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,150
salary and allowance.

494
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,260
There's even a year-end bonus if you perform well.

495
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,240
Our family

496
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,940
finally has someone who works for the government.

497
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,420
Serving for the authority is much better than being an agent.

498
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,470
Think about it.

499
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,070
Besides,

500
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,820
our house-cleansing business

501
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,710
will be entirely handled by the Court of Judicature and Revision.

502
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,840
There's no place for you in our family.

503
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:45,880
Uncle Wu,

504
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,030
are you really willing to

505
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,230
let me go?

506
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,030
Why don't you discuss it again?

507
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,110
I don't like to force her to do something.

508
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,980
No. No.

509
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,740
Not at all.

510
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,750
It's a rare opportunity.

511
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,650
Go for it!

512
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,110
Many

513
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,380
people

514
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,190
are fighting with both family backgrounds and exam scores

515
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,670
to get an opportunity.

516
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,690
What about you?

517
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:12,950
First, your father has passed away.

518
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:13,710
Second.

519
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:14,990
It's okay.

520
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,880
You're incapable of passing entrance exams.

521
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:16,790
Well,

522
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,750
if you miss this opportunity,

523
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,950
it's gone forever.

524
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,920
I intended to

525
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,480
make the house in the West Market

526
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:26,990
a shop for you.

527
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,110
I didn't realize that

528
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,590
you don't need it at all.

529
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:32,950
What

530
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,970
house in the West Market?

531
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,300
What shop in the West Market?

532
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,790
I'll take good care of Chirp.

533
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,750
Director Nan,

534
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,290
what the shop in the West Market she talked about?

535
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:43,670
I'm leaving, Uncle Wu.

536
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:44,630
Alright.

537
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,310
Please take care of our business.

538
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:48,840
Don't worry.

539
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,030
Director Nan,

540
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,460
do you like my sister?

541
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:14,590
Of course not.

542
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,490
Well, that's for the best.

543
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,770
Director Nan is not bad.

544
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,100
Miss Know-it-all,

545
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,710
what have you known this time?

546
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,790
A man with tough words but soft insides

547
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,890
is suitable for Chirp.

548
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,100
Is that what the 'Book of Plainness' teaches you?

549
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,390
Not bad?

550
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,910
Nonsense.

551
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,900
He's awesome!

552
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,340
I think I'd better

553
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,390
go stay somewhere else.

554
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,430
Where will you go?

555
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,050
I...

556
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,580
I can stay at the house in the West Market.

557
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,720
The house that Sikong She left for you

558
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,030
is the largest lavatory in the West Market.

559
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,990
Lavatory?

560
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:18,990
What

561
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,470
do you mean?

562
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,070
It's pretty spacious,

563
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,830
but I'm afraid you won't be comfortable living there.

564
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,790
I won't be comfortable...

565
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:31,680
I've done

566
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,320
all sorts of dirty and hard work before.

567
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,190
I'll be comfortable

568
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:35,940
to live in my own place.

569
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,990
Do you dislike staying at my house?

570
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,510
No.

571
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,450
It's just...

572
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,180
It's just that your father has an eccentric personality.

573
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,360
What if he decides to kick me out?

574
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:50,650
Would he?

575
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,750
Wouldn't he?

576
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,480
Welcome home.

577
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,240
I have prepared lots of dishes.

578
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:08,900
Come, have a seat.

579
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:09,960
Let's go.

580
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,150
Did

581
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,070
Uncle Nan make them all?

582
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,350
It's Ms. Wang,

583
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,510
our neighbor, who made it.

584
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:27,320
Neighbor?

585
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,510
That must be

586
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,340
the little sister Master mentioned before.

587
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,470
She must be cute.

588
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,360
Who's talking about me?

589
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:39,790
Yao Niang.

590
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:40,270
The dish is coming.

591
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,110
There are too many dishes.

592
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:41,890
Come and take this.

593
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:44,310
Be careful.

594
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,030
Here.

595
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,150
Nan was rude to you last time.

596
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,460
I've already scolded him for it.

597
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,230
These dishes

598
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,790
are our way of apologizing to you.

599
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:54,280
It's okay, it's okay.

600
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,740
I'm glad the misunderstanding is cleared up.

601
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,380
Thank you, Ms. Wang.

602
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,430
Well, enjoy your meal.

603
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,060
I'll leave now.

604
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,250
Why don't you join us for the meal?

605
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,990
It's a family meal.

606
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:06,920
I won't disturb you.

607
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:07,550
I'm off.

608
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,790
-A family?
-No.

609
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,190
Ms. Wang, who runs a martial arts school in the neighborhood,

610
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,230
became a widow many years ago.

611
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,790
She suffered a lot these years.

612
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,750
That's her personality,

613
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,330
coming and going without a trace.

614
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,430
Eat.

615
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,390
Girl,

616
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,190
after this welcoming feast,

617
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:41,550
we will be

618
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,390
a family.

619
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,950
A family?

620
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,270
I'd like to make a toast to you.

621
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,480
It's been a long time since I've had

622
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,830
such a delicious family dinner.

623
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:00,590
Thank you.

624
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:02,750
No need to thank him.

625
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,670
He just finds excuses

626
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,150
to drink every day.

627
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,260
You brat,

628
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,080
what are you saying?

629
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,110
I'm telling the truth.

630
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,360
Uncle Nan likes to drink?

631
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,190
Uncle Nan,

632
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,210
I love drinking, too.

633
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,350
Cheers.

634
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:21,110
See?

635
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,710
There is someone who can drink with me in the family.

636
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,560
Master,

637
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,670
you

638
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,310
don't know me.

639
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,680
I can hold my liquor quite well.

640
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:40,790
Have you forgotten

641
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,520
that you will have the exam of the Celestial Master's Mansion tomorrow?

642
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,090
No.

643
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,360
It's not a big deal.

644
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:46,470
Uncle Nan,

645
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:47,470
cheers.

646
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,910
Cheers.

647
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:57,910
Uncle Nan,

648
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:01,710
I've drunk it.

649
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:03,540
Father.

650
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,830
Be careful.

651
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,380
I'm fine.

652
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,500
The Nan family's wine

653
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,300
is good.

654
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,400
I'm not even drunk.

655
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,430
How's my performance, Master?

656
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,790
I can hold my liquor well, right?

657
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:38,070
Take me back to my room.

658
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,260
♫The leaves turn yellow as the weather cools♫

659
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,190
Let me go,

660
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,960
♫The clouds half-cover the moonlight♫

661
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,150
Master,

662
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,170
♫Cooking smoke rises, leaving a lingering fragrance♫

663
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,710
Uncle Nan never allows you

664
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,310
to get close to women.

665
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,320
♫I offer my love in exchange for appreciating the morning frost with you♫

666
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,550
But he let you take me as your disciple

667
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,980
♫How can I contain this fluttering heart?♫

668
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,880
and even let me live in your house.

669
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:02,960
Do you think

670
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:06,130
♫Eyes never lie♫

671
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,590
it is because he feels lonely?

672
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,160
Nonsense.

673
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,570
♫Listen, each heartbeat echoes♫

674
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,220
He loves Ms. Wang.

675
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,530
♫Every echo gently knocks upon my heart♫

676
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,080
Then what about you, Master?

677
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,500
♫Untie the silk robes and remove the makeup♫

678
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:19,870
♫A silver bell chimes by the umbrella♫

679
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:18,870
What are you thinking about?

680
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,750
I don't even treat you as a woman at all.

681
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,190
♫Rain falls upon the paper♫

682
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,650
♫Every drop mirrors you♫

683
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:30,310
♫My fluttering heart has nowhere to rest♫

684
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,720
♫I can't hide the nervousness in my eyes♫

685
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:33,780
What are you doing?

686
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:39,020
♫Thinking of sharing dreams with you, have you been well?♫

687
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,500
There's

688
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,590
a faint smell of herbs on you.

689
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,670
♫Light a lamp at twilight♫

690
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:46,240
♫Attempt to keep time♫

691

You smelled it?

692
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,590
So what?

693
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:52,520
♫Love poem warms the wine up and makes the moon drunk♫

694
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:47,950
Well,

695
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,360
I'm the first woman

696
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,380
to smell the scent on you.

697
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,920
♫In the alley in the rain♫

698
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,050
So what?

699
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,160
Well,

700
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:00,570
♫They're in pairs♫

701
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,050
it stinks.

702
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,070
Remember to wash it off.

703
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:06,340
♫I can't forget you♫

704
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,670
♫Sing about the old times with the sound of zither♫

Meng Xizhou,

707

♫The night is lit up with glittering light flying through the autumn windows♫

708
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:15,790
you're pretending to be drunk.

709
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,070
How could the low alcohol

710
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,400
make me crocked?

711
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:23,970
♫The fallen flowers had the fragrance of the town♫

712
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,450
♫Like the two of us♫

♫Like you're by my side♫

714

Are you angry?

715
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,950
I'm just kidding.

716
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,070
But

717
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,830
you made some progress.

718
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,490
This time, you didn't get a nosebleed.

719
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,090
So, for tomorrow's exam of the Celestial Master's Mansion,

720
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,530
you'll be there, right?

721
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,150
Why should I be there?

722
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,110
Because with Master there,

723
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,590
I will be more powerful.

724
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:58,410
You're my reservoir of power.

725
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,070
Taking the exam of the Celestial Master's Mansion is your own business.

726
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,840
Why should others help you?

727
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,380
I...

728
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,630
I was planning to teach you

729
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,510
the Five-element Technique today.

730
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,030
But you showed such an attitude.

731
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,070
Learn it by yourself, then.

732
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,250
No, Master, I...

733
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,430
Damn it. It's all over.

734
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,630
He really doesn't care about me anymore.

735
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,630
Fire restricts wind.

736
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,270
Wind restricts thunder.

737
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,250
The hand gesture is...

738
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,080
Nan Fengyi,

739
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:08,790
look at my horse.

740
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,280
It's plump and strong

741
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,310
with a shiny coat.

742
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,490
It can carry me from Changle City all the way to Xizhou.

743
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,630
Brother,

744
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,090
you're still alive?

745
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:21,550
Pei,

746
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:22,700
it's time to go.

747
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,160
Alright.

748
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:27,990
Hui Fang.

749
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,710
Nan,

750
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:30,600
please

751
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,390
take care of my family for me.

752
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,540
From now on, you'll have to rely on yourself.

753
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:39,470
However,

754
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,640
you need to be more careful in everything you do.

755
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,390
What do you mean by that?

756
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:46,630
Nan,

757
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,400
I just found out

758
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,290
you've been secretly practicing the Big Dipper Primordial Spell secretly

759
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,500
to retrieve the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

760
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,330
If that's the case,

761
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,350
be careful of Agent Meng.

762
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,110
Her appearance

763
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,550
might not be a good thing for you.

764
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,260
Hui Fang, what do you mean?

765
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,030
With her by my side,

766
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:17,820
my Big Dipper Primordial Spell

767
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,910
is progressing smoothly.

768
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,230
Nan,

769
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,390
be careful of Agent Meng.

770
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,320
Her appearance

771
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,390
may not be a good thing for you.

772
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,830
As long as I can master the Big Dipper Primordial Spell,

773
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,480
what does it matter if I endure some suffering?
