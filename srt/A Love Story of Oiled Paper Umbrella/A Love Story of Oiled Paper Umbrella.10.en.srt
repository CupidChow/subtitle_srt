1
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,070
Chirp.

2
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,200
Are you all right?

3
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,120
I was worried about you.

4
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,470
I'm fine.

5
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,750
Come home with me.

6
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,120
What happened?

7
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,150
She'll be back

8
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,590
after she has some rest in the palace for several days.

9
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,280
Your Highness.

10
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,560
She's with me.

11
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,680
Don't you worry.

12
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,710
No one dares to bully her.

13
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,400
I'll send her back

14
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,590
after she has some rest for several days.

15
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,400
We appreciate your kindness, Your Highness.

16
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,560
But after all,

17
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,840
she'll feel at ease if she can rest at home.

18
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,360
Your Highness, you're right.

19
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,630
There are many imperial physicians

20
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,360
in the palace,

21
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,840
which is good for me to recover.

22
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,710
Don't worry.

23
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:55,630
I'll come home

24
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,360
when I recover.

25
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,150
Are you sure?

26
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,830
What are you afraid of?

27
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,120
She won't be wronged

28
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,430
when she's with me.

29
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,710
Don't worry.

30
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:10,800
Okay.

31
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,590
I'll pick you up

32
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:14,840
when you recover.

33
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,150
Don't worry.

34
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,120
I'll send her back.

35
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,430
Thanks.

36
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:06,870
It's nothing.

37
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,120
My pleasure.

38
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,159
You're still alive?

39
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,120
No.

40
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,390
This should be just a dream.

41
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,920
Situ Hanshan,

42
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,800
you did all the bad things.

43
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,720
You used my skin through skin transformation,

44
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,680
without knowing that I was born with a constitution that shares an affinity with demons.

45
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,240
Besides, half of your Demon Pill

46
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,710
has long been damaged.

47
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,000
Now you narrowly live under my skin.

48
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,040
You'll endure the burning pain day and night.

49
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,950
In the end,

50
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,240
you'll die in agony

51
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,720
in endless torture.

52
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,160
You're already dead.

53
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,560
Stop playing tricks on me!

54
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,800
I'm dead,

55
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,680
but retributive justice remains.

56
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,800
Could it not be a dream?

57
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,120
Where is Master?

58
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,120
Master

59
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,310
can't show up for the time being.

60
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,870
Lord Situ,

61
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,560
you took the risk of combining yourself with the female worm of the Jinsi Puppet Worm

62
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,360
for the skin of Du Fenglei.

63
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,360
What a clever strategy.

64
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,360
As long as you're alive,

65
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,120
there's hope.

66
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,000
But the Sky-covering Formation

67
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,920
is the strongest formation that can't possibly be broken.

68
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,870
How could it end up broken?

69
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,920
I was careless.

70
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,430
I always believed that no one could break this formation

71
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,870
because there is no such thing in the world.

72
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,360
What

73
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,430
is the thing?

74
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,070
I need some more time to conduct an investigation.

75
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,750
Ren Guang!

76
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,120
Ren Guang!

77
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,360
Ren Guang!

78
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,240
Ren Guang!

79
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,560
W-Where are you?

80
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,680
You can't accept the fact that you're a demon, can you?

81
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,840
Have you long known

82
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,680
that I'm a demon?

83
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,000
So what?

84
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,000
Didn't you say

85
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,750
that demons are the same as humans?

86
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,070
They're both intelligent

87
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,360
and sentimental.

88
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,480
No, they're different.

89
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,560
Demons always do evil things.

90
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,430
They kill people

91
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,720
and their own kinds.

92
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,870
At that time, you were a human.

93
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,120
That's how you would treat demons.

94
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,120
But now you are a demon.

95
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,240
You should view it from a different perspective.

96
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,630
But even so,

97
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,990
you shouldn't have encouraged me

98
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,680
to be the best demon hunter in the world.

99
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,120
You're so crafty!

100
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,310
Chirp.

101
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,040
Your father,

102
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,560
Li Shiyi,

103
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,070
was indeed the best demon hunter in the world.

104
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,800
Becoming someone like your father

105
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,560
has always been your dream.

106
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,000
How can I break your dream?

107
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,560
So,

108
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,680
my mother

109
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,750
is a demon?

110
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,870
Be it a human or a demon,

111
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,550
there's no difference at all.

112
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,920
She's your mother after all.

113
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,070
Why would Father unreasonably choose a demon

114
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,070
to give birth to a monster like me?

115
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,950
Take the time to accept your changes.

116
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,390
Chirp,

117
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,720
you're not a monster.

118
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,190
You are

119
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,000
just yourself.

120
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,510
Can you tell me

121
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,080
about my mother now?

122
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,080
Don't overthink it.

123
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,150
Everything has its own cause.

124
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,320
When the time comes,

125
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,200
you'll know for yourself.

126
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,080
You're playing tricks on me again.

127
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,840
What on earth happened?

128
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,080
You seemed fine just now.

129
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,480
Hurry!

130
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,200
Call the imperial physician here!

131
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,360
Yes.

132
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,790
Luckily, you didn't go back.

133
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,870
Otherwise, I would be worried sick.

134
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,600
Your Highness.

135
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,550
Thank you.

136
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,360
Miss.

137
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,440
What's wrong with her?

138
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,350
Why does she keep vomiting blood?

139
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,320
Say something!

140
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,200
Aren't you the most reputational physician

141
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,240
in the Imperial Medical Office?

142
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,550
Your Highness, please forgive me.

143
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,080
I've never seen such a pulse condition

144
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,150
like hers before.

145
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,600
I can't cure her.

146
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:22,960
What?

147
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,440
What do you mean by saying that?

148
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,080
She was fine just now!

149
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,870
Please forgive my ignorance.

150
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,550
Even if I go all out,

151
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,080
I'm afraid she can't be cured.

152
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,000
She can't be cured?

153
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,480
All of you

154
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,200
are quacks!

155
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,240
Yes.

156
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Your Highness, please forgive me!

157
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,360
Your Highness.

158
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,870
Don't make it hard for him.

159
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,240
You may leave now.

160
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,670
At the right time,

161
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,510
I hereby announce

162
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,790
that Nan Fengyi

163
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,320
has done a great job and contributed a lot

164
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,870
in terms of catching demons.

165
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:56,670
He is now promoted

166
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,550
to Chief Minister of the Court of Judicature and Revision

167
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,870
to guard the Imperial City.

168
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,000
Besides,

169
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,000
given that Celestial Master's Mansion has contributed to the country

170
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,390
by eliminating demons and saving the world,

171
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,000
I hereby

172
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,550
grant Lord Du Fenglei

173
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,030
third rank title

174
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:13,910
and

175
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,630
the position of Qianniu Imperial Bodyguard.

176
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,080
All Masters

177
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,030
will be rewarded.

178
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

179
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,550
Great!

180
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,720
What should we do?

181
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,270
Your Highness.

182
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,670
How about...

183
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,480
How about

184
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,870
you find me a vet?

185
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,270
A vet?

186
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,880
By seeing it in a new light,

187
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,390
I am

188
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,440
a bird now.

189
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,390
Maybe,

190
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,630
someone with relevant experience

191
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,630
will help me out.

192
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,150
That makes sense.

193
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,150
Bottle, Can.

194
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:03,790
Yes.

195
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,630
Call the vet here.

196
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,320
Yes.

197
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,320
Call the vet!

198
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,200
Your Highness,

199
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,910
you're indeed kind-hearted.

200
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,750
You even

201
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,840
let an injured bird

202
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,270
stay on the bed.

203
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,790
Cut the crap.

204
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,550
Check her out.

205
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:28,790
Sit down.

206
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,670
This is a rare species.

207
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,440
It's not for ordinary people.

208
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,790
But I need to check its pulse.

209
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:47,790
Hold it tightly.

210
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,790
It's indeed a rare species.

211
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,150
It can even understand what you said.

212
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,750
Your Highness,

213
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,030
this rare bird

214
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:09,870
just

215
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,720
got an internal injury.

216
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,480
As long as

217
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,390
it takes the Five-poison Powder

218
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,270
specially made by me,

219
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,440
it'll feel good

220
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:16,790
in three days.

221
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,550
Five-poison Powder?

222
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,080
In other words,

223
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,030
a mixture of

224
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:24,790
horse dung,

225
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:25,750
rotten wood,

226
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:26,870
centipede,

227
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:27,670
mudstone,

228
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,790
and moldy millet

229
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,200
should be fed to her.

230
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,200
What millet?

231
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,550
Moldy millet.

232
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,790
Millet that goes moldy.

233
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:37,680
Okay.

234
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,150
Go and prescribe the medication.

235
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,550
Bottle,

236
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:40,390
you go

237
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,750
and come back as soon as you're done with the decoction.

238
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,510
Yes.

239
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,320
Goddess.

240
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,670
Look,

241
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,080
it's the right thing to give you the right medicine.

242
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,030
I don't want to undergo the treatment.

243
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,910
What's wrong?

244
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,320
Don't you want to be who you were before?

245
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,150
Yes.

246
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,910
I'm afraid

247
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,030
I can never go back.

248
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,720
It's okay.

249
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,150
When you recover,

250
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,030
you will still

251
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,720
be the...

252
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,670
The...

253
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,630
The...

254
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,550
The Goddess that everyone loves.

255
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,150
In the future,

256
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,910
if you manifest a demon shape,

257
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,870
you should come to me.

258
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,790
I'll get you a vet.

259
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,200
There are many vets in Dazhou.

260
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,670
I can even get ten for you.

261
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,000
It's useless.

262
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,320
Even if you get me ten vets

263
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,910
and they cure me,

264
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:02,870
I'm still a demon.

265
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,270
Then you are also a cute demon.

266
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,240
Who is it?

267
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,550
It's me, Master.

268
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
You are...

269
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,440
Guo Ji.

270
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,320
Can't you recognize my voice?

271
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,000
Come in.

272
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:08,870
Master.

273
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,600
What are you doing here?

274
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,320
Master,

275
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,550
didn't you suspect

276
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,750
Nan Fengyi is a demon?

277
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,120
Yes.

278
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,240
I've investigated him for a long time.

279
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,350
I'm sure he's not a demon.

280
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:23,870
Really?

281
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,720
But he's father

282
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,960
is definitely suspicious.

283
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,840
What is it?

284
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,600
His name is Nan Sixu.

285
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,670
Guess who he is.

286
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,510
Who is he?

287
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,550
He was Baize Gong's wife's younger brother.

288
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,150
Baize Gong?

289
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,510
Weren’t all of them executed

290
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,150
that year?

291
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,390
Yes.

292
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,000
Seems

293
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,120
that the Baize family

294
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,910
left a way out.

295
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,720
Could it be that

296
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,480
Nan Fengyi is a descendant of the Baize family?

297
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,870
Help me check

298
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,240
if Nan Fengyi is Nan Sixu's biological child.

299
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:00,960
No problem.

300
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:01,950
I'll do it right now.

301
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,120
By the way,

302
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,440
please throw away

303
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,240
this terrible umbrella for me.

304
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,240
Master,

305
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:11,960
this...

306
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:12,720
What's wrong?

307
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,960
This umbrella...

308
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,310
It...

309
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,160
It's very important to you and Junior.

310
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,550
If you throw it away,

311
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:23,829
Junior

312
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,960
will

313
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:25,960
kill you.

314
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,550
I've read some books recently,

315
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,480
from which I learned

316
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,110
the concept of simplifying your life.

317
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,310
How could I throw such an important thing...

318
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,590
I'm a fool.

319
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,000
How could I

320
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,640
throw such an important thing away?

321
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,070
Master,

322
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,350
have some tea.

323
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,790
How many times have I told you

324
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,790
I don't drink tea?

325
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:55,750
I...

326
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,200
I was wondering

327
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,640
why it seems you have changed recently.

328
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,880
Turns out you learned to clean up the room.

329
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,680
You even added a new tea plate.

330
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:03,920
That's great.

331
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,400
Go.

332
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,480
Go and check it for me.

333
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:07,750
Yes.

334
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,160
Master.

335
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,000
What's wrong?

336
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:23,750
In a few days,

337
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,110
there will be a promotion assessment held by the Celestial Master's Mansion.

338
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,070
Do you think...

339
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,790
Can you...

340
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,240
What level are you in?

341
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:34,960
Have you forgotten?

342
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,550
I'm in level 2.

343
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,350
I've taken the test related to the Five-thunder Book for ten years,

344
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,240
but I failed every time.

345
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,240
Help me find out

346
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,480
about Nan Fengyi,

347
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,160
and I will reward you.

348
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:54,750
Got it!

349
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,310
Good tea.

350
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,070
Have a look.

351
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:04,830
Take a look.

352
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,920
Have a look.

353
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,440
The art of making sesame pastries was learned from the capital;

354
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,920
It's crisp, fragrant,

355
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,550
and freshly baked.

356
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,920
Take a look. Have a look.

357
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,270
Freshly baked sesame pastries!

358
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,440
Freshly baked sesame pastries!

359
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,160
Chief Minister Nan,

360
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:22,880
you're here.

361
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,750
Director Nan,

362
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,680
do you smell

363
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,790
something fragrant?

364
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:33,960
Sesame pastries?

365
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,200
Freshly baked sesame pastries!

366
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,920
Is it good?

367
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,550
Seeing the beloved one eating sesame pastries...

368
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,310
Sesame pastries!

369
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,070
Try it. Try it.

370
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,760
Is really a happy thing.

371
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,960
Fragrant and crisp sesame pastries!

372
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,270
Here.

373
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:57,750
Wait.

374
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,510
Add some sugar.

375
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,110
Add some...

376
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,270
So sweet.

377
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,240
No need.

378
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,160
When I take medicine,

379
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,590
I don't need any sugar.

380
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:49,880
Amazing.

381
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:53,960
Your Highness,

382
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,680
thank you for what you've done

383
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,240
these days.

384
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,400
I'm much better now.

385
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,680
Except that some feathers would fall

386
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,240
from this arm from time to time.

387
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,550
It's okay.

388
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,750
Everything will be fine.

389
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,590
Besides,

390
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,000
others can't see it.

391
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,830
Unfortunately,

392
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,790
I'm no longer the original Meng Xizhou

393
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,550
who can become a demon hunter.

394
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,480
Because I

395
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,110
am a demon now.

396
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,830
Your Highness,

397
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,920
Nan Fengyi requests to see Miss Chirp.

398
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:44,950
He wants to see her.

399
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:50,830
I think

400
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,000
Nan Fengyi cares about you a lot.

401
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,830
He's come here several times a day.

402
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,590
No.

403
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,480
Given my current condition,

404
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,480
I can't see him.

405
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,640
You're doing well now.

406
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,000
Others can't see it.

407
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,510
Whether he'll find out about me or not,

408
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,750
he's a human

409
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,440
and I'm a demon.

410
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,550
We used to fight

411
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,440
side by side.

412
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,440
But now,

413
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:34,070
I've become his enemy.

414
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,440
It's time

415
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,240
to end this.

416
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,400
Luckily, it's still hot.

417
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,510
Chirp.

418
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,000
Here.

419
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,350
Sesame pastry.

420
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,270
I saw it in the night market.

421
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,200
Since you took a liking to it,

422
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,480
I bought one for you.

423
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,880
Do you think my new feather fan is beautiful?

424
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,240
Yes.

425
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,550
Eat it while it's hot.

426
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,920
Come on, let's go home.

427
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,640
I...

428
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,960
I won't go back to Nan's Umbrella Shop with you anymore.

429
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,550
Why?

430
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,480
Enough. Enough.

431
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,240
Anything else?

432
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,160
Your Highness,

433
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,480
what did you say to Chirp?

434
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,200
Why did she suddenly

435
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,240
become like this?

436
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,160
Me?

437
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,110
What does it have to do with me?

438
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,400
As a single girl,

439
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,920
is it appropriate for you to live in the Prince's Palace?

440
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,240
Well, what do you mean?

441
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,200
If it's inappropriate for her to live in the Prince's Palace,

442
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,680
is it appropriate for her to live in Nan's Umbrella Shop?

443
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,070
Weird logic.

444
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,240
Stop arguing.

445
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,030
I made this decision.

446
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,720
I think living in the Prince's Palace

447
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,510
is better than living in Nan's Umbrella Shop.

448
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,160
Of course.

449
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,310
This is the imperial palace after all.

450
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,920
In case of any need from Goddess,

451
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,440
any doctors will be ready anytime.

452
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,310
You're right.

453
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,480
Do you mean it?

454
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,400
Yes.

455
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,790
Given what she said,

456
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,440
you'd better not ask for humiliation.

457
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,400
Goddess,

458
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,000
let's go.

459
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,960
Chirp.

460
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,750
No matter what happened,

461
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,880
don't do this to me.

462
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,830
We should go.

463
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,550
You should leave too.

464
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,200
Fine.

465
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,070
Fine.

466
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,240
Fine.

467
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,240
Goddess,

468
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,000
no offense.

469
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,920
Thank you.

470
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,430
Actually,

471
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,160
you don't have to be so nice to me.

472
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:34,680
It's okay.

473
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:35,920
As long as you are happy,

474
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,270
I'm willing to do anything.

475
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:42,960
If

476
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,960
I weren't who I am,

477
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,110
I would be happy.

478
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,830
Actually, it's not about who you are.

479
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,350
Likewise,

480
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:57,880
I'm the Crown Prince,

481
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,640
but it's not something I can choose.

482
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,110
Even though others envy

483
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,510
or hate me,

484
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,680
it's just an identity decided by the fate,

485
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,640
which is used to travel in the mortal world.

486
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,960
His Highness

487
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,030
has put much effort.

488
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,480
I don't think

489
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:36,070
Miss Meng likes him.

490
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,240
I hope

491
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,590
love can grow over time

492
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,590
and His Highness

493
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,550
can win her over with sincerity.

494
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,080
Can

495
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,110
it really work?

496
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,510
Of course.

497
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,960
Women are the most emotional.

498
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:53,790
And...

499
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,590
Forget it.

500
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,270
You won't understand even if I tell you.

501
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,640
By the way,

502
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,240
tomorrow,

503
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,960
I want to go to the Celestial Master's Mansion.

504
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,680
Celestial Master's Mansion?

505
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,240
Aren't you happy living in the Prince's Palace?

506
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,190
I

507
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,160
just want to say goodbye

508
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,480
to my past days.

509
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,440
Then I'll go with you.

510
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,070
No need.

511
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,440
Guo Ji,

512
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,880
if you kill this snake demon,

513
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,440
you'll be promoted.

514
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,480
Yes, Master.

515
00:28:59,270 --> 00:28:59,830
Meng Xizhou!

516
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,070
Meng Xizhou.

517
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,680
Where have you been these days?

518
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,200
Do you know

519
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,880
today is the day of the Celestial Master's Mansion's assessment?

520
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,680
Come with me.

521
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:17,920
Wait.

522
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,480
I have something to tell you.

523
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,400
Let's talk after the assessment.

524
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,030
I passed!

525
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,350
I finally passed!

526
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,070
I quit.

527
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,350
What did you say?

528
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,200
I'm here today

529
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,640
to resign as a demon hunter.

530
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,350
This is my resignation letter.

531
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,920
What happened?

532
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,120
No wonder I heard

533
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,880
the relationship between this woman and the Crown Prince is far from ordinary.

534
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,960
Turns out she has risen from obscurity to prominence.

535
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,480
She doesn't want

536
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,240
to be a tiring and dangerous demon hunter.

537
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:05,880
Du Yuelian,

538
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:06,920
it's not like that.

539
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,680
I just...

540
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:12,790
I can't...

541
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,680
I can't catch demons anymore.

542
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,200
Meng Xizhou.

543
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,200
Do you know what you're talking about?

544
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,070
When you were an agent,

545
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,200
you said

546
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,240
being a demon hunter

547
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,400
was your dream.

548
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,070
But what do you take the Celestial Master's Mansion for?

549
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,270
You can come and go

550
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:30,880
as you wish.

551
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,830
You really let me down.

552
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,480
I'm sorry.

553
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:43,920
Since

554
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,400
you joined us on your own,

555
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,680
now that you want to leave,

556
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,510
you have to rely on your ability as well.

557
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,510
Defeat me first.

558
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,270
Stop!

559
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,640
She just recovered from the battle involved with Situ Hanshan.

560
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,440
Master Du, how could you make things difficult for her?

561
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,590
Chirp,

562
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,550
let's go.

563
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,350
No need.

564
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,070
Nan Fengyi,

565
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,110
thank you for speaking for me.

566
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,240
Miss Meng,

567
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,000
His Highness is afraid that you'll feel tired during the travel,

568
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,680
so he sent us to take you back to the Prince's Palace.

569
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:40,790
Sure.

570
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:45,680
Chirp!

571
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,030
Why?

572
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,070
Nan Fengyi.

573
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,790
Let's not

574
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,790
meet again.

575
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:13,880
Why

576
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,720
do you do this to me?

577
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,480
Why?

578
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:46,830
Junior.

579
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,030
Look.

580
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,680
Am I right?

581
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,240
She has climbed the social ladder.

582
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,640
No.

583
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:54,790
Meng Xizhou

584
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,400
is not that kind of person.

585
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:57,790
Look at her.

586
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,480
She is so cold and heartless.

587
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,400
Meng Xizhou used to try every means to join the Celestial Master's Mansion,

588
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,790
but now she suddenly looks like a different person.

589
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,200
Something must have happened.

590
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:19,840
What's the matter?

591
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,550
Wait a second.

592
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,270
I found it.

593
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:26,630
Look at this.

594
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,030
In the last battle,

595
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,360
the Sky-covering Formation was broken.

596
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,110
I thought it was weird.

597
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,150
Logically speaking,

598
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,400
no one in the world

599
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,630
can break this formation.

600
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,670
But it was suddenly broken.

601
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,150
So,

602
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,190
I thought there could be a way to break the formation.

603
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:44,800
Look at the end.

604
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,670
The way to break the formation.

605
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,320
Only the blood of the Golden-winged Roc

606
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,110
can break this formation.

607
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,670
Golden-winged Roc.

608
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,960
Perhaps, my blood can break the formation.

609
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,150
By the way, Nan Fengyi,

610
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:13,710
who else

611
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:14,670
was there at the altar

612
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,320
except you?
