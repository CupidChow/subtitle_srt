00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,080
[Episode 22]

3
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,340
Goddess,

4
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,750
farewell.

5
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:49,870
Meng Xizhou.

6
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,070
You should call me

7
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,680
Demon Queen.

8
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,950
Goddess.

9
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:54,710
Leave here quickly.

10
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:58,990
Miao Yun,

11
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,420
you've committed so many evil deeds

12
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,710
in these years.

13
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,110
Today,

14
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,200
I'll kill you.

15
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,480
As long as I have the dragon aura with me,

16
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,930
even you can't harm me.

17
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,550
Moreover,

18
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,740
I have a secret weapon.

19
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,710
What do you mean?

20
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:28,640
Nan Fengyi.

21
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,310
Why?

22
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,990
Why didn't my Shigu Scale

23
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,810
work on you?

24
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,070
Miao Yun,

25
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,660
do you think you're the only one

26
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,670
who knows the illusionary technique to bewitch people?

27
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,460
♫The wind hesitates, not daring to smooth the furrowed brow♫

28
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,780
♫The rain hesitates, reluctant to burden the tear-streaked eyes beneath the umbrella♫

29
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,210
Come here, kitty.

30
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,410
You

31
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,500
came at me first.

32
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,950
But now you're accusing me?

33
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,710
♫The closer you are to me, the clearer the pain becomes♫

34
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,190
Cry if you want to.

35
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,090
No one will see your tears.

36
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,610
There are

37
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,440
good human beings.

38
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,510
♫The most painful separation means you can't even miss her♫

39
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,430
There

40
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,709
are good demons, too.

41
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,990
♫In silence, the world's grudges weave a web of entanglement♫

42
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,589
No matter you're a human or a demon,

43
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,450
you are my disciple, Chirp.

44
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,340
♫Under the clouds, the smoke from cooking rises and spreads freely♫

45
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,530
♫It's the love doomed by fate♫

46
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,110
Chirp.

47
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,430
♫Under the umbrella, your profile is gently framed by the soft strands of your hair♫

48
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,270
You have been

49
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,730
♫Should my heart belong to someone for ten thousand years♫

50
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,310
controlled by Miao Yun.

51
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:45,490
♫Through endless lifetimes, softly and quietly, it flows on♫

52
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,130
Nan Fengyi,

53
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,180
your strength is far inferior to mine now.

54
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,630
It's not too late to

55
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,030
♫I won't lose you♫

56
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,530
surrender to me.

57
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,920
♫I'll sacrifice myself to help you♫

58
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:59,210
♫With a single lamp and a thousand books, alone I'm restless through the night♫

59
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,630
What are you doing?

60
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,620
My body

61
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,370
is controlled by Miao Yun with the Shigu Scale

62
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:05,840
♫Give me a fleeting moment of rain, to be held captive by your side♫

63
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,450
to activate the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

64
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,590
There's the last awareness I have

65
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,110
to control myself.

66
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,990
♫Under the umbrella, your profile is gently framed by the soft strands of your hair♫

67
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,310
♫Should my heart belong to someone for ten thousand years♫

68
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,310
Quick!

69
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,310
Don't you want to kill me?

70
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:20,060
♫Through endless lifetimes, softly and quietly, it flows on♫

71
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,230
Kill me now!

72
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,810
Hurry!

73
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,120
You...

74
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,600
♫I won't lose you♫

75
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,490
♫I'll sacrifice myself to help you♫

76
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:33,790
♫With a single lamp and a thousand books, alone I'm restless through the night♫

77
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:40,409
♫Give me a fleeting moment of rain, to be held captive by your side♫

78
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,950
Why don't you kill me?

79
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,550
♫Under the umbrella, your profile is gently framed by the soft strands of your hair♫

80
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,900
Miao Yun possesses the Emperor's dragon aura.

81
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,030
You are the only one

82
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,830
who can help me open the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

83
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,870
♫Should my heart belong to someone for ten thousand years♫

84
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,830
Then, I can catch her.

85
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:57,610
♫Through endless lifetimes, softly and quietly, it flows on♫

86
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,630
So, I removed the Shigu Scale from your body.

87
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,470
My meridians have been destroyed along with the Shigu Scale.

88
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:02,160
♫I won't lose you♫

89
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,630
The internal power of existence

90
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:05,040
♫I'll sacrifice myself to help you♫

91
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,190
is not enough to open the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

92
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:11,330
♫With a single lamp and a thousand books, alone I'm restless through the night♫

93
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,550
With the Demon Queen's help,

94
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,790
what do you have to worry about?

95
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:18,010
♫Give me a fleeting moment of rain, to be held captive by your side♫

96
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,430
Baize Yi,

97
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,670
how dare you betray me?

98
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,230
Your Highness.

99
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:55,670
Your Highness.

100
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,440
Zhai Yue.

101
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,000
I never thought the mermaid princess

102
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,760
would be in such pain

103
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,760
when you witness the death of your loved ones.

104
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,590
Have you ever thought

105
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,270
my Uncle Wu

106
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,909
and countless people

107
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:44,150
you killed in Changle City

108
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,950
were abandoned by their families

109
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,430
and died miserably in the end?

110
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,110
That's what they deserve.

111
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,870
What's the matter?

112
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,190
I'm injured.

113
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:56,930
Please help me.

114
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,510
You saved me?

115
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,150
You're welcome.

116
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,070
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,740
For what?

118
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,750
You demon!

119
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,420
You can't escape!

120
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,900
You utilized my kindness!

121
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,350
We have no choice.

122
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,150
You're a demon.

123
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:38,789
Stop!

124
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,550
The ancestors in your eyes

125
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,030
are nothing

126
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,750
but ruthless villains in our view.

127
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,390
That's the reason

128
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,070
why you started

129
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,030
endless revenge against humans, huh?

130
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:58,790
Yes!

131
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,750
I want them to taste

132
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,070
the feeling of being exterminated.

133
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,110
When will this cycle of revenge end?

134
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,270
Hanshan.

135
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,910
I couldn't

136
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:38,670
avenge you and our demon clan.

137
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:48,220
I failed to avenge you and our demon clan.

138
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:06,830
Demon Queen,

139
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:07,550
I will kill you!

140
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:08,830
Stop!

141
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,220
Are you blind?

142
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,150
It was the Demon Queen who helped us defeat

143
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,020
Miao Yun, that evil queen.

144
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,670
But she's the Demon Queen after all.

145
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,260
Who knows if she'll come after us?

146
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,190
If she wanted to hurt us,

147
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,110
we'd be dead already.

148
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,120
Du Yuelian,

149
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,750
give me the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

150
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,810
I can't

151
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,550
give it to you.

152
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:05,910
You only allow

153
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,800
me to save your people,

154
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,810
but don't allow

155
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,830
me to save my own people.

156
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,310
Don't you find this ridiculous?

157
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,910
Chirp,

158
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,950
our positions are different,

159
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,130
and so are our responsibilities.

160
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,710
Where are you taking him?

161
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,710
I'll hill him.

162
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,430
Don't you hate him anymore?

163
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,510
What's

164
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,140
the use of my hate?

165
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,750
As long as he can open the Scroll of Mountains and Seas,

166
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,590
I should save him.

167
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,070
Following the destiny and the times,

168
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,550
I hereby announce that

169
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,740
Crown Prince Beigong Shuo,

170
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,900
who is virtuous and capable

171
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,630
and is the first heir of the royal family,

172
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,270
wins the will of God.

173
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,730
Now, I solemnly abide by the initial decree,

174
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,190
follow traditional regulations

175
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,790
and conform to the will of the people

176
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,310
to respectfully inform Heaven and Earth,

177
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,830
the ancestral temples,

178
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,150
and the altars of land and grain,

179
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,340
that he will succeed to the imperial throne

180
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,160
and rule the country.

181
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,870
That's all.

182
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,560
Prostrate yourselves.

183
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,260
Greetings,

184
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,040
Your Majesty.

185
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,670
You may all rise.

186
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,270
Rise.

187
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,270
Thank you, Your Majesty.

188
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,140
There are good and evil humans,

189
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,790
and there are good and evil demons.

190
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,840
Although Meng Xizhou is the Demon Queen,

191
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,670
she has fought against her own kind,

192
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,940
eliminated Miao Yun and Situ Hanshan,

193
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,260
and saved the people of Dazhou.

194
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,950
She has done a great service to humanity.

195
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,110
Therefore,

196
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,700
in Dazhou,

197
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,100
Meng Xizhou is permitted

198
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,110
to enter the court as a foreign envoy,

199
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:46,950
dressed in official robes and holding a tablet

200
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,560
like a human official.

201
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,190
Yes.

202
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:56,990
Goddess,

203
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,860
I will fulfill

204
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,320
what I promised you.

205
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,500
In the twenty-third year of Mingde,

206
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,520
the Mingzong Emperor of Dazhou passed away.

207
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,190
Crown Prince Beigong Shuo ascended to the throne,

208
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,420
historically known as

209
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,310
Emperor Ruizong.

210
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,050
[Nan's Umbrella Shop]

211
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,390
The Scroll of Mountains and Seas has not yet been opened.

212
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,110
You can't die.

213
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,470
It's strange.

214
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,550
Why no matter how much power I impart,

215
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,150
none can enter his body?

216
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,090
His breath

217
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,630
is getting weaker and weaker.

218
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,530
I must keep you alive.

219
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:55,990
Chirp,

220
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,550
come to me.

221
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,070
I have a way.

222
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,710
Ren Guang?

223
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,190
No.

224
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,790
I should call you Xi.

225
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,840
Can I save him?

226
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:17,510
Of course.

227
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,150
This is still

228
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,550
your dream.

229
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:21,750
What?

230
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,470
I am not welcomed?

231
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,150
Welcome.

232
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,160
It seems

233
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,550
you've forgiven Nan Fengyi.

234
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,430
It's only because the Scroll of Mountains and Seas hasn't been opened yet.

235
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,590
He can't die now.

236
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,110
Well, well,

237
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:37,940
you have some intelligence.

238
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,310
I can't save him.

239
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:42,910
Didn't you just say

240
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,690
you have a way?

241
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:44,840
What is it?

242
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,310
How much are you willing

243
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,950
to pay for him?

244
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,260
What do you mean?

245
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,270
He was born with a defective heart,

246
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,740
and grew up with the help of the Demon Pill.

247
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,320
You've removed his Demon Pill

248
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,950
and severed all his meridians.

249
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,370
He suffered severe injuries.

250
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,150
It's almost impossible

251
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,240
to make him alive.

252
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,070
But he helped me

253
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,390
kill Miao Yun just now.

254
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,350
In the battle against Miao Yun,

255
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,140
he used his last willpower to sustain it.

256
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,630
Now, his wish has been fulfilled,

257
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,450
he no longer has the will to live.

258
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,950
You mean

259
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,870
he wants to die?

260
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,000
Think about it.

261
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,390
Doesn't he know you hate him?

262
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,230
He was blamed by the one he loves,

263
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,800
and felt guilty towards countless people.

264
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,140
Do you think

265
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,010
he still wants to live?

266
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,350
Then, what can I do

267
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,830
to awaken his will to live?

268
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,990
A person has three souls and seven spirits.

269
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,510
If you want him to survive,

270
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,480
someone must

271
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,510
give him a strand of life-seeking soul.

272
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,720
The one who gave a soul to him,

273
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,430
from then on,

274
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,470
would no longer fear death, right?

275
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,670
The one who gives up their life-seeking soul

276
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,990
will have no desire.

277
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:21,990
His or her heart will be like a wasteland.

278
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,680
The only thing left is obsession.

279
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,790
Have no desire.

280
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,970
His or her heart will be like a wasteland.

281
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,190
The only thing left is obsession.

282
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,200
I'll do it.

283
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,110
Are you sure?

284
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,530
The Scroll of Mountains and Seas hasn't been opened yet.

285
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,550
He can't die now.

286
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,710
I've made up my mind.

287
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,070
Are you really

288
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,110
doing this just for the Scroll of Mountains and Seas?

289
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,510
Yes.

290
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,590
Alright.

291
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,840
Soul-locking Formation.

292
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:04,630
Start.

293
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:21,730
Meng Xizhou.

294
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,950
Meng Xizhou, you need to say

295
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,410
that you willingly gave your life-seeking soul to Nan Fengyi.

296
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,670
Otherwise, this soul

297
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,780
won't leave your body.

298
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,150
I am...

299
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,710
I willingly give up my life-seeking soul.

300
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,560
Next,

301
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,230
I'll wait for the right moment

302
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,720
to completely control you.

303
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,310
Meng Xizhou.

304
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:35,910
You are

305
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,630
much better.

306
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,230
This medicine is bitter.

307
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,030
I brought you some rock sugar.

308
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,830
It's good to drink it while it's warm.

309
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:01,870
You swallow

310
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,720
bitter medicine directly?

311
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,990
I work desperately for money.

312
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,550
How could I be afraid of bitter medicine?

313
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,050
I'm only afraid of wasting my time to make money

314
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,740
if I'm sick for another day.

315
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:21,750
Master,

316
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,670
you lied to me.

317
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,750
You lied to me.

318
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,470
Didn't you say

319
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,880
you're not afraid of bitter medicine?

320
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,300
I...

321
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,950
Maybe it's because the days are too sweet now.

322
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,730
I'm gradually starting

323
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,160
to fear the bitterness.

324
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,590
You've changed.

325
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,230
Master, you've changed, too.

326
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,190
So sweet.

327
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,100
Yi,

328
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,910
is that you?

329
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,990
Yi?

330
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,190
Master Bai,

331
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,710
why are you here?

332
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,270
Demon Queen,

333
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:02,970
you are a great calamity to this world.

334
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,580
Although His Majesty and Lord Du protect you,

335
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,210
you'll be a future disaster

336
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,090
if you're still alive.

337
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,990
So you came here today

338
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:29,490
to betray me after use?

339
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,020
The Demon Queen is right there.

340
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,020
She is the Demon Queen.

341
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:38,750
Humans and demons have different paths.

342
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,390
Although you helped us defeat the evil queen,

343
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:41,630
you have

344
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:42,690
the Demon Queen's blood.

345
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,710
We can't let you live.

346
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,690
The deep grudge of Dazhou's innocent people

347
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,710
must attribute her.

348
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,780
That's right.

349
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:52,990
Meng Xizhou,

350
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,570
after several major battles,

351
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,730
your spiritual power is exhausted.

352
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,490
Why don't you surrender obediently?

353
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:06,910
What?

354
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,540
We haven't even started fighting.

355
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,750
You're already scared, huh?

356
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:13,530
Stubborn.

357
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:14,500
Guys,

358
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:15,830
now that Lord Du is away,

359
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:16,790
let's arrest her directly.

360
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,390
Kill her! Kill her!

361
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,270
Kill her! Kill her!

362
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,950
Kill her! Kill her!

363
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:26,790
Kill her!

364
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,770
Kill her!

365
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:28,950
Kill her now!

366
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,220
Kill her quickly!

367
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:31,670
Kill her!

368
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:33,630
Kill her!

369
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,790
The Demon Queen is going to kill people!

370
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,510
She's finally showing her true colors!

371
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,940
The Demon Queen is indeed evil.

372
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,510
I heard she was even raised by humans.

373
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,630
She is ambitious and ruthless.

374
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,830
Kill her!

375
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:44,690
Kill her!

376
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,980
Don't force me.

377
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,430
Stop it!

378
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,270
Chirp.

379
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,470
Goddess.

380
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,470
Your Majesty.

381
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:02,710
Come here.

382
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,420
Let me see

383
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,400
if you're hurt.

384
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,510
Are you injured?

385
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,750
She just saved all of you.

386
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:14,950
Is this how you treat her?

387
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,400
Can't you understand?

388
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:17,690
She can defeat you,

389
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,190
but she doesn't want to harm you.

390
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,090
Your Majesty, please reconsider.

391
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,270
Meng Xizhou

392
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,710
is a demon after all.

393
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:27,250
Didn't you hear

394
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,310
my imperial decree?

395
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,550
Meng Xizhou

396
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,390
is a benefactor of Dazhou.

397
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,270
From this day on,

398
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,670
whoever dares to bully her

399
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:35,950
is opposing me.

400
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:36,960
Let's see who dares to do so.

401
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:40,870
Goddess,

402
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,350
let's go.

403
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,200
Come back to the palace with me.

404
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:44,800
I can't leave yet.

405
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,800
I need to return to Nan's Umbrella Shop.

406
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,230
Nan Fengyi hasn't woken up yet.

407
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,660
Leave with him.

408
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:17,900
In this world,

409
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,870
His Majesty is the only one

410
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,000
who can protect you.

411
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:30,910
♫The wind hesitates, not daring to smooth the furrowed brow♫

412
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:38,240
♫The rain hesitates, reluctant to burden the tear-streaked eyes beneath the umbrella♫

413
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,120
Nan Fengyi,

414
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:45,170
♫The closer you are to me, the clearer the pain becomes♫

415
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,350
live for me.

416
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,960
♫The most painful separation means you can't even miss her♫

417
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:57,450
♫In silence, the world's grudges weave a web of entanglement♫

418
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,800
♫Under the clouds, the smoke from cooking rises and spreads freely♫

419
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,920
Is it just because I can help you open the Scroll of Mountains and Seas?

420
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:05,990
♫It's the love doomed by fate♫

421
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,060
Yes.

422
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:10,880
♫Under the umbrella, your profile is gently framed by the soft strands of your hair♫

423
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:10,800
Just because

424
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,200
♫Should my heart belong to someone for ten thousand years♫

425
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,580
you can help me open the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

426
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:19,950
♫Through endless lifetimes, softly and quietly, it flows on♫

427
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,840
Whenever you give me an order,

428
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:24,490
♫I won't lose you♫

429
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,440
I'll open it.

430
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,380
♫I'll sacrifice myself to help you♫

431
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:27,670
Your Majesty,

432
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:33,670
♫With a single lamp and a thousand books, alone I'm restless through the night♫

433
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,290
let's go.

434
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:40,290
♫Give me a fleeting moment of rain, to be held captive by your side♫

435
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:48,990
Why are you crying?

436
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,110
No, I'm not.

437
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:52,630
The wind got in my eyes.

438
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,020
Goddess,

439
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,030
look who I've brought here.

440
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,040
Chirp.

441
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,890
Dan Qian.

442
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,280
Qian,

443
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,510
let me take a look at you.

444
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,520
While I was away,

445
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,230
did you take good care of yourself?

446
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,410
Were you hurt?

447
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,720
Did anyone bully you?

448
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,880
I'm fine.

449
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,360
On the day my father turned into a demon,

450
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,550
I hid.

451
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,500
I'm glad you're okay.

452
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:02,730
That's good.

453
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,310
So,

454
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,370
how were you rescued?

455
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:12,960
I...

456
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,140
I was saved by His Majesty.

457
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:17,240
Yes, yes, yes.

458
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,390
It was at the…

459
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:18,940
The...

460
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,670
It was at...

461
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:21,170
Her house.

462
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:21,720
Her house.

463
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,680
-Her house.
-On the street.

464
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,320
Yes, yes, yes.

465
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,590
I mean, it was

466
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:28,790
on the street near her house.

467
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,180
We rescued her together with His Majesty.

468
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,170
That's right.

469
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,650
I see.

470
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,220
Thanks, Your Majesty.

471
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:41,920
Goddess,

472
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,620
your status is special.

473
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:45,300
It's better for You and Dan Qian

474
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,350
to stay in the palace.

475
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:47,350
It's safer.

476
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:49,910
Don't worry.

477
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,300
I will gradually eliminate

478
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,310
people's prejudice against you.

479
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,570
I'll help clear the names

480
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,630
of you and the innocent demons.

481
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:03,200
Okay.

482
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,470
Thank you, Your Majesty.

483
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,160
These disasters and calamities keep coming,

484
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,050
Yes.

485
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,170
What should we do?

486
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,430
Ministers,

487
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:46,780
the south has been suffering from a prolonged drought,

488
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,910
while the north is ravaged by devastating floods.

489
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,500
Millions of our people are affected.

490
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,280
These disasters

491
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,920
hang over my heart like a sharp sword.

492
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,590
Meng Xizhou, the Demon Queen,

493
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:57,550
has expressed willingness to assist humans in alleviating these disasters.

494
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,590
Today,

495
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,630
I decree

496
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,760
that Meng Xizhou shall serve as

497
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,270
the disaster relief envoy

498
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,260
who travel to both drought-stricken and flood-ravaged areas

499
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,950
to save our people.

500
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:10,860
Yes.

501
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,930
How can we let the demon clan interfere with human affairs?

502
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,360
Goddess,

503
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,870
if you want my people to accept you and the demon clan,

504
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,060
you need to do something for the human clan.

505
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,870
I beseech the God

506
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,160
to bring thunder and rain,

507
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,860
make water nourish the land

508
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,550
and revive the fertile fields.

509
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,310
I beseech the God

510
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,100
to bring thunder and rain.

511
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,390
It's the Demon Queen.

512
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,270
It's the Demon Queen. It's the Demon Queen.

513
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:26,900
Don't panic.

514
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,000
The Demon Queen is here to pray for rain for us.

515
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,000
Oh no.

516
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:38,590
Defying the God to bring rain

517
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,850
will lead to backlash.

518
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,830
Focus on bringing rain.

519
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,230
I'll protect you.

520
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,580
It must be him.

521
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,190
It's raining.

522
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:13,760
It's raining.

523
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,980
It's really raining.

524
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,630
It's raining.

525
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,670
It's raining.

526
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:30,240
Thank you, Demon Queen. Thank you, Demon Queen.

527
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,760
Thank you, Demon Queen.

528
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,310
Nan Fengyi,

529
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:36,870
you can't force yourself to use your power

530
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,850
to secretly help her anymore.

531
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:39,310
If this continues,

532
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:40,590
you won't even live for three months.

533
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,880
I should have died long ago.

534
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,670
To be honest, Du Yuelian,

535
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,409
the only belief that keeps me alive now

536
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,699
is to help her open the Scroll of Mountains and Seas,

537
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,280
and accompany her for a bit longer.

538
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,230
But as a descendant of a demon-hunting family,

539
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,890
have you really thought it through

540
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,280
to you open the Scroll of Mountains and Seas for her?

541
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,010
Not just for her.

542
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,490
I was obsessive before

543
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,790
and fixated on the identities of humans and demons.

544
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,720
But if all beings in the world are striving for goodness,

545
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,390
seeking for a place to survive,

546
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,830
does it really matter

547
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,020
whether they're humans or demons?

548
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,030
The sight of humans and demons coexisting

549
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:24,950
is also nice,

550
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,360
right?

551
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:28,710
No.

552
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,910
I can't imagine it.

553
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,060
Why can't you imagine it?

554
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,000
If they were given freedom,

555
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,710
they would surely

556
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,720
return to the mountains and seas,

557
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,430
living a carefree life.

558
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,250
But there are also those evil demons, like Situ Hanshan

559
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,360
and Miao Yun.

560
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,220
They don't want our human clan to live well.

561
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,030
Situ Hanshan and Miao Yun

562
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,070
were originally a merfolk couple.

563
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,470
If it weren't for my father

564
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,350
insisting on killing their partners,

565
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,110
today's tragedy might not have happened.

566
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:03,510
In this world,

567
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,580
there has never been love or hate for no reason.

568
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,270
But love

569
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,310
and hate,

570
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,260
how can they be resolved?

571
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,590
Only when those who love and hate

572
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,580
get happiness,

573
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:28,530
will this world truly achieve peace.

574
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,190
So,

575
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:32,820
you've understood this for a long time.

576
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,000
This is the last

577
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,260
and the only thing I can do for her and myself.
