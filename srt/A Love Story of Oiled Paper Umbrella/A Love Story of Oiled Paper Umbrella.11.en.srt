1
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,120
It's all your fault.

2
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,120
You made me suffer so much.

3
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,039
If you force me out,

4
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,479
it will speed up

5
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,000
my backfire on you.

6
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,830
Du Fenglei, don't forget that

7
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,200
I have your daughter in my hands.

8
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,200
Dare you threaten me with the life of Yuelian?

9
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,039
If you force me again,

10
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,760
I will kill Du Yuelian

11
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
and myself!

12
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,000
Here is a chance.

13
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,280
Let's make a deal.

14
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,030
If your obsession remains,

15
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,080
you will die of it.

16
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,120
It's better to fulfill his wish.

17
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,270
There is a way

18
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,400
to enhance my power

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,120
and alleviate my pain.

20
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,840
It can also help Master

21
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,800
to get rid of the big trouble.

22
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,870
Meng Xizhou, with Demon-Recognizing Pupils,

23
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,079
is also a demon.

24
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,560
She is a Golden-winged Roc.

25
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,120
As a demon,

26
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,430
why does she choose to be a demon hunter?

27
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,120
What does she mean?

28
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,520
Before that,

29
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,430
she didn't know she is a demon.

30
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,680
Do you want her Demon Pill?

31
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,400
If it weren't for her Demon-Recognizing Pupils,

32
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,800
we wouldn't be in this mess.

33
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,240
But there are so many traps outside.

34
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,800
It's risky

35
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,430
if you take action by yourself.

36
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,520
Lord Fan's nine demon children

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,710
are hiding in the Lingshan Guard, right?

38
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,190
Do you want to hurt his child?

39
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,190
Lingshan Guard.

40
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,150
Lingshan Guard.

41
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,910
Mothers and kids will meet in their dream.

42
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:20,360
Paper is covered with blood and tears.

43
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,000
Where are their parents?

44
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,030
Kids,

45
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,800
please go home.

46
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,510
Their father are heartbroken.

47
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,590
Following the destiny and the times,

48
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,910
I command you.

49
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,430
Rivers have been rising recently,

50
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,800
and canal backflow occurred.

51
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,590
In the Lingshan Guard in the suburb of Changle City,

52
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,800
the flood is severe,

53
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,470
which is caused by demons.

54
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,280
I command the Celestial Master's Mansion

55
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,590
to cooperate with the Court of Judicature and Revision

56
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,910
to handle

57
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,030
the disaster relief issues.

58
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,590
That's all.

59
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,030
Yes, sir.

60
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,390
The flood is caused by demons.

61
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,720
I think Lord Du must have known something, right?

62
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,269
Well,

63
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,830
Yuelian has gone to Lingshan Guard

64
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,950
with several celestial masters.

65
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,040
It is said that a lot of strange incidents happened there.

66
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,160
But it

67
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,830
is just our guess.

68
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,360
All Puppet Spirits in Changle City have been eliminated.

69
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,430
Now,

70
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,480
even if there are demons in Changle City,

71
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,830
nothing serious will happen.

72
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,950
The safety of the citizens is the priority.

73
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,630
Let's go to Lingshan Guard together.

74
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,190
Okay.

75
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:41,950
Hey.

76
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,430
Well...

77
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,310
Where is Meng Xizhou,

78
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,310
the demon-hunter with Demon-Recognizing Pupils?

79
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,430
She's recuperating in the Prince's Palace.

80
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,430
I thought she has been resting in your mansion.

81
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,720
What a pity!

82
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,190
Junior.

83
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,070
Something

84
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,070
under the water

85
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,070
has been absorbing my power.

86
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,950
There must be

87
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,000
something wrong in the water.

88
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,310
We need to find a way

89
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,430
to buy time

90
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,630
to evacuate the people.

91
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,270
Okay.

92
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,270
How is it?

93
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,310
The waves

94
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,630
are extremely strange and powerful.

95
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,070
If we can’t stop them,

96
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,630
the entire Lingshan Guard will be flooded.

97
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,510
Even Changle City will be in danger.

98
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:30,950
Hang in there.

99
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,070
The Court of Judicature and Revision has organized the people to evacuate.

100
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:36,950
Fan Yong?

101
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:42,870
Nan Fengyi,

102
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,720
where are you going?

103
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,630
I have something important to do.

104
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,159
Your Highness.

105
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,750
Why are you dressed like this?

106
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,310
In the Lingshan Guard

107
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,870
of the suburb,

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
there are demons in the water.

109
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,560
Men of the Celestial Master's Mansion and Court of Judicature and Revision were trapped there.

110
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,240
Father asked me to help them.

111
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,430
I'm leaving now.

112
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,120
Are the people of the Court of Judicature and Revision

113
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,430
trapped?

114
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:07,920
Yes.

115
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:08,870
If we don't give them support,

116
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,360
I'm afraid things will be out of control.

117
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,310
Wait.

118
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,800
I'll go with you.

119
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:16,920
You...

120
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,310
Are you worried about him?

121
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,240
I have Demon-Recognizing Pupils.

122
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,750
Since there are demons,

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,070
I can definitely help.

124
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,120
That’s good.

125
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,750
Lord Du of the Celestial Master's Mansion

126
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,920
has been asking me

127
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,360
to take you there.

128
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,680
Take me there?

129
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,430
Go to the downstream.

130
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:01,600
Okay.

131
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,190
Yes.

132
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,070
Be careful. Watch out, Your Highness.

133
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:08,950
Goddess,

134
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,720
slow down.

135
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,600
Du Yuelian.

136
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,310
Are you alright?

137
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,120
Greetings, Your Highness.

138
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,430
How is the disaster?

139
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,120
The men of the Court of Judicature and Revision

140
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,560
have evacuated the citizens.

141
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,360
The waves have subsided.

142
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,430
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

143
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,950
Looks like I'm late.

144
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,310
It's not late. Your Highness.

145
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,720
You came at the right time.

146
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,430
Let me show you around.

147
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:28,830
In addition,

148
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,310
you can comfort the refugees nearby.

149
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,360
What do you think?

150
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,430
Hurry up.

151
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,560
Take me to have a look.

152
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,480
Here, Your Highness.

153
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,190
Watch your step.

154
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:52,920
Huo Xiao!

155
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,360
Where is Director Nan?

156
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,830
I don't know.

157
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,040
Maybe

158
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,600
he's hiding because he doesn't want to see you.

159
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,070
Didn't you say

160
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:02,950
you don't want to meet him again?

161
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:03,950
Yes.

162
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,190
Now you come here

163
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,480
to perform your care.

164
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,310
It's too late.

165
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,360
Let's go.

166
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,440
Director Nan

167
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,720
said he had something to do

168
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:19,830
and went that way.

169
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,600
Are you looking for him?

170
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,360
Nope.

171
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,080
Although waves

172
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,360
subsided,

173
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,720
there should be demons

174
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,200
in the water of Lingshan Guard.

175
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,870
You'd better go back to be with Crown Prince.

176
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,120
Don't hang around.

177
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:45,960
Okay.

178
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,840
There are demons?

179
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,510
Someone fell into the water!

180
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,910
Someone fell into the water!

181
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,390
Sir,

182
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,630
what happened?

183
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:01,870
Just now,

184
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,080
I saw a man

185
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,630
-jumped into the whirlpool
-A man？

186
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,270
to save my kid.

187
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,600
Jumped into the whirlpool?

188
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,150
He

189
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,960
left this.

190
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,870
Feibai Brush?

191
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,600
It's him.

192
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,870
It's him.

193
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,840
Miss.

194
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,120
Lingshan Guard's water has something that absorbs the power of demon-hunting.

195
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,670
The stronger the hunter is, the more power it will absorb.

196
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:29,830
Nan Fengyi,

197
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,600
this is your grave.

198
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,150
There is indeed a city under the water.

199
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,390
Looks like I can save Master.

200
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,390
Lingshan Guard.

201
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,630
Lingshan Guard.

202
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:45,000
Mothers and kids will meet in their dreams.

203
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:51,000
Paper is covered with blood and tears.

204
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,360
Chirp.

205
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,600
Nan Fengyi.

206
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,390
Stay away from me!

207
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:57,870
It's dangerous here.

208
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,080
Little demons.

209
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
Let him go!

210
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,320
Why?

211
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,000
Because he's a good man.

212
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,390
Humans are bad.

213
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,390
You are also a demon.

214
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,480
Why are you defending them?

215
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,840
That's right.

216
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,750
That's right.

217
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,750
Bad guy!

218
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,440
Bad guy!

219
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,870
Bad guy!

220
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,600
I'm a demon.

221
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,120
But I'm a friend of the human clan.

222
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,080
Then you are our enemy.

223
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,720
I'm not.

224
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,480
I'm not.

225
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:32,960
I'm not.

226
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,320
Our mom went out for food,

227
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
but demon hunters killed her.

228
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,720
All of our demons in Lingshan Guard

229
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,360
have been suppressed in the Scroll of Mountains and Seas

230
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,360
and suffered a lot.

231
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,480
Why should we let him go?

232
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,120
If we don't kill him,

233
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,880
our secret home

234
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,360
will be discovered.

235
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,240
Human beings won't pity us.

236
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,630
They will only destroy our home.

237
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,750
We'll die!

238
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,750
Father will die, too.

239
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,480
You'll also be arrested.

240
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,320
Listen to me.

241
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,360
There are

242
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,120
good human beings.

243
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,390
And

244
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,630
there are good demons too.

245
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,870
I will talk to humans.

246
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,840
You are so young and cute.

247
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,240
They won't hurt you.

248
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,320
No.

249
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,550
Father said

250
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
people who come to the Lingshan Guard

251
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,750
will destroy our home.

252
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,000
They are all bad men.

253
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,000
So,

254
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,870
no one is allowed to live.

255
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,720
Yes.

256
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,480
You little demons

257
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,360
transformed into children

258
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,960
and killed so many people in Lingshan Guard,

259
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,750
but you pretend to be innocent.

260
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,870
You invaded our home

261
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,390
and made us homeless.

262
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:43,600
You made us homeless.

263
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,120
Give back our home!

264
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,000
We're homeless.

265
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,670
We're homeless.

266
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,720
Help me! Help me!

267
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,080
Master.

268
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,200
I think

269
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,750
their words

270
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,120
make sense.

271
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,720
Nonsense.

272
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,240
Demons are demons.

273
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,240
You can never pity them.

274
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,600
As you can see,

275
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,080
I'm also a demon.

276
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,390
They killed the humans,

277
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,750
but human beings also killed their mothers.

278
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,200
Do we have to

279
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,960
keep repeating like this?

280
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,000
Master.

281
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,000
No matter you're a human or a demon,

282
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,870
you're my disciple, Chirp.

283
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,960
Meng Xizhou,

284
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,750
you traitor of demon clan.

285
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:32,840
Today,

286
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,360
I will kill you to uphold justice

287
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:34,840
with my kids.

288
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,000
Can we have a talk.

289
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,480
Stop hurting each other,

290
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,600
okay?

291
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,960
No.

292
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,360
Don't!

293
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,600
Follow me to kill them.

294
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,200
It's too late.

295
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,600
Why did you trap me?

296
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,550
Are you crazy?

297
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,320
I need to take a Demon Pill as soon as possible.

298
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,240
Otherwise,

299
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,440
I will lose

300
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,510
my power.

301
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,790
Since you are incapable of

302
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,840
catching Meng Xizhou,

303
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,750
then,

304
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,910
don't blame me for killing you.

305
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,320
Situ Hanshan,

306
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,360
you schemed all this.

307
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,670
You let my nine demon children fight against Meng Xizhou.

308
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,910
Now you want to take my Demon Pill.

309
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,670
I'm doing this to survive.

310
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,120
Aren't you?

311
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,750
Every time we were in danger,

312
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,080
you always ran away first.

313
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,560
Aren't you afraid that Master will kill you?

314
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,270
Do you think

315
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,790
he would kill me?

316
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,910
With your Demon Pills,

317
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,240
my power

318
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,910
finally came back.

319
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,670
What should we do?

320
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,480
Nan Fengyi.

321
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,720
Nan.

322
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,120
Nan.

323
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,240
Nan.

324
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,120
Nan Fengyi.

325
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,120
Nan.

326
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,600
Nan.

327
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,200
Nan Fengyi.

328
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,390
Over there.

329
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,360
Nan Fengyi. Nan.

330
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,200
Nan Fengyi.

331
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:23,750
Nan.

332
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,910
Nan Fengyi is seriously injured.

333
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,750
Take him back first.

334
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,840
I'll search around

335
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,840
whether there are demons or not.

336
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,150
Only the blood of the Golden-winged Roc

337
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,320
can activate the Sky-covering Formation.

338
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,150
What is recorded in the book

339
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,550
is right.

340
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,320
Come out.

341
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,069
You can't escape.

342
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,270
Meng Xizhou.

343
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,510
I know it's you.

344
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,270
My mother

345
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,880
was killed by a demon.

346
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:20,960
I swore

347
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:22,720
I would never

348
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,510
let any demon go.

349
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:28,550
I'm already injured.

350
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,640
If you want to kill me,

351
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,790
do it now.

352
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:57,880
Meng Xizhou,

353
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,830
from today onwards,

354
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,550
I will

355
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,720
remove your name

356
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:08,480
from the list of Celestial Master's Mansion.

357
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,110
I will take your Demon Pill today.

358
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:19,720
Your life

359
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,310
depends on the fate.

360
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,960
If you dare to hurt human beings,

361
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,590
I won't be merciful like today.

362
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,510
Be wise.

363
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:35,960
What happened?

364
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,070
Where is her Demon Pill?

365
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,400
Du Yuelian, be careful.

366
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,400
Meng Xizhou,

367
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,120
what are you doing?

368
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,270
Since

369
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,350
my name

370
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,880
has been removed from the list,

371
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,790
I accept it.

372
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,030
But I don't want you

373
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,440
to remove me

374
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,960
from your friend list.

375
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,640
Meng Xizhou,

376
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,960
do you think

377
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,000
I'll sympathize with you in this way?

378
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,960
You need to take a rest.

379
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,390
Have you found the whereabouts of Meng Xizhou?

380
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,200
No.

381
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,160
Meng Xizhou is fine.

382
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,680
Did...

383
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,920
Did you see her?

384
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,960
You're injured.

385
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,640
Sit down.

386
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,830
I've helped her regain her human form.

387
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,510
She went back to the Prince's Palace with His Highness.

388
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,750
Did you help her?

389
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,680
I thought you wouldn't let any demon go.

390
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,350
Meng Xizhou

391
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,390
was almost killed by a poisonous needle

392
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,720
in order to save me.

393
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,240
How could I bear to kill her?

394
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,480
Meng Xizhou

395
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,550
is troublesome.

396
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,200
She saved me

397
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,480
and saved you as well.

398
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,510
Nan Fengyi,

399
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,510
I hope

400
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,640
you won't

401
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,000
be sympathize with

402
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,750
demons for this.

403
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,480
I won't.

404
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,310
We know that

405
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,960
Chirp is an exception.

406
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,480
By the way,

407
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,750
did you see Fan Yong, Vice Minister of War,

408
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,200
in the water

409
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,160
and his nine demon children?

410
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,550
How do you know?

411
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,310
They died.

412
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,480
What's more,

413
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,390
their Demon Pills were taken by someone.

414
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,550
Their Demon Pills were taken?

415
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,750
But when Chirp and I escaped,

416
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,920
Fan Yong was still alive.

417
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,240
Then,

418
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:16,830
who killed Fan Yong?

419
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,480
And who

420
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,270
took their Demon Pills?

421
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,750
The Demon Pills are useful for demons.

422
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,270
I suspect...

423
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,160
What?

424
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,070
There's a spy in the Celestial Master's Mansion.

425
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,750
Impossible.

426
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,550
All members of Celestial Master's Mansion

427
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,240
were picked by Du Fenglei and me.

428
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,160
Nobody would collude with demons.

429
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,790
Your Highness.

430
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:22,720
Goddess,

431
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,750
you're awake.

432
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,680
I've been with you for three days and nights.

433
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,920
I draw it to kill time.

434
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,030
You...

435
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,400
Where are you going?

436
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,790
I...

437
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,920
I'm going to leave here.

438
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,510
Why?

439
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,480
You haven't recovered yet.

440
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,680
It's dangerous outside.

441
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,550
I was too naive

442
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,480
before.

443
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,480
If

444
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,000
someone finds me staying in the Prince's Palace,

445
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,640
you will be implicated.

446
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,030
Are you not comfortable

447
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,000
or unaccustomed?

448
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,240
After the incident happened in the Lingshan Guard,

449
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,240
I realized something.

450
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,720
It's a fact that

451
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,480
I'm a demon.

452
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,680
Things won't change

453
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,550
just because I'm hiding in the Prince's Palace.

454
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,070
Although

455
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,640
I think I'm a good demon,

456
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:31,160
I can't eliminate others' prejudice.

457
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,640
Besides, if I stay here,

458
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,030
you will be implicated.

459
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,550
By then,

460
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,200
what will people think of you?

461
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:40,960
But...

462
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,920
No buts.

463
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,240
I've made up my mind.

464
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,720
Since I've been removed from the list of Celestial Master's Mansion.

465
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,510
I will hide my identity

466
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,400
and stay out of trouble.

467
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,310
No one will know I'm a demon.

468
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,960
By then,

469
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,000
you can come to play with me.

470
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,270
Look,

471
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,830
this is for you.

472
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,480
What is this?

473
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,200
Tomorrow is the Lantern Festival.

474
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:19,960
I planned to

475
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,680
set a festival lantern activity for you in the Prince's Palace.

476
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,240
Since you're leaving,

477
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,070
I want to give it to you.

478
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,200
I made this Panchi lantern myself.

479
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,480
It's pretty.

480
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,920
I've cut paper as the whirl

481
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,200
and exert it with candle.

482
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:37,960
and

483
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,960
the carriages and horses on the lantern

484
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,790
will keep moving.

485
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,240
When the candle burns out,

486
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,000
they will stop.

487
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,480
I'd like to give it to you.

488
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,720
Your Highness,

489
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,310
you are a nice guy.

490
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,790
The lantern

491
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,750
is beautiful.

492
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,790
But it

493
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,920
deserves a better owner.

494
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:30,920
Well,

495
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,640
wish you

496
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,000
safe and sound

497
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,160
in the Lantern Festival.

498
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,750
You too.

499
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,550
Wish you safe

500
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,480
and sound.

501
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,720
Nan's Umbrella Shop.

502
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,480
There are so many umbrellas.

503
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,030
So beautiful.

504
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,240
Is it your home?

505
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,310
Hello, Uncle Nan.

506
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,920
Long time no see.

507
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,440
I

508
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,070
have to move back to my agency.

509
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,440
Uncle Wu has been seriously ill recently.

510
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,350
Dan Qian is too young

511
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,310
to take care of him.

512
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,680
Well,

513
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,920
I won't learn demon-catching techniques anymore.

514
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,160
Please take care

515
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,240
of yourself.

516
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,440
I don't think it will work.

517
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,480
What about

518
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,160
changing to other words?

519
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:00,920
Change to

520
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,920
a lively one.

521
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,440
Uncle Nan,

522
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,240
long time no see.

523
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,480
I'll

524
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:09,960
go back.

525
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,160
Yes.

526
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,590
I'm not used to

527
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,510
live in the umbrella shop.

528
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,440
I think

529
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,830
it's useless

530
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,200
to learn about demon-catching techniques.

531
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,830
So I decided

532
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,360
to sell haunted houses.

533
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,960
I'll go upstairs and pack up my belongings.

534
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,960
Go on about your business.

535
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,830
Don't worry about me.

536
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,000
Master...

537
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:36,880
You're back.

538
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,510
I thought

539
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,350
you should be working in the Court of Judicature and Revision.

540
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,590
Do you think you can pack up your baggage

541
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,960
when I'm not at home

542
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,950
and leave

543
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,640
without saying goodbye?

544
00:28:59,400 --> 00:28:59,830
Yes.

545
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:01,830
Yes.

546
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,510
Father went to Cloud County

547
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,160
with Ms. Wang to recruit disciples of the martial arts school.

548
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,400
It takes some time to come back.

549
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:12,880
Okay.

550
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,310
I just sent them off.

551
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:15,680
I see.

552
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,880
Do you plan to stay in the Prince's Palace

553
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,440
or...

554
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,590
No.

555
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,310
I don't want to trouble anyone,

556
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,200
including you.

557
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,550
You're never a trouble.

558
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,720
The umbrella shop is your home.

559
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,830
I've always kept the room for you.

560
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:50,640
No.

561
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,110
I...

562
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,400
I'm a demon.

563
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,310
Take me back to the Celestial Master's Mansion.

564
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,640
You saw my true form.

565
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,960
I won't blame you.

566
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,200
How is that possible?

567
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,440
How could I hunt you?

568
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,310
Humans and demons have different paths.

569
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,480
Even if you don't hunt me today,

570
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,000
one day,

571
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,440
your partners

572
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,440
will hunt me.

573
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,350
Besides,

574
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,200
there are so many demon hunters in the Celestial Master's Mansion.

575
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,720
I can't escape.

576
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,440
No.

577
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,110
I won't allow anyone to hurt you.

578
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,960
Don't be silly.

579
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,200
I've dreamed

580
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,590
to be

581
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,720
the best demon hunter in the world.

582
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,200
But now

583
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:26,720
demons take me

584
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:28,920
as a traitor

585
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,200
while human beings

586
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,640
will treat me as an enemy.

587
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,240
I'm willing to be with you

588
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,750
and fight against them.

589
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,550
You are the innocent Chief of the Court of Judicature and Revision.

590
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,440
Why do you have to be stained

591
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,920
for a demon?

592
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,920
Who told you

593
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,590
I’m the innocent Chief?

594
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,920
For everyone,

595
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,000
my existence

596
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,110
is a sin to them.

597
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,110
Don’t you always want to know

598
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,550
why I practiced the Big Dipper Primordial Spell?

599
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,350
Let me tell you the answer now.

600
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,720
I'm not Nan Fengyi.

601
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,480
Who are you then?

602
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,000
My real name

603
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,200
is Baize Yi.

604
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,310
I am

605
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,720
the only descendant of the Baize family,

606
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,960
a family of demon-hunting which was eradicated by the imperials.

607
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,790
My father

608
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,830
is actually my uncle.

609
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,550
I’ve endured humiliation

610
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,240
and practiced the Big Dipper Primordial Spell

611
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,720
to get

612
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,920
the "Scroll of Mountains and Seas" that my father accidentally lost

613
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,350
to protect all demons.

614
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,830
Do you still think I’m innocent?

615
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,200
Chirp,

616
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,720
stay here.

617
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:40,960
Don't leave.

618
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,110
Now,

619
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,590
we are facing the truest selves.

620
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,510
Let's face it together.

621
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,000
Master.

622
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,400
Master.

623
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,960
These days,

624
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,360
I'm scared.

625
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,280
I miss you so much.

626
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,110
Master, why are you escaping?

627
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,590
Come back!

628
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,400
Master!

629
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,360
What's up?

630
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,590
Where are you going?

631
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,510
Master.

632
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,630
Master.

633
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,000
What’s up?

634
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,760
Before I master the Big Dipper Primordial Spell,

635
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,400
we can’t…

636
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,070
Got it.

637
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,400
I will

638
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,120
protect you.

639
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:51,630
Tonight,

640
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,670
let's sleep separately.

641
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,670
Go back first.

642
00:34:59,190 --> 00:34:59,830
Bye.
