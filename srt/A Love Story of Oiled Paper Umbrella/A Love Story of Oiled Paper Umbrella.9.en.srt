[A Love Story of Oiled Paper Umbrella]

2
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,150
[Episode 9]

3
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,870
Go help me check Nan Fengyi

4
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,550
and his father,

5
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,670
Nan Sixu.

6
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,030
However...

7
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,370
I'm afraid I won't be able to handle it alone.

8
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,070
You want Yuelian to go with you, right?

9
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,910
When it comes to crucial moments,

10
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:58,630
I

11
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,350
still need to rely on Junior Yuelian.

12
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,610
I've long seen through...

13
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,910
your feelings for her.

14
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,460
However,

15
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,630
she's my daughter,

16
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,150
and I know her very well.

17
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:18,990
Men are nothing

18
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,590
but obstacles in her career.

19
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,630
Just give up.

20
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:23,960
Master,

21
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,070
please help me.

22
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,090
I really like her.

23
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,870
I also want to work hard

24
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,150
to be good enough for her

25
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,590
and give her a better life.

26
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,150
My daughter

27
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,670
won't yield to either gentle persuasion or forceful demands.

28
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,540
She would listen to me, her father,

29
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,150
let alone yours.

30
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,910
Give up.

31
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,630
Gentle persuasion or forceful demands...

32
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,440
I'm sorry, Junior.

33
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,000
Senior!

34
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,670
What are you doing here?

35
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,030
Master,

36
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,350
Master has asked me to tell you

37
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,590
that we don't have to go to the Crown Prince's

38
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,550
Coming-of-Age Ceremony tomorrow.

39
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,470
Where are we going then?

40
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,870
He's sent...

41
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,110
sent us

42
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,370
t-to check Nan Fengyi and his father's household register.

43
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,670
Check if his father or mother was a demon

44
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,700
or had something to do with demons.

45
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,790
Right.

46
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,630
Got it.

47
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,510
If that's all,

48
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,510
you can go now.

49
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:22,670
Okay.

50
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,550
Then, I'm off, then.

51
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:25,670
In the future,

52
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,560
don't come into my room without permission.

53
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,550
Or I might kill you as a thief.

54
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:33,990
I won't do it again.

55
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,620
I'll change. I promise.

56
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,730
I won't come in again.

57
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:37,630
Leave.

58
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,770
Since you're here,

59
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,170
don't hide anymore. Come out and let's talk.

60
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,650
Your power

61
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,950
far exceeds that of a fourth-level demon hunter.

62
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,510
You almost reach the fifth level, right?

63
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,950
Your relationship with Meng Xizhou

64
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,529
should just be to cover up your true identity.

65
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,589
You didn't just come here

66
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,380
to ask this;

67
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,180
you came to watch me transform into a demon, right?

68
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,000
You said

69
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,470
that the Crown Prince has the dragon aura.

70
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,030
Demons can't hurt him.

71
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,390
If you were really a demon,

72
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,480
you wouldn't be so stupid

73
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,560
as to kill the Crown Prince,

74
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,350
who can't be harmed by demons, in front of everyone.

75
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,960
So you are definitely not a demon.

76
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,210
Looks like there are some smart people in the Celestial Master's Mansion.

77
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,390
But why were you in the Eastern Palace?

78
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:43,720
That day, Meng Xizhou was going to send the tribute umbrellas to the palace,

79
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,720
and I asked her to help me identify the demons.

80
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,290
After I disguised myself and entered the palace as a Puppet Spirit,

81
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,290
I was caught in an illusionary technique.

82
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,630
As for the rest, you saw it.

83
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,280
So,

84
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,680
you fell under an illusionary technique?

85
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,310
Yes.

86
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,970
What exactly

87
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,260
is their real purpose?

88
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,580
The mirage

89
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,770
we saw at the Imperial Armory

90
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,630
is the key to cracking the mystery.

91
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,700
When did this happen?

92
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,060
How come I don't remember it?

93
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,380
They saw themselves

94
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,690
in the mirage,

95
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,570
but they didn't recognize the embroidered robes they wore.

96
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,350
Look.

97
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,690
The patterns on the embroidered robes vary.

98
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,030
Take these patterns

99
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,150
and check with all the departments

100
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,170
to see if anyone has seen or worn them.

101
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,670
You managed to memorize all of these?

102
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,030
Mountain?

103
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:31,900
Water.

104
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,150
The combination

105
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,510
looks like a painting.

106
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,590
I'm not sure if it's a painting.

107
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,480
But it must have some meaning.

108
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:42,810
I'll look into it.

109
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,650
What is this?

110
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,890
Looking at the injuries on you,

111
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,030
you must have suffered a lot.

112
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,240
This is the Meridian Protection Pill that I take every day.

113
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,530
It can protect your heart meridian.

114
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,590
Thank you.

115
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,320
[Court of Judicature and Revision]

116
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,000
How is it?

117
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,590
Have you identified who those servants were?

118
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,830
None of the Puppet Spirits that appeared today

119
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,170
are actual eunuchs from the palace.

120
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,470
How could this be?

121
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,350
I clearly

122
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,990
encountered them in the Imperial Palace.

123
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,540
Besides, they were so naturally

124
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,190
entering the Imperial Kitchen.

125
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,070
They planned it in advance

126
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,750
for you to see it.

127
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:39,750
Du Yuelian,

128
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,950
how is my disciple?

129
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,360
Master Du,

130
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,830
Nan is really not a demon.

131
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,640
If anyone's a demon, it's more likely to be me than him.

132
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,030
Do something.

133
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,590
It's His Majesty

134
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,270
who has ordered us to lock him up within the Demon Locking Pagoda.

135
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,740
What can I do?

136
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,750
Then, did you...

137
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,909
torture him severely?

138
00:06:58,659 --> 00:06:59,470
These things don't matter.

139
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,950
If you want Nan Fengyi to be fine,

140
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,000
help me

141
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:05,990
solve the case as soon as possible.

142
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,030
You just said

143
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,720
it was all planned in advance, right?

144
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,360
Yes.

145
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,830
The Puppet Spirits deliberately appeared

146
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,020
in Meng Xizhou's path,

147
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,410
making her identify them as demons.

148
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:16,400
Only in this way

149
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,280
could Nan Fengyi be completely convinced and follow her.

150
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,870
Then he fell into an illusionary technique.

151
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,780
And that's the scene

152
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,200
His Majesty saw.

153
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:23,900
Then, who knew

154
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:24,950
he was going to the palace?

155
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,750
Everyone in the palace knew

156
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,030
about Meng Xizhou sending the umbrellas.

157
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,730
I've also checked on the maid serving Her Majesty,

158
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,640
who was leading the way.

159
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,100
I haven't found anything suspicious yet.

160
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,070
In short,

161
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,470
I inadvertently brought this trouble upon him.

162
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,810
Nan Fengyi said

163
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,620
that the mirage we saw

164
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,409
outside the Imperial Armory

165
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,380
is most likely the key to cracking the mystery.

166
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,830
The eunuch and the maid serving the Crown Prince

167
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,730
saw themselves in the mirage.

168
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,510
Yes.

169
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:50,780
They also said...

170
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,270
they didn't remember ever wearing

171
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,470
the clothes in the mirage.

172
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,110
How could they not remember things

173
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,110
that happened to them?

174
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,060
Is there a possibility

175
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,150
that the things shown in the mirage will happen in the future?

176
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:08,990
Come with me and check these.

177
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,030
These look

178
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,670
very much like puzzle pieces.

179
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,820
Like a corner of the geomantic map.

180
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,170
And a painting.

181
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,680
But it's disjointed

182
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,830
and missing a lot.

183
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,790
If we can go to the Imperial Weaving Department,

184
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,270
we might find something new.

185
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,800
But in the Imperial Weaving Department,

186
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,990
there are many of His Majesty's garments.

187
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,470
Besides Her Majesty,

188
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,049
who else has the authority

189
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,070
to go there and investigate?

190
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,309
Of course, there is someone.

191
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,030
The Crown Prince.

192
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,070
The Crown Prince?

193
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,590
I'm well acquainted with him.

194
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,659
And I've even saved his life.

195
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,470
He should be willing to help me.

196
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,730
I'm going to the palace now.

197
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:46,430
Wait.

198
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,870
With your status,

199
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,070
how are you gonna get in?

200
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,230
Then...

201
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,150
what should we do?

202
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,270
This is mine.

203
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,230
I'm just lending it to you.

204
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,280
You...

205
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,610
If you get caught,

206
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:08,670
don't blame it on me.

207
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,390
You can just say...

208
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,230
I'll say

209
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,480
I stole it.

210
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,270
Stole what?

211
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:16,950
Have you forgotten

212
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,590
that you are also a member of the Celestial Master's Mansion?

213
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:27,950
Don't just stand here.

214
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,810
Go.

215
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,030
Okay.

216
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,920
[Eastern Palace]

217
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,390
Your Highness,

218
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,250
the food is cold now.

219
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,630
Why haven't you eaten yet?

220
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,950
So much has happened today.

221
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,150
I can't eat.

222
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,030
His Majesty

223
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,750
has sent more guards here.

224
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,430
Actually,

225
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,910
you don't need to worry so much.

226
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,390
I'm not worried about my own safety.

227
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,310
I just have a strange feeling

228
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,180
that something is off.

229
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,350
Nan Fengyi kept calling me "Situ Hanshan"

230
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,380
and tried to kill me.

231
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,510
It was as if he was possessed.

232
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,300
Well, if he was really going to kill me,

233
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,030
why did he call me "Situ Hanshan"?

234
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,150
That's so strange.

235
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,590
Your Highness, you're right.

236
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,390
Goddess Chirp?

237
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,440
Why are you here?

238
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,130
Your Highness,

239
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,490
tonight the Celestial Master's Mansion

240
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,130
has been instructed to protect you.

241
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:47,890
Okay.

242
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,110
Come on, have a seat.

243
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,320
You haven't eaten, have you?

244
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,280
Would you like to...

245
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,640
I'll take my leave now.

246
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,450
Come on, Goddess.

247
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,310
This pastry

248
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,680
is really good.

249
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,430
Thank you.

250
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,630
It's good.

251
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,880
You like drawing?

252
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,030
Just sketching casually.

253
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:35,980
Let's get down to business.

254
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,270
Today,

255
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,670
I actually came here to ask you for a favor.

256
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,870
Ask me for a favor?

257
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:42,680
Go ahead.

258
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:43,810
I will help you.

259
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,710
Can you

260
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,130
take me to the Imperial Weaving Department?

261
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,810
The Imperial Weaving Department?

262
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,120
Why do you want to go there?

263
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,360
I've found a new clue regarding Nan Fengyi's

264
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,850
attempt to assassinate you.

265
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:01,830
Really?

266
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,420
I've been worried about this too.

267
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,270
So, will you go?

268
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,430
Yes.

269
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:11,750
I'll take you there.

270
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,960
[Weaving Bureau]

271
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,160
The Crown Prince has arrived!

272
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,230
I'm Li Hong'an, the Vice Minister of Rites.

273
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:31,710
Greetings, Your Highness.

274
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,710
Rise.

275
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:36,990
Li Hong'an,

276
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,430
what are you doing here?

277
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,440
Your Highness,

278
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,250
tomorrow is your Grand Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

279
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,400
I'm taking inventory of

280
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,910
the embroidered robes for the palace servants.

281
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,790
I'll be sending them to the various palaces shortly.

282
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,320
Your Highness, what brings you here in person?

283
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,040
Me?

284
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,470
I...

285
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,790
I've been eating too much lately.

286
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,670
I've noticed that my waist

287
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:00,990
seems to have gotten a bit bigger.

288
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,670
Come and measure it for me,

289
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,060
and see if you can adjust my robe.

290
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:06,370
Well...

291
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,110
Your Highness,

292
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,070
we've already made your ceremonial attire

293
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,470
with ease allowance.

294
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,400
Ease allowance?

295
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,830
What does that mean?

296
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,710
My coming-of-age ceremony should be perfect.

297
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:17,910
I want to try it on.

298
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,700
Why all this talk?

299
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,580
Well...

300
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,050
Then, I will take you

301
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,380
to try on your new attire now.

302
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:27,550
Please, Your Highness.

303
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,070
Bottle, wait for me here.

304
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:29,670
Yes.

305
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,130
Let's go.

306
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,810
Are these the embroidered robes

307
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,800
that the Master said the palace servants

308
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,140
were wearing in the mirage?

309
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,810
They're indeed here.

310
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:10,640
No.

311
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,430
The patterns on these clothes

312
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,670
are all interconnected.

313
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,790
They are all connected.

314
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,910
You, a little palace maid,

315
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,030
what are you doing here?

316
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:48,910
Stupid Bottle!

317
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,270
What are you doing here?

318
00:14:58,930 --> 00:14:59,590
This room…

319
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,950
There are so many embroidered robes here.

320
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,070
These are the embroidered robes

321
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,110
that the servants will wear

322
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,800
at your coming-of-age ceremony.

323
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,170
They are to be sent to the palaces tonight.

324
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,350
Indeed, these are the embroidered robes for the Crown Prince's 
coming-of-age ceremony.

325
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,320
Your Highness.

326
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,670
Have you tried on

327
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,750
your ceremonial robe?

328
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,260
I've eaten a lot lately,

329
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,530
yet surprisingly, I've lost 6 centimeters...

330
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,150
from my waist.

331
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,490
Have your people alter the robe quickly tonight.

332
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,390
I'm tired.

333
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,380
I'm leaving.

334
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,510
Your Highness.

335
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,820
[Eastern Palace]

336
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,430
These are the patterns I copied

337
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,590
from the palace servants' embroidered robes.

338
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,990
Unfortunately, I didn't get to copy all of them.

339
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,360
Hurry and take a look for me.

340
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,430
You copied all of them?

341
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,720
You're amazing.

342
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,350
Let me take a look.

343
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,270
These are all landscape patterns,

344
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,190
symbols of auspiciousness.

345
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,550
They are for my coming-of-age ceremony tomorrow.

346
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,270
There's nothing suspicious about it.

347
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:03,710
Nothing suspicious?

348
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,970
Are you too nervous?

349
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,510
The palace has been heavily guarded lately.

350
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,780
The masters from the Celestial Master's Mansion 
have been protecting me around the clock.

351
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,280
Situ Hanshan

352
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,980
shouldn't be able to cause any trouble.

353
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:14,900
Don't worry.

354
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,630
I hope so.

355
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,950
Thank you for today.

356
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,230
Rest early.

357
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,120
I'm leaving now.

358
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:24,460
Goddess.

359
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:25,670
What's wrong?

360
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,410
Don't feel too pressured.

361
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,170
Okay.

362
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,550
Tomorrow

363
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,130
is my coming-of-age ceremony.

364
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,550
Will you come to witness it?

365
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,790
I...

366
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,310
I'll try my best to make it.

367
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,350
After the coming-of-age ceremony,

368
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,210
I'll be able to participate in politics and choose a princess.

369
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,890
Then, let me congratulate you in advance.

370
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,230
May you engage more in politics and 
have more princesses and concubines.

371
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,350
I'm off.

372
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,990
But I only want one princess.

373
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:35,590
Chirp.

374
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:40,400
Master.

375
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,590
Are you okay?

376
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,810
Don't worry.

377
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,980
♫The wind hesitates, not daring to smooth the furrowed brow♫

378
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:47,790
I'm fine.

379
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,380
How can you be fine?

380
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,280
Master.

381
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,310
♫The rain hesitates, reluctant to burden the tear-streaked eyes beneath the umbrella♫

382
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,110
Are you in a lot of pain?

383
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,380
I'm fine.

384
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,580
I definitely am not a demon.

385
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,490
The truth will be revealed in three days.

386
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:03,240
♫The closer you are to me, the clearer the pain becomes♫

387
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,030
What are you talking about?

388
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,150
Even if you were a demon,

389
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,030
♫The most painful separation means you can't even miss her♫

390
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,200
I wouldn't give up on you.

391
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:15,510
♫In silence, the world's grudges weave a web of entanglement♫

392
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,870
♫Under the clouds, the smoke from cooking rises and spreads freely♫

393
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,060
♫It's the love doomed by fate♫

394
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:28,950
♫Under the umbrella, your profile is gently framed by the soft strands of your hair♫

395
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,260
If I were a demon,

396
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,260
♫Should my heart belong to someone for ten thousand years♫

397
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,510
use your little broken umbrella and subdue me.

398
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:38,010
♫Through endless lifetimes, softly and quietly, it flows on♫

399
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,900
You are now

400
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,280
a real demon hunter.

401
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,560
♫I won't lose you♫

402
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,450
♫I'll sacrifice myself to help you♫

403
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,470
How's the investigation going outside?

404
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:51,740
♫With a single lamp and a thousand books, alone I'm restless through the night♫

405
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,550
I gave Du Yuelian some drawings...

406
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,560
Master, don't worry.

407
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,110
I've already gone to the palace

408
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,960
and investigated those drawings.

409
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,590
Look.

410
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,560
The patterns you drew

411
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,470
match exactly with those

412
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,960
on the embroidered robes I saw in the Imperial Weaving Department.

413
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,810
Look, every pattern

414
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,220
can be connected together.

415
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,260
But every pattern is independent too.

416
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,800
Unfortunately...

417
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,030
neither the Crown Prince nor I

418
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,100
could decipher this mystery.

419
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,760
Did the Crown Prince help you

420
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,990
get into the Weaving Department?

421
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:18,550
Yes.

422
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,150
Master, don't worry.

423
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,070
With his protection,

424
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,570
I won't be discovered.

425
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,070
Did they tell you

426
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,580
when these robes would be worn?

427
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,460
They said

428
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,670
they would be worn during the Crown Prince's

429
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,270
Grand Coming-of-Age Ceremony tomorrow.

430
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,010
Tomorrow?

431
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,080
It's today now.

432
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,070
It's past 5 o'clock now.

433
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,600
The sun will come out soon.

434
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,910
Master.

435
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,820
But except for these,

436
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,960
I really have no clue.

437
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,070
And you know what?

438
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:55,730
Without you by my side,

439
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,310
I can't use

440
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,110
my Demon-Recognizing Pupils at all.

441
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,600
Chirp, don't be afraid.

442
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,990
Do you remember

443
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,950
the umbrella patterns

444
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:06,630
that my father made?

445
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,150
I remember.

446
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,390
On that rainy night...

447
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,000
On that rainy night,

448
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,510
I drank too much,

449
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,180
but I vaguely remember

450
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,110
that the patterns on the umbrellas

451
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,820
were all different from each other.

452
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,950
On that rainy night,

453
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:25,830
the sky was very dark,

454
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,110
and the rain was very heavy.

455
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:31,590
How about this?

456
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,300
You go back to find my father,

457
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,090
get those drawings,

458
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,630
and compare them with these.

459
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,910
Then, we'll see what we find,

460
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,550
okay?

461
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,570
I'll go now.

462
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:41,910
Wait.

463
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,190
What's wrong?

464
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,710
Haven't you been sleeping well

465
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,990
these past few days?

466
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,580
Don't worry, Master.

467
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,250
I'm holding up.

468
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:59,150
I'm fine.

469
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,740
Then, after everything is over,

470
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,870
let's go back and have a good sleep.

471
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,310
I...

472
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:12,910
No, I...

473
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,210
Chirp, I didn't mean it that way.

474
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,350
Just go, okay?

475
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,150
Hurry up. Or it'll be too late. Hurry!

476
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,110
Okay.

477
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,290
[5 a.m.]

478
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,230
No.

479
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,120
It's almost dawn.

480
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,760
By the time Chirp gets it to me, it'll be too late.

481
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,800
Let me try to piece these patterns together.

482
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:08,350
All the patterns were burned.

483
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:14,790
Uncle Nan,

484
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,630
didn't you draw those patterns before?

485
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,020
How about

486
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,640
you draw down everything

487
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:20,890
you can remember?

488
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,630
The more you rush me,

489
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,630
the more anxious I get,

490
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,650
and I can't remember anything.

491
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,740
You made those umbrellas.

492
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,150
How could you not remember?

493
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:30,390
Uncle Nan.

494
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:31,230
It's urgent.

495
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,460
Don't rush me.

496
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,270
Let me

497
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:36,390
think about it.

498
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,280
Uncle Nan, can you do it?

499
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,510
Hold on.

500
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:05,790
Uncle Nan.

501
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:06,830
Let me think on it some more.

502
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,510
It's urgent. We're all counting on you.

503
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,180
Okay.

504
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:09,840
Calm down.

505
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,640
What is it?

506
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,630
Mr. Ren Guang!

507
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,110
Chirp?

508
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,090
Come on.

509
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,090
You're drawing the patterns from the tribute umbrellas.

510
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,040
How could you possibly know what they look like?

511
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,470
I'm in your consciousness,

512
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,280
so sometimes I can catch glimpses of what you're seeing or thinking.

513
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:47,670
Don't worry.

514
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:48,950
Not all.

515
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,930
Though it's only partial,

516
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,460
I can tell

517
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,620
it's the Sky-covering Formation.

518
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,760
These patterns

519
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,440
are a formation?

520
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,270
This formation

521
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,710
can temporarily suppress the dragon aura.

522
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,440
Situ Hanshan wants to

523
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,430
use the Sky-covering Formation to suppress the dragon aura

524
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,360
to possess either the Crown Prince

525
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,480
or the Emperor?

526
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,900
Right at the Crown Prince's coming-of-age ceremony.

527
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,750
I have to go back now.

528
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:19,670
Wait.

529
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,190
I haven't finished speaking, and you're already leaving.

530
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,390
Remember,

531
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,710
only you can break this formation.

532
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,270
How can that be?

533
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,200
Master and Du Yuelian

534
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,740
are both great demon hunters.

535
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,630
Your blood

536
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,110
is the beginning of everything

537
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,970
and the end of everything.

538
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:41,830
What do you mean?

539
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,960
Why do you always speak so vaguely?

540
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,380
Can't you make it clear in one go?

541
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:47,550
No.

542
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,520
Only when I appear at the critical moment

543
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,500
can you realize how important I am.

544
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,610
You're always important!

545
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:58,570
Chirp?

546
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,220
Chirp!

547
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,300
Wake up.

548
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:01,720
Chirp?

549
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,020
Give me two more hours,

550
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,200
and I'll definitely be able to draw them.

551
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,180
No need.

552
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,350
Can you save Yi?

553
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,460
[7 a.m.]

554
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:23,450
Could it be...

555
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,500
Could it be a formation?

556
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,740
It's attacking my heart meridian again.

557
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,640
It's been a day and a night.

558
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,310
Well,

559
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,670
I don't even know where Junior is.

560
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,110
What if...

561
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,830
Then you'd have committed a great error.

562
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:54,330
Senior!

563
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,680
Why are you sneaking around here again?

564
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:58,510
I...

565
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,510
I...

566
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:00,710
I didn't do anything.

567
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,230
I, I was waiting for you.

568
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,650
Waiting for me?

569
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:06,990
Right.

570
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,870
Didn't I tell you yesterday?

571
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,670
Master has gone to the Imperial Ancestral Temple 
to escort the Crown Prince

572
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,030
to his coming-of-age ceremony.

573
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,990
We need to go investigate Nan Fengyi.

574
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,820
It's a big deal for the Crown Prince to leave the palace.

575
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,820
Now that we haven't caught Situ Hanshan yet,

576
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,890
we can't let our guard down.

577
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,350
Let's deal with Nan Fengyi's matter

578
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,270
tomorrow.

579
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,110
Let's go.

580
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:26,980
Wait, Junior.

581
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,240
Did you...

582
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,590
feel anything strange in your body?

583
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,750
No.

584
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,910
Then...

585
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,910
did you take the Meridian Protection Pill that I made yesterday?

586
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,150
I took it

587
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,190
after you left yesterday.

588
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,870
Is there a problem?

589
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,470
That's strange.

590
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,190
I switched the medicine myself.

591
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,960
Why didn't she have any reactions at all?

592
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,910
That's good. That's good.

593
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:58,950
Du Yuelian!

594
00:26:59,370 --> 00:26:59,980
Meng Xizhou?

595
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,710
Have you found anything?

596
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,990
Together, those patterns form the Sky-covering Formation

597
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,450
to conceal the dragon aura.

598
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,260
How did you know about this formation?

599
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,420
Did Nan Fengyi tell you?

600
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,750
It's hard to explain.

601
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,640
In short,

602
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,950
both the Crown Prince and the Emperor are in danger.

603
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,470
Let's go.

604
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:19,610
Junior.

605
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,080
The Crown Prince's coming-of-age ceremony is a big deal.

606
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,710
If the ceremony is ruined,

607
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,830
the fate of our realm will be affected.

608
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,830
Then our Celestial Master's Mansion will be guilty of death.

609
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:30,790
Du Yuelian.

610
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,950
I've never lied to you,

611
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:33,910
right?

612
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,420
Junior...

613
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,640
If there's anything wrong,

614
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,620
I will bear it alone.

615
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,300
It's the responsibility of the whole Celestial Master's Mansion.

616
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,570
Why would I let you, a minor master, bear it?

617
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,470
This pattern

618
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:52,280
can unlock the Demon Locking Pagoda

619
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,490
and release Nan Fengyi.

620
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,110
Okay.

621
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,450
Thank you for trusting me.

622
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:01,640
Senior.

623
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,130
Are you willing

624
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:05,010
to come to the Crown Prince's coming-of-age ceremony 
to save them with me?

625
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:06,350
I...

626
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,470
will go.

627
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,270
Let's go.

628
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,570
The Meridian Protection Pill that Du Yuelian gave me

629
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,750
not only had no effect

630
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,830
but also made me even hotter and more restless.

631
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,910
How could this happen?

632
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:28,310
Master.

633
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,310
Master.

634
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,080
I've found out that those patterns  together form a formation.

635
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,950
It's called the Sky-covering Formation.

636
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,520
It's designed to conceal the dragon aura.

637
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,910
I think they must want to take this opportunity

638
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,160
to possess the Crown Prince.

639
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,030
I'll get you out first.

640
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,350
Then, let's save the Crown Prince together.

641
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,140
Don't come over!

642
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,190
What's wrong?

643
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,460
I'll hurt you.

644
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,190
I'm here to get you out.

645
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:53,990
Besides, with you by my side,

646
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,220
I'll be stronger.

647
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,330
I said no!

648
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,170
Great!

649
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:05,680
Master!

650
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:06,630
Master?

651
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:07,950
Come on, be careful.

652
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,140
Master.

653
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,340
You...

654
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,610
Master.

655
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,780
Calm down.

656

♫What is love, and how many can truly understand it?♫

657
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:25,880
I think

658
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,910
we should wait until we get back to do this.

659
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,200
♫In the moment of writing, thousands of thoughts surge through my mind♫

660
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,750
I mistakenly took some medicine.

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,250
Now, I'm fighting to purge it from my system.

662

Are you feeling better?

669
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,780
Much better.

♫Your eyes mirror my flustered face♫

Master, slow down.

682
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:09,150
[Noon]

683
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,170
In this auspicious hour,

684
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,720
we bestow the rites of adulthood.

685
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,580
May you serve the country with diligence,

686
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,390
and may lasting fortune be passed down.

687
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,790
Get out of the way!

688
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,230
Help!

689
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:05,790
Somebody help me!

690
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:19,980
Crown Prince,

691
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,360
you must hang in there.

692
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,240
Goddess,

693
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,140
you and I

694
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,940
can never meet again.

695
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,490
Your Highness.

696
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,170
Goddess.

697
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,670
You're finally here.

698
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,630
Situ Hanshan!

699
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,490
The Demon-Recognizing Pupils are really useful.

700
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:14,990
But you don't have the ability

701
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,560
to break the formation.

702
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,070
Only you

703
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,370
can break this formation.

704
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:22,430
Your blood is the beginning of everything

705
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,380
and the end of everything.

706

My blood

708
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,110
may be able to break the formation.

709
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,130
Stop Situ Hanshan for me!

710
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,430
Who told you that?

711
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:32,910
You must trust me.

712
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,310
I'll explain everything to you later.

713
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,050
Hurry up!

714
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,640
Okay.

715
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:41,430
Nan Fengyi,

716
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,380
do you really think what you're protecting

717
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,310
is justice in this world?

718
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,720
How many more innocent lives have to be sacrificed

719
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,620
in exchange for the "justice" you speak of?

720
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,510
All of you...

721
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,330
Goddess?

722
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,190
No!

723
00:33:58,910 --> 00:33:59,590
No!

724
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,150
No.

725
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,510
It's too slow.

726
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,510
Goddess,

727
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,010
just remember

728
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,030
that there is someone in this world

729
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,750
for whom you will always be the best

730
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:13,060
in his heart, no matter what.

731
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,710
I won't allow you to give up on yourself!

732
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,460

733
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,580
Old man!

734
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:04,010
Yuelian!

735
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,270
Old man!

736
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,400
Chirp.

737
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,650
Du Fenglei!

738
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,950
I'm here!

739
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,530
Du Fenglei.

740
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:54,830
How are you?

741
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:55,990
Are you hurt?

742
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:56,920
Yuelian,

743
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,230
don't worry about me.

744
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:58,920
I'm fine.

745
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,280
It's just that my leg hurts a bit.

746
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,480
I'll be fine after some rest.

747
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:07,830
By the way,

748
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,230
where is Situ Hanshan?

749
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:09,740
There.

750
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,000
I killed him.

751
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,710
From now on,

752
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,070
you're not allowed to act alone again.

753
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,150
Okay.

754
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,820
I'll listen to you.

00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,270
Goddess.

758
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,190
You're awake.

759
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:56,430
I...

760
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:59,140
Why am I in your palace?

761
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,360
You saved me

762
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,660
and defeated Situ Hanshan.

763
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,740
You're amazing.

764
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,870
Situ Hanshan...

765
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,050
was defeated.

766
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:20,810
What is this?

767
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,500
This...

768
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:22,980
this is your fur.

769
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:24,830
No.

770
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,830
These are your feathers.

771
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,850
My feathers?

772
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,480
Goddess.

773
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,950
Actually, no matter what you become,

774
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,650
you will always be the goddess I revere.

775
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,710
Impossible.

776
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,230
Impossible.

777
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,200
I'm a human.

778
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:49,350
How could a human have feathers?

779
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,880
Is it possible

780
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,430
that you are a demon?

781
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,670
Impossible!

782
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,480
Impossible!

783
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,790
I'm a human.

784
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:57,590
Your Highness.

785
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,480
Let me tell you.

786
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,630
I'm a demon hunter.

787
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,660
And I want to become

788
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,090
a great demon hunter.

789
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,590
How can I be a demon?

790
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,470
Impossible!

791
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:07,180
Impossible!

792
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:07,970
Impossible!

793
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,310
It's all my fault.

794
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,830
My dragon aura

795
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,680
accidentally restored you to your original form.

796
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:20,550
But I've learned

797
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,390
that as long as you don't cast magic on me,

798
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:23,620
it's safe for us

799
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:24,870
to be together.

800
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,140
Don't be afraid.

801
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,190
I will protect you.

802
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:34,830
Besides...

803
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,290
only the two of us know about it.

804
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:40,710
No one else knows.

805
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,390
Your Highness,

806
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:42,590
Nan Fengyi has arrived!

807
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,470
Tell him to wait for me in the side hall.

808
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:46,310
Yes, Your Highness!

809
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,230
Don't worry.

810
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,080
I won't tell him

811
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,200
your identity.

812
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,390
I...

813
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,420
I think I can maintain my human form a little longer.

814
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,320
I'll go see him myself.

815
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,050
Master will be worried

816
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,440
if he can't find me.
