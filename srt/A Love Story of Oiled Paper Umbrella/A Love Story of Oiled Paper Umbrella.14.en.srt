1
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,070
Think about it.

2
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,759
This is your life career.

3
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,840
Now that you're leaving,

4
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,070
you must be very reluctant to go.

5
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,000
Master,

6
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,400
how about

7
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,760
we go to the secret tunnel again

8
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,200
and beg His Majesty?

9
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,510
If we can find the Scroll of Mountains and Seas,

10
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,200
we can make up for our mistakes.

11
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,560
The coachman exposed my identity.

12
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,120
His Majesty sealed

13
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,870
all the entrances to the secret tunnel.

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,750
I'm afraid

15
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,240
he doesn't want to see me anymore.

16
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,520
He blocked the secret tunnel…

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,400
Why didn't I think of that?

18
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,520
In the court,

19
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,360
you revealed your background

20
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,840
in public.

21
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,590
You even ate the secret letter.

22
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,750
It turns out

23
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,079
the one who saved you back then

24
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,520
was the Emperor.

25
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,150
Now my identity has been exposed,

26
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,840
this secret tunnel will only

27
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,710
implicate His Majesty.

28
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,630
It's useless.

29
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,000
His Majesty

30
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,870
is too heartless.

31
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,960
Let’s go.

32
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,280
Nan,

33
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,750
you'll always be our big brother.

34
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,750
We don't want you to leave.

35
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,280
Even if you don't,

36
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,910
he has to leave.

37
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,430
Guo Ji?

38
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,360
He...

39
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,630
Why is he wearing the official uniform?

40
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:53,950
Sorry.

41
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,750
I forgot to tell you my new identity.

42
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,680
I am the Director of the Court of Judicature and Revision appointed by His Majesty.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,030
Call me Director Guo.

44
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,680
His Majesty

45
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,750
actually appoint you to be the Director of the Court of Judicature and Revision?

46
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,390
If it weren't for your stupid evidence,

47
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,920
Nan Fengyi wouldn't have resigned.

48
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,000
I...

49
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,070
What do you mean by stupid evidence?

50
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,870
Everything I've done

51
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,310
is true to my conscience.

52
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,430
That's why His Majesty entrusted the Court of Judicature and Revision

53
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,600
to me.

54
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,600
As for Nan Fengyi...

55
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,560
No.

56
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,040
I should call you Baize Yi now.

57
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,680
You are the base person

58
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,390
who lied to all the people in our country.

59
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,750
His Majesty didn't punish you for deceiving him.

60
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,310
It's already giving you some leeway.

61
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,120
It turns out that it's His Majesty's idea.

62
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,510
You are not welcome here at the Court of Judicature and Revision.

63
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:16,920
Get lost.

64
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,430
Get lost?

65
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,510
You're acting like we want to be here.

66
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
What you're doing now

67
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,360
is what they say:

68
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,630
"Only dogs look down on others."

69
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,910
You...

70
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,040
What did you say…

71
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,870
Sassy girl!

72
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,120
Who are you calling a dog?

73
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,800
You...

74
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,750
Me…

75
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,190
I was talking about the person who reacted.

76
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,750
Look at you.

77
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,640
Guo Ji,

78
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,920
you are really

79
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:38,920
a vile person in power.

80
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,120
Do you understand that?

81
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,240
Only dogs look down on others!

82
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:41,680
Get lost!

83
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,310
Chirp!

84
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,720
Stop!

85
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,310
Today,

86
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,040
if anyone dares to leave the Court of Judicature and Revision,

87
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,070
don't ever dream of coming back!

88
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,240
Pick it up.

89
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:18,720
You...

90
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,240
Master.

91
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,159
He was wearing an official uniform but not the official hat.

92
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,430
Look at how arrogant Guo Ji was.

93
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,600
If it weren't for you…

94
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,310
What would you like for dinner?

95
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,750
Aren't you angry at all?

96
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
He said that to make me angry.

97
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,160
If you want others to understand you,

98
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,680
it will only make you suffer more.

99
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,510
Master,

100
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,360
don't you feel wronged

101
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,600
and sad?

102
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,360
You're devoted to protecting His Majesty.

103
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:22,920
And now,

104
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,000
he has promoted Guo Ji to your place.

105
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,630
Besides,

106
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,070
it wasn't easy to build a group of brothers

107
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,310
who would risk their lives with you,

108
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,720
but in the end, when we left,

109
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,800
they didn't even dare say goodbye.

110
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,920
Are you listening to me?

111
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,480
Yes.

112
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,360
Boss,

113
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,870
how much is the rice?

114
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,040
Six coppers per catty.

115
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,480
I'll have one catty.

116
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,430
Okay.

117
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,560
You're Nan Fengyi,

118
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,680
the Minister of the Court of Judicature and Revision, who was dismissed, right?

119
00:07:59,480 --> 00:07:59,920
Yes.

120
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,830
The descendant of the Baize family

121
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,190
who lost the Scroll of Mountains and Seas!

122
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,190
Take your money and go away!

123
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,430
I won't sell rice

124
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,040
to you, a traitor!

125
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,830
Who are you talking about?

126
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,920
Who are you calling a traitor?

127
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,800
Chirp.

128
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,190
Go away!

129
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:15,510
Go.

130
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,240
Don't delay my business.

131
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,160
What a bad luck.

132
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,430
This Nan Fengyi

133
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,000
is actually called Baize Yi.

134
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,720
He looks decent.

135
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,510
I didn't know he was such a person!

136
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,070
Who are you pointing at?

137
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,630
His father is a rebel.

138
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,120
He's a rebel, too.

139
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,040
How dare he come out?

140
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,000
Bah!

141
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,440
He's a traitor.

142
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,360
A traitor.

143
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:35,720
A traitor!

144
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,390
Get lost!

145
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,789
Don't go too far.

146
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,150
You keep calling him a traitor.

147
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,960
But have you ever thought this?

148
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,790
He was still a child

149
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,000
when the Baize family incident happened.

150
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,200
Besides,

151
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,030
he didn't lose the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

152
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,870
He's a traitor.

153
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,030
As a descendant of the Baize family,

154
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,270
does he have a choice?

155
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:54,720
Right?

156
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,440
Boss.

157
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:56,750
Here.

158
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,390
This rice...

159
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,200
We don't want

160
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,110
the rice.

161
00:08:59,270 --> 00:08:59,870
Give me back my money!

162
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,910
Take your stinky money!

163
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,750
Fine.

164
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,790
Let's go, Master.

165
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,510
Get lost!

166
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,240
He's a traitor.

167
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,720
Just leave!

168
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,150
Get lost!

169
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,270
Also,

170
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,670
if he, Nan Fengyi, hadn't risked his life

171
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,790
to solve the Puppet Spirit Case,

172
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,510
all of you

173
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,600
would have been replaced by the Puppet Spirit.

174
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,840
You might even have been eaten alive.

175
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,600
And you even hurled harsh words at him.

176
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,120
Do you have any conscience?

177
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,910
Don't bluff there.

178
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,080
The demons in Changle City

179
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,960
might even be

180
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,550
released from the Scroll of

181
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Mountains and Seas!

182
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,840
Exactly!

183
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,550
Yes, you released it.

184
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,840
You still won't admit it?

185
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,480
Right!

186
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,080
The Scroll of Mountains and Seas contains tens of thousands of demons.

187
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,390
If they were released now,

188
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,870
the winds have shifted in Changle City long ago.

189
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:37,790
Look.

190
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,240
You jinx.

191
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,840
You really are a jinx.

192
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,200
So what?

193
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,390
I sold haunted houses.

194
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,670
It's even worse!

195
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,550
Do you know who my father is?

196
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:45,960
What?

197
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,790
Shut up!

198
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,360
What an unlucky person!

199
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,480
You are not welcome in Changle City.

200
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,360
So unlucky.

201
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,200
Get lost!

202
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,150
The weather is changing.

203
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,080
Let's go home now.

204
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,150
Master.

205
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,630
I'm sorry.

206
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,840
It's all my fault.

207
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,840
Blame it on my jinxed mouth.

208
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,510
It's not your fault.

209
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,320
I only have you now.

210
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,150
Let's go.

211
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,510
Let's go home.

212
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,750
Tonight is the Winter Festival.

213
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,160
There must be many activities

214
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,200
on Zhuque Street.

215
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:32,910
How about

216
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,510
we go out

217
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,910
while Uncle Nan isn't around?

218
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,720
Don't follow me

219
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,240
while going out in the future.

220
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,030
Master,

221
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,550
did what those people said

222
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,550
upset you?

223
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,390
I knew it.

224
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,600
You said you didn't care,

225
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,670
but deep inside,

226
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,720
you still mind it.

227
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,910
I've been practicing

228
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,240
how to deal with

229
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,390
what happened today

230
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,910
many times.

231
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,550
But in your eyes,

232
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,080
there is clearly guilt.

233
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,670
I feel guilty for you.

234
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,150
In the future,

235
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,510
I can't marry you in glory.

236
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,440
As long as it's you,

237
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,600
it's fine.

238
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,510
What's wrong, Chirp?

239
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,510
Chirp!

240
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:58,550
What's wrong?

241
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,960
My eyes hurt.

242
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,720
Let me see.

243
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,240
Master.

244
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:07,870
I...

245
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,080
I can't see clearly.

246
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,120
Open your eyes slowly.

247
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,870
I can see it.

248
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,670
I can see it.

249
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,750
Maybe

250
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,560
I've been fighting against Situ Hanshan for too long

251
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,000
and consumed too much power.

252
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,600
Don't worry, Master.

253
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,910
I can see it now.

254
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,750
You keep saying your eyes hurt.

255
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,390
Let me find you a clinic.

256
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm back.

257
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,320
Uncle.

258
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,000
-Uncle Nan？
-Yi.

259
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,000
Yi.

260
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,670
Uncle,

261
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,150
you're back.

262
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,600
Uncle Nan, you're finally back.

263
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,630
You brat.

264
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,240
I've just left for a little while,

265
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,670
and yet you've exposed

266
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,840
our secret that we've been keeping

267
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,030
for a lifetime.

268
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:09,960
I'm sorry.

269
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,390
I failed to keep our secret.

270
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,030
Uncle.

271
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,630
Uncle Nan, don't blame him.

272
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,750
It was His Majesty…

273
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,440
I'm happy.

274
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,550
All these years,

275
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,030
I've always been worried that this secret

276
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,670
will get Yi and me executed.

277
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,510
Uncle.

278
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,600
Yaoniang,

279
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,240
I've been celibate

280
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,910
all these years.

281
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,200
I can finally

282
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,790
face you

283
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
with my innocence

284
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,960
and my real identity.

285
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,030
You two…

286
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,000
Don't you have

287
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,390
anything else to do tonight?

288
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,440
No.

289
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,750
Yes.

290
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,120
Didn't we agree

291
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,240
to celebrate the Winter Festival tonight?

292
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:07,910
Did we?

293
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,270
Uncle Nan.

294
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,670
When do you want us to come back?

295
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,320
Anyway, don't

296
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,320
come back too early.

297
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,360
Let's go.

298
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,960
Do your best.

299
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,360
Look.

300
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,280
There are so many people from Xizhou.

301
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,870
Tonight is the Winter Festival.

302
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,030
Why do I feel

303
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,750
there are more people than during the New Year?

304
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:44,750
Of course.

305
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,670
Before the Puppet Spirit case was solved,

306
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,240
people of Changle City

307
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,200
have been stuck at home for so long!

308
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:49,910
Tonight,

309
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,670
everyone can finally celebrate the festival.

310
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,750
So,

311
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,320
whether those who have a partner or those who don't

312
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,550
all came out to join the fun.

313
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,510
By the way,

314
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,360
it is said that

315
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,480
the Emperor, the Empress,

316
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,120
and the Crown Prince

317
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,200
will be enjoying the joy with people

318
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,120
at Lizheng City Tower.

319
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,910
In my opinion,

320
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,600
we don't need to wear masks.

321
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,360
Changle City is so big.

322
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,910
No one will recognize you.

323
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,630
I used to work around here.

324
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,750
All these merchants know me.

325
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,270
It's better to be cautious.

326
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,750
We're already out to have fun.

327
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,200
Why are you still unhappy?

328
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,550
I'm very happy.

329
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,440
You can't see it because I'm wearing a mask.

330
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,200
Don't think I can't see it because of the mask.

331
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,790
Your face and eyes

332
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,910
are written all over

333
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,720
with unhappiness.

334
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,030
Cheer up.

335
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,030
The lip balm from Xizhou.

336
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:00,120
The same lip balm used by the performers of the Tianji Troupe.

337
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,000
If you love her,

338
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,960
give her our latest

339
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,270
black ointment lip balm.

340
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,960
I heard that the Tianji Troupe from Xizhou

341
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,720
is the top performance group in the world.

342
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,360
The lip balm they use

343
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,360
must be the most beautiful.

344
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:21,390
Black ointment!

345
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,600
It's really black ointment!

346
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,720
It's from Xizhou.

347
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,320
It's the most fashionable color of lip balm!

348
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,150
I'll have it.

349
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:27,960
Give me one.

350
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:29,750
Me too.

351
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:32,550
Master,

352
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,360
This is black ointment lip balm.

353
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,870
I want it, too.

354
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,080
Your old lip balm isn't used up, is it?

355
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,510
You don't understand,

356
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,670
but girls

357
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,790
are always in need of new lip balm of the latest color.

358
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,790
Just one.

359
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,120
If you love her,

360
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,320
give her black ointment lip balm.

361
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,600
Look.

362
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,200
You heard what she said.

363
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,000
If you don't buy it,

364
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,360
it means you don't love me.

365
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,150
You don't love me…

366
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,750
I'll buy it for you.

367
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,120
Ma'am,

368
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,030
I'll buy one.

369
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:05,790
Thank you.

370
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,069
Thank you, Master.

371
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:22,589
Looks good.

372
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,640
I'm sorry.

373
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,270
Uncle Nan?

374
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,000
Put it on for me.

375
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,160
How is it?

376
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,590
It looks good.

377
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,240
Master, you're good-looking, too.

378
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,880
Anyone who wears black ointment lip balm

379
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,440
is allowed to watch the once-in-a-century

380
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,960
illusionary technique performance by the Tianji Troupe.

381
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,680
There seems to be a performance over there.

382
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,510
Anyone who wears black ointment lip balm

383
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,550
I want to see it.

384
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,720
is allowed to watch the once-in-a-century

385
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,830
illusionary technique performance by the Tianji Troupe.

386
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:51,720
You...

387
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,590
You say it.

388
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,550
Your Highness.

389
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,160
Her Majesty sent someone to urge you.

390
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,720
She hopes you can go to Lizheng City Tower

391
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,510
with His Majesty

392
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,160
and enjoy

393
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,590
the performance of the Tianji Troupe from Xizhou.

394
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,310
This Xizhou

395
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,720
is different from that Xizhou.

396
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,640
I'm not going.

397
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,480
It's not good.

398
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,720
You'll be alone…

399
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,160
In my opinion,

400
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,000
it's okay if he doesn't want to go.

401
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,400
Our Crown Prince

402
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,750
is alone.

403
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,160
It's not good.

404
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,960
I want to immerse myself in my painting.

405
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,480
I will meet my happiness.

406
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,440
You may leave.

407
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,510
Yes.

408
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,110
Goddess,

409
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,200
you and Nan Fengyi are together.

410
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,720
You must be happy.

411
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,750
You should be happy, too.

412
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,720
Me?

413
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,720
Don't worry about me.

414
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm the Crown Prince.

415
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,550
Of course, I can find happiness in my own life.

416
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,440
Anyone who wears black ointment lip balm

417
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,590
is allowed to watch the once-in-a-century

418
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,790
illusionary technique performance by the Tianji Troupe.

419
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,270
If we don't have the lip balm,

420
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,240
can't we watch it?

421
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,920
The effect will be greatly reduced.

422
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,830
What exactly is Xizhou's

423
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,030
illusionary technique?

424
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,960
I know that.

425
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:35,960
It

426
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,720
is just

427
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,400
just some sleight of hand and tricks.

428
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,160
Master,

429
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,790
when I was seven,

430
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,440
I was brought to Changle by Uncle Wu.

431
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,510
I haven't seen any performance since.

432
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,510
How about

433
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,440
you take me to watch the performance?

434
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:48,920
Sure.

435
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,510
But there are so many people ahead.

436
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,510
Can we make it?

437
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,350
Well…

438
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,270
I queued up to buy you this lip balm.

439
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,680
See if you like it.

440
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,720
This is black ointment lip balm, the most popular in Changle City.

441
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,200
Look.

442
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,510
I

443
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,240
don't have a wife,

444
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,070
and you don't have a husband.

445
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,720
Should our relationship

446
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,270
go further?

447
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:29,640
Honey.

448
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,590
Apply the black ointment lip balm on me.

449
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,240
Okay, honey.

450
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,400
What?

451
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,030
It seems that since ancient times,

452
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,070
there are always many people

453
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,640
as long as it's a festival.

454
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,350
Yes.

455
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,590
So,

456
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,000
you have to follow me closely,

457
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,160
or you'll get lost.

458
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,550
The black ointment lip balm is so beautiful.

459
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,070
Put it on.

460
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,830
Good performance.

461
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,310
Master,

462
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,960
you're so much taller than me.

463
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,200
You should be able to see

464
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,790
the performance of the troupe, right?

465
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,270
Yes,

466
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,480
but

467
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,920
I can't understand it

468
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,200
or hear it clearly.

469
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,590
Looks like your lip balm is wasted.

470
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,880
You can't see the stage,

471
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,920
let alone the illusionary technique.

472
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,400
I can only ask you

473
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,680
to help me think of a way.

474
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:24,510
Come on.

475
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,070
It's raining.

476
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,160
What a big umbrella!

477
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,110
What a big umbrella, Master.

478
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,400
Amazing!

479
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,400
Amazing!

480
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,960
So beautiful.

481
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,350
So beautiful.

482
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,160
Look.

483
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:21,880
So beautiful.

484
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,200
This umbrella is conjured by the illusionary technique.

485
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,160
Look!

486
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,030
It's that again.

487
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:31,920
This cloud

488
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,920
is the smoke from the illusionary technique

489
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,510
performance earlier,

490
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,160
which turned into colorful hues,

491
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,480
and will soon dissipate.

492
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,720
Looks like there's

493
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,920
something wrong with it.

494
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:52,960
What's wrong?

495
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,240
My eyes

496
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,640
hurt.

497
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,510
It seems

498
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,830
you should take a good rest.

499
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,830
It's just a baby tooth.

500
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,030
What's the point to keep it?

501
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,350
The Qi Sword

502
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,550
was forged by the bones of the ancient Demon Lord.

503
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,510
The Scroll of Mountains and Seas

504
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,750
was transformed from his flesh and blood.

505
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,400
Then, my father's Qi Sword

506
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,480
and the Scroll of Mountains and Seas

507
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,480
are both turned by the body of the ancient Demon Lord.

508
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,400
Could it be...

509
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,400
the trembling of the Qi Sword

510
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,000
indicates the reappearance of the Scroll of Mountains and Seas?

511
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,790
It's a premium house.

512
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,000
a third-rate price,

513
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,670
A first-class house.

514
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,830
The dream of living in Chang'an

515
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,200
will be protected by Uncle Wu's Agency.

516
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,160
The Jiao Yanlong residence is

517
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,880
eleven paces long from east to west

518
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,270
and nine paces from north to south,

519
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,830
with four rooms inside,

520
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,240
priced at 400,000 coins.

521
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,110
No, thanks.

522
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,030
Take a look.

523
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,240
Thank you.

524
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,400
The price is 400,000 coins.

525
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:53,920
Father.

526
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,110
Who would buy a house

527
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,070
in the middle of the night?

528
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,310
In my opinion,

529
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,920
it's better to go back to sleep.

530
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,240
Why are we suddenly

531
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,550
not allowed to sell the talisman

532
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,480
approved by the Court of Judicature and Revision?

533
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,030
That's easy.

534
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,070
The Nan Fengyi that Chirp likes

535
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,440
has resigned.

536
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,400
The new Director of the Court of Judicature and Revision

537
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,510
doesn't recognize us anymore.

538
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,790
Who would have thought

539
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,720
he'd be the descendant of the Baize family?

540
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,720
Father,

541
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,070
are you going to stop him

542
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,790
from being with Chirp?

543
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,510
He…

544
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,480
His reputation is really bad now.

545
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,110
I'm worried that

546
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,680
our Chirp will suffer if she's with him.

547
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,680
Not necessarily.

548
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,350
But he's the only man

549
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,590
whom Chirp likes

550
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,160
and isn't turned down by.

551
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,030
You...

552
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,000
You're right.

553
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,790
Chirp is like my daughter.

554
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,400
We need to care about her feelings.

555
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:55,030
Money and fame are worldly possessions.

556
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,110
In life,

557
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,960
happy experiences are the most important.

558
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,200
Let's make more money

559
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,720
and let Nan Fengyi marry into our family.

560
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,270
That way, you'll have a son.

561
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,110
This deal

562
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,200
will not be a loss for us.

563
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,400
From which book did you read this?

564
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,590
You really convinced me.

565
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:13,480
Let's go.

566
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,000
Home.

567
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,680
Demon!

568
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,830
Run!

569
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,240
Demon!

570
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,750
Monster!

571
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,750
Run!

572
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,200
Where is the monster?

573
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,240
Where is the monster?

574
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:25,790
Run!

575
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,480
Brother.

576
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,680
Where is the monster?

577
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,350
Strange.

578
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,440
What demon is this?

579
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,160
I’ve never seen such a demon before.

580
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,110
Master Du,

581
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,270
you said this monster is a demon.

582
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,920
Little girl,

583
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,070
why aren't you afraid at all?

584
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,720
It didn't seem to want to hurt me

585
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,270
but to run away.

586
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,070
Look at its eyes.

587
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,440
They're full of fear.

588
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,110
You're curious about everything.

589
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,750
Recently,

590
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,830
you've always said your eyes hurt.

591
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,110
So, I specifically learned how to make the eye-strengthening medicine soup

592
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,400
from the ancient medical books and made it.

593
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,720
Do you want to try it?

594
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,790
But I haven't had my brunch yet.

595
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,960
According to the ancient medical book,

596
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,590
it's more effective if you drink it

597
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,920
with an empty stomach.

598
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,270
It stinks.

599
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:54,590
I don't want it.

600
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,920
It just smells bad.

601
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,440
It tastes good.

602
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,920
Really?

603
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:01,870
Of course.

604
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,880
Let me show you.

605
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,720
How is it?

606
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,160
It's so delicious.

607
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,310
This tastes better than wine.

608
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,110
It tastes better than wine?

609
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,670
Of course.

610
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:26,790
Master.

611
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,920
You lied to me.

612
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:29,830
You lied to me.

613
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,240
Didn't you say

614
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,790
you're not afraid of bitter medicine?

615
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,400
I...

616
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,310
Maybe it's because the days are too sweet now.

617
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,000
I'm gradually starting

618
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,400
to fear the bitterness.

619
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,550
You've changed.

620
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,070
Master, you've changed, too.

621
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:58,680
Brother.

622
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,550
Brother, something happened.

623
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,200
Did I hear it right?

624
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,920
Last night, Ms. Wang died in Zhang Sanlang's house.

625
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,400
Zhang Sanlang went missing.

626
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,590
But the Court of Judicature and Revision

627
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,000
arrested our Uncle Nan overnight?

628
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,830
Why?

629
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,920
Suspected footprints of Uncle Nan were found at the scene.

630
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,790
We also found Uncle Nan,

631
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,640
who was wandering through the nearby alley.

632
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,350
Uncle Nan

633
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,920
is close with Ms. Wang.

634
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,440
And Zhang Sanlang and Ms. Wang had an affair.

635
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,070
I'm afraid Uncle Nan accidentally

636
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,110
walked in on their affair last night.

637
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,200
You're so annoying.

638
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:50,720
Nan Sixu!

639
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,070
Brother Nan? what are you doing?

640
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,510
Why are you here? Who let you in?

641
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,030
Nan Sixu!

642
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,240
Let him go!

643
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,510
Let him go!

644
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,200
Murder!

645
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,350
He must have killed them in a fit of anger,

646
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,590
disposed of Zhang Sanlang's body,

647
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,400
and staged the scene to make it look like he fled out of fear of punishment.

648
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,400
Uncle does have feelings for Ms. Wang,

649
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,830
but he wouldn't go so far as to kill somebody out of jealousy.

650
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,160
He's very timid.

651
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,030
He didn't even dare to kill the fish.

652
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,160
Besides,

653
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,720
Ms. Wang runs a martial club.

654
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,510
She wouldn't have been killed

655
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,400
by a weak man like Uncle Nan.

656
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,750
To be honest,

657
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,000
I don't believe it, either.

658
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,440
However…

659
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,270
Uncle.

660
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:46,680
Uncle.

661
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,030
Uncle Nan.

662
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,110
Uncle.

663
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:50,680
Uncle Nan.

664
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,030
Zhang Sanlang.

665
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,640
Give me back my Yaoniang!

666
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,200
Uncle!

667
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,350
Give me back my Yaoniang!

668
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,200
Uncle Nan.

669
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,000
He's not Zhang Sanlang.

670
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,310
He's Nan Fengyi.

671
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,400
Nan Fengyi.

672
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,310
Yi.

673
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,400
Yaoniang?

674
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,350
Yaoniang.

675
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:10,750
Uncle.

676
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,240
Are you okay?

677
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,240
Yaoniang. Yaoniang.

678
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,400
Why are you with Zhang Sanlang?

679
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,640
Tell me,

680
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,640
how is he better than me?

681
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,680
You're trying to kill me there!

682
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,720
Uncle Nan.

683
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,070
I'm Chirp.

684
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,400
Do you recognize me?

685
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,110
I'll kill you!

686
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,590
Uncle!

687
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:39,590
I'll kill you!

688
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,400
Uncle!

689
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:41,800
Kill you…

690
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:43,750
Kill…

691
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,550
Kill…

692
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,680
Kill you…

693
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,510
I'll kill you.

694
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,110
I'll kill you…

695
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:51,550
Kill you.

696
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,400
Kill…

697
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,520
How did this happen?

698
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,790
When we saw Uncle Nan at dawn today,

699
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,510
he was already crazy like this.

700
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,000
He seemed to be shocked and scared by something.

701
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,200
He talked nonsense.

702
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,240
Have you consulted the physician?

703
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,200
Many famous doctors came.

704
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,830
They all said Uncle Nan lost his soul.

705
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,510
Unless...

706
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,350
someone knows how to perform the 13 Needles of Ghost Sect.

707
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,310
Otherwise, Uncle Nan's illness...

708
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:17,750
can't be cured.

709
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,160
13 Needles of Ghost Sect?

710
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,510
What is that?

711
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,920
It's a magic that has been lost for hundreds of years.

712
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,640
It specializes in treating possession and hysteria.

713
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,590
Hundreds of years?

714
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,240
Then, in this world,

715
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,240
no one can cure Uncle Nan?

716
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,030
This is not the most urgent matter.

717
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,640
The new Director of the Court of Judicature and Revision

718
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,110
is going to convict Uncle Nan.

719
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:39,920
I called you here

720
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,880
in the hope that you can find a way

721
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,110
before the conviction.

722
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,680
My uncle can't even recognize people now.

723
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,070
How can his testimony be accepted as evidence?

724
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:48,920
Exactly.

725
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,750
Exactly!

726
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,160
He said he wanted to kill someone.

727
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,830
It's different from killing someone for real.

728
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,830
Yaoniang.

729
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,350
It's possible

730
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,920
that Zhang Sanlang did it himself.

731
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,160
He envied the relationship between Ms. Wang and Uncle Nan.

732
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,310
Then,

733
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,240
he tricked Ms. Wang into going to his place and killed her.

734
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,000
In the end,

735
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:03,830
he fled to escape punishment.

736
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,110
That's possible.

737
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,510
Escape punishment?

738
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,150
That way, he should've at least brought some money for the journey, right?

739
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,590
Zhang Sanlang has a habit of keeping accounts every day.

740
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,800
He even wrote down how much money was left

741
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,590
after buying dinner last night.

742
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:16,960
And it matches the amount of silver

743
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,400
we found in his house.

744
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,510
And the clothes, shoes, and caps in his closet

745
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,280
are all there.

746
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,070
It didn't look like he was running away.

747
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,360
The most crucial point is that

748
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,840
yesterday, his family and neighbors

749
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,280
saw the clothes he wore.

750
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,030
They matched the scraps of cloth

751
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,400
found in his house.

752
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,280
If he fled to escape punishment,

753
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,070
he can't run away naked.

754
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,190
What about the footprints?

755
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,230
The suspected footprints you mentioned

756
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,070
are not just footprints, right?

757
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,320
Changle City is so big.

758
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,550
There should be many people

759
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,590
who wear the same size of shoes as my uncle.

760
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,110
It rained last night.

761
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,190
Louyi Alley is very muddy.

762
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,800
Our men looked carefully.

763
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,840
No trace of Zhang Sanlang leaving was found.

764
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,440
Only the footprints of a person with uneven steps were found.

765
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,590
Look at Uncle Nan's feet.

766
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,800
They must have been injured last night.

767
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,070
And this.

768
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,190
Brother.

769
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,920
The damaged area on Uncle Nan's pants and the shred

770
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,480
are consistent in terms of the material.

771
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,070
The footprints

772
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,070
and the cloth

773
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:29,960
all prove it was him.

774
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,880
This only means

775
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,190
Uncle

776
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,110
did appear in Zhang Sanlang's house last night.

777
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,110
Besides,

778
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,670
he was also injured.

779
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,000
Now, the Court of Judicature and Revision believes

780
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,360
Uncle Nan killed Ms. Wang and Zhang Sanlang

781
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,030
and then destroyed Zhang Sanlang's body.

782
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,590
Only based on these?

783
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,510
Have you found the weapon?

784
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,400
Have you found Zhang Sanlang's body?

785
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,150
No.

786
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,590
But there were indeed injuries on Ms. Wang's body.

787
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:05,630
Then...

788
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,510
Nan,

789
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,150
what should we do now?

790
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,840
Autopsy.
