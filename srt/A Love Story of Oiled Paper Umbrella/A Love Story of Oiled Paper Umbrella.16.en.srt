[A Love Story of Oiled Paper Umbrella]

2
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,140
[Episode 16]

3
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,070
It's said that dozens of demon-related cases

4
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,570
happened in Changle City.

5
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,470
Is it true?

6
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:47,400
Your Majesty,

7
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,310
I think there are

8
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,270
over one hundred cases.

9
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,250
What?

10
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:53,630
Why so many

11
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,470
cases happened

12
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,110
in

13
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,240
a night?

14
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:56,870
Father.

15
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:58,590
Your Majesty.

16
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,390
Father, calm down.

17
00:01:59,470 --> 00:01:59,870
Your Majesty.

18
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:00,310
Hurry!

19
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,040
Call imperial physicians!

20
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:02,680
Your Majesty.

21
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,390
Calm down, Father.

22
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,520
The Demon Lord is back!

23
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,590
The Demon Lord is back!

24
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,470
The Demon Lord is back with Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

25
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,590
The day that demons massacre the city

26
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,200
is coming up, right?

27
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:16,750
Where's my queen?

28
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:18,829
Miao Yun.

29
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:19,990
Yes.

30
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:20,670
Miao Yun.

31
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,900
I'm scared.

32
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,020
It's only been a few years of peace.

33
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,310
I'm terrified.

34
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,460
Silang,

35
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,110
don't scare yourself.

36
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,590
Maybe they are fugitives

37
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,110
like Situ Hanshan,

38
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,430
who escaped from

39
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,550
the Scroll of Mountains and Seas,

40
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,430
and hid in Changle City.

41
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,140
No, no.

42
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,470
No.

43
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,040
It must be the Demon Lord!

44
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,750
Your Majesty,

45
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,829
don't worry.

46
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,150
Most of these demons

47
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,190
have been captured by us.

48
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:49,910
They are suppressed under the Demon Locking Pagoda

49
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,630
and wait for your punishment.

50
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,680
What are you waiting for?

51
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,310
Kill them!

52
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,510
Kill them all!

53
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,630
Wipe all of them out!

54
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,510
Yes.

55
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,670
But

56
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,270
there are some escaped demons.

57
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,460
The Celestial Master's Mansion is short-handed.

58
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,960
It would be great

59
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,170
if Nan Fengyi can help us.

60
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,550
Where is Nan Fengyi?

61
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,210
Why didn't he hunt demons with you?

62
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,420
Your Majesty,

63
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,040
Nan Fengyi was detained by Guo Ji, the Judicial Director,

64
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,430
under the charge of hiding the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

65
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,430
Who recommended Guo Ji

66
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,000
to be the Judicial Director?

67
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,090
What's the use of detaining Nan Fengyi?

68
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,590
There are still demons.

69
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:27,480
Father!

70
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,329
Father!

71
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,000
Father,

72
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,960
this demon might not be released

73
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,510
from the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

74
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,750
Please take good care of yourself

75
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,110
in case anger harms your health.

76
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,470
Go.

77
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,550
Release Nan Fengyi.

78
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,430
My son, tomorrow,

79
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,150
I want you to discuss with them how to eliminate demons

80
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,710
on behalf of me.

81
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,110
Don't worry, Father.

82
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,550
Son,

83
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:58,190
you should grow up.

84
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,950
Don't be as willful as a child anymore.

85
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,210
You have to take the responsibility

86
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,680
for me.

87
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,020
Father,

88
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,350
I see.

89
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:12,710
Father.

90
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,280
Silang.

91
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:14,790
Father.

92
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,630
Silang.

93
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,430
Father.

94
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,760
Why can't I make a breakthrough

95
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,630
in the final practicing stage

96
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,730
of Big Dipper Primordial Spell?

97
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,060
What did I miss?

98
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,130
It turns out the Scroll of Mountains and Seas you hid

99
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,250
released more than one demon.

100
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,090
What did you mean?

101
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,630
Stop pretending.

102
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,390
Hundreds of sea demons appeared in Changle City tonight.

103
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,600
It must be you who plotted it.

104
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,950
According to your words,

105
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,750
the Scroll of Mountains and Seas must be on me.

106
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,270
Otherwise, the fact that you detained me yesterday

107
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,670
but demons appeared tonight

108
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,380
will prove that as the Director of the Court of Judicature and Revision,

109
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,750
you are useless.

110
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:08,960
You...

111
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,830
How dare you refute me?

112
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,110
Guards!

113
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,350
Torture him!

114
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,710
Guards!

115
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,620
Where are you guys?

116
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,800
The Court of Judicature and Revision has no...

117
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,390
How domineering you are, Director Guo!

118
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:28,720
Greetings, Your Highness.

119
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,110
Nan Fengyi.

120
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,870
There are demons in Changle City.

121
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,510
By the order of His Majesty,

122
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,110
I summon you to the palace

123
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,470
to discuss the demon-hunting issue tomorrow.

124
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:41,550
Yes.

125
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,150
Yes.

126
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,710
Your Highness,

127
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,030
he is the culprit of the demon disaster.

128
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,909
If we discuss this issue with him,

129
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,390
isn't it a doomed petition?

130
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:51,510
It's a waste of time.

131
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,260
He's the culprit?

132
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,620
Nan Fengyi has been locked in the dungeon of the Court of Judicature and Revision.

133
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,310
If he had a way to create a demon disaster,

134
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,370
do you mean the Court of Judicature and Revision helped the evil?

135
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,630
It's a greater crime.

136
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,350
I dare not.

137
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,860
Then,

138
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,710
don't frame others.

139
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:07,990
Everything needs

140
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,220
evidence.

141
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,750
Let him go.

142
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,310
Nan Fengyi,

143
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,580
clean yourself up.

144
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,190
Tomorrow,

145
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,710
I'll wait for you in the Imperial Study.

146
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:19,750
Yes.

147
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:24,910
Can.

148
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,310
Is there a bug

149
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,240
on Director Guo's shoulder?

150
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,510
Director Guo.

151
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,000
Your Highness.

152
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,830
Wait for me.

153
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:46,840
I'm scared.

154
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,150
Baize Yi,

155
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,810
you cannot get away from suspicion

156
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,480
though His Highness protects you.

157
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,150
I'll keep an eye on you.

158
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,900
How is it?

159
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,190
Was

160
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,830
I mighty just now?

161
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,280
Do I look as fierce

162
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,000
as my father?

163
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:17,990
Yes.

164
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,860
You didn't see

165
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,920
Guo Ji's expression.

166
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,080
He turned blue

167
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,910
and pale in his face.

168
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,250
He trembled out of fear.

169
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,270
Yes.

170
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,990
Your Highness.

171
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:28,790
Your words

172
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,710
sounded as powerful as

173
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,950
thunder and fire.

174
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,680
You were

175
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,600
in an overbearing manner.

176
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,630
Are you literate?

177
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,860
Don't talk nonsense.

178
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,110
You two...

179
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,640
Why are you two so stupid?

180
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,580
I am not talking about Guo Ji.

181
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,990
I mean,

182
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:47,580
did I

183
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,070
scare Nan Fengyi

184
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:50,950
just now?

185
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,750
-Nan Fengyi?
-Nan Fengyi?

186
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,409
Nan Fengyi is a prisoner.

187
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,270
He's no match for you.

188
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,250
Exactly.

189
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,920
I don't know why Meng Xizhou

190
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,070
fell in love with him.

191
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:01,950
Look at him.

192
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:02,820
He is dirty

193
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:03,670
and smelly.

194
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,440
Your Highness is so handsome.

195
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,290
In addition,

196
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,300
you are the Crown Prince.

197
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:09,710
Keep a low profile.

198
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,170
Don't doubt Goddess' taste.

199
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,910
Since she likes him,

200
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,040
he must have

201
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,190
a special charm beyond me.

202
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,590
Sir,

203
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,670
you're modest.

204
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,590
Yes.

205
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,150
Greetings, Your Highness.

206
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:25,820
You...

207
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,530
Why are you following us?

208
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,030
His Highness saved me just now.

209
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,150
Just now?

210
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:31,790
Just now...

211
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:36,179
Did you hear anything?

212
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,549
I heard

213
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:40,000
nothing.

214
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,309
Okay.

215
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,300
Let's go.

216
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,030
Goodbye, Your Highness.

217
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:58,390
Chirp,

218
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,710
congratulations.

219
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,470
For what?

220
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,430
Your Demon-Recognizing Pupils progressed again.

221
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,910
I have a sudden eye disease these days.

222
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,470
I thought there was something wrong with my Demon-Recognizing Pupils.

223
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,710
Think about it.

224
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,990
You could activate your Demon-Recognizing Pupils

225
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,470
on your own when Nan Fengyi was away, right?

226
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:19,710
Yes.

227
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,710
No wonder I could tell that the sea demons were human beings

228
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,990
on the Zhuque Street yesterday.

229
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,350
It explains the matter.

230
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,320
I thought

231
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,630
something was wrong with my eyes.

232
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,630
But I didn't expect that

233
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,580
you would help them.

234
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:33,950
Chirp,

235
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,750
you've already known you're a demon.

236
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,030
Even if you help them,

237
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,270
they won't thank you.

238
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,590
So do demons.

239
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,230
Why do you

240
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,430
put yourself in a dilemma?

241
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,190
Anyway,

242
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,310
I was raised by a human.

243
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,780
After Zhang Sanlang's father

244
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,070
knew his son was a demon,

245
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,590
he didn't even want to take his body back.

246
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,550
How pathetic!

247
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,350
Isn't that the greatest irony?

248
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,510
Once humans

249
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,070
find out someone,

250
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,500
even the closest person, is a demon,

251
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,200
they will make a break regardless of anything.

252
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,270
But I can't stand aside

253
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,230
and do nothing.

254
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,150
Fine.

255
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,430
This is your choice.

256
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,030
Just like this stalemate,

257
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,240
it seems you have many solutions.

258
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,310
But

259
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,190
you've already been trapped in it.

260
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,510
A wrong step

261
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,200
may kill you.

262
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,140
Master,

263
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,190
am I dreaming?

264
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,270
Since there are demons in Changle City,

265
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,310
His Majesty

266
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,070
pardoned me to come back to catch the sea demons.

267
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,830
I am happy you're safe.

268
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,750
That's the best thing.

269
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,720
Did you cure

270
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,830
my uncle's illness?

271
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,070
Yes

272
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,510
and

273
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,510
no.

274
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,870
What do you mean?

275
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,310
An amazing young gentleman

276
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,630
taught me in my dream.

277
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,360
In your dream?

278
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,720
A man?

279
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,630
He

280
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,010
is a well-educated young gentleman.

281
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,440
His name is Ren Guang.

282
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,670
He appeared in my dreams frequently

283
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,310
since I was young.

284
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,190
He taught me how to read and write,

285
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,740
played with me

286
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,820
and helped me navigate difficult situations

287
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,230
like a teacher and a friend.

288
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,150
So it was Ren Guang who taught you

289
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,790
the 13 Needles of Ghost Sect?

290
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,000
You didn't even know

291
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,790
how many acupoints a man has.

292
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,100
How could you acupuncture accurately

293
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:58,970
in one night?

294
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,900
But

295
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,750
I made it.

296
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,510
There's another

297
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,210
incredible thing.

298
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,150
I lent my body to him.

299
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,090
He sneaked into the prison of the Court of Judicature and Revision

300
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,320
and

301
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,690
cured Uncle Nan.

302
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:15,920
You...

303
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,150
Did you lend him your body?

304
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,870
Why did he use your body?

305
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,110
It's because

306
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,270
he only exists in my dream.

307
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,670
He had to use my body

308
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,390
to help me.

309
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,110
Well,

310
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,630
besides treatment,

311
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,090
did you lend him your body at other moments?

312
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,110
Of course not.

313
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,830
Master,

314
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,220
don't worry.

315
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,540
Mr. Ren Guang

316
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,460
is on our side.

317
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,470
He did everything to do me good.

318
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:51,580
Don't worry.

319
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,850
You can't lend him your body anymore.

320
00:12:59,070 --> 00:12:59,710
I know

321
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,550
you did so to save Uncle.

322
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,940
But remember,

323
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,630
prevention awareness is indispensable.

324
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,280
I see.

325
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:18,980
By the way,

326
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,790
Master,

327
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,670
there's something else

328
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,790
I have to tell you.

329
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,290
Go ahead.

330
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,970
Those sea demons

331
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,790
might not be demons

332
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,270
but humans.

333
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,230
Humans?

334
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,760
Yes.

335
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,120
I've recognized their identities

336
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,150
with my Demon-Recognizing Pupils.

337
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:37,830
Last night,

338
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,270
I wasn't by your side.

339
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,070
How could you use Demon-Recognizing Pupils?

340
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,110
Mr. Ren Guang said

341
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,400
my Demon-Recognizing Pupils

342
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,390
progressed.

343
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,710
I can use them

344
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,060
even if you're not by my side.

345
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,030
You mentioned him again.

346
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,810
Do you believe everything he said?

347
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,150
Not everything.

348
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:00,550
So,

349
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,750
we must find it out.

350
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,780
Du Yuelian

351
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,550
has arrested the sea demons

352
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,670
and put them in the Demon Locking Pagoda.

353
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,150
It is said that three days later,

354
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,200
they will be burnt out.

355
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,150
Master,

356
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,190
what if they are humans?

357
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,510
What if they are really burnt out

358
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,830
in three days?

359
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,230
Master,

360
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,230
don't you empathize with them?

361
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,510
They might be living humans.

362
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,790
Master.

363
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,190
I was locked in the pagoda once.

364
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:39,830
If they are humans,

365
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,400
they won't be burnt out by the Demon Locking Pagoda.

366
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,110
We can wait and see the result

367
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,840
after three days.

368
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,280
You don't understand what I mean.

369
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,350
I mean,

370
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,550
if they are human beings

371
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,500
and injured by mistake,

372
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,430
what should we do?

373
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,870
If they are demons,

374
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,020
they will be burnt out.

375
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,870
Even without me,

376
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,900
the Celestial Master's Mansion

377
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,470
will eliminate them

378
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,400
to prevent future troubles.

379
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,830
In the end,

380
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,190
demon identity

381
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,840
is our original sin,

382
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,350
right?

383
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,590
Chirp,

384
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,500
you're an exception.

385
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,870
If Uncle Nan, Uncle Wu and Dan Qian

386
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,150
become sea demons,

387
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,510
can you say

388
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,790
I'm the only exception?

389
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,280
But they are humans.

390
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:41,510
Forget it.

391
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:42,270
Chirp!

392
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,330
Where are you going?

393
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,780
Go home

394
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,190
to see Uncle Wu and Dan Qian.

395
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,460
Changle City

396
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,910
is full of demon-hunting formations.

397
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,390
Can you stop running around?

398
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,300
Not every demon hunter

399
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,110
will treat you as an exception.

400
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,870
Master,

401
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,960
I don't want to be treated as an exception.

402
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,300
If possible,

403
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,230
I hope

404
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,310
all kind demons in the world

405
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,700
can be treated as exceptions.

406
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:21,550
Chirp.

407
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,520
Don't follow me!

408
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,240
Follow her.

409
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,130
If there are any dangers,

410
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,230
-tell me immediately.
-Okay.

411
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,110
Could it be that those sea demons were transformed from humans?

412
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,750
Why would I have such a ridiculous thought?

413
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,750
[Dan's Mansion]

414
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,220
It seems that even Master

415
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,560
has a solid prejudice

416
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,630
against demons.

417
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:00,420
Uncle Wu.

418
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,670
Uncle Wu?

419
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,150
Dan Qian?

420
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,349
Did something happen?

421
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,400
House-cleansing Agreement?

422
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,630
This is a house cleansing agreement signed a few days ago.

423
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:34,670
It seems that

424
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,580
Uncle Wu went to clean the haunted house.

425
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,050
It was a false alarm.

426
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,670
Why are you here?

427
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,760
You...

428
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,070
Did Master send you here to spy on me?

429
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,030
Did you two quarrel?

430
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,190
No.

431
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,910
I didn't quarrel with him.

432
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,870
I just can't stand him talking about

433
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,550
demon-hunting

434
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,630
issues.

435
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,570
I've changed.

436
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,650
Since I found out that I'm a demon,

437
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,790
I can't face the war

438
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,350
between humans and demons in peace.

439
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,710
The more righteously they

440
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,290
try to kill demons

441
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,570
to protect the peace of the world,

442
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,590
the more I hate it.

443
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,790
Why are human beings sentenced

444
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,150
according to the laws

445
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,950
while demons are killed

446
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,640
when their identities are exposed?

447
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,430
No matter they are humans or demons,

448
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,290
they should not be killed.

449
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,160
Wake up.

450
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,540
So,

451
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,230
we must find a way

452
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,310
to transform them back

453
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,970
before the Celestial Master's Mansion eliminates them.

454
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:46,650
But

455
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,470
I'm not a member of the Celestial Master's Mansion

456
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,070
nor a member of the Court of Judicature and Revision.

457
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,320
What should I do?

458
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,030
Got it.

459
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,470
I'm here for His Highness.

460
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:02,730
Miss,

461
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,050
a large number of demons appeared in Changle City last night.

462
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,110
The Imperial City

463
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,030
has strengthened the guards.

464
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,390
Without an official letter,

465
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,550
we can't let you in

466
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,240
with this token alone.

467
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,230
Sir,

468
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,110
I have something urgent to tell His Highness.

469
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,010
She came with me.

470
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:18,950
Today,

471
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,630
we have to meet His Highness

472
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,830
to discuss the demon-hunting issue in Changle City.

473
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,620
I see.

474
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:25,470
Please

475
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:26,490
wait here.

476
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,310
Thank you.

477
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:32,750
Did you...

478
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,500
Did you have a sound sleep last night?

479
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:36,550
Yes.

480
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,300
But that's not what the papermen said.

481
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,670
Please

482
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,290
don't let them follow me anymore.

483
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,750
Besides,

484
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,900
I also know Paper Control Technique.

485
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,110
After they come to me,

486
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,390
they may not follow your words.

487
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,920
But last night, you said...

488
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,030
Mr. Nan.

489
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:54,550
Miss Meng.

490
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,340
Why are you here?

491
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,070
Bottle,

492
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,020
I...

493
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,230
I didn't come with him.

494
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,200
I want to borrow something from His Highness.

495
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:02,550
Okay.

496
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:05,970
Recently, in Changle City,

497
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,630
a lot of sea demons appeared.

498
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,070
When Father heard about this,

499
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,220
his old illness relapsed.

500
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:11,670
Today,

501
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:12,930
Mother and I, on behalf of him,

502
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,160
summoned you all

503
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,030
to discuss

504
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,740
how to get rid of demons.

505
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:20,960
Your Highness.

506
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,020
Your Majesty.

507
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,840
All the sea demons

508
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:24,840
have been arrested

509
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,070
and imprisoned in the Demon Locking Pagoda of the Celestial Master's Mansion.

510
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,590
They will be burnt out in three days.

511
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,700
We also arranged guards from Celestial Master's Mansion

512
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,270
to patrol Changle City

513
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:31,950
day and night.

514
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,160
If there is any escaped demon,

515
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,350
they'll arrest it immediately.

516
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,350
You can

517
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,430
rest assured.

518
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,590
They're demons.

519
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,680
Just eliminate them.

520
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,430
Why do you need three days to burn them out?

521
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,750
All demons are kept in the pagoda of the Celestial Master's Mansion.

522
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,670
What if anything goes wrong,

523
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,030
and causes more trouble?

524
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,950
Your Majesty,

525
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,190
I...

526
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,350
I want to find out

527
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,370
the origin of these demons.

528
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,150
You can investigate it,

529
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,120
but it's not in conflict with killing these demons

530
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,070
to prevent further trouble.

531
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:10,510
But...

532
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,070
Your Majesty, Your Highness,

533
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,110
Nan Fengyi and Meng Xizhou are here to see you.

534
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:17,910
Goddess.

535
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:18,790
Hurry.

536
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:19,910
Let her in.

537
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,670
Yes.

538
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,430
Goddess,

539
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:26,900
what are you doing here?

540
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:30,270
Your Highness.

541
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,890
I'm here to beg you.

542
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,750
You can't kill the demons in the Demon Locking Pagoda.

543
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,270
I have Demon-Recognizing Pupils.

544
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,230
I saw

545
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,150
the demons

546
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,070
may be humans.

547
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,450
Nonsense!

548
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,230
All people have seen

549
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,310
their ugly demon forms.

550
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,220
How could they be humans?

551
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,670
Your Majesty,

552
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,510
as we all know,

553
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,720
the first sea demon in Changle City

554
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,580
was Zhang Sanlang.

555
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,840
At first,

556
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,030
we thought he was a demon,

557
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,370
who transformed into a human.

558
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,920
But there is another possibility.

559
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,110
He was a human,

560
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,720
but was transformed into a demon with a secret technique.

561
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,500
The over one hundred sea demons

562
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,830
could be in the same situation.

563
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,500
If what you said is true,

564
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,730
why didn't you

565
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:09,780
find the sea demons are humans with Demon-Recognizing Pupils

566
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,750
when Zhang Sanlang's incident happened?

567
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:12,670
I...

568
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,040
It's a long story.

569
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,750
Recently, when I was practicing,

570
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,360
my power has improved.

571
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,030
Maybe

572
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:21,990
my Demon-Recognizing Pupils

573
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,920
progressed

574
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,070
after Zhang Sanlang's case.

575
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,600
It's your assumption.

576
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,550
If we release all these demons according to your words,

577
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,430
aren't we putting the whole Changle City

578
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,660
in danger?

579
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,760
Your Majesty,

580
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,270
I think

581
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,390
maybe we can give Meng Xizhou a chance

582
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,900
to investigate this case

583
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,050
in case

584
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,600
over one hundred lives were wrongly killed.

585
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,280
Nan Fengyi,

586
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,750
are you indulging her out of your personal feelings

587
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,560
or do you really believe her nonsense?

588
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,230
Can you bear the responsibility?

589
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,700
This concerns the safety of all people in Changle City.

590
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:00,950
He doesn't have to bear the responsibility.

591
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:02,490
Your Majesty,

592
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,390
and Your Highness,

593
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,380
please give me a chance.

594
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:05,790
I will prove

595
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:06,690
my words are right.

596
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,030
Mother,

597
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,630
I think as long as she doesn't hurt the innocent,

598
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,350
we should give her a chance.

599
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,110
Okay.

600
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,380
Meng Xizhou,

601
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,060
I'll give you a chance.

602
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,600
You have three days.

603
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:28,780
After three days,

604
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,420
if you can't find evidence to prove those sea demons are humans,

605
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,550
I'll punish you

606
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,910
for disturbing the demon-hunting incident

607
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,510
and give you to the Court of Judicature and Revision.

608
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,110
Your Majesty.

609
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:37,790
Mother.

610
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,630
I'll take this task.

611
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,230
Thank you, Your Majesty.

612
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,130
I know

613
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,950
it's hard for you to understand my unnecessary actions.

614
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:51,960
You may even think

615
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,160
I'm siding with those sea demons.

616
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,390
I'll show you the truth.

617
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,050
Time is running out.

618
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,340
I have to go.

619
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,720
I shall take my leave.

620
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,230
Your Majesty,

621
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,450
I shall take my leave, too.

622
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:09,680
Nan Fengyi,

623
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,230
the reason why Changle City is now troubled by demons

624
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,920
is that the Baize family

625
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,550
lost the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

626
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,810
Although you have an evil origin,

627
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,120
you're loyal to the people.

628
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,310
Why don't you be an official detective

629
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,540
and help the Celestial Master's Mansion capture these demons

630
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,560
and redeem myself?

631
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,450
Do you have any objections?

632
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,350
Thank you, Your Highness.

633
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,030
I accept the decree.

634
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:45,470
Mother,

635
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,510
if there's nothing else,

636
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,510
I'll leave now.

637
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:48,430
Go.

638
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,110
Your Majesty.

639
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,090
I'm fine.

640
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,210
[Taiji Gate]

641
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,030
Miss Meng.

642
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:05,980
Miss Meng.

643
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:07,750
Can?

644
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:10,510
Miss Meng,

645
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,580
come with me.

646
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,190
Where are we going?

647
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:31,870
Your Highness.

648
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,150
Goddess.

649
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,430
What can I do for you?

650
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:36,970
Here you are.

651
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,590
What is this?

652
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,860
This is a fish token.

653
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,730
With this,

654
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,620
the authorities won't stop you from handling the case.

655
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:45,150
Besides,

656
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,800
you can send one or two people to help.

657
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,460
Thank you.

658
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,350
Don't worry. Go to investigate the case.

659
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,790
If Mother convicts you,

660
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,310
I will protect you.

661
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:56,630
Thank you, Your Highness.

662
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:59,510
I have nothing else to say.

663
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,680
Be careful.

664
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:02,750
Okay.

665
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,070
I will.

666
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:14,590
Nan Fengyi,

667
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,350
follow me to the Celestial Master's Mansion.

668
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:16,790
What?

669
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:18,950
Now that Her Majesty

670
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:19,830
gave you a position,

671
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,550
you should bear the responsibility of hunting demons.

672
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,150
Let's go.

673
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,550
As His Highness ordered,

674
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,230
all officials should cooperate with me

675
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,810
to investigate when seeing the fish token.

676
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:32,590
[Court of Judicature and Revision]

677
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,190
Lord Guo,

678
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,280
please give the files

679
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,590
of the missing cases in Changle City

680
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,350
to me.

681
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:33,710
Meng Xizhou,

682
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,230
are you too idle?

683
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,620
Her Majesty only gave you three days

684
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,810
to investigate the case of the sea demons.

685
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,310
Why do you have spare time to

686
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,790
come to the Court of Judicature and Revision

687
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,590
and investigate other cases?

688
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,150
Cut the crap.

689
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,560
Will you do it

690
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,360
or not?

691
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,630
I have to obey

692
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,750
His Highness' words.

693
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:56,820
But

694
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,840
everyone here has important things to deal with.

695
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,900
We don't have enough manpower.

696
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,360
I'm willing to take Miss Meng

697
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,270
to investigate the case files.

698
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:05,990
Bro.

699
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,070
Huo Xiao.

700
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,390
How dare you!

701
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,990
I didn't know

702
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,810
you're a brave man.

703
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,210
Lord Guo, don't get me wrong.

704
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,700
I'm taking a break today.

705
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,830
Since Miss Meng has His Highness' fish token,

706
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,860
I don't want to make things difficult for you.

707
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:30,680
Calm down, Lord Guo.

708
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,680
My brother helped her

709
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:33,270
for the sake of His Highness.

710
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,030
Lord Guo.

711
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,070
Huo Xiao,

712
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,220
what if you are fired by the Court of Judicature and Revision

713
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,200
as you helped me?

714
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:43,190
It doesn't matter.

715
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,660
Director Guo is a newcomer.

716
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,030
He needs me now.

717
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,370
He can't handle

718
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,520
all the trifles of the Court of Judicature and Revision.

719
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,620
Those are angry words.

720
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,240
As long as I go back and apologize

721
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:53,910
to him in a well-behaved way,

722
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,000
he will be at ease

723
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,200
and let me go.

724
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,130
It's okay.

725
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,050
I'm sorry.

726
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,280
I

727
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,390
wronged you.

728
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,470
I thought you were trying to

729
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,100
to make a clear break with Nan Fengyi.

730
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,080
But I understand.

731
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,590
After all,

732
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,760
it's really hard to get a proper job

733
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,300
in Changle City.

734
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,510
We were once comrades.

735
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:17,860
Let's skip the formalities.

736
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:18,920
Don't treat each other as an outsider.

737
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,240
By the way,

738
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,580
why are you here to look for the missing case files?

739
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,210
I think

740
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,670
the sea demons in Changle City

741
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,170
were transformed from

742
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,790
ordinary citizens

743
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:35,320
by secret magic.

744
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,990
Did you find any evidence?

745
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:42,870
No.

746
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,070
But I came here today

747
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,650
to verify my guess.

748
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,110
If the number of

749
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,230
missing persons reported suddenly increased,

750
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,000
and matches that of

751
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,100
the sea demons that were captured,

752
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:54,870
my guess

753
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,220
may be true.

754
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,580
The number of missing people increased.

755
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:01,790
Wait.

756
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,830
Nine people in the west of the city,

757
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,710
twenty-two in the north,

758
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,870
sixteen in the south,

759
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:23,020
and over ten people in the east are missing.

760
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:26,990
Why are there so many missing cases?

761
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,050
It's a rough report.

762
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,620
Many missing people

763
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,280
have no relatives.

764
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,150
So, the missing persons haven't been reported.

765
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,990
After the investigation of the Court of Judicature and Revision,

766
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,150
we confirmed that

767
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,440
the missing people in Changle City

768
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,560
are around one hundred.

769
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,350
How many sea demons

770
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,510
were captured by Celestial Master's Mansion?

771
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,200
Over one hundred.

772
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,230
Have you noticed

773
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,590
all the missing people

774
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,270
are men?

775
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,230
Shall

776
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,760
I go with you to visit their home

777
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,190
and see if there's any clue?

778
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,110
On the eighth day of this month,

779
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,030
I was

780
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,370
weaving cloth in my room.

781
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,110
My husband

782
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,580
said he wanted to take a walk in the garden.

783
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,350
I couldn't find

784
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:10,910
him

785
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,680
after I went out.

786
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,540
I'm from another city.

787
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:16,160
I knew it.

788
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:17,540
He became a demon

789
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:18,890
from human here.

790
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,750
How can I make a living

791
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,100
by myself?

792
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,150
What are you doing?

793
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,110
Let go of me!

794
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,200
You applied maroon lip balm, too.

795
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,350
This maroon lip balm

796
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,350
was a gift of the Winter Festival

797
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,680
given by my husband.

798
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,910
Did he apply it

799
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,110
before he went missing?

800
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,750
How could a man

801
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,150
use it?

802
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,990
Of course it's for me.

803
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,460
Before he went missing,

804
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:45,360
did you use it?

805
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,110
What do you mean?

806
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:47,350
Can't I use it?

807
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:47,990
And then?

808
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,510
Did you do

809
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,530
anything special?

810
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,550
What special thing

811
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,360
can a couple

812
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,230
do?

813
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,430
Am I right, officer?

814
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,100
I...

815
00:30:58,650 --> 00:30:59,550
I don't know.

816
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,150
Give me the lip balm.

817
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,830
Why?

818
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:03,140
Hurry.

819
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,310
It will make your lips worn out.

820
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:04,910
Give it to me.

821
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,510
I'll take it away.

822
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,150
Tell everyone around you

823
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,350
don't use it anymore.

824
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:13,470
Let's go.

825
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:13,910
Huo Xiao.

826
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,510
Master,

827
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,350
please let us go.

828
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,870
I'll

829
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,410
be grateful to you.

830
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,850
What's up?

831
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:41,750
Master,

832
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,200
Meng Xizhou

833
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,790
has been looking for evidence that human beings were turned into sea demons.

834
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,490
I'm worried that

835
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,570
within three days,

836
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,990
she'll find the truth.

837
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,280
Are you concerned that she may find out the truth?

838
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:55,270
Yes.

839
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,030
Although I tried to stop her,

840
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:59,430
His Highness gave her the fish token

841
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,790
and those from the Celestial Master's Mansion

842
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,280
are helping her.

843
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,370
I'm really worried.

844
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,360
Don't worry.

845
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,350
It's better for me

846
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,020
if she finds out the truth.

847
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,710
[Silk-thread Puppet]

848
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,350
What can I do for you, Master?

849
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,690
A silk-thread puppet.

850
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,560
You're my senior's...

851
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,150
Xuanxu, how dare you

852
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,990
practice sorcery here?

853
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:43,000
How did you learn it?

854
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:43,870
Master,

855
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,470
there is no distinction between good and evil in skills.

856
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,190
It depends on the aim of the practitioner.

857
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,350
You know

858
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,110
why I want to practice puppet skills.

859
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,800
It

860
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,910
needs corpses' energy to nourish equinox flowers

861
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,230
and then inject energy into puppets.

862
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,480
It's against the grain.

863
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,760
You'll be doomed eventually.

864
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,350
I don't care.

865
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,750
I was born

866
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,100
for practicing puppet skills.

867
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,660
No one can stop me.

868
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,630
You...

869
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:13,930
The Celestial Master's Mansion

870
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,640
can't tolerate an evil person

871
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:17,750
like you.

872
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,150
Master.

873
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,070
Master!

874
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,880
Master.

875
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:27,910
Are you

876
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,860
going to kick me out?

877
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,230
No, Master.

878
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,530
Master,

879
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,750
you are my only family.

880
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,910
Please.

881
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:40,070
Please don't kick me out.

882
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:40,740
Master!

883
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:41,910
Master?

884
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:42,530
No!

885
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,120
Master,

886
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,070
she has

887
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,460
no family.

888
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,230
If you kick her out,

889
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,880
where can she go?

890
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,400
Please forgive her this time.

891
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:54,960
Cut the crap.

892
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,650
If she stays in my sect,

893
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,270
she'll be a big trouble in the future.

894
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,390
Senior.

895
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:08,909
Master.

896
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:09,370
Master,

897
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,340
you are so cruel to me.

898
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:16,840
All right.

899
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,190
Du Fenglei,

900
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:20,460
I will transmute the black silk-thread puppet

901
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,790
to prove everything I did

902
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,230
is right.

903
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:26,730
Guo Ji,

904
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,230
I didn't expect that

905
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,820
you remember me.

906
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:32,620
Of course.

907
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,150
Good.

908
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,190
Since you know each other,

909
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,690
things will be easier.

910
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,340
Meng Xizhou wants to

911
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,330
find out the truth about the sea demons, right?

912
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,900
Then, let her find out

913
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:46,929
something she can't accept.

914
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,840
Master, you mean...

915
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,900
Doesn't she think the sea demons are innocent?

916
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,020
Let sea demons

917
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,150
kill human beings.

918
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,760
Jiaoniang,

919
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,490
you're good at this.

920
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,120
It's your task now.

921
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:05,510
Yes.

922
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:09,290
Guo Ji,

923
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,870
give this clue

924
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,270
to the Court of Judicature and Revision.

925
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,590
Meng Xizhou will take the bait.

926
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:15,770
Yes.

927
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,410
By the way, Master,

928
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,670
when

929
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,430
will you fulfill your words

930
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,490
of making me Minister of the Court of Judicature and Revision?

931
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:28,430
Be patient.

932
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,950
It depends on

933
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,220
your and your senior's performance this time.

934
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,320
Okay.

935
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,880
I'll do my best.

936
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,830

937
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,740
You little brat

938
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,550
are back.

From now on,

00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:47,850
you are my silk-thread puppets.

942
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,240
Do whatever I

943
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,820
tell you.

944
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,640

945
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,300
if it were not for the money.

00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,070
why are you here alone?

00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:18,630
Where are your parents?

Are you hungry?

952
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,510
Kill him!

00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,890
come back home with me.

eight people were killed by sea demons.

965
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,370
It's not too late to kill them after two days.

966
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,390
I'll take them in

967
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,970
your Demon Locking Pagoda.

968
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,120
I can understand Chirp's thought.

969
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,230
But as a descendant of Baize,

970
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,510
how could you tolerate demons killing people?

971
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:28,430
Anyway,

972
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,510
I will give their family

973
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:31,110
an explanation.

974
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:53,950
Miss Meng,

975
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,510
this is our newly brewed wine.

976
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,870
Have a taste.

977
00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:59,030
Thank you.

978
00:38:59,130 --> 00:38:59,790
You're welcome.

979
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:20,280
It seems that the secret technique that can turn a human into a demon

980
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,870
lies in the lip balm.

981
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,680
But how did it become?

982
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:28,970
How about

983
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,340
I try it myself?

984
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,110
I've learned

985
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,070
the switch between human and my demon form.

986
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,550
It should be fine.

987
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,670
Miss Chirp.

988
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,270
How is it?

989
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:02,310
I found it.

990
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,230
The lady who sells lip balm

991
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,000
lives in the Jizhong.

992
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:06,430
Jizhong?

993
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,830
Why does a girl

994
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:09,880
live in such a place?

995
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,170
It's a place that

996
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,870
sells funerals.

997
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,830
Because she

998
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,550
is not a person who sells cosmetics

999
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,720
but makes up the dead.

1000
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,420
What are the ingredients

1001
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,710
of her lip balm?

1002
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:40,950
Well...

1003
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,880
There must be something wrong with the lip balm.

1004
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:44,990
Let's go.

1005
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,970
Let's go and ask her.

1006
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:50,670
Give me

1007
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:51,700
a bowl of wine, too.

1008
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:54,110
Mr. Huo Xiao,

1009
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:54,890
next time,

1010
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,210
I'll treat you.

1011
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:57,830
Let's go.

1012
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:58,830
Take your sword.

1013
00:40:58,850 --> 00:40:59,590
You can't go back

1014
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,040
on your word.

1015
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,790
I'll keep my word.

1016
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,010
The soul will be back.

1017
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,520
The falling leaves return to their roots.

1018
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:18,650
The soul will be back.

1019
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,150
The falling leaves return to their roots.

1020
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,970
What is this?

1021
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:28,030
Many poor people who came to Changle City

1022
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:28,840
couldn't afford the cemetery.

1023
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,590
If they want to be buried in their hometown,

1024
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,620
they'll pay the travel fee

1025
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,270
and ask the corpse controllers

1026
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:34,550
to take them back to their hometown.

1027
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,720
The soul will be back.

1028
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:44,590
The falling leaves return to their roots.

1029
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,470
There is a man from Xizhou.

1030
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,910
That's the last way of life

1031
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,670
of a worker in Changle City.

1032
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:56,870
I don't know how much I need to pay

1033
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,820
when I return to Xizhou.

1034
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:00,630
With Nan here,

1035
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:02,110
you don't have to worry about money.

1036
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:03,790
Let's go.
