[The mortuary]

4
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,900
[The mortuary]

5
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,440
The Court of Judicature and Revision caught fire.

6
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,590
If the mortuary also caught fire

7
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,840
and Lord Pei's body was burned,

8
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:53,810
then the Puppet Worm would be nowhere to be found.

9
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:56,020
Then, I wouldn't be able to prove my innocence.

10
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:57,950
No matter what,

11
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,890
I must find Lord Pei's body.

12
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,630
Demon!

13
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,070
Could it be that the Scroll of Mountains and Seas have appeared in this world?

14
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,070
Heaven is on my side!

15
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:42,710
No,

16
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,190
I can't break such an advanced spell.

17
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,160
Who are you?

18
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,480
Why did you set fire to the Court of Judicature and Revision?

19
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,790
Did Lord Pei shoot hidden arrows at you?

20
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,070
Yes.

21
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,750
This is the wound from Lord Pei's hidden arrow.

22
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,730
He wanted to kill me.

23
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,350
I had no choice but to fight back with all my strength.

24
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,760
Ice arrow, a concealed weapon.

25
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:16,510
It turns to water when it hits the ground.

26
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,840
Agent Meng wasn't lying after all.

27
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,070
Hui Fang,

28
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,590
if I die,

29
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,230
please go out and testify for me.

30
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,930
This way, I can die with a clean name

31
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,480
and won't implicate Uncle Wu and Dan Qian.

32
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,500
Please!

33
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,680
Meng Xizhou?

34
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,590
How did you escape?

35
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,430
There's no door in this world

36
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,190
that we, the agents, can't open.

37
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,000
I…

38
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:16,860
Go, hurry!

39
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,680
The door has been sealed.

40
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:38,670
Hurry up!

41
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,110
What are you dawdling for?

42
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,580
I can't move anymore.

43
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,070
No, no,

44
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,670
Director Nan,

45
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,230
please save Lord Pei first.

46
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,670
Without Lord Pei's body,

47
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,150
I'll never be able to clear my name.

48
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,980
I would never wrongly accuse an innocent person.

49
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,030
But everything needs evidence, doesn't it?

50
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,830
Director Nan,

51
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:55,900
save him first.

52
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,670
If you don't take him out first,

53
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,600
I won't leave either.

54
00:04:59,070 --> 00:04:59,909
Wait for me here.

55
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,730
[Celestial Master's Mansion]

56
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,580
I've only been in seclusion for a few years,

57
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,630
but the demon-capturing formation in Changle City

58
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,450
has been so severely damaged.

59
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,350
The prestigious Celestial Master's Mansion

60
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,880
hasn't sent anyone to repair it!

61
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,190
The Changle City

62
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,670
has been free from demon troubles for many years.

63
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,430
There's no need to rush in terms of the repair of this formation.

64
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,550
Senior,

65
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,310
Is this what you meant when you said

66
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,230
Changle City has been free from demon troubles for many years?

67
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,310
Well…

68
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:41,530
Junior.

69
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,790
Junior, where are you going?

70
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,230
How did you get such strong inner power?

71
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,710
What's going on?

72
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,140
My inner power suddenly became so strong just now.

73
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,710
Don't breathe a word of

74
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,720
what you just saw to anyone.

75
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,500
Or I'll kill you.

76
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,050
Do you understand?

77
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,570
Don't worry.

78
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,080
I won't tell anyone.

79
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,070
Let's go.

80
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,590
Let's go.

81
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,270
I can't walk.

82
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:13,710
I'll carry you on my back.

83
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:36,909
Master.

84
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,980
A powerful demonic force came from nowhere.

85
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,070
It extinguished the fire at the Court of Judicature and Revision.

86
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,430
What about Pei Xun's body?

87
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,550
Has it been destroyed?

88
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,170
You useless fool!

89
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,490
Do you know

90
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,850
you've ruined our grand plan?

91
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,430
Insolent demon!

92
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,590
Surrender now!

93
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,490
You dare? You're seeking death!

94
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,320
I can't believe there's still

95
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,940
such a powerful demon in Changle City.

96
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,870
It should be pretty much healed now.

97
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,030
Get up and walk around.

98
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,310
Really?

99
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:44,750
I...

100
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,030
I'll try.

101
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,110
I'm really fine now.

102
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,000
You're truly a miracle doctor.

103
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,030
Don't be so lively and jumpy.

104
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,390
You might dislocate it again.

105
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,510
Brother,

106
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,510
you can even undo this kind of immobilization spell?

107
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,510
Let me tell you,

108
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,190
Director Nan knows a lot…

109
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,590
What exactly happened just now?

110
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,150
Brother,

111
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,080
Agent Meng was right.

112
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:41,990
Pei's corpse...

113
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:42,929
There's something wrong with it.

114
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:44,350
You see, Director Nan,

115
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,450
I wasn't lying, was I?

116
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:46,870
Go on.

117
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,030
Pei's corpse was unusually hard.

118
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,490
Ordinary knives couldn't cut through it at all.

119
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,840
I tried all night but couldn't do it.

120
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,630
Then,

121
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,550
a person in black suddenly appeared in the mortuary.

122
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,430
He cast a spell to immobilize me.

123
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,280
Then, there was a fire.

124
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,980
If Agent Meng hadn't saved me,

125
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,060
I guess

126
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,600
I would've been burned to charcoal

127
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,970
along with Pei.

128
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,270
The body couldn't be cut open?

129
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:14,740
Yes.

130
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,510
If people are possessed by Puppet Worms,

131
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,580
their flesh will be hardened like steel.

132
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,230
Ordinary knives can hardly cut through it.

133
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,950
You must follow the skin texture

134
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,270
to find a weak spot.

135
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,390
Can you do it?

136
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,110
Yes.

137
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,030
Meng Xizhou.

138
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,510
I don't dare.

139
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,810
Hui Fang, you do it.

140
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,250
I'll help you locate the Puppet Worm.

141
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:43,910
I...

142
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,030
Yes.

143
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,590
Okay.

144
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,350
The pupils can be opened again.

145
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:03,710
It's right here.

146
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,030
There's a worm here.

147
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:20,940
Really.

148
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,800
There really is a worm!

149
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,160
It's so tiny.

150
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,370
Don't be fooled by its small size.

151
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,150
After it enters the human body,

152
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,390
it will quickly kill the host,

153
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,460
grows countless tentacles all over the body,

154
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,780
and then controls the body.

155
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,610
However, the host's behavior

156
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,110
is indistinguishable from a normal person.

157
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,840
It's absolutely terrifying.

158
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,990
Agent Meng, you…

159
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,310
can really catch demons, huh?

160
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,190
I…

161
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,600
I…

162
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,070
Agent Meng, you're indeed an expert.

163
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,790
You kept your skills hidden.

164
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:08,710
That's right.

165
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:09,810
I…

166
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,610
know a little.

167
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,700
Just a thing or two.

168
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:17,740
It seems tonight

169
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,030
these people

170
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,710
are really here to destroy evidence.

171
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,460
[Celestial Master's Mansion]

172
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:22,610
Yuelian,

173
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,530
how's it going?

174
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,030
Are there any traces of demons at the Court of Judicature and Revision?

175
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,060
No wonder you made an agreement with that useless agent earlier

176
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,210
about capturing demons in the mansion.

177
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,950
So, you've known all along that there were demons in Changle City.

178
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,510
Those minor demons

179
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,880
don't amount to much.

180
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,190
That's good enough.

181
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,350
Besides,

182
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,160
they haven't done anything

183
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,070
particularly harmful to us humans.

184
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,480
There's no need to exterminate them completely.

185
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,110
Good enough?

186
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,630
No need?

187
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,030
Do you live up to

188
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,270
your title as the lord of the Celestial Master's Mansion?

189
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,220
Yuelian...

190
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:48,870
Du Fenglei,

191
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,050
I really don't know

192
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,930
how you've become like this.

193
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,790
Director Nan.

194
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:56,870
Since I've already proven my innocence,

195
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,030
can I go home?

196
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,030
My father and sister are waiting for me at home.

197
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,670
You're involved in a murder case.

198
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,560
I've sent someone to notify your family.

199
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:04,860
Don't worry.

200
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,030
Well,

201
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,800
you can't just keep me here, can you?

202
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,070
I still have some doubts

203
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,110
that need to be verified.

204
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,440
What doubts?

205
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:44,950
This is…

206
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,460
Indeed.

207
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,030
Every time I'm about ten meters away from you,

208
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,120
as soon as I cast a spell,

209
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,870
I'm drawn to your side.

210
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,150
Yes,

211
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,670
that's right.

212
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,050
Just now, at the fire scene,

213
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,470
you suddenly appeared like this.

214
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,390
And last night, when Chief Minister Pei died…

215
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:00,390
And also

216
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,390
when we first met

217
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,510
at the haunted house,

218
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,470
you were always…

219
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,230
So,

220
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,990
this is how you've been

221
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,190
drawn to me.

222
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,140
But…

223
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,120
what's the reason?

224
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,870
Give me your hand.

225
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,390
Well...

226
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,550
everyone's watching.

227
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,000
It's not appropriate, is it?

228
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,230
Well,

229
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,500
there's something

230
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,830
I need to say upfront.

231
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,790
Well,

232
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,990
I do think you're impressive

233
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:53,750
and…

234
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,560
attractive too,

235
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,030
however,

236
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,220
I have a psychological flaw.

237
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,430
Over the years,

238
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,340
I've admired quite a few men,

239
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,230
but as soon as they

240
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,390
showed any feelings for me,

241
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,220
I'd lose interest,

242
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,320
even feel disgusted.

243
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,710
Chirp.

244
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,740
I really like you.

245
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,190
Good-bye.

246
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,730
Don't ask me out again in the future.

247
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:50,990
Chirp.

248
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,230
Chirp.

249
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,260
Chirp!

250
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,480
Chirp.

251
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,270
It's been a long time.

252
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,780
I've always wanted to tell you

253
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,360
that I really like you.

254
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,790
Zhang,

255
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,370
I lack the metal element in my life.

256
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,110
I only want to get rich quickly.

257
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:27,960
In the future,

258
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,670
please don't come looking for me again.

259
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,090
Chirp!

260
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,450
So,

261
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,880
if you want to keep me as a friend,

262
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,670
you should be cautious

263
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,820
about confessing your love to me.

264
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,360
I'm not interested in knowing about your affairs.

265
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,570
I'm taking your pulse.

266
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,920
Then, just pretend

267
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,480
you didn't hear anything.

268
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,310
Turn around.

269
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,440
Well,

270
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,970
I'm actually fine.

271
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,700
What's wrong?

272
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,310
Your Qi Core

273
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,630
has an innate flaw.

274
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,610
No wonder! No matter how hard I practiced,

275
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,110
I could never get it right.

276
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,690
But every time I'm near you,

277
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,830
your cultivation improves greatly,

278
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,710
and you can activate your Demon-Recognizing Pupils.

279
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:47,990
Yes,

280
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,150
that's right.

281
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:49,990
So,

282
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,710
what's the reason for that?

283
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:53,980
I'm not sure of the reason either,

284
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,230
but as long as I'm close to you,

285
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,020
I can compensate for the flaw in your Qi Core.

286
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,710
That's great!

287
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,950
After years of fruitless cultivation,

288
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,180
now,

289
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:20,700
I've finally found the cure.

290
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,990
Let's never be apart from now on.

291
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:23,640
You...

292
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,510
I didn't mean anything else by that.

293
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,270
I just wanted to ask you

294
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,480
if you'd take me as your disciple.

295
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,780
My dream of becoming a demon hunter for years

296
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,430
finally has a glimmer of hope.

297
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,150
Well,

298
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:35,860
you...

299
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,360
just teach me a trick or two, that's all.

300
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,630
I'm open to paying per lesson.

301
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,070
That's absolutely preposterous!

302
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:43,660
Let me tell you,

303
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,910
if you dare tell anyone about my talisman skills,

304
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,970
do you believe I'll twist your head off?

305
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:06,950
What about you?

306
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,000
Do you want me to keep your secret?

307
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,470
Are you threatening me?

308
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,080
I wouldn't dare.

309
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,150
I just

310
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,070
want to learn some

311
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,330
talismans, formations, and incantations from you.

312
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,530
It's up to you how you teach me.

313
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,910
You're not selling haunted houses anymore?

314
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:21,550
I think

315
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,910
with your help, getting into the Celestial Master's Mansion

316
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,270
would be a piece of cake.

317
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,210
Moreover,

318
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,220
mentally,

319
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,460
I'm ready to leave this life behind and work for the government.

320
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,600
So, if you help me achieve it,

321
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,040
I'll keep your secret.

322
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,070
How about it?

323
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,470
How dare you bargain with me!

324
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,590
Do you know?

325
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:44,960
Even though you've proven

326
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,460
there was a Puppet Worm in Chief Minister Pei's body,

327
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,780
you're still a suspect in this case.

328
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,230
Just for escaping from jail out of fear of punishment,

329
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,480
according to criminal law, you should be exiled.

330
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,660
Exiled?

331
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,550
Director Nan.

332
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,270
It's a misunderstanding. Misunderstanding!

333
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,430
That's because the Court of Judicature and Revision was on fire.

334
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,160
I ran out

335
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,490
because I wanted to put out the fire.

336
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,470
I'll be going now.

337
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,220
Stop!

338
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,750
You helped me solve the Puppet Worm case,

339
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,270
so I'll make sure to restore your innocence and freedom.

340
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,120
Innocence…

341
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,920
Yes, I want my innocence to be restored.

342
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:20,850
But as for freedom,

343
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:21,700
I don't want it anymore.

344
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,160
I just want to learn from you.

345
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:23,970
Get out of the way!

346
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,140
Stop wasting time with idle talk.

347
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:34,550
I...

348
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,470
How can I assist you?

349
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,780
The primary task now

350
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,510
is to investigate the connection between the Cat Demon Puppet Spirit

351
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,170
and Situ Hanshan.

352
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,000
[Zhao Qingbai, Vice Minister of Justice]

353
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,030
Sir,

354
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,580
these Puppet Worm can't adapt to the climate of Dazhou.

355
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,580
I'm afraid they won't survive tonight.

356
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,110
It seems

357
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,630
my Puppet Worms can hold on until tonight.

358
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:09,820
Master,

359
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:10,790
we've found her.

360
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,200
That kite girl

361
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,510
is indeed from the Celestial Master's Mansion.

362
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,110
She's just finished her secluded training.

363
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,710
She's Du Yuelian, a third-rank demon hunter.

364
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,320
So, has the Celestial Master's Mansion discovered us?

365
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,950
In my opinion, not likely.

366
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,110
You mean…

367
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,430
I have an informant in the Celestial Master's Mansion.

368
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,220
This demon-capturing formation has been damaged for years.

369
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:28,590
Right Chancellor,

370
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,870
you and we have been in Changle City for years.

371
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,790
The people from the Celestial Master's Mansion

372
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,630
haven't found a single clue.

373
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,400
This damaged demon-capturing formation suddenly reacted.

374
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,910
It must be due to the extremely strong demonic power

375
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,710
that distinguished the devastating fire in the mortuary of the Court of Judicature and Revision last night.

376
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,790
Could it be Nan Fengyi, Director of the Court of Judicature and Revision, the one who suddenly fought with me

377
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,190
and fell into the mortuary last night?

378
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,530
Could Nan Fengyi be one of our kind?

379
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:49,870
There's another person

380
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:50,710
who's also suspicious.

381
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:51,430
Who?

382
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,030
The suspect in Pei Xun's case.

383
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,480
Overnight,

384
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,110
she became a witness for the case.

385
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,070
She claims

386
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,820
to be able to identify and kill Puppet Spirits.

387
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,000
She's definitely not an ordinary agent.

388
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:01,960
At present,

389
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,920
it's unclear whether these two are our friends or foes.

390
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,920
It seems that before tonight's operation,

391
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,630
we need to restrain them first.

392
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,970
If that terrifying power comes from these two,

393
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,010
their strength is not to be underestimated.

394
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,140
Forcibly capturing them might be risky.

395
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:14,610
I have a plan.

396
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,360
[Court of Judicature and Revision]

397
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,750
Director Nan has given instructions.

398
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,120
What else would you like to eat?

399
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,560
Let me know before your execution tomorrow.

400
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:25,870
I heard

401
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,630
you're the murderer behind the Zhuque Street massacre,

402
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,910
the wealthy heir who wiped out

403
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,840
an entire family with your bare hands.

404
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,630
Your story

405
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,390
must be quite extraordinary, right?

406
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,310
Oh, right,

407
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,630
in your family,

408
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,000
wasn't there a big black cat?

409
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:52,150
It's such a pity about that big black cat.

410
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,310
What did you do to Hua?

411
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,630
I didn't do anything to it.

412
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,550
I just happened to

413
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,920
see it at your family's house.

414
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,040
You've been to my house?

415
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:00,970
Yes,

416
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,440
I'm just an agent.

417
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,910
I specialize in selling houses where murders occur.

418
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,990
You sold my house?

419
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,420
I just earn a commission, that's all.

420
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,560
Most of the money

421
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,950
goes to the metropolitan prefecture.

422
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,350
The house is gone.

423
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,150
Where will Hua live now?

424
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:14,780
Where will Hua live?

425
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,440
It…

426
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,630
It wanders around,

427
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,280
eating from different households.

428
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,630
Look,

429
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,840
is this yours?

430
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:35,890
I saw Hua

431
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,910
wandering around the mansion all the time.

432
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,470
Is it

433
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,280
waiting for you to come home?

434
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,540
I'm sorry.

435
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,390
I can't go back anymore.

436
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,380
I mean, come on,

437
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,630
you killed your own father and mother with your own hands,

438
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,110
and now you have to pay with your life.

439
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,190
What do you know?

440
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,580
But they were your family.

441
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,030
Don't you have any regrets at all?

442
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,070
Family?

443
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,350
Those beasts

444
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,150
don't deserve to be my family.

445
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,450
Beasts?

446
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,330
Sikong Pei and that wretched woman

447
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,790
were originally servants in my household.

448
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,310
They had an affair and poisoned my birth mother to death,

449
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,310
then impersonated my parents

450
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,780
to come to Changle City.

451
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:23,910
Heaven has eyes.

452
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,860
They couldn't have children,

453
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,910
and I was young,

454
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,300
pretending to be ignorant.

455
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,910
That's how I managed to survive all these years.

456
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,880
So, that's how it was.

457
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,710
Your life is so miserable.

458
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,110
Have you thought about

459
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,910
finding a good home for Hua?

460
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,520
I see it's been lonely in the house,

461
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,040
which must be quite distressing.

462
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,110
Show this to it,

463
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,340
and it will go with you.

464
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:08,710
Go with me?

465
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:09,700
I can't do that.

466
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,040
I can barely take care of myself.

467
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,040
I have another house

468
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:12,900
in the West Market.

469
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,240
If you take good care of it,

470
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,550
I'll give you the house.

471
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,750
You have another house in the West Market?

472
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:20,980
Do you have the deed?

473
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:21,790
-Yes.
-Meng Xizhou.

474
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,000
What are you doing?

475
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:27,280
Sikong She,

476
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,150
stop telling your story to others.

477
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,860
Your parents were indeed pitiful.

478
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,660
But what about the maids and servants in your household?

479
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,110
What wrong have they done?

480
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,450
In the face of evil,

481
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,630
they remained indifferent.

482
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:38,950
-Let's go.
-Wasn't that a crime?

483
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:40,630
I beg you.

484
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,950
I beg you to take care of Hua.

485
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:42,820
It's innocent.

486
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,380
The Puppet Spirit of Situ's Mansion

487
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,200
didn't kill a foolish human like you

488
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:21,910
after all.

489
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,440
What rotten luck!

490
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,050
Puppet Spirit of Situ's Mansion?

491
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,060
You…

492
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,990
Have you seen Lord Pei?

493
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:29,830
So, it's true.

494
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,450
This cat was at the scene that night.

495
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,310
Hua.

496
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,400
You…

497
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:36,920
What did you call me?

498
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,310
Your master, Sikong She, will be executed tomorrow.

499
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,550
He asked me

500
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,010
to bring this to you.

501
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,690
Since you are a demon,

502
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,760
you should know

503
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,100
about the Puppet Spirit incident at the Situ's Mansion.

504
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,920
If you want to see Sikong She one last time,

505
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,910
tell us what you know.

506
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,190
So, you're using this as a condition.

507
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:06,920
No, no,

508
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,310
I sincerely

509
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,790
came to deliver a message for Sikong She.

510
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,160
Director Nan, he…

511
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,500
he's also doing this for his friend.

512
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:14,600
You know,

513
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,770
that dead Puppet Spirit

514
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,360
was his best friend.

515
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,350
What does it have to do with me?

516
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:22,230
It would be best if demons ruled this world

517
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,880
so that you so-called noble humans

518
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,350
can experience the wretched taste of surviving in disgrace.

519
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,500
Both humans and demons are living beings.

520
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,430
I don't think spirits are inferior to humans.

521
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,290
Besides, in Sikong She's eyes,

522
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,690
you're not just an ordinary cat.

523
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,550
Instead, you are his only family

524
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,470
in this world.

525
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,160
What's the use of saying all this?

526
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,480
That old scoundrel Situ has been planning

527
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,130
to replace officials with Puppet Spirits for a long time.

528
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,390
A few days ago,

529
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,650
there were almost a hundred Puppet Worms he smuggled

530
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,320
into the mansion from Dongzhou.

531
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:56,470
What did it say?

532
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,110
Give up.

533
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,630
You're no match for him.

534
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,880
It said Situ has prepared a hundred Puppet Worms,

535
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,150
planning to replace a hundred officials.

536
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,860
How many people has Situ Hanshan replaced?

537
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,180
I will never be a traitor to the demon race.

538
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,840
We're not asking you to be a traitor.

539
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,800
If it weren't for the bit of human loyalty in you,

540
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,080
I would've long dealt with you, you wretched creature.

541
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,110
Director Nan, stop resorting to torture so easily.

542
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,360
Let's talk this through calmly.

543
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:21,730
Let's talk it out.

544
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,070
Besides the replaced Puppet Spirits,

545
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,520
how many more monsters like you are there?

546
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,940
Don't even think about getting that information out of me!

547
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:28,810
You,

548
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,070
Situ Hanshan,

549
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,310
what connection do you have

550
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,310
with the long-lost Scroll of Mountains and Seas?

551
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,230
Scroll of Mountains and Seas?

552
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,400
Where exactly is the Scroll of Mountains and Seas?

553
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,710
He's looking for the Scroll of Mountains and Seas?

554
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,910
Or I'll kill you right now!

555
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,600
Hua, Hua!

556
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:39,550
The Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

557
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,790
Do you know where the Scroll of Mountains and Seas is?

558
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:41,450
Dream on!

559
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:42,430
Tell him,

560
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,330
I'll never tell, even if he kills me!

561
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:45,310
What did it say?

562
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:46,430
It said…

563
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:49,730
Hua,

564
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,440
let's talk this through.

565
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,250
Don't you want to see Sikong She?

566
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,840
He... he is Director Nan.

567
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,020
Director Nan from the Court of Judicature and Revision.

568
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,210
My master has bid me farewell with a letter written in blood.

569
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,200
After his death,

570
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,250
I will have no compassion left for your human race!

571
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:02,870
No…

572
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,820
Foolish humans!

573
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,360
Instead of living on alone…

574
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,390
Hua!

575
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,790
I'd rather follow Master

576
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,860
on the path to the underworld

577
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,830
and keep each other company.

578
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,600
You killed it.

579
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,310
A demon is still a demon.

580
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,700
What's the point of talking about benevolence and righteousness with it?

581
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,110
That's because

582
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,070
you didn't have a heartfelt conversation with it.

583
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,200
So what?

584
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:34,850
If I don't kill it,

585
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,670
it will kill you.

586
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,450
Do you expect it to behave

587
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,350
and be a house cat

588
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,400
after Sikong She dies?

589
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,150
It didn't reveal the whereabouts of the Scroll of Mountains and Seas,

590
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:45,950
but that's fine.

591
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,700
Anyway, we've already obtained

592
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,010
more clues about the Puppet Spirit.

593
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,190
I'll be going now.

594
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:05,800
What are you doing here?

595
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,270
Didn't we agree?

596
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,010
As long as I help you find the cat demon

597
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,960
and some lead,

598
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,630
you'll help me become a witness in the Puppet Spirit case, right?

599
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,430
Now, I'm giving you your freedom.

600
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,750
Why aren't you leaving?

601
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,020
I had an agreement with the Celestial Master's Mansion.

602
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,710
As long as I catch one demon,

603
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,000
I can gain special entry.

604
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,710
Do you really

605
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,430
want to be a demon hunter?

606
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,920
I've always wanted to.

607
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,030
It's just that

608
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:39,790
I lack the talent.

609
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,270
That's perfect, then.

610
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:42,850
If you take this cat demon over,

611
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,470
wouldn't you get into the Celestial Master's Mansion right away?

612
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:45,910
First, this demon

613
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,320
wasn't killed by me.

614
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:48,620
Second,

615
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,720
I've changed my mind.

616
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,870
I don't want Hua, who was so loyal,

617
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,040
to become my stepping stone to enter the Celestial Master's Mansion.

618
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,090
Don't you think it's contradictory?

619
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,130
You want to be a demon hunter,

620
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,130
yet you sympathize with demons.

621
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,020
Then, what's the meaning

622
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,920
of your persistence in becoming a demon hunter?

623
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,610
Because I am Li Shiyi's daughter.

624
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,000
I want to become someone like my father.

625
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,020
So, it's here.

626
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:24,630
What's this?

627
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,510
This is my agreement with Sikong She.

628
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,440
Isn't this what Sikong She mentioned,

629
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,270
the deed to the house in the West Market?

630
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,320
Sikong She has another house?

631
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,710
I...

632
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,870
This is what we agreed on.

633
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,130
If I helped him settle Hua,

634
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,620
he would give me this house.

635
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,670
Hua is dead,

636
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,000
and you still want the house?

637
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:47,400
You're the one who caused its death.

638
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:48,700
Besides,

639
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,150
why should I give it to you?

640
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:50,950
What if...

641
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,660
What if you embezzle it?

642
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:54,840
Meng Xizhou,

643
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,710
as a professional agent,

644
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,340
you should know that

645
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,870
an oral gift of a house or property

646
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,190
is essentially ineffective

647
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,460
without proper deeds.

648
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,590
Even if I wanted to embezzle it, I couldn't.

649
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:05,910
Give it to me.

650
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:07,990
No.

651
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,470
Don't you even have

652
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,000
the most basic trust between people in me?

653
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,240
No.

654
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:25,810
If you keep hiding like this,

655
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,710
I'll have to take action.

656
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,330
I…

657
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,710
What are you doing?

658
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:37,750
You're shameless and despicable!

659
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:38,590
Have you no shame?

660
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,510
I want the house!

661
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:40,770
Today,

662
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,710
I'll let you go home first.

663
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,430
Be ready to await the summons of the Court of Judicature and Revision.

664
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,070
Go home now!

665
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:53,510
Hua.

666
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,030
Rest in peace.

667
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:56,650
In your next life,

668
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:59,310
just be an ordinary house cat.

669
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,470
Wasn't the demons put into

670
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,420
the Scroll of Mountains and Seas by Baize Gong and my father?

671
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,190
Could it be that the Scroll of Mountains and Seas

672
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,170
has really reappeared in the world?
