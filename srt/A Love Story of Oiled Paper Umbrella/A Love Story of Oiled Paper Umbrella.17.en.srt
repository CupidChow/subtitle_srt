00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,190
Hello?

[Maroon lip balm]

00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:50,750
Chirp.

6
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,000
That's a lot of lip balm and powder for dead people.

7
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:03,660
Don't touch it.

8
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,670
Aren't you afraid it's poisoned and you'll turn into a demon?

9
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:07,670
Right.

10
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,150
Yeah.

11
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,560
This is the place where they make

12
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,670
maroon lip balm.

13
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:34,950
Look.

14
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,550
For someone who puts makeup on the dead,

15
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,670
she has too many tools for digging graves.

16
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,430
Who's there?

17
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,020
Can I help you?

18
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,550
We're here to buy...

19
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,650
Maroon lip balm.

20
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,030
That thing?

21
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,780
I don't sell it anymore.

22
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:00,230
Such a shame.

23
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,830
You have no idea.

24
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,550
The lip balm you sold,

25
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,790
the color was stunning.

26
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,990
I bought a jar

27
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,170
on Winter Festival.

28
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,670
I applied it every day.

29
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,350
Used it up really fast.

30
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,390
It's only been a few days.

31
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,470
You've already used it up?

32
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:16,829
Yeah.

33
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,829
My lips get dry easily.

I'd like…

36

Wait here.

38
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,130
I'll go get them for you.

Huo Xiao.

40
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:17,950
Don't mind me

41
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:18,950
Chirp.

42
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,030
I'm injured.

43
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,790
Gotta go.

44
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:43,040
Oh, Meng Xizhou.

45
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,920
Let's see how innocent the sea demon…

46
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,390
Well…

47
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:47,170
-you're trying to protect is.
-Let's die together.

48

Talk to me.

63
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:58,860
I will capture all the sea demons

64
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,750
to avenge Huo Xiao's death.

65

66
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:04,990
what are you doing here?

Master.

73
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,390
Why did this happen?

74
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,950
If little paperman

75
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,170
didn't show me your position,

76
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:48,920
last night,

77
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,390
you would have been dead. You know that?

78
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,310
But Master,

79
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,790
we got a new lead.

80
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,420
And, the maroon lip balm has something

81
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,940
to do with why they turned into demons.

82
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,550
Do you still think these sea demons

83
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,370
are innocent?

84
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,650
Last night, the sea demon

85
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,350
you think is innocent

86
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,000

87
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,870
One of them

88
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,150

-I’m sorry.
-Nan Fengyi.

disappeared from the palace.

95
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,120
The palace is heavily guarded.

96
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,440
Her Majesty couldn't have just vanished.

97
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,430
His Highness is worried

98
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,090
it might have something to do with the sea demons.

99
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,270
He wants us there now.

have you been crying?

104
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,840
Your eyes are red.

105
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:17,830
Did Nan Fengyi

106
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:18,510
bully you?

107
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,310
No.

108
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:21,730
It has nothing to do with him.

109
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,070
Okay.

110
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,200
How's

111
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,110
the investigation going?

112
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,890
Did the Court of Judicature and Revision give you a hard time?

113
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:28,950
Your Highness,

114
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,550
we should

115
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,950
focus on finding Her Majesty.

116
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:33,470
Alright.

117
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,190
Come in.

118
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,230
After His Highness left,

119
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,919
Her Majesty said she needed a nap.

120
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,669
But at lunchtime,

121
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,630
I found Her Majesty wasn't in her room.

122
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,330
We searched the whole palace,

123
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,990
but couldn't find her.

124
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,490
Let's search carefully again.

125
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,040
Should find some clues.

126
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:21,470
Your Highness,

127
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,790
may I ask what this is?

128
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,790
It's imperial beeswax.

129
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:26,710
It's

130
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,670
Xizhou's tribute to Her Majesty.

131
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,830
Smells familiar.

132
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,030
What's special about it?

133
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,070
It produces purple smoke

134
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,830
when it meets Lu Wine,

135
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,910
giving people wonderful hallucinations.

136
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,440
It produces purple smoke when it meets Lu Wine.

137
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,430
Is there any Lu Wine in the palace?

138
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,230
Yes.

139
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,650
Her Majesty loves it.

140
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:00,870
Goddess,

141
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,920
you found

142
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,470
a lead, didn't you?

143
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,030
Yes.

144
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,950
Huo Xiao and I

145
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,070
stumbled on it back in the pub.

146
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,150
Now is the time to verify it.

147
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,580
In the sea demons case,

148
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,630
we found the same Xizhou product

149
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,230
called maroon lip balm in all the missing people's homes.

150
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,470
It was made at home by Jiaoniang,

151
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,770
who sells funeral supplies.

152
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,600
The special part of it is that

153
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,440
it also produces purple smoke when it meets Lu Wine.

154
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,590
You mean,

155
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,240
Her Majesty's imperial beeswax

156
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,590
is most likely the raw material for the maroon lip balm.

157
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,370
No, no.

158
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,000
Imperial beeswax

159
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,200
is Xizhou's

160
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,860
exclusive tribute to Her Majesty.

161
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,110
Even I didn't get any.

162
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,020
How could it end up in the hands of some civilian?

163
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,390
Unless...

164
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,030
Her Majesty is connected with Jiaoniang.

165
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,710
Her Majesty hardly leaves the imperial harem

166
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,720
how could she possibly be connected with someone like her?

167
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,180
Can anyone recognize Her Majesty's handwriting?

168
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,350
These are all Her Majesty's paintings.

169
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:20,700
She taught me

170
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,710
how to paint.

171
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,940
The mermaid princess's tribe got tragically wiped out.

172
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,110
She left the sea

173
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,030
and married a human.

174
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,150
What is this?

175
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:31,660
I know.

176
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,470
The play performed by Tianji Troupe

177
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,030
on the night of Winter Festival.

178
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:35,830
That day,

179
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,710
I happened to be on duty beside Her Majesty and His Majesty.

180
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,230
I heard her tell this story.

181
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,230
That's right.

182
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,110
Jiaoniang

183
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,620
was selling the marron lip balm

184
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,780
on the night of the performance.

185
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:45,630
And,

186
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,970
the plays performed by the troupe

187
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,240
were all written by Her Majesty.

188
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:49,830
In that case,

189
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,200
there must be some kind of connection

190
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,420
between Her Majesty and Jiaoniang.

191
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,130
I understand now.

192
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,710
You mean

193
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,910
Jiaoniang has kidnapped Her Majesty.

194
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,320
No,

195
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,270
I mean…

196
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,210
I've dealt with that Jiaoniang before.

197
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,690
She can control sea demons.

198
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,310
And,

199
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,670
she killed Huo Xiao.

200
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,390
It's possible she kidnapped Her Majesty.

201
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,610
Check the courtyard.

202
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,600
Why didn't you let me

203
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,590
tell him there's something wrong with the Empress?

204
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,350
We're in the palace.

205
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,170
Be careful what you say.

206
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,000
Look.

207
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,090
There are some broken twigs

208
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,590
and a red thread.

209
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,120
This must be where Her Majesty

210
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:33,990
was taken.

211
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,450
This red thread belongs to Jiaoniang.

212
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:37,990
How many Jizhong cereteries are there

213
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:38,720
in the western city?

214
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,750
Only one.

215
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,230
There was fresh soil

216
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,270
on Jiaoniang's shoes.

217
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,870
Grave-digging tools in her house.

218
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,110
Her Majesty should be

219
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,120
in the Jizhong Cemetery.

220
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,670
Hurry.

221
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,950
We have to go there now.

222
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:55,560
Wait.

223
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,060
It's a ceretery.

224
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,660
If we go straight there like this,

225
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,700
we'll alert her.

226
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,310
Then how should we go?

227
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,310
I have an idea.

228
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,210
Honey,

229
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,380
how am I

230
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,420
supposed to live without you?

231
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,390
Honey!

232
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,150
Look.

233
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,110
Anything unusual?

234
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:19,510
Yeah.

235
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,680
That's not a wedding procession.

236
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,350
Watch for a second.

237
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,670
Well,

238
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,790
do they have to

239
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,990
choose a road that passes the cemetery?

240
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,930
It's bad luck.

241
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,160
That's weird.

242
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,320
Du Yuelian.

243
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:08,990
Du Yuelian.

244
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,750
Wake up!

245
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:13,670
Master Bai.

246
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,230
Master Bai.

247
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,030
Master Liang.

248
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,110
Master Liang.

249
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,510
What's going on?

250
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,300
There's something wrong with this red mist.

251
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,100
Black magic spell.

252
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,560
Why didn't it

253
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,270
work on me?

254
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,990
Because you're a demon.

255
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,710
Right.

256
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:38,550
So, how do we

257
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,830
break this spell?

258
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:41,910
There isn't a good idea.

259
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,190
But there's an offensive one.

260
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,390
What is it?

261
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:48,830
Go.

262
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,330
Wake up!

263
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,380
Wake up!

264
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,160
Wake up!

265
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,840
Do it the hard way.

266
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,910
It is offensive.

267
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,620
This wedding procession is wrong.

268
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,840
Let's follow them and see what happens.

269
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,510
Okay.

270
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:06,830
Where did they go?

271
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,110
Your Majesty.

272
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,110
Here you are!

273
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:34,780
Your Majesty.

274
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,020
Where were they taking you?

275
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,310
They wanted me to die and have a ghost marriage

276
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,080
with Situ Hanshan.

277
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,390
Is

278
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,570
this Situ Hanshan's tomb?

279
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,070
Yes.

280
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:44,830
Chirp.

281
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,360
Protect Her Majesty.

282
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,770
I'll go scout around.

283
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:48,750
Okay.

284
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:50,870
Here.

285
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:00,380
Your Majesty

286
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,180
Stay inside.

287
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,180
Don't come out.

288
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:02,830
Okay.

289
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,650
It's poisonous.

290
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,940
You fools.

291
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,940
You've fallen into my trap.

292
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,740
You ruined my master's wedding.

293
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,630
You're not going anywhere.

294
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,870
So,

295
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,830
Situ Hanshan was your master.

296
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,310
I'll kill you today.

297
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:34,910
Don't!

298
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,710
These red spider lilies emit poisonous miasma.

299
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:38,860
Even touching them

300
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,190
will lead to death by poisoning.

301
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,990
What should we do now?

302
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,350
There's poison gas all around.

303
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,750
How do we get out?

304
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,060
No one's coming to save you today.

305
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:49,950
I'll

306
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,300
have you two buried with my master.

307
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:06,950
I feel dizzy.

308
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:26,660
Nan,

309
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,349
the red spider lilies are poisonous.

310
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,430
Back off.

311
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,310
Master.

312
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,320
Huo Ting.

313
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,990
Huo Ting.

314
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:42,550
Huo Ting.

315
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,370
Meng Xizhou.

316
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,670
The sea demon would never have escaped

317
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,280
if you hadn't stood in the way.

318
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:01,740
I'm sorry.

319
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,720
I'm sorry.

320
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,190
I'll stop my investigation.

321
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,380
I'll stop.

322
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,510
Sorry is not enough.

323
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,530
Sorry is not enough.

324
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,830
Sea demons are evil.

325
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,790
I…

326
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:12,470
Evil.

327
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,060
Hate…

328
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:14,630
You.

329
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,200
No!

330
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,380
You are a human.

331
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,750
Why are you working for the demons?

332
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,600
Humans wouldn't help me,

333
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,990
but demons did.

334
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,990
It's simple.

335
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,740
I've heard people in the Celestial Master's Mansion are so powerful

336
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,270
that you can bring people back from the dead.

337
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,830
Please, save my brother.

338
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,710
Although I can't bring your brother back to life,

339
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,280
I can teach you magic

340
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,590
to protect all humans.

341
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,470
Since you have no parents,

342
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,030
are you willing

343
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,180
to follow me to the Celestial Master's Mansion

344
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,110
and practice magic?

345
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,570
Being abandoned

346
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,590
must be hard.

347
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,270
Who are you?

348
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,410
Someone who will help you.

349
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,950
Help me?

350
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,390
Why?

351
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,590
You are a powerful demon hunter.

352
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,550
You have powerful magic

353
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,430
and affection.

354
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,950
Du Fenglei didn't understand,

355
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,930
but I do.

356
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,780
Because we both lost our loved ones.

357
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,450
I can help you master puppet magic.

358
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:08,980
This way,

359
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,680
your brother can become a puppet

360
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,710
and stay with you forever.

361
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,630
Sister.

362
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,150
Sister.

363
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,950
Are you be willing

364
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,470
to follow me?

365
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,830
Sister.

366
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,230
Brother.

367
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,420
Brother.

368
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,340
I swear to follow you.

369
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,720
You killed innocent people for your own obsession.

370
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,470
You deserve to die.

371
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:07,870
Sister.

372
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:08,590
Sister.

373
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:09,630
Brother.

374
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,310
Brother!

375
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,440
I'm coming to you now.

376
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,890
Huo Ting.

377
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:21,970
Greetings, Your Majesty.

378
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,310
Please forgive me.

379
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:24,550
You're here now.

380
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,390
You're here now.

381
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,520
That is Situ Hanshan's cenotaph.

382
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,660
Why is there a golden light flickering?

383
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,870
I'll go check it out.

384
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:42,350
Okay.

385
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,520
The Qi Sword is having such a strong reaction.

386
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,200
Has it sensed the Scroll of Mountains and Seas?

387
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,190
Your Majesty.

388
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,280
Here's the Scroll.

389
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,310
Excellent.

390
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,710
Lord Du,

391
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,230
you have rendered outstanding service.

392
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,640
Mr. Ren Guang,

393
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,200
you saw

394
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:30,710
what just happened.

395
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:32,790
Yes.

396
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,180
You've worked so hard helping humans investigate cases,

397
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,630
yet they hated you till the end of their life.

398
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:40,310
I thought

399
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:41,950
at least Nan Fengyi

400
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,070
would stand by you.

401
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,710
It's my fault.

402
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,240
If I hadn't stood in the way,

403
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,790
all the sea demons

404
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,900
would have been caught.

405
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,550
Huo Xiao,

406
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,640
Huo Ting,

407
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,190
and those civilians

408
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,830
wouldn't have been killed in vain.

409
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,050
It's not your fault.

410
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,240
The world

411
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,990
can't see the truth.

412
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,750
I'll stop my investigation.

413
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,590
I'll stop.

414
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,630
No matter what the truth is,

415
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,240
I don't want to look into it anymore.

416
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,750
They can do whatever they want

417
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,430
to those sea demons.

418
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:38,050
Chirp,

419
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,190
don't give up.

420
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,410
There's another batch

421
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:49,910
of sea demons under the Demon Locking Pagoda.

422
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,830
Maybe the person

423
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,420
you care about the most is in there.

424
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,850
The person I care about the most?

425
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,110
What do you mean?

426
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,640
Chirp.

427
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,110
Uncle Wu.

428
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:18,880
Chirp.

429
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,350
Chirp.

430
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,660
You got poisoned by the red spider lilies.

431
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,580
The Celestial Master's Mansion has cured you.

432
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:33,760
Where's Nan Fengyi?

433
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,710
Where is he?

434
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,150
He went to the Celestial Master's Mansion.

435
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,310
I heard

436
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,080
they're executing the sea demons today.

437
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:43,830
Have you heard?

438
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,100
The Scroll of Mountains and Seas has been found.

439
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,600
When they seal

440
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,520
the demons,

441
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,790
the scene must be spectacular.

442
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,260
The Scroll of Mountains and Seas...

443
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,310
Chirp.

444
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:53,980
Maybe the person

445
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,200
you care about the most is in there.

446
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:59,940
[Dan's Mansion]

447
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:59,270
Peirong.

448
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,070
What are you doing here?

449
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,670
We made an appointment

450
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,240
for Uncle Wu to do an exorcism.

451
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,190
But

452
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,720
we haven't seen him.

453
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,670
Uncle Wu

454
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,700
didn't do the exorcism.

455
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,430
That old bastard.

456
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,960
He gave me a jar of lip balm on Winter Festival.

457
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:16,960
Now

458
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:17,750
he's ghosting me.

459
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,030
He's nowhere to be found.

460
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,020
Lip balm?

461
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,510
Did you use it?

462
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,670
Did you touch Uncle Wu?

463
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,420
I did.

464
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,460
I even

465
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,190
gave him a kiss.

466
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:29,830
What's wrong?

467
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,330
We're together now.

468
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,240
Is there a problem?

469
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,220
[Celestial Master's Mansion]

470
00:27:59,140 --> 00:27:59,790
Your Majesty,

471
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,390
all the sea demons have been captured,

472
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,710
awaiting to be sentenced.

473
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,470
Nan Fengyi.

474
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,150
Your practice of the Big Dipper Primordial Spell

475
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,000
has been static and unable to progress

476
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,560
for a long time, hasn't it?

477
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,190
If you kill all the sea demons,

478
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,670
your inner strength will move forward.

479
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,410
You'll be able to master the Spell sooner.

480
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:31,470
Your Majesty,

481
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,610
how did you know about it?

482
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:35,690
Why don't you

483
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,660
go kill one and we'll see?

484
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,790
You know my father?

485
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,160
Get it started, Lord Du.

486
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:48,400
Yes.

487
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,960
Here's the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

488
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,830
From now on,

489
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,350
the people of Dazhou

490
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,940
will no longer suffer from the demons.

491
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,520
Nan Fengyi,

492
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,390
don't you

493
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,110
want to avenge your colleagues' death?

494
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,370
Uncle Wu!

495
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:10,500
Nan Fengyi!

496
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:12,950
No!

497
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,350
Uncle Wu!

498
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:15,950
He's Uncle Wu!

499
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,670
If you want to kill him,

500
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:18,600
kill me first.

501
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,050
I am your real enemy.

502
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,750
Kill the demons to reassure the people.

503
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,310
Kill the demons to reassure the people.

504
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,720
Kill the demons to reassure the people.

505
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,150
Kill the demons to reassure the people.

506
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,220
Chirp.

507
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:49,950
Get out of the way.

508
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,870
Whatever he is,

509
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,070
he has to die.

510
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,100
No!

511
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,230
No!

512
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,390
Uncle Wu!

513
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,540
Uncle Wu!

514
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,820
Why?

515
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,750
Why?

516
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,420
Why don't you believe me?

517
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,470
Everyone,

518
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,350
look!

519
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,800
Meng Xizhou is the Golden-winged Bird Demon.

520
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:13,300
The legendary summoner of the Demon Queen.

521
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,590
If they're alive,

522
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,250
the Demon Queen will soon be summoned.

523
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,440
Dazhou will never know peace again!

524
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,270
Seal her now!

525
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,100
Otherwise, Dazhou will never know peace again.

526
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,800
The sky has darkened.

527
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,970
Kill her now!

528
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,860
Otherwise, Dazhou will never know peace again.

529
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,120
The Demon Queen is about to come out.

530
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,160
Seal her now!

531
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:34,750
Seal her!

532
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,630
Seal her!

533
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:36,310
Seal her!

534
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,270
Seal her!

535
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,150
Seal her!

536
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,630
Seal her!

537
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,330
Nan Fengyi.

538
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,080
Seal her!

539
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:42,310
Your Majesty,

540
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,390
I haven't mastered the Big Dipper Primordial Spell yet.

541
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,310
I can't open the Scroll.

542
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,410
You can try.

543
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,470
Open the Scroll, Nan Fengyi.

544
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:05,670
♫The wind hesitates, not daring to smooth the furrowed brow♫

545
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:13,010
♫The rain hesitates, reluctant to burden the tear-streaked eyes beneath the umbrella♫

546
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,940
♫The closer you are to me, the clearer the pain becomes♫

547
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,870
Nan Fengyi.

548
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,310
You'll regret it.

549
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,730
♫The most painful separation means you can't even miss her♫

550
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,429
I already do.

551
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,989
I regret listening to you

552
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:32,210
♫In silence, the world's grudges weave a web of entanglement♫

553
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:30,280
and feeling pity for those demons.

554
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,460
Have you regretted

555
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:36,570
♫Under the clouds, the smoke from cooking rises and spreads freely♫

556
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,449
being merciful to me as well?

557
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:40,750
♫It's the love doomed by fate♫

558
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:41,710
Seal!

559
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:45,650
♫Under the umbrella, your profile is gently framed by the soft strands of your hair♫

560
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:48,960
♫Should my heart belong to someone for ten thousand years♫

561
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:54,710
♫Through endless lifetimes, softly and quietly, it flows on♫

562
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:59,260
♫I won't lose you♫

563
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,130
♫I'll sacrifice myself to help you♫

564
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:08,430
♫With a single lamp and a thousand books, alone I'm restless through the night♫

565
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:15,060
♫Give me a fleeting moment of rain, to be held captive by your side♫

566
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,000
From now on,

567
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,730
your name will be Baize Yi.

568
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,390
You'll be of assistance for me.

569
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:36,750
Yes.

570
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:41,910
Your Majesty.

571
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:15,610
So this is the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

572
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,790
I cannot be sealed in here.
