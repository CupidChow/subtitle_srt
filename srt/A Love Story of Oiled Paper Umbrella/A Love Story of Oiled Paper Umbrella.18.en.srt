00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,030
Help!

4
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,630
Goddess.

5
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:47,390
You're awake.

6
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:49,950
Your Highness.

7
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,840
Wasn't I captured by the Scroll of Mountains and Seas?

8
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,240
Bottle changed them for you.

9
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,500
You won't believe what happened.

10
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,080
I went to my mother's chambers,

11
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,380
stole the Scroll of Mountains and Seas,

12
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,570
found Lord Du,

13
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:10,880
and secretly rescued you.

14
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,070
Goddess, we're out of town already.

15
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,280
Will Her Majesty

16
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,829
find out about this?

17
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:25,670
Don't worry.

18
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,760
I made a reproduction 
of the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

19
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,120
She won't suspect a thing.

20
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:36,230
Dan Qian.

21
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,990
Dan Qian is also missing.

22
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,950
I must go find her.

23
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,230
I've already found Dan Qian.

24
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,470
She's hiding in the Eastern Palace now.

25
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,780
She is safe.

26
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,030
Thank you, Your Highness.

27
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,150
Now,

28
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,030
your safety is the most important thing.

29
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,270
We need to leave here quickly

30
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,810
no matter what.

31
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,270
The further we go, the better.

32
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:57,630
So

33
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,910
where are you taking me?

34
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:00,830
To Xizhou, of course.

35
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,830
Xizhou?

36
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,390
Why?

37
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,150
You...

38
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,830
how can you go somewhere

39
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,150
so far away with me?

40
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,000
My biggest wish

41
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,150
is to be able to protect you.

42
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,910
You don't need to worry about me.

43
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:16,750
Besides,

44
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,270
I received a letter

45
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,829
from my aunt a few days ago.

46
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,079
My uncle,

47
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,190
General Sun, who is guarding Xizhou,

48
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,110
has fallen ill.

49
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,750
It makes sense

50
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,420
that I'm visiting him.

51
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,770
No one will be suspicious.

52
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,150
So,

53
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,670
was it your idea

54
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,310
to go to Xizhou?

55
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,310
Yes, of course.

56
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,430

any of this,

60
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:53,350
does he?

61
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:54,150
He...

62
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,360
He doesn't know about this.

63
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,270
Don't worry.

64
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,710
That's good.

65
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,950
Then I

66
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,870
no longer owe him anything.

From now on,

71

Do you promise?

73
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,390
Yes, I promise.

74
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,790
I promise.

80

risked his life to kill the demons.

If the enemy learns 
that we don't have the general in the army,

118
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,669
it will be dangerous.

and he solved the crisis.

He was a hero to the people of Xizhou.

00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,070
There was a demon crisis at the Acrobatics Troupe?

143

It was all over a decade ago.

144
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,870

I admired your father for a long time,

147

but I never had the chance to meet him.

148
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,430
I heard

149
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,720
that the Acrobatics Troupe disbanded

150
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,750
after that.

151
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,390

156

No.

Don't you find them all very familiar?

00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,910
Did you paint it?

169
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,110
No, of course not.

170

174
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,870
Could you tell me?

175
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:34,750
Look.

178
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,430
the coloring,

180
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,390
the vibrant colors,

181

The murals in this area

183
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,870
were all painted

184
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,150
by the same person.

185
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,670
So did you figure out the artist

186
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,890
of the Scroll of Mountains and Seas?

187
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,180
I don't know about this scroll.

188
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,630
But these murals

189
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,750
were painted by an old man called Iron.

00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,110
Every few decades,

195
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,870
some people claim that they have seen him.

196
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,350
It's been decades

197
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,550
since his last appearance.

198
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,990
At that time,

199
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,150
my mother

200
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,350
was still a graceful young girl.

201
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,390
I can't believe

202
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,350
this is connected to the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

203
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,230
Aunt,

204
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,350
do you have a portrait of Iron?

205
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,810
Or has anyone seen

206
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,590
where he lives?

207
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:36,780
According to legend,

208
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,790
this

209
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,920
is Iron's self-portrait.

210
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:06,950
Baize Yi

211
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:07,910
greets Your Majesty.

212
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,150
Baize Yi.

213
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,780
The Crown Prince hasn't come to greet me for several days.

214
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,310
Have you found out what illness he has?

215
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:19,750
Your Majesty,

216
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,230
I was just about to report to you

217
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,510
that His Highness

218
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:24,350
has been missing.

219
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:26,790
Has been missing?

220
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,590
What a coincidence 
that it happened at this moment.

221
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:31,750
Why did you stop?

222
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:32,790
Continue the massage.

223
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:33,750
Er.

224
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,240
She is indeed a mermaid demon.

225
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,830
Your Majesty,

226
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:42,750
your feet

227
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,550
suddenly...

228
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,990
suddenly aged.

229
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:46,590
You...

230
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,310
Nonsense.

231
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:50,780
Get out!

232
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:51,750
Yes.

233
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,920
Hurry up and add more water.

234
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,270
Baize Yi.

235
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,130
I didn't expect

236
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,350
you to be so gentle.

237
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,430
Your Majesty, I am willing to serve only you,

238
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,650
follow your lead,

239
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,030
and risk my life for you

240
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,240
without hesitation.

241
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,420
The Emperor is not dead yet.

242
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,430
You

243
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,590
go and find out the whereabouts 
of the Crown Prince for me first.

244
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,350
Yes, Your Majesty.

245
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,190
Baize Yi,

246
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,580
do you want to take refuge with me?

247
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,150
Do you think it will be that easy?

248
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,070
Your Highness,

249
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,660
why are we coming back here in the middle of the night?

250
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:55,740
Follow me.

251
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,710
The mural is a profile of Iron.

252
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,440
And it was painted by Iron himself.

253
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,350
He must have left this as a clue for the visitors.

254
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,710
This lantern boy

255
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,350
and the fireflies

256
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,350
mean we have to wait until the middle of the night

257
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,500
for Iron to show up.

258
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:15,790
Also, it suddenly

259
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,430
started snowing and the temperature dropped.

260
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,430
which fits with the anomalous four seasons 
depicted in this painting.

261
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:21,630
Perhaps

262
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,510
it's a test for us.

263
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,390
But for some reason,

264
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,350
when we came here during the day,

265
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,510
the Little White Camel

266
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,850
really disliked this place.

267
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,860
He made a fuss about leaving, no matter what.

268
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,430
This painting...

269
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,380
Now I know why Little White didn't like this place.

270
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:51,990
I've figured it out too.

271
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,880
But why during the day

272
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,630
we couldn't see these bones?

273
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,110
Goddess, look.

274
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,030
These fireflies

275
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,700
are exactly the same as those in the painting.

276
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,970
The Lantern Boy is among the fireflies.

277
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,610
Goddess, look at this painting.

278
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,370
Iron has a group of fireflies.

279
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,790
If we follow them,

280
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,950
we can find Iron.

281
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,130
The Lantern Boy might be among the fireflies.

282
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,790
Why can't I see the Lantern Boy?

283
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,910
Everything I see looks the same.

284
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:36,990
There's a possibility

285
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,700
that this lantern boy is a demon.

286
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,990
Only my Demon-Recognizing Pupils

287
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:41,830
can see it.

288
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,140
Give it a try.

289
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,050
Umbrella, come.

290
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,640
[Lantern Boy]

291
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,840
Oh, my aching back.

292
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,830
You wicked woman!

293
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,520
How dare you touch me.

294
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:17,440
Tell us

295
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,500
where Iron is, now.

296
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:19,470
Take us to see him.

297
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,070
Why should I tell you?

298
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:25,330
Fine.

299
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,260
It's okay if you don't take us to see him.

300
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,330
Then you won't be able to see him either.

301
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,320
You're coming with us.

302
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,110
What are you doing?

303
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,350
Put me down now.

304
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,030
I may look small,

305
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,290
but I've actually lived for over two hundred years.

306
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,980
Do you think it's appropriate

307
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,670
to hang an ancestor like this?

308
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,070
Cut the nonsense.

309
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,250
If you don't take us to see Iron,

310
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,110
my Umbrella will capture you.

311
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,750
You'd better believe it.

312
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,470
And

313
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,900
let me tell you something.

314
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,440
I am a

315
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,760
demon hunter.

316
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,790
Fine. I'll take you.

317
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,730
Happy now?

318
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,030
Hurry up.

319
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,390
Young people these days

320
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,619
dilly-dally at everything, indeed.

321
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,319
You little brat.

322
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:23,670
This...

323
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,260
Where is this place?

324
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:29,830
Grandpa,

325
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,250
we have visitors.

326
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,230
Grandpa,

327
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,890
we have visitors.

328
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,610
You little brat,

329
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,590
didn't I tell you

330
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,310
not to let anyone disturb me?

331
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,280
This woman is quite formidable.

332
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,910
If you're annoyed,

333
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,430
go take it out on them.

334
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:04,830
Iron,

335
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,190
I am Beigong Shuo.

336
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,010
And this is Meng Xizhou.

337
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,550
General Sun, who guards Xizhou, is my uncle.

338
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,480
We came here to find out his whereabouts.

339
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,010
Ah, General Sun.

340
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,500
He has lost his way in my painting,

341
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,210
so he can't get out.

342
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,270
Lost his way?

343
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,820
Your uncle misses his sister.

344
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,550
He feels her death was suspicious.

345
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,030
He kept bothering me every now and then.

346
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,190
I had no choice.

347
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,990
but to paint a picture called Missing My Sister for him.

348
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,310
It turns out

349
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,750
that he entered the painting and couldn't get out.

350
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,720
My mother passed away from an illness.

351
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,150
Everyone in the palace knows that.

352
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,630
Why did my uncle say otherwise?

353
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,150
Please let my uncle out, Iron.

354
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,270
Everyone has their own emotional complex.

355
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,810
If I were that kind-hearted,

356
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,060
I wouldn't have lived to this age.

357
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,830
Don't be delusional.

358
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,590
I'm trapped in a

359
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,690
timeless enigmatic painting myself.

360
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,590
How can I possibly help your uncle?

361
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,150
Timeless enigmatic painting?

362
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,220
Tell us about it.

363
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:11,510
Perhaps

364
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:12,990
we can solve it.

365
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:17,390
Li Shiyi fought the Demon Queen back then.

366
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,250
How was he

367
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,510
able to kill

368
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,490
the all-powerful Demon Queen?

369
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,310
What kind of riddle is this?

370
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,310
Li Shiyi

371
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,310
was the world's greatest demon hunter.

372
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,630
Naturally, his magical power is strong,

373
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,480
so even the Demon Queen was no match for him.

374
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,590
Fool!

375
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,670
You're completely wrong.

376
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,990
I've seen the Demon Queen before.

377
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,000
She can leap 90 thousand miles in a single bound, just like Kunpeng.

378
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,680
How could that Li Shiyi be her match?

379
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,270
If the answer were really that simple,

380
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,910
would I have been trapped here for so long?

381
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,590
My father wouldn't lie to me.

382
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:52,910
The Demon Queen

383
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,750
was indeed killed by him.

384
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,550
Your father is Li Shiyi?

385
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:58,430
Yes.

386
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,270
I am his daughter.

387
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:00,630
You...

388
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,530
You're his daughter?

389
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,720
God is on my side!

390
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,790
You're the only one

391
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,870
who can enter the painting

392
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,270
and solve the riddle in this world.

393
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,350
Enter the painting?

394
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,630
What does that mean?

395
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,030
Those paintings covering the walls

396
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,990
are actually the emotional complexes 
of many lovelorn men and women.

397
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,470
They've struggled their whole lives,

398
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,950
just wanting an answer.

399
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,750
So they asked me to paint for them

400
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,550
and recreate the scenes from earlier,

401
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,830
so they could find answers.

402
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,790
However,

403
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,910
only the closest family members
 of those in the paintings

404
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,830
can uncover the truth.

405
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,360
You are Li Shiyi's daughter,

406
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,390
naturally connected by blood 
to the Li Shiyi in the painting.

407
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,440
You can restart the story from that year,

408
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,260
and help me find the truth 
about Li Shiyi's battle with the Demon Queen.

409
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,110
So,

410
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,710
are you saying

411
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,390
I can go into the painting

412
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,820
and witness the grand spectacle

413
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,830
of my father battling the Demon Queen?

414
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,240
Yes, of course.

415
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:53,670
However,

416
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,070
he won't recognize you.

417
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,000
because you'll be possessing

418
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,590
the body of a stranger.

419
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,350
Let me make it clear.

420
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,990
People who enter the painting

421
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,870
but can't solve the riddle

422
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,550
will end up like his uncle.

423
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,410
They will be trapped inside, unable to escape,

424
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:12,070
and eventually turn into these scattered bones.

425
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,030
I'll go.

426
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:14,870
I'll go.

427
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:15,400
No, no.

428
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:15,870
Goddess,

429
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,790
how can I let you take this risk?

430
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:18,880
What if...

431
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:20,790
I mean what if

432
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:21,830
Li Shiyi

433
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,250
isn't your real father?

434
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:24,750
Are you sure

435
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,030
you're his biological child?

436
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,270
Don't forget,

437
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:30,270
you're a demon.

438
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,710
If you get trapped in the painting,

439
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:34,680
what am I going to do?

440
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:37,990
Your Highness,

441
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,190
the flaws I have

442
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,480
are exactly the same as my father's.

443
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,670
Also, Your Highness,

444
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,310
there are many things

445
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,990
I want to ask my father

446
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,350
in person.

447
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,820
This is something I've been dreaming of.

448
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,550
Your Highness, I hope

449
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,670
that you won't stop me.

450
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,430
Can I go in there for her?

451
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,020
Only the closest family members

452
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,820
can open the path into the painting.

453
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,440
If you don't believe me, try it yourselves.

454
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,510
Both of you,

455
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:05,980
take some blood

456
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,070
and drop it under the shadow of my lamp.

457
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:26,890
The painting of Li Shiyi's Great Battle

458
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,320
with the Demon Queen.

459
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:29,350
This is indeed

460
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,670
the path I should take.

461
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:33,960
Time waits for no one.

462
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,380
Please go inside the painting.

463
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:36,910
Alright.

464
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,270
Wait.

465
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,550
Please be very careful.

466
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:44,710
Don't worry,

467
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,070
I will definitely come back.

468
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:00,910
Iron,

469
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,910
what is your relationship

470
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,830
with Li shiyi

471
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,630
and the Demon Queen?

472
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,100
Why do you dare enter this painting?

473
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,670
Twenty years ago,

474
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,990
the Demon Queen was killed by Li Shiyi.

475
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,840
The Scroll of Mountains and Seas captured thousands of demons.

476
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,150
That is the pain of our demon kind.

477
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,250
So I searched for the Demon Queen's blood for a long time,

478
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,520
but in the end, I trapped myself in the painting.

479
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,510
So,

480
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,470
you're a demon too.

481
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,300
If we were human,

482
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,040
why would we need to hide?

483
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:29,950
Why wouldn't we dare come out?

484
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,090
I wonder if the Goddess

485
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,270
will be able to see her father.

486
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,720
[Li Residence]

487
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,710
Remember.

488
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,600
You exist in the painting with someone else's identity.

489
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:50,950
Therefore,

490
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,020
you can only be an observer.

491
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,080
You cannot change the outcome of anything,

492
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:59,570
nor can you reveal your true relationship.

493
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:00,900
If you do,

494
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,820
you will never find the truth.

495
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:12,990
I can't call out.

496
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,670
I'm no longer myself.

497
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,030
What nonsense did you just say?

498
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,150
My wife is missing.

499
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,550
Who is missing?

500
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,190
My wife, Ren Guang, is missing.

501
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,190
Ren Guang?

502
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,060
Ren Guang is your wife?

503
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:26,650
Xi,

504
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,730
did you hit your head today?

505
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,070
Go, go, go.

506
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:31,780
Is this really you?

507
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:34,910
What are you doing?

508
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,790
My wife is heavily pregnant and about to give birth.

509
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:38,660
Now,

510
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,470
let's split up and search for her right now.

511
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,670
Madam is about to give birth

512
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:42,590
and she's missing!

513
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:43,780
I...

514
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,960
Isn't this the painting

515
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,590
of Li Shiyi's Great Battle with the Demon Queen?

516
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:52,710
Why

517
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,840
have I gone back to the day 
when my mother gave birth to me?

518
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,640
My mom died due to a difficult birth

519
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,710
when she gave birth to me.

520
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:58,950
No,

521
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,450
I must find her.

522
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,060
Mother!

523
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:03,390
Mother!

524
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:08,850
Sister,

525
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,760
have you seen a woman who's about to give birth?

526
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,110
No, I haven't.

527
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,110
Have you seen a woman who's about to give birth?

528
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,190
No, I haven't.

529
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,830
Have you seen a woman who's about to give birth?

530
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,070
About this big.

531
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,400
You work for Li Shiyi's family, don't you?

532
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:20,310
Yes.

533
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:21,900
Do you have any leads, sister?

534
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,230
I don't have any leads.

535
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,640
But your Madam has a kind and dignified nature.

536
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,150
She never argues with Li Shiyi.

537
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:27,990
Don't worry.

538
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:28,830
She has such a nice temperament.

539
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:29,910
she won't go far.

540
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,060
Really?

541
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,150
That's good.

542
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,110
She also ordered

543
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,150
a set of baby clothes and shoes from me.

544
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,150
She wants to have a daughter.

545
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,640
She's happy, even with morning sickness every day.

546
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,430
She's truly a good mother.

547
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,310
Look,

548
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,770
these clothes are pink.

549
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,430
What if it's a boy?

550
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,950
You should take these back to her.

551
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,590
Wish her sweet dreams come true.

552
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,150
Alright.

553
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,350
Thank you, sister.

554
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,570
Young man. Young man.

555
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,400
Early this morning,

556
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,950
I did see a pregnant woman

557
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:55,790
shakily

558
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,310
heading towards the caves.

559
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,350
How about you go look for her there?

560
00:25:58,910 --> 00:25:59,590
Thank you.

561
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:00,630
No problem. Hurry up and go.

562
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,260
She must be my mother.

563
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,670
We even have the same wings.

564
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,590
Don't come any closer.

565
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,470
Madam,

566
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,070
don't worry,

567
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,160
I won't hurt you.

568
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:37,990
I'm...

569
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,180
I'm...

570
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,270
Xi.

571
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,430
Quick, help me guard the cave entrance.

572
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,770
I can't maintain my human form for long.

573
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,270
Alright.

574
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,430
I'll go find Master then.

575
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,740
You can't do it like this.

576
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,700
Stop right there.

577
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,950
Don't go, please.

578
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,920
Master

579
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,950
doesn't know my true identity.

580
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,580
I'm very weak right now.

581
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,740
I'm about to return to my original form.

582
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,710
What should we do then?

583
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,230
I don't know how to deliver a baby.

584
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,910
You really can't do it like this.

585
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,590
I can.

586
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,510
Okay.

587
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:20,420
Then I'll keep watch at the cave entrance.

588
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,310
Madam, if anything happens,

589
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,480
just call for me.

590
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,430
Madam,

591
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:37,150
how about

592
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,830
I recite some poetry

593
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,150
to cheer you on?

594
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:43,750
The journey is difficult.

595
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,920
The journey is difficult.

596
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,580
Many paths diverge;

597
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:47,470
where do they lead now?

598
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,100
There will come a time 
when the wind breaks the waves,

599
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,260
and we'll set sail across the vast sea.

600
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,270
Is this poem not good?

601
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,390
Then let me choose another one for you.

602
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,860
As Heaven's movement is ever vigorous,

603
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:00,880
so must a gentleman…

604
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,950
Shut up.

605
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,020
This one's not good either?

606
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,000
Then I...

607
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:05,950
let me think of another one.

608
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,110
I'll choose a different one for you.

609
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,270
Where there's a will, there's a way.

610
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,810
I was born.

611
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,750
Xi,

612
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,340
come help me hold the baby.

613
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:07,840
Could it be that my mother

614
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,900
didn’t die from a difficult childbirth after all?

615
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:11,500
Okay.

616
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,710
Help me hold the baby.

617
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,780
You are the most

618
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,510
adorable little girl in the world.

619
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:47,550
Madam,

620
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,170
I'm glad you and your daughter are safe.

621
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,230
You have no idea

622
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,190
how happy this child will be

623
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,990
when she grows up.

624
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,190
How could she know

625
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,870
that the day of her birth

626
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,330
is her mother's day of suffering?

627
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:17,880
Never mind.

628
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,930
As long as I can accompany her as she grows up,

629
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,720
the suffering now

630
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,710
is worth it.

631
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,950
You're about to return to your true form.

632
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,210
I'm too weak now.

633
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,560
I can't maintain my human form.

634
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,390
Take the child and go now.

635
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,750
Help me keep Master calm.

636
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,470
Don't let him find me, no matter what.

637
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:50,990
Then you'll be alone in this cave.

638
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:51,830
Do you have anything to eat,

639
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,720
or drink?

640
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:55,740
I can take care of myself.

641
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,110
You need to leave now.

642
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,240
Promise me.

643
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,350
You must

644
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,680
make sure the child is safe.

645
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,470
Can you do that?

646
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,200
Do not worry, Madam.

647
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,270
I will definitely protect this child.

648
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,150
If she lives,

649
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:23,920
I live.

650
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:27,770
If she doesn't survive,

651
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,070
neither will I.

652
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,110
Although

653
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,800
I'm not a qualified Demon Queen,

654
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:39,990
and I've even let down

655
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,120
The Demon Queen…

656
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,990
millions of my demon brothers and sisters,

657
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:44,630
but

658
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,460
I want to be

659
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,110
a good mother.

660
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,070
What did you just say?

661
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,680
You're the Demon Queen?

662
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:24,390
Don't!

663
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,570
Die, Demon Lord!

664
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,310
Darling.

665
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,420
Darling.

666
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,870
Demon Lord,

667
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,360
don't even think about deceiving me

668
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,180
by taking my wife's form.

669
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,500
Where's Guang?

670
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,790
I'm sorry.

671
00:32:59,350 --> 00:32:59,750
I...

672
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,620
I planned to keep it from you for a lifetime.

673
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,390
I never thought

674
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,470
you would still

675
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,040
find out.

676
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,590
Being the Demon Queen is a curse.

677
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:27,950
From the moment I was born,

678
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:31,940
humans have seen me 
as the ultimate hunting trophy.

679
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,870
Whoever kills me

680
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,380
will become

681
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:40,510
the greatest demon hunter in the world.

682
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,470
But

683
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,630
ironically,

684
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,590
I've developed

685
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:52,610
a desire to live an ordinary life.

686
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,870
I don't want to end up like my mother,

687
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,020
having her skin peeled off

688
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,630
and her bones extracted

689
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,670
by the Baize family.

690
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,610
The essence of her blood

691
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,730
was used to create 
the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

692
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,310
No.

693
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:22,909
We still have

694
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:25,530
such a lovely child.

695
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,070
Long for

696
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,330
an ordinary life

697
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:34,670
and live it well for me,

698
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:36,820
will you?

699
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,030
I...

700
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,710
I killed the person I loved most.

701
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,070
I always thought

702
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,659
once you knew my true identity,

703
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:50,429
you would mind.

704
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:52,870
Now,

705
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:55,199
I finally know

706
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,310
that even though I'm a demon,

707
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,550
you still love me.

708
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,600
Madam,

709
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,680
he doesn't deserve your love.

710
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,310
Don't blame yourself.

711
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:15,610
You are the greatest demon hunter in the world.

712
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,070
Killing the Demon Queen

713
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,790
is your sacred duty.

714
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,760
Why didn't you tell him before?

715
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:29,620
His obsession with killing demons runs too deep.

716
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:30,790
Madam,

717
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,430
he is your killer.

718
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:35,450
If I didn't get killed by him,

719
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,600
I would surely die at the hands of

720
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,260
the demon hunters of Dazhou.

721
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,630
Would I want them to peel off my skin,

722
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,270
scrape my bones,

723
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:51,430
and use the essence of my blood

724
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,630
to create another Scroll of Mountains and Seas,

725
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:56,890
and imprison my brothers and sisters?

726
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,750
Thinking about it now,

727
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,550
I truly brought this on myself.

728
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:03,790
I have

729
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,400
thousands of

730
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,970
kinsmen who are

731
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,830
captured

732
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,720
in the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

733
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,910
They've always been hoping

734
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,230
that I will go and save them.

735
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:21,750
They've kept hoping.

736
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,990
But I

737
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,480
chose to run away.

738
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:34,910
My death today

739
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,390
is my retribution.

740
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,750
I don't blame anyone.

741
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:45,390
If…

742
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:46,830
If you

743
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,000
could help me

744
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:53,820
find the Scroll of Mountains and Seas again,

745
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,270
you must

746
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,150
release them.

747
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,590
They are just like me.

748
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:08,710
They are all

749
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,830
innocent.

750
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,070
Guang.

751
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:19,270
Madam.

752
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,080
Guang.

753
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,040
Guang.

754
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,630
Don't leave me.

755
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,530
Guang.

756
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,110
Guang.

757
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,570
I will be with you

758
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,820
after I die.

759
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,750
Life after life.

760
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:53,730
We'll never be apart.

761
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,670
What's next?

762
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,100
What are you going to do?

763
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,300
I'm going to Guang's last wish

764
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,660
and get back 
the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.

765
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,220
Are you really planning to release millions of demons?

766
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,590
Will it cause another catastrophe for humanity?

767
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,090
Why would releasing the demons

768
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,880
certainly lead to a catastrophe?

769
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,420
Guang once told me

770
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,830
that demons and humans

771
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:29,370
are the same.

772
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,410
They all long for their own homes

773
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,570
and peaceful lives.

774
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,350
Unfortunately,

775
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,820
I was too obsessed with capturing demons back then,

776
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,570
and completely ignored her words.

777
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,070
Now that she's gone,

778
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,470
I've finally realized what she meant.

779
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,520
But humans see demons as aliens

780
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,800
and slaughter them violently.

781
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,350
Demons view humans as mortal enemies

782
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:57,990
and seek revenge madly.

783
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,590
The hatred and resentment between them

784
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,870
has always been like this.

785
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,940
And they will only grow deeper.

786
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:15,910
My child,

787
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,070
your mother's surname is Meng,

788
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,540
and you were born here.

789
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:22,390
From now on,

790
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,990
you'll be called Meng Xizhou.

791
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,190
And since today,

792
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:29,370
we'll rely on each other

793
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,820
and fulfill your mother's last wish.
