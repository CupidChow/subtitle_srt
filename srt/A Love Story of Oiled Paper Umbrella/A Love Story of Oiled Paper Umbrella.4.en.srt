00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,070
[Imperial Secret Passage]

4
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:47,750
Inside this mystical secret passage,

5
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,590
there are many traps.

6
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,130
Just keep moving forward.

7
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,240
Don't touch anything.

8
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,260
Don't move.

9
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:11,560
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

10
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,310
I

11
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,000
am a bit later than scheduled.

12
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,230
It's all right.

13
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,550
What happened?

14
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,670
As expected,

15
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,710
Situ Hanshan indeed

16
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,470
sent the powerful Smoke Dragon and Nine-Tailed Fox

17
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,590
for assassination in the imperial prison.

18
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,000
Nan, you're indeed impressive.

19
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,200
I...

20
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,710
I'm no match for those demons.

21
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,360
Fortunately, Miss Meng was there.

22
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,450
She saved my life.

23
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,079
Don't say anything stupid.

24
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,390
Right.

25
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,829
This girl is amazing.

26
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,190
In the great hall,

27
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,130
I witnessed what you got.

28
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,150
Not bad.

29
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,690
The Nine-Tailed Fox's illusionary techniques are unparalleled in the world.

30
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,160
No one but Li Shiyi

31
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,880
could break them.

32
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,430
Because

33
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,460
I'm Li Shiyi's daughter.

34
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,260
Your father is Li Shiyi?

35
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,230
No wonder you know so many demons.

36
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,950
What happened to this girl?

37
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,670
Just a few days ago, she said

38
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,410
she didn't dare to acknowledge Li Shiyi as her father.

39
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,990
Now she's so confident.

40
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,780
It's like she's a different person.

41
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:15,940
Anyway,

42
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,250
I will continue to work hard.

43
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,560
Your Majesty,

44
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,270
I discovered in the imperial prison

45
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,050
two important pieces of information

46
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,420
that need to be reported immediately.

47
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,630
Go on.

48
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,200
In Changle City,

49
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,240
there exists a group of demons that haven't transformed themselves into human shapes.

50
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,250
These demons

51
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,450
escaped by a fluke...

52
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,050
When Li Shiyi and Baize Gong used the Scroll of Mountains and Seas

53
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,420
to suppress ten thousand demons.

54
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,280
These demons

55
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,590
are now hidden by Situ Hanshan

56
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,640
somewhere in the city.

57
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:43,630
If that's the case,

58
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,940
it's good news for us.

59
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,090
Once the ten thousand demons are released

60
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,160
from the Scroll of Mountains and Seas,

61
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,800
the world will be in chaos.

62
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,920
You tell me!

63
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,680
Who should be held accountable for this negligence?

64
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,430
It's my fault.

65
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,300
What about another piece of information?

66
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,270
These Puppet Worms won't survive past tonight.

67
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,240
Tonight,

68
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,300
Situ Hanshan

69
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,580
will host a banquet for all officials.

70
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,390
He'll attempt to transform skin for sure.

71
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,340
Your Majesty,

72
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,680
we must eliminate all demons.

73
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,150
I'm willing to lead the Masters from the Celestial Master's Mansion

74
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,450
to wipe out Situ Hanshan,

75
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,670
so as to calm the people's hearts.

76
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,050
The Court of Judicature and Revision and the Celestial Master's Mansion

77
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,950
will join hands together.

78
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:16,970
Good.

79
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,550
Take this great demon hunter with you.

80
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,590
We can't let any demons slip through the net.

81
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,080
Me?

82
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,730
Are you Li Shiyi's daughter?

83
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,420
Then you must be a great demon hunter too.

84
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,590
Got it, Your Majesty.

85
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,470
[Situ's Mansion]

86
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,070
Something bad happened, Master.

87
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,880
The Celestial Master's Mansion and the Court of Judicature and Revision

88
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,040
have surrounded our mansion.

89
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:45,730
What?

90
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:46,970
How could this happen?

91
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,700
Nan Fengyi and Meng Xizhou are also here.

92
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,370
Seems

93
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,720
Smoke Dragon and Nine-Tailed Fox have both perished.

94
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,470
We've been exposed.

95
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:58,830
What should we do?

96
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,240
How about

97
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,510
we retreat as soon as possible?

98
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,880
These Puppet Worms

99
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,950
are the result of years of hard work by Master and me.

100
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,830
Let them come.

101
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
It would be the right time for me

102
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,390
to set up a formation in the courtyard

103
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,470
to capture them all for skin transformation.

104
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,440
Let's see

105
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,440
if the useless emperor

106
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,470
can distinguish humans

107
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,090
from demons.

108
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,030
By His Majesty's decree,

109
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,150
since Situ Hanshan has colluded with demons,

110
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,790
he must be executed tonight.

111
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:31,490
Yes!

112
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,560
Be careful, Junior.

113
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:39,540
It's a formation set by Situ Hanshan.

114
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,270
It's not a big deal.

115
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,510
Give me some time.

116
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,720
I'll lead the Masters

117
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,830
to break it.

118
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,290
There is a side door on the east and south sides respectively.

119
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,600
I'll send our brothers from the Court of Judicature and Revision

120
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,730
to surround him from the east.

121
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,270
The south side is close to the banquet hall.

122
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,280
We

123
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,630
will seize the opportunity to rescue the officials.

124
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,940
You...

125
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,950
You and I...

126
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,490
Us?

127
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,450
Who else could it be?

128
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,390
Well,

129
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,280
I mean,

130
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,500
I want to go with Lord Du and the others to catch demons.

131
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,390
Director Nan,

132
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,430
you'd better go rescue the officials yourself.

133
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,100
Don't forget the fact

134
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,740
that by staying with me,

135
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,220
your magical power will be greatly enhanced.

136
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,070
Masters, attention.

137
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,670
Follow me to break the formation.

138
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,060
Meng Xizhou.

139
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,990
Stay by my side later.

140
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,190
Don't go anywhere.

141
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,100
Don't worry.

142
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,020
I won't absorb your energy at will after I go in.

143
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,630
Such an embarrassing thing

144
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,550
should never be brought up again.

145
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,540
Huo Ting.

146
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,470
Let's go.

147
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,230
My little broken umbrella!

148
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,070
Nan.

149
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:46,870
Nan.

150
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,870
Take me with you.

151
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:49,700
Why are you here?

152
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,590
I live nearby.

153
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,020
And I'm familiar with the terrain around here.

154
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,380
Peirong's family

155
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,270
look down on me for being a coroner.

156
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:59,470
So I'm thinking about changing my career.

157
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:00,590
I want to be a yamen runner.

158
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,050
I want to make my child and Peirong proud.

159
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,940
Hui Fang, you're a coroner.

160
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,690
You shouldn't act recklessly.

161
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,550
Go back and stay with Peirong.

162
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,470
Don't go anywhere.

163
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:09,950
Go back!

164
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:10,630
Go back!

165
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:11,530
Nan,

166
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,470
I'm begging you.

167
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,380
Hui Fang,

168
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,710
there's nothing wrong with being a coroner.

169
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,110
I used to sell haunted houses.

170
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,380
Yet I still hold my head high.

171
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,530
We

172
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,630
don't need to belittle ourselves.

173
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,340
Please, Nan.

174
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:38,590
Then do something for me.

175
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,440
-Okay.
-Be very careful.

176
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:40,909
Okay.

177
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:56,860
Seems

178
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,110
Situ Hanshan has been well prepared.

179
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,690
We must be extremely careful.

180
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:06,950
This place

181
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,830
seems a bit strange.

182
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,190
Why is it so quiet?

183
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,180
This is an illusionary formation.

184
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,910
Illusionary formation?

185
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:21,980
How do we break it?

186
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:56,810
Impressive.

187
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:57,990
Very impressive.

188
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:58,910
Let's hurry and leave.

189
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,430
I didn't expect

190
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,350
that you two would be the first to break my formation.

191
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,630
Turns out Puppet Worms are all here.

192
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,510
Since you're here,

193
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,190
you might as well join them

194
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,990
and become my Puppet Spirits.

195
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:28,910
Leave him to me.

196
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,770
You go and collect the Puppet Worms.

197
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,300
Got it.

198
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,640
♫I hold the umbrella alone and traverse the rivers, lakes, mountains, and seas♫

199

♫Feibai Brush writes the love of my life♫

Director Nan.

231
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,770
Hui Fang

232
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,100
has set up the Shifang Xuanwu Formation in the backyard as I instructed.

233
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,430
Du Fenglei and Du Yuelian

234
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,270
are dealing with Situ Hanshan here.

235
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,510
I need you

236
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,000
to channel your internal energy into this object

237
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,580
and activate the formation.

238
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,460
Hurry.

239
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,950
Where should I put it?

240
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,390
Where is it?

241
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,580
Found it.

242
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,590
Hui Fang!

243
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,680
How could small fry

244
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,140
dare to stand against me?

245
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,370
Small fry

246
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,420
can also make great things fall.

247
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,070
Sooner or later, all of you will die.

248
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,550
This is only the beginning!

249
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,630
Hui Fang.

250
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,660
Hui Fang!

251
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,220
Hui Fang.

252
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,180
Peirong is still waiting for you.

253
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,890
You can't die.

254
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,570
I'm not afraid of death.

255
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,110
I'm not afraid.

256
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:42,900
It's just that

257
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,100
I haven't seen

258
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,270
Peirong

259
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,550
and my unborn child yet.

260
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,100
Nan,

261
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,900
please take good care of Peirong for me.

262
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,590
Also...

263
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,720
I promise you everything.

264
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,460
What happened?

265
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,350
You still think about drinking?

266
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,670
You muddle-headed officials.

267
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,680
You can't even tell humans from demons.

268
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,660
You drank the poisonous trigger

269
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,740
from the mermaid demon of Situ Hanshan.

270
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,310
You almost had your skin changed

271
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,680
and became Puppet Spirits!

272
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,350
Thank you, Master.

273
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,230
Thank you for saving us, Master.

274
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:28,390
[Hui's Mansion]

275
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:29,860
Wake up.

276
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,420
Wake up.

277
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,740
Wake up, Hui Fang!

278
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,090
Peirong.

279
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:52,820
I'm sorry.

280
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,780
I failed to protect Hui Fang.

281
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,590
Does saying sorry help?

282
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,020
Last time, it was Chief Minister Pei.

283
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,040
This time, it's Hui Fang.

284
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,790
Why did you survive only?

285
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:18,180
Peirong.

286
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,930
-You're the only one who survived every time!
-Peirong!

287
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:20,830
Why?

288
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,670
-Nan doesn't want this as well.
-Why?

289
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,740
He was just a coroner.

290
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,160
Why did you let him go to the demon-catching scene?

291
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,910
Because Hui Fang said

292
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,900
he wanted to be a yamen runner.

293
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:39,580
In doing so,

294
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,670
he could become your and the child's pride.

295
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,320
It's you again.

296
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,670
You still dare to speak up for others?

297
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,120
It's all because you sold this haunted house,

298
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,590
which brought bad luck and got my husband killed!

299
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,340
Otherwise, how could he have died so easily?

300
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,590
It's all because of you, you jinx.

301
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,720
You've brought misfortune to everyone!

302
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,550
You've destroyed the hope of me and my child.

303
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,400
93.

304
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,590
94.

305
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,470
Mr. Ren Guang.

306
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:28,870
Hurry.

307
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,200
[Ren Guang]

308
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,660
It's your turn.

309
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:49,630
Chirp,

310
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,630
you've made progress.

311
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,150
I lost like this,

312
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,700
and you call that improvement?

313
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,470
Losing a game doesn't mean you've regressed.

314
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,910
Winning doesn't necessarily mean you've improved either.

315
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:02,770
You may seem to have lost,

316
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,060
but in fact,

317
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,020
your way of playing has changed.

318
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,230
Perhaps you haven't realized it yourself,

319
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:09,630
or

320
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,710
you're not yet accustomed to this change in yourself.

321
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:13,930
That's why you would lose.

322
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,400
What change could I possibly have?

323
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,710
I've always been like this,

324
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,310
mediocre and useless.

325
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,750
When I had a glimmer of hope,

326
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,150
it turned out...

327
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,900
It turned out even worse.

328
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,540
After this period of time,

329
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,220
you're no longer the agent

330
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,630
who only knows how to pick locks and clean houses.

331
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,460
How am I not?

332
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,300
People told me before

333
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,860
that selling haunted houses was unlucky.

334
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,390
I didn't believe it.

335
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,390
But now I do.

336
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,630
I led to Hui Fang's death.

337
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,150
If it weren't for you,

338
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,170
the hidden demon problem in Changle City

339
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,550
wouldn't have been uncovered so quickly.

340
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,980
How many people would have died unjustly?

341
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,930
How can you be called a jinx?

342
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,100
-But...
-People are born to die.

343
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,460
If we die for a just cause,

344
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,190
what's there to regret?

345
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,220
Hui Fang

346
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,870
had his own karma.

347
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,460
So,

348
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,590
since you haven't appeared in my dreams for so long,

349
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,700
are you here to comfort me?

350
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,390
Look at your umbrella.

351
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,430
I remember now.

352
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,220
Tonight at the Situ's Mansion,

353
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,700
it caught many Puppet Worms,

354
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,470
and then it changed.

355
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,600
All living things

356
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,270
are endowed with primordial Qi.

357
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,280
Look, everything in this world

358
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,670
is all composed of primordial Qi.

359
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:54,950
Chirp.

360
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:58,880
You've finally met your destined master.

361
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,260
Destined master?

362
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,110
Who is it?

363
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:06,710
Who do you think it is?

364
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,420
Director Nan?

365
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,820
When I'm by his side,

366
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:12,910
my Qi Core no longer leaks,

367
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,230
my powers greatly improve,

368
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,030
and I can even recognize demons.

369
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,670
But he

370
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,520
doesn't want to take me as his disciple.

371
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,490
Sincerity of the heart

372
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:21,460
brings about realized wishes.

373
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:24,900
Chirp,

374
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:26,740
I'm waiting for the day

375
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,900
when you become the world's greatest demon hunter with his help.

376
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,340
Then when I

377
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,970
become the world's greatest demon hunter,

378
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:35,820
will you come out to see me?

379
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:36,540
Of course, I will.

380
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,670
This has been our promise

381
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,820
since you were a child.

382
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:41,790
Then,

383
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,310
are you a real person?

384
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,690
Why do we always meet in dreams?

385
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,180
Until the day we meet,

386
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,090
you'll know

387
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,380
for yourself.

388
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,900
When that day comes,

389
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,460
can you tell me

390
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,270
why my father abandoned me

391
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,690
and the truth about his death?

Better.

396

You've been walking for a while, haven't you?

397
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:40,890
Put me down.

398
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,150
I'm quite heavy.

399
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,780
My shoes are already wet.

400
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,860
I can't let yours get wet too.

401
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,250
Hold on tight to me.

402
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,680
About what Peirong said,

403
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,550
don't take it to heart.

404
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:01,050
I don't.

405
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,990
I think she

406
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,740
was right to scold me

407
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,160
and hit me.

408
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,260
I'm always so self-righteous,

409
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,430
thinking I've mastered some powers,

410
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,330
but in the end,

411
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,240
I couldn't even break a formation.

412
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:24,750
So,

413
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,700
I got Hui Fang killed.

415
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,500
I'm truly sorry.

416
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,430
Don't say it.

417

This is the mansion left behind by the Baize family, once demon hunters,

after their property was confiscated.

to finally buy it.

431
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,410
Being able to live here

432
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,400
is really worth it.

433
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,920
Do you know why I

434
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,790
built those steps

435
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,070

are just like the obstacles in our lives.

441
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,450
It's impossible

442
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,520
to have a smooth sailing life.

443
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,820
I understand.

00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,140
isn't good,

563
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,230
and the rent is high.

564
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,270
After Uncle Wu and Dan Qian move in,

565
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,190
at least,

566
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,970
we won't worry about the number of customers.

567
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,300
You really care about your family.

568
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:41,850
Of course.

569
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,340
My father and mother died

570
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,460
when I was young.

571
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,670
So, Uncle Wu and Dan Qian

572
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,710
are the only two relatives

573
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,400
I have in this world.

574
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,930
Do you still want to learn talismanic formations?

575
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,070
Of course.

576
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,210
Then you should take me as your master.
