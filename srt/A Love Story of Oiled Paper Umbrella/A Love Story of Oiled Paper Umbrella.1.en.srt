00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:53,780
Demon or not,

381
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,050
I'll help you get rid of it.

382
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,310
Do you want to give it a try?

383
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,270
1,000 coins.

384
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,830
-1,000 coins?
-She didn't need a magical weapon.

385
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,070
She can identify demons with her eyes.

386
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,550
What kind of special ability is that?

387
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,030
Nan can do it too.

388
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:03,910
Come on.

389
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,430
We'll clean the whole house for you for free.

390
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,860
You can move in

391
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,950
after everything is settled.

392
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,230
It's very reassuring.

393
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,110
Sounds professional.

394
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,390
500 coins.

395
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,720
500 coins. Bottom price.

396
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,350
500 coins.

397
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:15,910
50 coins.

398
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,830
No more.

399
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:17,630
You...

400
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:19,990
Come here.

401
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,660
Let me tell you,

402
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,110
I

403
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,250
do have the power

404
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,750
to make people move.

405
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,870
If you don't cooperate,

406
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,270
I'll embarrass you in front of

407
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,340
your friend.

408
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,070
Catching demons isn't an easy job.

409
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,680
Here, take it all.

410
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:43,830
Hui Fang,

411
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:44,750
leave it to her. Let's go.

412
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,070
Okay.

413
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:57,870
Umbrella!

414
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,550
That's strange.

415
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,230
I was able to channel my power just now.

416
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:05,760
Is it

417
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,500
gone?

418
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,250
How could

419
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,140
that woman make me move towards her?

420
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,230
And she claimed she could recognize demons.

421
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,520
Ridiculous.

422
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,460
Yi,

423
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,550
you seem off today.

424
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,490
What do you mean?

425
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,230
Has anyone found out

426
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,190
you know how to

427
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,180
use talismans and cast spells?

428
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:50,750
Uncle!

429
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,330
There's

430
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,470
a feminine scent on you.

431
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,880
Uncle, it's all in your head.

432
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,110
Yi,

433
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,070
you shouldn't think about personal affairs

434
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,030
until you revive the Baize family.

435
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,830
This is the most crucial moment.

436
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,890
Don't be distracted

437
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,780
by those

438
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,940
misbehaving women.

439
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,270
Do you understand?

440
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,100
Answer me!

441
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,410
[Imperial Palace]

442
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,580
[Mingzong, the Emperor of Dazhou]

443
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:41,990
Nan Fengyi.

444
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,780
The entire Baize family were executed back in the day.

445
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,780
I believe you know very well

446
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,010
I kept you alive

447
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,620
so that you can

448
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,680
serve me at any time.

449
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,250
I will

450
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,080
forever be grateful for Your Majesty's kindness.

451
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,470
Lord Pei.

452
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,760
[Pei Xun, the Chief Minister of the Court of Judicature and Revision]

453
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:02,410
Your Majesty.

454
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:03,630
Rise.

455
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,540
I summoned you here today

456
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,530
to talk about Situ Hanshan.

457
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:11,710
We must get rid of him

458
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,990
to maintain the peace of Dazhou.

459
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,390
I've been

460
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,480
secretly gathering evidence

461
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,550
of Right Chancellor's clique and corruption.

462
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,630
But

463
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,070
Right Chancellor is very cunning.

464
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,530
He's left no trace.

465
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:24,750
And,

466
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,350
Situ's Mansion is heavily guarded all the time.

467
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,170
It must be extremely difficult

468
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,580
to get to his books.

469
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:30,790
There'll be an opportunity

470
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,760
if we wait.

471
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,750
[You're invited to the birthday party held at the Right Chancellor's Mansion on September 5th]

472
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,030
The six

473
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,380
favorite foods of cats in Dazhou,

474
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,460
I brought

475
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:45,760
them all here.

476
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:47,910
Sorry.

477
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,180
I also added some knockout drops.

478
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,840
Right Chancellor Situ really knows how to get along with people.

479
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,500
Free stage outside the mansion to win over the people.

480
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,520
Lavish banquet inside to make useful contacts.

481
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,420
I'm Chief Minister Pei.

482
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,520
I'm here to congratulate Right Chancellor Situ on his 40th birthday.

483
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,680
[Han Qi, guard of the Right Chancellor's Mansion]

484
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,170
Here's my gift.

485
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:18,590
Please, come in.

486
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,190
Do you know how much it costs?

487
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:30,780
Follow him.

488
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:31,990
Don't get yourself wet.

489
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,300
Okay.

490
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:40,290
That guy is sneaky.

491
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,920
Got ya!

492
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,190
Is that you, kitty?

493
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,170
Why can't I sense your demonic aura?

494
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,260
I can't

495
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,950
understand what you're saying either.

496
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,230
A Journal of My Remaining Years.

497
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,980
Did you leave this, kitty?

498
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,870
Looks like this cat

499
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,400
is owned by Lord Sikong's son,

500
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,640
Sikong She.

501
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,500
No wonder it doesn't want to leave this mansion.

502
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,320
It's actually an affectionate cat.

503
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,060
Have you seen Lord Pei from the Court of Judicature and Revision?

504
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,120
No.

505
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:51,990
Go find him!

506
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:52,550
Yes.

507
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,230
Hurry!

508
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:57,820
Pei,

509
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,210
what are you doing at Sikong's Mansion?

510
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,070
Little greedy cat.

511
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,270
Looks like the knockout drops...

512
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:46,630
It

513
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,080
worked.

514
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:00,310
Who...

515
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,460
Who are you?

516
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,900
Not bad, Umbrella.

517
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:00,350
Come on.

518
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,750
Oh, no.

519
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,990
Umbrella fails at the crucial moment.

520
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,170
Umbrella! Umbrella!

521
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,070
Umbrella.

522
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:17,980
Umbrella.

523
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,190
Help me!

524
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,740
This strange feeling again.

525
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,040
My magical powers seem to have suddenly increased.

526
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,630
What's happening?

527
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,090
Help me!

528
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:22,830
You killed him.

529
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,040
I...

530
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:37,980
He's a demon!

531
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,310
Who sent you?

532
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,470
Why did you kill him?

533
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,330
It wasn't me.

534
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,030
It was my umbrella.

535
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,450
I don't know what happened either.

536
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,430
Director Nan.

537
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,900
I'm the agent who sold that murder house.

538
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,750
Remember?

539
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,420
We met in this very house.

540
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,440
Don't be fooled by his appearance.

541
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:19,510
His body

542
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,190
has been taken over by a puppet worm.

543
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,950
Bullshit!

544
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,190
He was the Chief Minister of the Court of Judicature and Revision.

545
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,670
Chief Minister?

546
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:33,480
Oh, no.

547
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,260
You can explain everything in details

548
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,550
when we get to the Court.

549
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:42,870
Take her back!

550
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,290
[Situ's Mansion]

551
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:48,450
Master.

552
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,470
Pei Xun is dead.

553
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:54,240
[Situ Hanshan, Right Chancellor]

554
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,110
How did he die?

555
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,240
Some female agent

556
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:57,980
stabbed him with an umbrella

557
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,070
in the yard next door.

558
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,300
I didn't expect these parasitic puppet spirits

559
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,440
to be killed so easily.

560
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,490
Never mind.

561
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,080
Doesn't matter.

562
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:09,930
But…

563
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,900
If the Court do an autopsy,

564
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,130
our plan will be ruined.

565
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,400
Right, we should be more careful.

566
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,660
Han Qi,

567
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,030
take care of

568
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,090
Pei Xun's body.

569
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,270
Yes.

570
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,630

What's with the injury?

579
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,360
I was wounded by Lord Pei's hidden arrow.

He wanted to kill me.

581
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,620

Yes.

584

Why have I never seen you catch demons?

I caught my first demon.

But he fled in panic and climbed over the wall

681
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,390
I lied.

As for that journal,

702
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,070
I found it.

It's a friend of Sikong She's.

711
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:51,780
It must have brought it to me

to tell me something.

713
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:54,870
But

00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,160
I couldn't activate my Demon-Recognizing Pupils at that time.

715

716
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,810
This Demon-Recognizing Pupils you keep talking about,

717
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,470
what is it?

718
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,910
When it's activated, I can see demon forms.

719
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,420
I can even talk to demons.

720
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:08,100
You were able to recognize demons again

722
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:10,400
Yes!

723
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,320
No.

724
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:15,870
At first,

725
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,450
I couldn't see it.

726
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,920
But somehow,

727
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,330
suddenly I could see it again.

728
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,600
I saw

729
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:24,390
a puppet worm inside his body.

730
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:32,450
Go on.

731
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,050
It's been banned in Dazhou for a long time.

732
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,620
So, I was pretty shocked

733
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:38,010
when I saw it that night.

734
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,910
Do you think I'll believe you?

735
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,540
Yes.

736
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,910
If you have a coroner cut open his body

737
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,080
and find the puppet worm inside,

738
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,600
it will prove that what I said

739
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,800
is all true.

740
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,110

are all burning.

744
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,140
All the important physical evidence is here.

745
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,070
We can't let anything bad happen to it.

746
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,510
Lock her up.

747
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:03,310
I'll interrogate her later.

748
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:03,830
What should we do?

749
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,040
If the morgue is also burning,

750
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,590
