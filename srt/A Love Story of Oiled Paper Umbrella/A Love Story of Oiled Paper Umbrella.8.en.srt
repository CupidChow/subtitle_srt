4
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:42,910
Every time...

5
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,400
Every time Situ Hanshan was about to be caught,

6
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,070
there was always purple fog.

7
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,190
There's no doubt, then.

8
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,729
It must have been his accomplice who did it.

9
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,160
No.

10
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,350
In my opinion,

11
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,729
it was not his accomplice.

12
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,789
Then, what is it?

13
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:58,910
Junior.

14
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,270
Junior, bad news!

15
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,150
Bad news!

16
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,190
What's going on? Why are you in such a panic?

17
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:02,550
Cr...

18
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,070
Cr...

19
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:03,700
Cr...

20
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,760
Cr...

21
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,730
Cr...

22
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,750
You...

23
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,639
-Here comes the Crown Prince!
-What?

24
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,830
The Crown Prince?

25
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,410
Greetings, Your Highness.

26
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:20,860
Goddess.

27
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,290
I finally found you.

28
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,440
Your Highness.

29
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,190
You...

30
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:27,820
Leave.

31
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:30,170
Junior.

32
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:30,960
Let's go.

33
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,350
I came here

34
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,530
because I wanted to see you.

35
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,890
How are your hands?

36
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:39,820
Thank you for your concern.

37
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,750
My hands are

38
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,670
much better.

39
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,260
This is a special medicine prescribed by the imperial physician.

40
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,270
It specializes in minor injuries and bruises.

41
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,030
Take it.

42
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,600
Thank you, Your Highness.

43
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,230
Thank you for taking all the trouble to deliver it.

44
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,520
Changle City is in danger.

45
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:00,350
Your Highness, why are you here

46
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,800
instead of staying in the palace?

47
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,890
Greetings, Your Highness.

48
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,430
Nan, you came at the right time.

49
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,510
I'm here

50
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,630
just to

51
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:07,550
thank you

52
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,890
for saving my life last time.

53
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,940
I didn't see you in the umbrella shop.

54
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,270
That's why I came to the Celestial Master's Mansion to look for you.

55
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,400
Protecting the Crown Prince

56
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,060
is Meng Xizhou's

57
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,710
and my duty.

58
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,340
Your Highness, I appreciate your kindness.

59
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,240
It's just…

60
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,470
it's too dangerous outside.

61
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,820
It is.

62
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,060
But the Celestial Master's Mansion

63
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,030
is very safe.

64
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:24,810
That's right.

65
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,190
I'm here on my mother's order.

66
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,930
First, I'm holding a banquet to express my gratitude.

67
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,390
Second, I'm here to reserve umbrellas.

68
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,910
Reserve umbrellas?

69
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:37,079
In three days,

70
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,200
it's my Grand Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

71
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,280
By then, we'll

72
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,150
need 33

73
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,590
Royal tribute umbrellas.

74
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,550
The royal tribute umbrellas?

75
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,680
Then, wouldn't it make Nan

76
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,340
the imperial-appointed umbrella maker?

77
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,240
Of course.

78
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,110
Thirty-three.

79
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,600
I can't even finish them in three months,

80
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,870
let alone three days.

81
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,760
Impossible.

82
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,110
It's easy.

83
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,360
In your umbrella shop,

84
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,110
you must have many ready-made umbrella frames.

85
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,750
No…

86
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,790
Yes!

87
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,590
That's it, then.

88
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,710
Yes,

89
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,070
but…

90
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,750
they've been reserved from long before.

91
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,970
Just deliver those past the deadline.

92
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,230
Don't worry.

93
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,470
All the compensation

94
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,590
will be

95
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,750
paid by me.

96
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,320
All you need to do

97
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,870
is paste the Ministry of Rites paper

98
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,320
on the ready-made umbrella frames.

99
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:17,829
That's all.

100
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,820
You will be in charge of everything?

101
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,630
Then, it'll be easy.

102
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,830
My disciple!

103
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,870
We must take this order.

104
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,570
Even so,

105
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,120
if you fail,

106
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,750
you'll be executed.

107
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,390
Executed?

108
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,950
I'm in charge of this matter.

109
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:43,540
Don't worry.

110
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,180
No one will give you trouble.

111
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:47,909
Your Highness,

112
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,770
you are such a great friend.

113
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,260
With your words,

114
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,470
we can rest assured.

115
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:53,430
Right?

116
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,820
Greetings, Your Highness.

117
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:00,830
What?

118
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,230
We are ordered by the Emperor

119
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,760
to escort you back to the palace.

120
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,520
Did you tell His Majesty?

121
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,320
Nan Fengyi.

122
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,160
Are you trying to chase me away?

123
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,070
Your Highness.

124
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,850
His Majesty said

125
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,820
that if you're done with your business,

126
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,060
you should hurry back to the palace.

127
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:22,990
Please, Your Highness.

128
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,350
All right.

129
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,590
Two days later,

130
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,360
Meng Xizhou,

131
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,060
bring the tribute umbrellas

132
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,320
to the palace for an inspection.

133
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,280
See you then.

134
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,690
-Why her?
-Okay.

135
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,409
This is the order from Her Majesty and me.

136
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,560
Who dares to disobey?

137
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,600
My disciple,

138
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,300
it doesn't matter who's delivering them.

139
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:41,990
Your Highness,

140
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,560
buy me some delicious food by then.

141
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,200
Let's go, Your Highness.

142
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:45,750
Take care.

143
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,630
See you in the palace.

144
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,230
Take care.

145
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:47,960
See you in the palace.

146
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,000
Take care.

147
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,510
Take care.

148
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,030
Nan Fengyi.

149
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,510
Don't you think

150
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,770
you acted very impolitely?

151
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,550
Can't you see what he means?

152
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,550
We risked our lives to save him.

153
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,630
He repaid us with even more kindness.

154
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,750
What's the problem?

155
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,570
Don't you know he likes you?

156
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,870

00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,070
That's perfect.

♫The closer you are to me, the clearer the pain becomes♫

160
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,270
In that case,

161
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,430
I'll be the Crown Princess,

162
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,620
and the future Empress.

163
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,030
Then, you'll be the future Empress's master.

164
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,930
♫The most painful separation means you can't even miss her♫

165

Everyone can benefit from it.

Isn't it a good thing?

♫In silence, the world's grudges weave a web of entanglement♫

Why?

172

♫Under the umbrella, your profile is gently framed by the soft strands of your hair♫

00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,260

♫Should my heart belong to someone for ten thousand years♫

176
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,360

but not me.

180
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,430
What do you mean?

181
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,840
Actually, it's easy to

182
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,830
get someone aloof like us.

183
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,980
Sometimes,

184
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,960
we act distant

185
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,380
just because we're afraid of getting hurt.

186
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,550
You obviously care about me and worry about me,

187
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,460
but you always push me far away.

188
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,040
Master,

189
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,000
do you have feelings for…

190
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:42,590
No.

191
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,590
I just don't want to add unnecessary emotional turmoil for myself.

192
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,830
You have to take the initiative to eat

193
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,390
what you love to eat.

194
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,200
You have to take the initiative to chase

195
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,950
someone you like.

196
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,080
Let's go. I'll buy you a drink.

197
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,300
Okay.

198
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,540
[Nan's Umbrella Shop]

199
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,110
Today,

200
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,280
you didn't take me to patrol.

201
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,370
And you stayed in your room since you came back.

202
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,720
What are you doing?

203
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,270
Your injuries haven't recovered.

204
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,270
Why should I take you out?

205
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:39,909
Look.

206
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,320
My hands are much better now.

207
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,990
It seems the medicine from the Crown Prince

208
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,270
is quite effective.

209
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,830
Tell me.

210
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,830
Are you jealous?

211
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:07,910
You think too much.

212
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,580
My umbrella.

213
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,750
Before, Li Bai wrote a poem for his wife.

214
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,200
Today, my disciple

215
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,110
repairs my umbrella.

216
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,990
As your master,

217
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,390
I'm really...

218
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,550
really touched.

219
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,430
Don't make random analogies.

220
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,350
The romantic relationship between them

221
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,540
is not the same as ours.

222
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,880
Master, do you know?

223
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,670
This umbrella

224
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,670
is the only thing

225
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,110
my father left to me.

226
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,160
Its power is weak,

227
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,590
but

228
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,390
it has improved a lot

229
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,820
by following me.

230
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,350
With it by my side,

231
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,030
it feels like

232
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,800
my father is still by my side.

233
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,610
So...

234
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,090
no matter

235
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,150
how tattered and ragged it becomes,

236
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,220
I will never abandon it.

237
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,150
If your little umbrella is broken again,

238
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,740
come to me. I'll repair it.

239
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,830
What are you doing?

240
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,670
Let go!

241
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,050
Thank you, Master.

242
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,280
It's great

243
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,390
to have you.

244
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,780
It's not a big deal.

245
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,160
As a girl,

246
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,310
♫What is love, and how many can truly understand it?♫

247
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,050
don't act like you're so easy.

248
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:03,210
♫In the moment of writing, thousands of thoughts surge through my mind♫

249
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,620
♫Ink stains the paper, words not from the heart♫

250
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,100
♫I collide with the clock of fate♫

251
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,110
Master, what do you mean?

252
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:17,140
♫Your glance makes the moonlight surge♫

253
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,380
If you have seen the galaxy,

254
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,230
you won't care if a star is bright or not.

255
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:22,470
♫Your eyes mirror my flustered face♫

256
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,150
Don't act like

257
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,570
you're all so grateful

258
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,150
just because of a little favor from others.

259
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,050
♫How I wish this life could freeze in this moment♫

260
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,370
♫The impulse that pauses for you♫

261
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,750
Why do I feel you're more jealous?

262
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,580
♫My solitary courage and your smile♫

263
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,140
♫Unfamiliar with the ways of the world♫

264
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,190
It's just what's on my mind.

265
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,310
Since you are my disciple,

266
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:43,040
♫Love, at its deepest, is understood most by the lovers♫

267
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,510
I'll say more.

268
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:42,870
Okay.

269
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:46,920
♫The most unique, composed, and touching feelings♫

270
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,150
Master, tell me the truth.

271
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,350
Do you feel inferior

272
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:51,370
♫Are the special affection you've given me♫

273
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,790
compared to the Crown Prince?

274
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:59,170
♫Your gaze can't resist it, and my heart aches so deeply♫

275
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,590
Of course not.

276
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,470
Do you dare to look into my eyes

277
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:04,380
♫My tear stains, and you can't bear them♫

278
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,190
and say it again?

279
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,260
Yi, bring in the tribute umbrellas.

280
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:12,180
♫Though there are a thousand trials, I'll still seek this possibility♫

281
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,670
Yi!

282
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,870
Bring in the tribute umbrellas!

283
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,470
Let's go.

284
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:20,310
♫I'm waiting to be reborn in the wasteland in our next life♫

285
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,070
Yi, I've finished these over here.

286
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,230
Bring in those over there.

287
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,190
Master.

288
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,460
Don't get wet.

289
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,550
My legs are short,

290
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,750
so I can't walk fast. That's why I came a litte late.

291
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:11,830
It's raining heavily.

292
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,310
Why did you come out?

293
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,600
I want to say,

294
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,280
even if I've seen the galaxy,

295
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,340
♫The wind hesitates, not daring to smooth the furrowed brow♫

296
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,230
my favorite star

in my heart

298
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,500
is also the brightest one.

299
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,670
♫The rain hesitates, reluctant to burden the tear-streaked eyes beneath the umbrella♫

300
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,600
♫The closer you are to me, the clearer the pain becomes♫

301
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,270
So what if you have to cultivate?

302
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,380
I can wait for you.

303
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:41,400
♫The most painful separation means you can't even miss her♫

304
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,180
After you master the Big Dipper Primordial Spell…

305
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,680
It has nothing to do with that.

306
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,880
♫In silence, the world's grudges weave a web of entanglement♫

307
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,830
I don't like you.

308
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,970
But if you don't like me,

309
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:51,230
♫Under the clouds, the smoke from cooking rises and spreads freely♫

310
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,130
why do you hate to see it when others like me?

311
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,420
♫It's the love doomed by fate♫

312
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,750
You don't allow others to like you.

313
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,320
♫Under the umbrella, your profile is gently framed by the soft strands of your hair♫

314
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,930
That's not true!

♫Should my heart belong to someone for ten thousand years♫

316
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,350
Have you forgotten

what you said the first time I took you

318
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:09,380
♫Through endless lifetimes, softly and quietly, it flows on♫

319
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,550
to the stable of the Court of Judicature and Revision?

320
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,190
I

321
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,950
have a psychological flaw.

322
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,710
Over the years,

323
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,920
♫I won't lose you♫

324
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,720
I've admired quite a few men,

♫I'll sacrifice myself to help you♫

326
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,590
but as soon as they

327
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,110
showed any feelings for me,

328
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:23,100
♫With a single lamp and a thousand books, alone I'm restless through the night♫

329
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,670
I'd lose interest

330
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,790
or even feel disgusted.

331
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,350
So,

332
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,030
if you want to keep me as a friend,

333
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:29,720
♫Give me a fleeting moment of rain, to be held captive by your side♫

334
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,830
you should be cautious about

00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,770
confessing your love to me.

336
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,600
So,

337
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,070
if I show you my feelings,

338
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,350
would you be turned off

340
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,510
Yes.

341
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,250
I'll be turned off.

342
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,660
Forget it.

343
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,190
I'm destined not to be loved by anyone.

344
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,920
I can't blame anyone else.

345
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,700

you risked your life to save people.

352
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,760

♫The closer you are to me, the clearer the pain becomes♫

354

You're confident and outgoing.

You have all kinds of thoughts.

375
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:05,730
♫With a single lamp and a thousand books, alone I'm restless through the night♫

376
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:12,360
♫Give me a fleeting moment of rain, to be held captive by your side♫

377
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,630
♫Under the umbrella, your profile is gently framed by the soft strands of your hair♫

378
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,950
♫Should my heart belong to someone for ten thousand years♫

379
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:29,690
♫Through endless lifetimes, softly and quietly, it flows on♫

380
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,090
Why did I vomit?

381
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,350
Master.

382
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,240
♫I won't lose you♫

383
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,750
I'm so sleepy.

384
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:37,130
♫I'll sacrifice myself to help you♫

385
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,730
Sure enough.

386
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:43,410
♫With a single lamp and a thousand books, alone I'm restless through the night♫

387
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,710
I'm not an exception.

388
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:50,040
♫Give me a fleeting moment of rain, to be held captive by your side♫

389
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,859
Lord Situ,

390
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:17,589
just to get rid of Nan Fengyi,

391
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,430
you need to use half of your Demon Pill.

392
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,099
Is it worth it?

393
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:22,760
Only in this way

394
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,950
can I eliminate the biggest obstacle for my master

395
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,950
in the future.

396
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,480
Take care.

397
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,230
You drank too much

398
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,290
last night.

399
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:00,750
Yes.

400
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,600
After drinking,

401
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,420
I can't remember anything.

402
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,380
Do you remember

403
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,540
it rained last night?

404
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,240
It rained?

405
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,140
Really?

406
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,310
I...

407
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,550
I can't remember clearly.

408
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,070
I went back to my room and slept after drinking, right?

409
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,310
What?

410
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,060
What...

411
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,270
What else happened?

412
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,150
Well,

413
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,740
do you feel dizzy

414
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,620
or nauseous?

415
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,020
The horse is steady.

416
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,000
No.

417
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,370
I'm not dizzy at all.

418
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,850
Nothing happened.

419
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:44,190
Good.

420
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,230
After you enter the palace,

421
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,580
don't forget the rules.

422
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,120
Also,

423
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,680
what I told you before…

424
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,820
If I find the Puppet Spirit,

425
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,330
I'll send the paperman to inform you immediately.

426
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,270
I'll have a way to deal with it.

427
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,200
Okay.

428
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,990
You're Meng Xizhou from Nan's Umbrella Shop, right?

429
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,620
She's from the Empress' palace.

430
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,800
Yes, it's me.

431
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,600
This is the sample of the tribute umbrella?

432
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,070
You must be the Goddess the Crown Prince mentioned.

433
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,550
Come with me to pay homage to Her Majesty

434
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,720
and have the tribute umbrella checked.

435
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:52,850
Puppet…

436
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:53,890
Puppet Spirits!

437
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,190
Go and report to Master

438
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:58,780
that there are Puppet Spirits in the palace.

439
00:19:58,810 --> 00:19:59,410
-Okay.
-Go!

440
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:03,660
Oh no.

441
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,240
My Qi Core is leading too fast.

442
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,270
The Demon-Recognizing Pupils are disappearing.

443
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,950
I need to find out which palace they belong to first.

444
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,120
Oh no.

445
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,660
My Demon-Recognizing Pupils are not working.

446
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,450
They're all dressed up the same.

447
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,160
Which one is the Puppet Spirit?

448
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,790
Hurry up! Hurry up!

449
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:58,980
Over there.

450
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,740
They are all Puppet Spirits.

451
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,650
I know.

452
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,290
Wait for me here.

453
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,460
Don't expose yourself.

454
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,180
The one at the corner.

455
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:09,550
Yes.

456
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,220
Isn't this the Crown Prince's lunch box?

457
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,220
And these delicacies are all

458
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,510
the ones the Crown Prince treated me to.

459
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,230
They are going to the Eastern Palace!

460
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,360
The person they want to harm

461
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,410
is the Crown Prince!

462
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,140
[Eastern Palace]

463
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,350
What happened?

464
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,560
Something is wrong here.

465
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:15,750
You...

466
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,640
Go and help the Crown Prince to put on the clothes.

467
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,790
Yes.

468
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:37,510
Your Highness.

469
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:41,920
My belt is too loose.

470
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,110
Tighten it up.

471
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:44,630
Yes.

472
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,680
Do you think I can't tell

473
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,590
if you pretend to be a servant?

474
00:22:59,070 --> 00:22:59,910
Nan Fengyi!

475
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,120
Nan Fengyi?

476
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,760
Situ Hanshan.

477
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,360
Your Majesty, you've been so tired that you're even ill

478
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,430
because of Situ Hanshan.

479
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,070
After drinking the tranquilizing soup,

480
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,550
you can have a good sleep.

481
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,700
Tomorrow,

482
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,120
you can attend the Crown Prince's

483
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,000
Grand Coming-of-Age Ceremony radiantly.

484
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,700
You're right.

485
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,070
Tonight,

486
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,410
I won't see anyone.

487
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,550
Your Majesty!

488
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,940
No, I'm not seeing anyone.

489
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:32,760
The Eastern Palace…

490
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,030
Puppet Spirits are found in the Eastern Palace!

491
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,400
What about the Celestial Master's Mansion?

492
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,060
Someone has been sent to inform them.

493
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,630
Isn't the Crown Prince in danger?

494
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,860
Nan Fengyi's speculation was right.

495
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,270
He said there had been some abnormalities in the palace

496
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,250
and asked me to strengthen the security.

497
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:45,770
I didn't expect these demons

498
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,230
to come to target the Crown Prince.

499
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,100
Let's go.

500
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:48,730
Let's take a look.

501
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,160
Your Majesty.

502
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,010
The Celestial Master's Mansion will help control the situation of the Eastern Palace.

503
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,690
You're not fulled recovered, and your status is distinguished.

504
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,190
It's better not to go there rashly.

505
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,270
This is an important matter.

506
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,760
If I don't see who this demon is,

507
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,780
I can't rest assured.

508
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,130
Your Majesty,

509
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,250
don't worry too much.

510
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,620
His Majesty is the Emperor,

511
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,820
so demons dare not approach him.

512
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,410
Nan Fengyi, what are you doing?

513
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,790
Goddess!

514
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,160
Today, I will kill Situ Hanshan

515
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,640
to avenge my brother.

516
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,210
Situ Hanshan?

517
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:29,750
No.

518
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,180
He is the Crown Prince!

519
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,250
What's wrong with you?

520
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,640
Hurry up!

521
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,740
Hurry up!

522
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,600
Greetings, Your Majesty.

523
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,310
What?

524
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,510
Did the Celestial Master's Mansion only send the two of you?

525
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,190
Where is Du Fenglei?

526
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:50,550
Your Majesty,

527
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,950
we are taking shifts nearby,

528
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,850
so we rushed here to protect you.

529
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,050
Lord Du will be here soon.

530
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,550
There are demons in the Eastern Palace.

531
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:56,370
You can't go in there.

532
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,110
Li Hong'an.

533
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,280
How is the Crown Prince now?

534
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,470
Your Majesty,

535
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,270
Nan Fengyi and Master Meng from the Court of Judicature and Revision

536
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,940
are killing demons and saving the Crown Prince inside.

537
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:08,910
No.

538
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,510
Your Majesty,

539
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,060
why don't you send us to investigate first?

540
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,070
Please wait here.

541
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:15,980
No.

542
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,310
I'm worried.

543
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,790
At least I need to know

544
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,550
what demon is inside.

545
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:23,790
Your Majesty,

546
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:24,750
don't worry.

547
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:25,910
My junior and I can take two of them each.

548
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:26,710
Follow me.

549
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:27,360
I'll protect you.

550
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:28,420
Guo Ji.

551
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,120
Good!

552
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,270
Guo Ji.

553
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,820
How can you let His Majesty go in there?

554
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,040
I...

555
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,310
I...

556
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,120
Go!

557
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,150
Hurry!

558
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,170
I'm not Situ Hanshan.

559
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,350
I'm going to kill you

560
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,310
to avenge my friend!

561
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:45,790
Nan Fengyi!

562
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:46,180
You...

563
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,590
Nan Fengyi?

564
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,310
Yes.

565
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:50,860
Move!

566
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:52,760
How dare you!

567
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,820
This is the Crown Prince,

568
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:55,660
my son!

569
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:56,790
Get…

570
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,130
Oh no.

571
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,010
Master is about to unleash his internal power!

572
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,270
Protect me!

573
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,200
Protect me!

574
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,220
Protect me!

575
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,190
Nan Fengyi!

576
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:11,840
Nan Fengyi!

577
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:12,820
Nan Fengyi!

578
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,740
Your Highness, go!

579
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,560
-He's the Puppet Spirit!
-Nan Fengyi!

580
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,700
Hurry!

581
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,230
Go over there.

582
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,500
-Go!
-Nan Fengyi!

583
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,430
Nan Fengyi!

584
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,550
Nan Fengyi.

585
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:22,680
Nan Fengyi.

586
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,990
I'm Chirp.

587
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,020
Master.

588
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,040
Master.

589
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,710
Calm down.

590
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:32,710
Calm down.

591
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,320
Chirp.

592
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,040
It's me.

593
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:38,990
Nan Fengyi!

594
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:39,710
You...

595
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:42,720
♫The wind hesitates, not daring to smooth the furrowed brow♫

596
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,860
Are you a demon?

597
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:42,750
Your Majesty.

598
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,080
I'll take him back to the Celestial Master's Mansion immediately.

599
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,680
Your Majesty,

600
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:50,050
♫The rain hesitates, reluctant to burden the tear-streaked eyes beneath the umbrella♫

601
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,510
there must be a misunderstanding.

602
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,230
I'm not a demon.

603
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,160
Nan Fengyi, you...

604
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:51,660
Your Majesty.

605
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,080
After I bring him back,

606
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:56,980
♫The closer you are to me, the clearer the pain becomes♫

607
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,110
I'll find out

608
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,510
whether he is a human or a demon.

609
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,790
Fine.

610
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,740
Take him back and interrogate him carefully.

611
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,770
♫The most painful separation means you can't even miss her♫

612
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:01,270
Yes

613
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:03,790
Protect His Majesty!

614
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:09,250
♫In silence, the world's grudges weave a web of entanglement♫

615
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,610
♫Under the clouds, the smoke from cooking rises and spreads freely♫

616
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,050
If I don't go back with him now,

617
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,540
I'll fall into his trap, and you'll also be implicated.

618
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:17,800
♫It's the love doomed by fate♫

619
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:22,690
♫Under the umbrella, your profile is gently framed by the soft strands of your hair♫

620
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:19,680
Master.

621
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,870
I trust you.

622
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:26,000
♫Should my heart belong to someone for ten thousand years♫

623
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,600
You're not a demon.

624
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:31,750
♫Through endless lifetimes, softly and quietly, it flows on♫

625
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,790
And there is even less of a chance that you'd hurt the Crown Prince.

626
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,590
As long as you trust me,

627
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:36,300
♫I won't lose you♫

628
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,140
that's enough.

629
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,180
♫I'll sacrifice myself to help you♫

630
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:45,470
♫With a single lamp and a thousand books, alone I'm restless through the night♫

631
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,700
Master.

632
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:52,100
♫Give me a fleeting moment of rain, to be held captive by your side♫

633
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,750
Actually, last night,

634
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,200
I vomited because I was drunk.

635
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,030
I remember

636
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,210
everything you said.

637
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,950
Master.

638
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,040
I will definitely prove your innocence.

639
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,810
I've worked with the Celestial Master's Mansion for a long time.

640
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,070
How could you misjudge me like this?

641
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,160
I really admire you.

642
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,400
Bah!

643
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,720
If you're not a demon,

644
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,930
why do you have scales on your neck?

645
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,750
Do you think we're stupid?

646
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:11,670
Also,

647
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:12,500
confess honestly:

648
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,200
Why did you try to kill the Crown Prince?

649
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,540
Where on earth is

650
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,760
Situ Hanshan hiding?

651
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,160
Situ Hanshan was sowing discord

652
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,350
in order to achieve the greater conspiracy.

653
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:23,830
Fine.

654
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,410
Even if I believe

655
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,240
that it was his scheme, as you said,

656
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,750
how do you explain

657
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:29,710
your demon body?

658
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:33,630
See?

659
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,990
Can't explain, huh?

660
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,150
You admitted it, didn't you?

661
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,310
How long can a demon

662
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,520
show its true form in this formation?

663
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:43,180
Even if you are the Demon King,

664
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,760
inside the Demon Refining Pagoda,

665
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,100
you'll definitely show your true form

666
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,870
within three days.

667
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:48,530
Okay.

668
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,550
In three days,

669
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,220
you can see if I'm a human or a demon.

670
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,330
You still don't admit it?

671
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:56,830
Listen.

672
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,900
The more you struggle,

673
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,930
the more it will backfire in the Demon Refining Pagoda.

674
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,110
I advise you

675
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,970
to tell us Situ Hanshan's whereabouts.

676
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,480
Then, I can spare you

677
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,100
from these tortures.

678
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,440
You just want to take the hard way, huh?

679
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:14,530
Stop!

680
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,310
-My lord.
-My lord.

681
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,020
Master.

682
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,110
Stop torturing him.

683
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:23,710
Just lock him here for three days.

684
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:24,640
Master.

685
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,740
Since it's such a good opportunity,

686
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,030
if we can't get anything from him,

687
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,390
then...

688
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,060
All right.

689
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,320
You may leave.

690
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:34,530
Yes.

691
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,860
Although I didn't see it with my own eyes,

692
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,090
I'm still willing

693
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,330
to believe that you are not a demon.

694
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,160
In three days,

695
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,430
the truth will be out.

696
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,800
Master,

697
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,920
I vomited because I was drunk.

698
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,950
I remember

699
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,300
everything you said.

700
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,420
Chirp.

701
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:17,900
Chirp.

702
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,400
Wait for me.

703
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:28,840
Master,

704
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,180
don't be too soft-hearted.

705
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,710
Nan Fengyi

706
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,610
has been pretending to be a human for so long,

707
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,040
but he's actually a demon.

708
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,530
After he's been turned to its true form,

709
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:39,770
let's torture him.

710
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,550
I don't believe he still won't confess

711
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,430
where Situ Hanshan is by then.

712
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,470
It's not that simple.

713
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,070
Tomorrow is

714
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,430
the Crown Prince's Grand Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

715
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,360
We must be cautious.

716
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,310
Investigate Nan Fengyi…

717
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,080
and his father,

718
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,220
Nan Sixu.
