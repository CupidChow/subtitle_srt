1
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:25,260


2
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,459
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:35,080
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:47,779
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,779 --> 00:00:53,159
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,159
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:03,479
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,579
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,679
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:18,539
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

12
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:23,900
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:29,139
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:36,918
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,019
   

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,059
   

17
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:44,939
   

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
   

19
00:01:51,985 --> 00:01:54,565
What are you and Brother Yan talking about?

20
00:01:55,244 --> 00:01:57,823
- Brother? 
 - Ju'er.

21
00:02:04,545 --> 00:02:07,564
Aren't you supposed to be resting at your temporary imperial residence?

22
00:02:07,564 --> 00:02:10,565
Why did you suddenly return at this late hour?

23
00:02:11,124 --> 00:02:13,844
I suddenly remembered I had forgotten something important.

24
00:02:13,844 --> 00:02:16,125
So I came back to retrieve them.

25
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,904
Ridiculous.

26
00:02:18,624 --> 00:02:21,044
If you forgot something,

27
00:02:21,044 --> 00:02:23,863
couldn't you have the eunuchs or the palace maids retrieve it for you?

28
00:02:23,864 --> 00:02:27,224
I was afraid you wouldn't give it to them if they came to retrieve it.

29
00:02:30,385 --> 00:02:34,485
Mother, Brother Yan and I have important matters to discuss.

30
00:02:34,485 --> 00:02:36,484
We will take our leave first.

31
00:02:37,945 --> 00:02:40,245
Both of you, stop right there.

32
00:02:47,144 --> 00:02:51,744
Since you've already returned, why are you in such a hurry to retrieve it?

33
00:02:51,744 --> 00:02:54,724
Now that you're here,

34
00:02:54,724 --> 00:02:57,544
we can see Lord Ding off together.

35
00:02:57,545 --> 00:02:59,045
Mother!

36
00:03:00,324 --> 00:03:02,704
You promised me!

37
00:03:03,304 --> 00:03:06,184
The imperial physician said you mustn't get agitated.

38
00:03:06,184 --> 00:03:07,544
Your Majesty.

39
00:03:07,545 --> 00:03:10,104
Someone, summon the imperial physician at once.

40
00:03:10,105 --> 00:03:11,705
No need.

41
00:03:12,505 --> 00:03:14,485
Mother, don't trouble yourself.

42
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,445
What are you saying?

43
00:03:16,445 --> 00:03:20,545
You keep telling me not to get agitated.

44
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:27,900
But have you thought about where this agitation comes from?

45
00:03:34,184 --> 00:03:37,305
Heaven watches everything we do.

46
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:41,085
Nothing can escape the eyes of Heaven.

47
00:03:48,484 --> 00:03:54,165
Your illness is causing you to speak nonsense.

48
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:58,904
Your Highness, who do you think Brother is doing this for?

49
00:04:00,545 --> 00:04:02,743
Then, who am I doing it for?

50
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:04,825
For me.

51
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:06,405
Am I right?

52
00:04:10,904 --> 00:04:13,205
If you didn't return to the palace,

53
00:04:14,345 --> 00:04:17,485
he would have died by now.

54
00:04:17,485 --> 00:04:21,844
You were away from the palace when Lord Ding met a sudden death.

55
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:24,644
He already has old illnesses.

56
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:28,245
People wouldn't suspect you were behind it.

57
00:04:30,264 --> 00:04:35,364
Your Highness, you finally admitted it.

58
00:04:41,624 --> 00:04:44,864
So what if I was behind it?

59
00:04:44,864 --> 00:04:47,145
You should have died long ago.

60
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:55,504
If Consort Yun hadn't cut her belly to give birth 30 years ago,

61
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,845
the one who should've died would have been you.

62
00:04:58,864 --> 00:05:05,205
If Chen'er hadn't saved you five years ago, you should've died as well.

63
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:07,805
Why aren't you dead?

64
00:05:12,744 --> 00:05:18,364
He's my younger brother and the son you raised.

65
00:05:18,364 --> 00:05:23,924
After so many years, don't you have even a shred of affection for him?

66
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:28,105
I don't.

67
00:05:29,164 --> 00:05:31,744
Why would I have any affection for him?

68
00:05:34,925 --> 00:05:39,025
His mother took my husband away.

69
00:05:40,744 --> 00:05:43,185
She finally died.

70
00:05:44,204 --> 00:05:48,785
But your father still wanted to follow her.

71
00:05:49,524 --> 00:05:52,824
If it weren't for the sake of keeping the late emperor alive,

72
00:05:52,824 --> 00:05:55,364
I wouldn't have let him live.

73
00:05:57,145 --> 00:06:00,105
So when Father passed away,

74
00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:03,585
you couldn't wait to have Yan'er dead.

75
00:06:03,585 --> 00:06:06,004
He was only six years old back then.

76
00:06:06,444 --> 00:06:11,263
How could you be so heartless to have someone push such a young child into a cold pond?

77
00:06:16,624 --> 00:06:18,124
Ju'er.

78
00:06:20,304 --> 00:06:22,564
You're my son.

79
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:27,724
Why do you always side with him in everything?

80
00:06:27,724 --> 00:06:29,844
In this world,

81
00:06:31,545 --> 00:06:35,605
we can only rely on each other now.

82
00:06:37,424 --> 00:06:42,065
You, your father, and Chen'er.

83
00:06:42,065 --> 00:06:45,524
All of you take his side.

84
00:06:45,524 --> 00:06:47,204
Am I doing this...

85
00:06:47,204 --> 00:06:51,845
Am I doing all of this for myself?

86
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,845
But, Mother,

87
00:06:55,844 --> 00:06:58,745
even if you have hatred,

88
00:06:58,745 --> 00:07:02,264
Consort Yun and Father are already dead.

89
00:07:02,264 --> 00:07:04,864
Brother is innocent.

90
00:07:06,624 --> 00:07:08,124
Mother...

91
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,785
So I deserve it?

92
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:20,944
Do I deserve to suffer like this?

93
00:07:31,644 --> 00:07:34,584
I had a husband.

94
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:40,305
Before he died, his last word for me...

95
00:07:41,705 --> 00:07:44,285
was to take care of Liu Yan.

96
00:07:45,145 --> 00:07:47,224
Then he left.

97
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:52,764
He has found peace and gone to find his beloved woman.

98
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,805
I treated him as my husband.

99
00:08:02,225 --> 00:08:07,704
But in his heart, I was just an empress.

100
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:12,785
I was never his wife.

101
00:08:19,744 --> 00:08:22,324
If you really loved Father,

102
00:08:23,705 --> 00:08:27,084
you shouldn't have killed the person he cared about the most.

103
00:08:40,945 --> 00:08:43,744
When the person he cared for the most died,

104
00:08:48,245 --> 00:08:51,444
should he also die with her?

105
00:08:53,185 --> 00:08:57,905
Is there nothing else in this world besides love?

106
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,424
I loved him so much.

107
00:09:03,345 --> 00:09:06,184
But he died.

108
00:09:06,185 --> 00:09:08,685
Yet, I have to keep living...

109
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:13,211
while carrying the burden of his responsibilities.

110
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,645
Not only do I hate him,

111
00:09:27,664 --> 00:09:30,025
but I also look down on him.

112
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,710
   
 Madam! 

113
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:41,324
Father sent his men multiple times to make me act.

114
00:09:41,324 --> 00:09:44,044
Now she was about to give birth,

115
00:09:44,044 --> 00:09:46,985
it was the last chance.

116
00:09:46,985 --> 00:09:49,244
His Majesty loved her so dearly.

117
00:09:49,264 --> 00:09:51,664
If her son was born,

118
00:09:51,664 --> 00:09:55,484
wouldn't Ju'er lose his chance to become the Crown Prince?

119
00:09:56,664 --> 00:10:00,325
But she was also my friend.

120
00:10:00,325 --> 00:10:03,024
How could I bear to hurt her?

121
00:10:13,644 --> 00:10:19,003
 I never thought Father would secretly use Fu Shengru's medicine behind my back. 

122
00:10:19,003 --> 00:10:21,244
After Consort Yun died,

123
00:10:21,244 --> 00:10:24,744
I was completely pushed onto a path of no return.

124
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:35,385
You could've hated the late Emperor and Consort Yun or blamed me.

125
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:39,585
But you should have never,

126
00:10:39,585 --> 00:10:43,543
ever let your selfishness cause the death of 30,000 soldiers

127
00:10:43,544 --> 00:10:46,625
and shake the foundation of Southern Chen.

128
00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:51,064
No matter what, today,

129
00:10:51,064 --> 00:10:55,524
I'm going to seek justice for the thirty thousand souls who perished.

130
00:10:56,305 --> 00:10:58,284
Do you have evidence?

131
00:10:58,985 --> 00:11:05,264
Accusing me without proof is treason.

132
00:11:07,345 --> 00:11:08,945
Your Highness,

133
00:11:11,744 --> 00:11:14,905
   
 don't you even recognize your command badge? 

134
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,240
   

135
00:11:42,845 --> 00:11:46,024
It was their fault for being your subordinates.

136
00:11:49,444 --> 00:11:52,524
They all died because of you.

137
00:11:53,065 --> 00:11:56,963
I had a hold of the map of your marching route, and I was struggling to send it out.

138
00:11:56,963 --> 00:11:59,505
But Heaven was on my side.

139
00:12:00,264 --> 00:12:04,725
Xue Xiaotang captured a spy from Northern Liang.

140
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:09,845
The map of the marching route still ended up in the hands of the Northern Liang people.

141
00:12:09,845 --> 00:12:11,504
Tell me.

142
00:12:12,085 --> 00:12:14,584
Is this not fate?

143
00:12:24,725 --> 00:12:28,825
Mother, just let it go.

144
00:12:28,825 --> 00:12:31,025
At this point,

145
00:12:32,825 --> 00:12:35,084
if I were to back down,

146
00:12:35,084 --> 00:12:37,885
would Liu Yan let me go?

147
00:12:39,144 --> 00:12:42,044
Instead of waiting to be killed,

148
00:12:43,325 --> 00:12:46,125
it's better to eliminate hidden danger permanently.

149
00:12:48,544 --> 00:12:51,284
You can try that.

150
00:12:55,624 --> 00:12:57,944
There's no need for that anymore.

151
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:59,645
I've told...

152
00:13:01,225 --> 00:13:03,544
all of your men to leave.

153
00:13:08,225 --> 00:13:14,325
Back then, I was afraid of facing a situation like today.

154
00:13:15,065 --> 00:13:17,465
So I sent out the Imperial Shadow Guards...

155
00:13:18,504 --> 00:13:21,045
to silence anyone...

156
00:13:22,985 --> 00:13:25,444
who knew the truth.

157
00:13:28,744 --> 00:13:31,644
I'm not a benevolent ruler.

158
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,025
I'm just a selfish and despicable person.

159
00:13:36,544 --> 00:13:41,644
To protect my closest kin, I could only pick up the butcher's knife...

160
00:13:42,784 --> 00:13:45,484
and kill innocent people.

161
00:14:06,564 --> 00:14:08,164
Mother,

162
00:14:10,345 --> 00:14:14,143
you and Brother Yan are my most important family.

163
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,263
I can't watch you kill Brother Yan.

164
00:14:16,264 --> 00:14:20,023
But I also don't want Brother Yan to seek revenge after knowing the truth.

165
00:14:20,024 --> 00:14:21,624
Mother...

166
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,525
Brother Yan,

167
00:14:31,144 --> 00:14:33,225
can you forgive her?

168
00:14:38,365 --> 00:14:41,105
She killed my mother

169
00:14:41,105 --> 00:14:43,845
and so many people.

170
00:14:44,624 --> 00:14:50,664
Their blood and hatred are flowing in my veins.

171
00:14:51,384 --> 00:14:53,824
Can I forgive?

172
00:14:53,824 --> 00:14:56,624
Who am I to forgive?

173
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,565
Brother,

174
00:15:02,544 --> 00:15:07,344
go and ask those who are already dead.

175
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:26,504
You're right.

176
00:15:27,465 --> 00:15:29,604
What right do I have...

177
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:32,825
to tell you to stop your hatred?

178
00:15:41,425 --> 00:15:43,303
- Brother! 
 - Ju'er!

179
00:15:44,784 --> 00:15:45,763
Brother!

180
00:15:45,763 --> 00:15:48,724
Ju'er! Ju'er!

181
00:15:52,945 --> 00:15:54,523
- Ju'er! 
 - Brother.

182
00:15:54,523 --> 00:15:58,344
Ju'er, what's wrong with you?

183
00:15:58,345 --> 00:16:00,143
I will go and call the imperial physician.

184
00:16:00,144 --> 00:16:02,304
I'll go and get the imperial physician.

185
00:16:02,304 --> 00:16:04,425
It's already too late.

186
00:16:11,365 --> 00:16:12,965
Brother Yan,

187
00:16:14,384 --> 00:16:20,165
I'm entrusting both Southern Chen and my children to you.

188
00:16:21,024 --> 00:16:23,005
Spare Mother.

189
00:16:24,365 --> 00:16:28,144
You must live on.

190
00:16:28,144 --> 00:16:29,944
Ju'er...

191
00:16:29,944 --> 00:16:31,825
Brother.

192
00:17:02,185 --> 00:17:05,085
   

193
00:17:30,385 --> 00:17:32,964
My Lord! My Lord.

194
00:17:47,004 --> 00:17:48,704
Your Highness.

195
00:18:17,185 --> 00:18:18,785
Your Highness.

196
00:18:20,185 --> 00:18:21,985
Xiaotang.

197
00:18:25,024 --> 00:18:27,244
She's calling my name.

198
00:18:27,905 --> 00:18:30,544
Your Highness... Your Highness!

199
00:18:42,185 --> 00:18:44,644
I never thought...

200
00:18:46,465 --> 00:18:50,325
that one day I would be able to meet you

201
00:18:50,325 --> 00:18:52,745
and hold you in my arms openly.

202
00:18:54,504 --> 00:18:57,764
I thought it was something that'd only happen in dreams.

203
00:18:57,764 --> 00:19:01,584
Rest assured, it's not a dream.

204
00:19:02,425 --> 00:19:04,225
I'm right here.

205
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:07,705
You no longer have to be afraid anymore...

206
00:19:08,905 --> 00:19:11,644
because Dowager Empress has confessed...

207
00:19:34,304 --> 00:19:38,965
When we were betrothed, you said you were willing to give up your life for me.

208
00:19:38,965 --> 00:19:43,604
Now, I will fulfill your wish.

209
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:58,225
 Thank you for everything you've done for me over these years. 

210
00:20:03,605 --> 00:20:07,104
 All these years, 

211
00:20:07,104 --> 00:20:09,524
 causing countless innocent lives to suffer. 

212
00:20:09,524 --> 00:20:13,824
 Now, you've come to this ending, you could say it's not unjust. 

213
00:20:45,705 --> 00:20:48,043
- My Lord! 
 - My Lord!

214
00:20:50,904 --> 00:20:52,604
How is His Lordship?

215
00:20:53,344 --> 00:20:55,004
 Hurry, someone come quickly! Save His Majesty! 

216
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,704
 Something happened in the main hall! 

217
00:20:56,705 --> 00:20:58,464
Fast, come to His Majesty's aid! Save His Majesty!

218
00:20:58,464 --> 00:21:01,105
Save His Majesty in the main hall!

219
00:21:01,105 --> 00:21:02,303
Someone is heading this way.

220
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:06,163
If they discover us at this moment, it will be hard for His Lordship to justify the crime of regicide.

221
00:21:06,163 --> 00:21:08,503
 Something happened in the main hall! Quick, save His Majesty! 

222
00:21:08,504 --> 00:21:11,764
Hurry! Save His Majesty!

223
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,080
   

224
00:21:18,425 --> 00:21:19,825
Your Majesty.

225
00:21:24,865 --> 00:21:26,365
Dowager Empress?

226
00:21:28,064 --> 00:21:29,664
Your Majesty.

227
00:21:39,744 --> 00:21:41,244
Your Majesty...

228
00:21:42,204 --> 00:21:43,364
Your Majesty!

229
00:21:43,364 --> 00:21:46,905
His Majesty has left us!

230
00:21:48,705 --> 00:21:51,765
 His Majesty has passed away! 

231
00:22:30,484 --> 00:22:32,325
Father?

232
00:22:35,824 --> 00:22:37,724
Father...

233
00:22:42,385 --> 00:22:44,525
Father!

234
00:22:57,225 --> 00:23:02,664
 His Lordship once said the water in the back garden of Ciming Hall flows to the moat. 

235
00:23:02,664 --> 00:23:06,444
 Under the cover of night, we should be able to make our escape. 

236
00:23:55,585 --> 00:23:58,185
   

237
00:24:15,045 --> 00:24:16,645
Ju'er...

238
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:21,685
Ju'er...

239
00:24:25,684 --> 00:24:27,484
Grandmother.

240
00:24:29,144 --> 00:24:31,023
Father is gone.

241
00:24:31,024 --> 00:24:32,824
Insolence!

242
00:24:38,304 --> 00:24:40,585
My son isn't dead.

243
00:24:43,784 --> 00:24:45,764
He's still alive.

244
00:24:47,665 --> 00:24:53,065
Grandmother, stop deceiving yourself.

245
00:24:53,065 --> 00:24:55,504
Father is already gone.

246
00:24:56,104 --> 00:24:58,344
He died because of you.

247
00:24:59,744 --> 00:25:01,063
How dare you?

248
00:25:01,064 --> 00:25:02,704
How insolent...

249
00:25:05,185 --> 00:25:10,004
Father died because of you, Grandmother.

250
00:25:16,945 --> 00:25:18,824
I see.

251
00:25:20,784 --> 00:25:24,445
Your obedience all this time

252
00:25:24,445 --> 00:25:27,445
was just a pretense.

253
00:25:27,445 --> 00:25:30,765
I've really misjudged the situation.

254
00:25:41,924 --> 00:25:43,724
You wicked child.

255
00:25:48,584 --> 00:25:54,384
Peilan, drag this wicked child out of here.

256
00:26:15,225 --> 00:26:17,025
Greetings, Your Highness.

257
00:26:17,665 --> 00:26:18,865
You...

258
00:26:28,104 --> 00:26:29,604
The two of you...

259
00:26:29,604 --> 00:26:36,465
Grandmother, your most trusted Peilan actually works for me.

260
00:26:45,865 --> 00:26:49,384
Weren't you the orphan from the Zhou family's branch?

261
00:26:49,385 --> 00:26:52,164
I've always been working for Jishan Hall.

262
00:26:52,164 --> 00:26:55,844
Back then, if Princess Roujia hadn't taken me in,

263
00:26:55,844 --> 00:26:58,565
I would have been dead now.

264
00:26:58,565 --> 00:27:00,644
You can leave now.

265
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:06,224
Let me have a proper conversation with my grandmother.

266
00:27:06,744 --> 00:27:08,144
Yes, Your Highness.

267
00:27:12,985 --> 00:27:15,425
You wicked child.

268
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,584
What are you planning to do?

269
00:27:18,225 --> 00:27:20,964
- I'm going to... 
 - Going to what?

270
00:27:21,824 --> 00:27:23,985
Execute me?

271
00:27:24,865 --> 00:27:29,465
Grandmother, you're as heartless as ever.

272
00:27:30,064 --> 00:27:31,764
But I understand why.

273
00:27:31,764 --> 00:27:34,204
If you weren't heartless,

274
00:27:34,204 --> 00:27:40,065
you wouldn't have plotted to let Uncle die on the battlefield at Juma River.

275
00:27:46,104 --> 00:27:47,704
Why?

276
00:27:48,945 --> 00:27:51,625
You don't think I should know about this. Right?

277
00:27:54,385 --> 00:27:59,085
Grandmother, you thought you were the strategist.

278
00:27:59,085 --> 00:28:03,364
But little do you know that you were merely

279
00:28:03,364 --> 00:28:06,444
a pawn in my hands.

280
00:28:10,705 --> 00:28:13,824
Do you still remember the spy of Northern Liang?

281
00:28:13,824 --> 00:28:15,724
It was you?

282
00:28:18,344 --> 00:28:23,743
Did you intentionally leak the information about the spy of Northern Liang to me?

283
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,484
Yes, it was me.

284
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,425
I used the intelligence network of Jishan Hall

285
00:28:29,425 --> 00:28:34,083
to find clues about the spy of Northern Liang and informed Xue Xiaotang.

286
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:39,885
Otherwise, do you think you could have easily injured Uncle so severely?

287
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:43,524
Why did you do that?

288
00:28:44,225 --> 00:28:46,104
What do you think?

289
00:28:50,024 --> 00:28:55,945
Over the past five years, could you have been having nightmares?

290
00:28:58,064 --> 00:29:02,484
Nightmares about unjust spirits seeking vengeance from you?

291
00:29:05,784 --> 00:29:07,465
In your dreams,

292
00:29:09,304 --> 00:29:11,225
do you see Xing?

293
00:29:16,865 --> 00:29:18,365
Why?

294
00:29:20,085 --> 00:29:21,885
Did you forget?

295
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:31,065
But Xing'er's daughter remembers everything very clearly.

296
00:29:43,304 --> 00:29:49,304
 Your Highness, will the Crown Prince blame me for this when he returns? 

297
00:29:51,784 --> 00:29:55,559
 It's just the death of a lowly maidservant. 

298
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:57,823
 (Xing, Princess Roujia's birth mother]  
 He'll understand.

299
00:29:57,823 --> 00:30:00,177
 (Xing, Princess Roujia's birth mother]  
 Compared to a nobody,

300
00:30:00,178 --> 00:30:03,144
the power of noble families matters the most.

301
00:30:03,145 --> 00:30:04,645
Yes, Your Majesty.

302
00:30:08,584 --> 00:30:12,383
Back then, to secure Father's position as Crown Prince,

303
00:30:12,385 --> 00:30:15,505
you arranged a high-born lady for him to marry.

304
00:30:15,505 --> 00:30:18,145
You could have arranged it.

305
00:30:18,145 --> 00:30:20,624
Was my mother in your way?

306
00:30:22,744 --> 00:30:24,985
Just because she was favored?

307
00:30:24,985 --> 00:30:27,745
That's why you heartlessly killed her?

308
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:42,004
It was cramped and dark in the cabinet.

309
00:30:43,225 --> 00:30:45,165
I didn't dare make a sound.

310
00:31:07,204 --> 00:31:09,764
My mother sacrificed herself to protect me.

311
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:14,084
How could I let her earnest efforts go in vain?

312
00:31:17,225 --> 00:31:18,825
Grandmother,

313
00:31:20,225 --> 00:31:26,105
you made me realize how important power is.

314
00:31:26,905 --> 00:31:29,805
Only when you stand in a high place

315
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:32,625
can you avoid being bullied.

316
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:34,585
But back then,

317
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:38,344
I didn't even have the ability to protect myself.

318
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,984
   

319
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:45,644
Father feared I'd meet a tragic end.

320
00:31:45,644 --> 00:31:49,204
So he asked Grandaunt to take me to Jiangnan.

321
00:31:56,865 --> 00:32:02,404
 Jiaojiao, I'm taking you to Jiangnan. 

322
00:32:02,404 --> 00:32:05,844
 It's much more fun there 

323
00:32:05,844 --> 00:32:08,865
 with its beautiful mountains and rivers than in the capital. 

324
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:14,064
 Stop the carriage. 

325
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:18,450
   

326
00:32:37,865 --> 00:32:39,565
Come here, my dear.

327
00:32:40,824 --> 00:32:43,604
Do you know why I grabbed that handful of soil?

328
00:32:44,425 --> 00:32:47,045
It's not an attachment to the homeland.

329
00:32:48,045 --> 00:32:51,744
It was to constantly remind myself

330
00:32:51,744 --> 00:32:54,304
that my enemies are here.

331
00:32:54,304 --> 00:32:56,745
I wanted to come back and seek revenge.

332
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:02,045
I wanted to make sure those who treat others as nothing

333
00:33:02,045 --> 00:33:07,244
and bully the weak receive their rightful punishment.

334
00:33:08,225 --> 00:33:10,376
With the support of Grandaunt's influence,

335
00:33:10,376 --> 00:33:16,117
I established Jishan Hall and helped many unfortunate people like me.

336
00:33:16,117 --> 00:33:19,505
When they hailed me as a reincarnated goddess,

337
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,784
I became even more resolute

338
00:33:22,784 --> 00:33:25,484
to become the ruler of this country.

339
00:33:26,385 --> 00:33:29,184
I want to save more people

340
00:33:29,184 --> 00:33:31,905
and make this country better.

341
00:33:34,724 --> 00:33:37,044
But I've never forgotten...

342
00:33:37,945 --> 00:33:40,765
to avenge my poor mother.

343
00:33:44,185 --> 00:33:48,123
After Father ascended the throne, he didn't summon me back to the capital.

344
00:33:49,185 --> 00:33:51,265
After sitting on the throne,

345
00:33:51,265 --> 00:33:54,805
perhaps he had forgotten he had a daughter like me.

346
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:59,605
So I had to find my own way.

347
00:34:02,104 --> 00:34:05,903
That's why I wrote a letter

348
00:34:05,905 --> 00:34:08,585
and sent it along with that handful of soil.

349
00:34:10,024 --> 00:34:12,364
After being apart for many years,

350
00:34:12,364 --> 00:34:15,504
I missed my beloved family in the capital.

351
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:20,244
How could he refuse my longing as a daughter?

352
00:34:28,745 --> 00:34:31,124
You should remember. Right?

353
00:34:31,124 --> 00:34:35,503
Peilan came to you that year.

354
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:40,864
I released the venomous snake in the back mountains of Huguo Temple.

355
00:34:40,864 --> 00:34:45,985
It was all to have Peilan save you from danger.

356
00:34:45,985 --> 00:34:51,404
You've always had deep suspicions and disdain for the poor.

357
00:34:51,404 --> 00:34:55,325
So, I had to fabricate a story

358
00:34:55,325 --> 00:34:58,685
about her being an orphan of the Zhou family's branch.

359
00:34:59,385 --> 00:35:02,923
As expected, you put your guard down and kept her by your side.

360
00:35:02,923 --> 00:35:08,045
This way, I had my informant by your side.

361
00:35:08,045 --> 00:35:12,764
Whenever there was any unusual movement from you, Peilan would let me know.

362
00:35:15,925 --> 00:35:18,025
Grandmother.

363
00:35:18,025 --> 00:35:20,924
To secure Father's position as the ruler,

364
00:35:20,924 --> 00:35:23,365
you truly resorted to any means.

365
00:35:24,345 --> 00:35:27,664
You even plotted to have Uncle die on the battlefield

366
00:35:27,664 --> 00:35:30,404
during his war campaign against Northern Liang.

367
00:35:32,745 --> 00:35:34,925
But I still need to thank you.

368
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:38,724
I was worried about not finding an opportunity for revenge.

369
00:35:38,724 --> 00:35:42,625
I heard Xue Xiaotang had always admired me.

370
00:35:43,624 --> 00:35:47,004
Indeed, I only used a little trick,

371
00:35:47,004 --> 00:35:49,004
and he took the bait.

372
00:35:53,365 --> 00:35:57,665
 Are you satisfied with him, Roujia? 

373
00:36:00,104 --> 00:36:02,784
According to Jishan Hall's intelligence,

374
00:36:02,784 --> 00:36:07,423
I learned that Xue Xiaotang had been colluding with you and the Zhou family.

375
00:36:08,885 --> 00:36:12,604
All the dirty deals have never stopped.

376
00:36:13,544 --> 00:36:15,945
Only this time,

377
00:36:15,945 --> 00:36:20,085
your pawn became mine.

378
00:36:21,184 --> 00:36:24,724
Upon hearing about my mother's tragic death at your hands,

379
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:28,924
he willingly became the blade in my hand.

380
00:36:30,424 --> 00:36:32,864
 The Dowager Empress summoned me to the palace today. 

381
00:36:34,084 --> 00:36:36,284
 She ordered me to kill Lord Ding... 

382
00:36:39,504 --> 00:36:42,004
 and not to stay on the battlefield. 

383
00:36:44,104 --> 00:36:48,865
He told me about your conspiracy to kill Uncle

384
00:36:48,865 --> 00:36:51,844
and bury the thirty thousand soldiers along with him.

385
00:36:53,584 --> 00:36:59,064
But you had no way to deliver the map of the marching route to Northern Liang.

386
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:03,884
So, I could only lend you a hand.

387
00:37:06,365 --> 00:37:09,504
After Jishan Hall discovered the spy of Northern Liang,

388
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:14,364
I concealed the matter and secretly informed Xue Xiaotang.

389
00:37:14,945 --> 00:37:18,425
As expected, you thought Heaven was on your side

390
00:37:18,425 --> 00:37:21,945
and you successfully delivered the map to Northern Liang.

391
00:37:23,425 --> 00:37:26,005
Xue Xiaotang also promised me

392
00:37:26,005 --> 00:37:30,385
that after it was all over, he would testify against you.

393
00:37:30,385 --> 00:37:35,725
Even if Father wanted to protect you,

394
00:37:35,745 --> 00:37:41,224
the crime of treason would be hard to conceal.

395
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:47,265
If it weren't for your deep sins,

396
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:51,544
those thirty thousand soldiers wouldn't have died.

397
00:37:56,985 --> 00:37:59,925
 With this token, 

398
00:37:59,925 --> 00:38:04,304
 the Zhou family will be at your beck and call. 

399
00:38:07,865 --> 00:38:12,205
Originally, I had everything under control.

400
00:38:12,985 --> 00:38:14,885
Unexpectedly...

401
00:38:17,584 --> 00:38:19,284
It was such a pity.

402
00:38:20,284 --> 00:38:23,025
To protect you,

403
00:38:23,025 --> 00:38:26,804
Father sent the Imperial Shadow Guards to silence Xue Xiaotang

404
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:32,445
to cover up your crimes, leaving no traces behind.

405
00:38:33,024 --> 00:38:37,705
And Uncle miraculously survived.

406
00:38:38,624 --> 00:38:40,024
Everything was ruined.

407
00:38:40,024 --> 00:38:44,465
So I could only return to Jiangnan to lay low. 
    

408
00:38:47,064 --> 00:38:49,684
Under the pretext of mourning for Xue Xiaotang

409
00:38:49,684 --> 00:38:52,385
and not wanting to be reminded of past memories,

410
00:38:52,385 --> 00:38:54,405
I returned to Jiangnan again.

411
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:09,110


412
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:19,970
♫  I can't forget the love that is still is nipping at my ears and temples  ♫

413
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:27,270
♫  Memories keep slamming into rocks and have nowhere to berth  ♫

414
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:34,710
♫  Both sides gaze at each other in the drizzling rain, but one has turned into clouds and mist  ♫

415
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:43,230
♫  Leaving the isolated heart's island, like waves without a shore  ♫

416
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:46,970
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

417
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:50,630
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

418
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:54,550
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

419
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:57,930
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

420
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:01,550
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

421
00:40:01,551 --> 00:40:05,270
♫  Obviously willing to swear life and death 
 to be entangled for a lifetime  ♫

422
00:40:05,271 --> 00:40:09,470
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

423
00:40:09,471 --> 00:40:15,271
♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

424
00:40:29,071 --> 00:40:36,470
♫  I can't forget the turmoil of love and hate, 
 even if the next day is far away  ♫

425
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:45,030
♫  Two souls embrace in chaos, how can it be written off?  ♫

426
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:48,710
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

427
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:52,350
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

428
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:56,230
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

429
00:40:56,231 --> 00:40:59,670
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

430
00:40:59,671 --> 00:41:03,370
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

431
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:07,050
♫  Obviously can't be erased, and haunted by lingering dreams  ♫

432
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:11,130
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

433
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:18,411
♫  Want to have one more glimpse of you, 
 even just for a second more  ♫
