2
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:30,359
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,980
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:47,879
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,160
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,259
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,380
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,580
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,679
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:18,639
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

12
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:24,100
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,139
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:36,919
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,020
   

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,060
   

17
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,940
   

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
   

19
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,710
Stop the carriage.

20
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,651
- How much longer? 
  - The carriage moves slower. 

21
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:26,011
It might take several hours to reach the capital.

22
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:29,951
Zhimo, Inform Miss Mu's family to wait at the entrance of the examination hall.

23
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:32,191
- I'll take your horse. 
 - Yes.

24
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:33,960
Get off.

25
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:36,390
Get off?

26
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:03,311
Where's Young Lady? Didn't she come back with you?

27
00:03:06,735 --> 00:03:08,235
(Follow me.)

28
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:11,551
I know these three words. Where are you taking me to?

29
00:03:11,551 --> 00:03:13,671
To see Young Lady?

30
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:17,631
Let's go. What's wrong?

31
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:20,290
You need to bring along the writing case to the examination hall.

32
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,270
Got it.

33
00:03:25,887 --> 00:03:29,667
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

34
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:34,151
- How dare you barge into... 
  - Greetings, Your Lordship. 

35
00:03:36,147 --> 00:03:41,247
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

36
00:03:41,247 --> 00:03:46,441
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

37
00:03:46,441 --> 00:03:51,617
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

38
00:03:51,617 --> 00:03:55,691
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

39
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:56,882
Juli.

40
00:03:56,882 --> 00:04:01,911
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart Never dims   ♫

41
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:04,811
Isn't that Lord Ding?

42
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,311
He actually sends that female provincial graduate here.

43
00:04:07,311 --> 00:04:10,751
Could it be that something is going on between them?

44
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,691
If it's true, he wouldn't do this before the public. 
    

45
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:17,270
- Lord Ding is one of the chief examiners this year. 
 -  Makes sense.

46
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,530
Young Lady, you made it here. And you got here earlier.

47
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,630
- Are you all right? 
 -  Don't worry, I'm fine.

48
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,730
Thank you, My Lord.

49
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,250
No need. I just don't want to feel indebted.

50
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,690
My Lord, I have something to tell you, actually.

51
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,510
Come with me.

52
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,691
My Lord, you're not young anymore.

53
00:04:42,691 --> 00:04:46,791
When my father was your age, he had already had many children.

54
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:50,091
I'm a physician and I'm kind of skilled.

55
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:52,990
You know this well.

56
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,790
To me, you're a heroic figure and you respect talents.

57
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:02,970
I always have the urge to do something for you.

58
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,351
The Mu family, well, my father...

59
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,690
has a lot of secretive aphrodisiac prescriptions.

60
00:05:17,011 --> 00:05:21,250
If you need this, I can give you a treatment at a cheap price.

61
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,510
Young Lady.

62
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:45,951
This is my first time showing a kind gesture because Lord Ding is a decent man.

63
00:05:45,951 --> 00:05:49,990
I wanted to help him with his coital difficulty.

64
00:05:50,011 --> 00:05:53,090
And yet it ticks him off.

65
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:58,190
Maybe because you offered that at a low price?

66
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:03,311
What? Does he want it for free?

67
00:06:03,311 --> 00:06:05,231
He's the mighty Lord Ding.

68
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:08,291
Can't he even afford this chicken feed?

69
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,411
Good, stop.

70
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,390
Stand in line.

71
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,070
Did Lord Ding send you here just now?

72
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:34,630
Young Master Jinghong. I'm Mu Zhuohua from Yanzhou.

73
00:06:35,651 --> 00:06:37,411
I barely missed the examination.

74
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:41,410
Thanks to the generous Lord Ding, I made it here on time.

75
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,230
There's only one female provincial graduate whose surname is Mu.

76
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:48,951
You must be exceptional to deserve praise from Princess Roujia.

77
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:51,910
I doubt if it's a praise I warrant from Her Highness.

78
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,511
Her Highness has a good judgment of people.

79
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:56,751
I wish you success in advance.

80
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:58,910
Thank you, Young Master Jinghong.

81
00:07:04,011 --> 00:07:07,530
Who exactly is that woman?

82
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:11,070
At first, Lord Ding sent her here himself,

83
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,571
and now, Young Master Jinghong approaches her.

84
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:18,831
Is she a daughter of a noble clan?

85
00:07:18,831 --> 00:07:21,071
Didn't you hear what Young Master Jinghong just said?

86
00:07:21,071 --> 00:07:23,671
Princess Roujia praised her.

87
00:07:23,671 --> 00:07:25,871
She must be great.

88
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:37,515
   

89
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:23,553
   

90
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:17,950
Your Majesty, aside from nursing the relapse,

91
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,651
His Lordship is all right.

92
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:20,870
You ought to diagnose him carefully.

93
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,991
You mustn't leave out any hidden sicknesses.

94
00:09:23,991 --> 00:09:28,130
Your Majesty, Imperial Physician Zhao is skillful.

95
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,751
He won't make any mistakes on pulse taking.

96
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:36,831
Yes.

97
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,851
Shadow Guards have reported Wandering Needle to me.

98
00:09:48,851 --> 00:09:54,551
I have tasked Du Chong to sort out all the name lists of Shadow Guards from the past three years

99
00:09:54,551 --> 00:09:57,151
and hand them to you.

100
00:09:57,151 --> 00:09:58,810
Thank you, Your Majesty.

101
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:03,750
I couldn't believe there were spies in the Shadow Guards.

102
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:06,951
Calm down, Your Majesty.

103
00:10:06,951 --> 00:10:09,090
Don't hurt your health.

104
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,771
I'm fine.

105
00:10:11,951 --> 00:10:14,051
When you told me you wanted to go to Tiantong Mountain the other day,

106
00:10:14,051 --> 00:10:16,691
and for some reason, I was worried about you.

107
00:10:16,691 --> 00:10:18,950
Fortunately, my men got there on time.

108
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,091
Otherwise...

109
00:10:22,311 --> 00:10:24,311
In this chaotic world,

110
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:28,851
Northern Liang has painted us as a target.

111
00:10:28,851 --> 00:10:33,111
Many people want to kill me.

112
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:39,071
I won't let the hiding evil off the hook.

113
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,291
Anyway, don't be anxious.

114
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,390
Rest assured, Your Majesty. I want to live a longer life.

115
00:10:50,091 --> 00:10:51,691
Glad to hear that.

116
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:55,991
I rest assured as long as you're safe.

117
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,390
Your Majesty,

118
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:04,291
has the Dowager Empress been doing well lately?

119
00:11:06,191 --> 00:11:10,310
I haven't told her about your incident.

120
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:14,130
Please don't make Mother worried.

121
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,491
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

122
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:23,790
I won't disturb the Dowager Empress, then.

123
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,211
By the way, you should go to the examination hall now.

124
00:11:28,211 --> 00:11:31,211
You're the invigilator.

125
00:11:33,851 --> 00:11:35,451
Yes, Your Majesty.

126
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:40,210
 If Dowager Empress is associated with the war at Juma River, 

127
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,450
 I should gather solid evidence to prove it. 

128
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,930
 I mustn't upset His Majesty. 

129
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,191
 Yuan Chengming has been dead for five years. 

130
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:52,350
 However, the empty grave on the islet in the middle of the lake is newly dug. 

131
00:11:52,851 --> 00:11:55,990
 Also, why did Yun Xiangyue not use her real name 

132
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,850
 to erect the tombstone for her own father?) 

133
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,830
 The alias is traceable. 

134
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:06,711
 It must be from someone's scheme and guide. 

135
00:12:06,711 --> 00:12:08,130
Zhijian,

136
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,391
send someone to investigate Yuan Chengming's tomb.

137
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:15,391
I need to know everything about it.

138
00:12:15,391 --> 00:12:16,931
Yes.

139
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,850
   

140
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,300
The metropolitan examination begins!

141
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,071
The first session is a compulsory subject.

142
00:12:53,071 --> 00:12:56,251
The "Benevolence" chapter in the Record of Sage.

143
00:13:20,251 --> 00:13:23,030
 Are you ready for this, Young Lady? 

144
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,710
 I... I think so. 

145
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,870
 Let me see. 

146
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,830
 The compulsory subject in the first session, it's under my control. 

147
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:35,311
 I have memorized all Classics and they're at my fingertips. 

148
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:54,470
Chen'er.

149
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,271
You're finally here, Uncle.

150
00:13:56,271 --> 00:13:57,971
But you're late.

151
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:00,951
You're already here. Can't I take a break?

152
00:14:00,951 --> 00:14:02,330
Of course, you can.

153
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,431
I didn't send someone to rush you. Right?

154
00:14:04,431 --> 00:14:07,991
You can come at any time you want.

155
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:18,131
Speaking of which, the female candidates are mainly from a noble origin,

156
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:20,430
but it's a pioneering attempt, anyway.

157
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,811
Thanks to you, Uncle.

158
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,630
It's just that given the resourceful prestigious clans,

159
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:32,070
it should be an easy task to groom female provincial graduates.

160
00:14:32,951 --> 00:14:39,490
But not many of them can pass the metropolitan examination.

161
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,710
I always agree with anything you do.

162
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,831
But I don't really understand why you allowed females to take part...

163
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:48,470
in the imperial examination.

164
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,350
What do you not understand?

165
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,911
Even though women candidates pass the palace examination,

166
00:14:52,911 --> 00:14:57,230
they still have to return to family life eventually.

167
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,710
What's the meaning of them studying so hard?

168
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,930
They can't help in state affairs.

169
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,640
Isn't it best to spend their time on learning women's morality?

170
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:13,471
The results have been the same since this practice started during the reign of Empress Yuanguang.

171
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:19,230
It's because of the ethos of Southern Chen.

172
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,151
Even though this isn't a path for everyone,

173
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:28,531
giving them an alternate path and shutting them out of it are different.

174
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,270
Everyone has their own aspiration.

175
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,931
Knowledge will only do us good.

176
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:36,651
For the same peach tree, some ignore it,

177
00:15:36,651 --> 00:15:40,490
some are enlightened by it, some empathize with its delicateness,

178
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,750
while some appreciate its niceties.

179
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:47,851
Whether they will become officials or be someone's wife and mother after studying,

180
00:15:47,851 --> 00:15:52,251
after all, they harvest what they've contributed.

181
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:00,731
Uncle, what does the peach tree mean to you?

182
00:16:00,731 --> 00:16:03,290
It reminds me of a verse.

183
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:09,320
"Peach blossoms bloom in graceful brilliance."

184
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:15,900
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

185
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,580
♫  Looking at the green bamboo strips for writing, 
 thousands of scrolls for planning  ♫

186
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:26,200
♫  The green silk carries dreams, 
 leisurely looking at  the world of mortals  ♫

187
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:31,370
♫  How can one look back at the one named on the honor roll?  ♫

188
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:36,480
♫  A trek of a lifetime, a barren hill  ♫

189
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,190
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

190
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:42,831
Uncle, when will you give me that jade pendant?

191
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:45,791
I've asked you for it several times.

192
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,190
Do you really need this?

193
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:53,800
♫  Who will swim with you  ♫

194
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:59,230
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

195
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:04,280
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

196
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:09,480
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

197
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,560
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

198
00:17:16,351 --> 00:17:17,650
Time's up.

199
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,770
Stop writing.

200
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,450
Turn in your answer sheet.

201
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:30,020
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

202
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:35,260
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

203
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:45,230
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

204
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,450
Well done.

205
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,011
Very well done.

206
00:17:55,011 --> 00:17:59,650
I have a sheet here with perfect answers.

207
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,490
Perfect answer?

208
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:03,030
Take a look at it.

209
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,431
Take a look at it.

210
00:18:04,431 --> 00:18:06,431
Am I right?

211
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,400
- Read this. 
  - It must be Shen Jinghong. 

212
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,351
Don't you believe him?

213
00:18:14,351 --> 00:18:16,491
Let's make a bet.

214
00:18:16,491 --> 00:18:19,231
The answer sheet belongs to Shen Jinghong, no doubt.

215
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,170
What are we betting on?

216
00:18:25,591 --> 00:18:31,311
The fine brew in your residence, Shiduanxiang.

217
00:18:32,671 --> 00:18:34,671
Or maybe...

218
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,850
your jade pendant?

219
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:44,591
It seems that you've been coveting my jade pendant.

220
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:48,051
Please take a look at it, Your Highness.

221
00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:49,651
Sure.

222
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,411
It isn't Shen Jinghong's writing.

223
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:04,470
I have another perfect answer here, too.

224
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,930
- One more? 
 - I see.

225
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:10,371
I heard that there are several tricky questions in Classics.

226
00:19:10,371 --> 00:19:13,270
Anyway, it's good to have more competent candidates.

227
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,190
Please read this, My Lord.

228
00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:22,831
Uncle.

229
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:25,451
Shen Jinghong wrote this one.

230
00:19:25,451 --> 00:19:27,151
Yes, that's right.

231
00:19:28,351 --> 00:19:32,190
It's a shame that you lost.

232
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,950
Because the answer sheet we bet on should be this one.

233
00:19:42,671 --> 00:19:47,671
To my surprise, we have another candidate who's on par with Shen Jinghong.

234
00:19:48,191 --> 00:19:52,180
There are many talents in this world. No need to be surprised.

235
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,631
This candidate may have a good memory.

236
00:19:54,631 --> 00:20:00,251
But the two following sessions are the real test of their strength.

237
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:57,390
 Child, keep this in mind. 

238
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,631
 Women should study more and have their own pursuits. 

239
00:21:01,631 --> 00:21:04,831
 Even if you're confined in your maiden chamber, 

240
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:09,151
 you mustn't be a tractable girl. 

241
00:21:10,111 --> 00:21:12,111
 You must remember this. 

242
00:21:12,111 --> 00:21:17,151
 Never hand over your destiny to someone's hand. 

243
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,330
 All right, my child? 

244
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:35,160
The second session is poetry. "Yellow Flowers Scatter Like Gold."

245
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,860
   

246
00:21:49,111 --> 00:21:51,911
 The second session is poetry, which I'm not good at. 

247
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:55,130
 But Tutor Shang toldme to try to stay on-topic, 

248
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:58,750
 maintain a rhymed flow, and keep the verse neat. 

249
00:22:09,731 --> 00:22:12,311
Ridiculous. This is ridiculous.

250
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:15,310
More than half of them went off topic.

251
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:21,331
The title is "Yellow Flowers Scatter Like Gold."

252
00:22:21,331 --> 00:22:25,991
This question seems simple, and yet it filters so many out.

253
00:22:25,991 --> 00:22:29,510
Most of them take the yellow flowers as chrysanthemums.

254
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:32,111
They're not aware that it's from the verse,

255
00:22:32,111 --> 00:22:35,430
"The green branches remain as verdant, but yellow flowers scatter like gold."

256
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:39,310
It wrote about the scenery of Grain Rain around the Spring Equinox.

257
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:42,871
The yellow flower here refers to rapeseed flowers.

258
00:22:42,871 --> 00:22:47,491
If the candidates mistook it as chrysanthemums of the autumn, they're eliminated.

259
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,591
This candidate didn't go off topic.

260
00:22:49,591 --> 00:22:54,091
However, it doesn't rhyme and is poorly written.

261
00:22:54,091 --> 00:22:55,810
Rapeseed flowers in the village.

262
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:59,571
Day after day, they are busy extracting oil from the rapeseed.

263
00:22:59,571 --> 00:23:02,471
No one cares about poor peasants.

264
00:23:58,051 --> 00:24:00,351
 This is a set of writing tools from a literati in Qingzhou. 

265
00:24:00,351 --> 00:24:01,510
 It's for you. 

266
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,310
 I wish you good luck. 

267
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,270
   

268
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,830
The third session is political discourse.

269
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,251
Discourse on subduing border intruders and pacifying the residents.

270
00:25:00,251 --> 00:25:03,171
 Discourse on subduing border intruders and pacifying the residents? 

271
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,011
 But the political discourse in the third session... 

272
00:25:20,011 --> 00:25:22,270
 Tutor Shang approves of your article. Right? 

273
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,550
 He said your idea is unconventional and amb... 

274
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,650
 Ambitious and bold. 

275
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:31,470
 Yes, he did say my article is ambitious and bold. 

276
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:37,230
 However, he also said my idea was wild and might be shocking. 

277
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:42,430
 So, if a rigid and conservative examiner reviews my article, 

278
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,951
 he might give me the lowest grade. 

279
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,611
 That's bad. 

280
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,571
 Here's what I'm going to do. 

281
00:25:51,571 --> 00:25:53,151
 In the first session, I'll do what I know. 

282
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,831
 In the second session, I'll do what I can. 

283
00:25:54,831 --> 00:25:56,911
 And in the third session, 

284
00:25:56,911 --> 00:25:59,370
 I think I have to pray to the deity. 

285
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:15,731
Time's up.

286
00:26:15,731 --> 00:26:17,591
Stop writing.

287
00:26:17,591 --> 00:26:19,990
Turn in your answer sheet.

288
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,991
 They're out. 

289
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,070
 Son. 

290
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,790
Young Lady!

291
00:26:58,671 --> 00:26:59,610
 Daughter. 

292
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:02,110
 - Young Lady. 
 - Juli. 

293
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:04,270
You're finally out.

294
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,091
 Father! 

295
00:27:08,091 --> 00:27:09,791
What's wrong?

296
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:12,991
Young Lady, you smell.

297
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:16,150
That hurts.

298
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,410
I didn't mean to do it.

299
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:19,551
I'm worried sick about you.

300
00:27:19,551 --> 00:27:21,090
Juli, you know what?

301
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:23,670
I had a fever three days before I entered the examination hall.

302
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:26,331
This metropolitan examination gives me a hard time.

303
00:27:26,331 --> 00:27:29,550
Young Lady, did you do well in your exam?

304
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,291
I don't know.

305
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:34,251
I've done my very best.

306
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,730
By the way, Juli,

307
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,590
let me tell you this.

308
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:43,170
The political discourse...

309
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:45,650
Forget it. Let's not talk about it.

310
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:47,950
I want delicious food now. Do we have any good food at home?

311
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:50,551
Of course, the food is ready. There are many delicious foods.

312
00:27:50,551 --> 00:27:52,571
- What do we have? 
 - Crispy pork knuckles.

313
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:53,951
Crispy pork knuckles?

314
00:27:53,951 --> 00:27:55,391
I thought you made it steamed.

315
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:58,491
This is deviant.

316
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:02,170
This question is about how to subdue border intruders.

317
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:06,970
And yet, this discourse wrote about the nurture of enemies on the border.

318
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:10,630
But I find it sensible after reading it, though.

319
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:13,450
Sensible? This is ridiculous.

320
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,270
What's with the noise?

321
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,170
Where's your manners?

322
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:21,931
Your Highness,

323
00:28:21,931 --> 00:28:24,471
we come across a political discourse

324
00:28:24,471 --> 00:28:27,790
and we are having a debate over it.

325
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,130
Bring me the sheet.

326
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:32,610
My uncle and I will read what's written on it.

327
00:28:36,491 --> 00:28:38,911
Please read this, Uncle.

328
00:28:43,671 --> 00:28:47,191
 Mu Zhuohua is bold to write this. 

329
00:28:47,191 --> 00:28:49,730
 But it does make some sense. 

330
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,771
 It's right that war brings harm to people, and the expenses are high. 

331
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:54,990
 This method might be feasible. 

332
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:58,291
Is this candidate from Northern Liang or Eastern Xia?

333
00:28:58,291 --> 00:29:00,731
This person actually takes the outsider's side.

334
00:29:01,691 --> 00:29:03,431
Southern Chen should employ Confucian teachings

335
00:29:03,431 --> 00:29:06,591
to enlighten foreign clans and set it as the national religion,

336
00:29:06,591 --> 00:29:08,930
like the Western Regions do.

337
00:29:09,851 --> 00:29:12,051
If this is a feasible way,

338
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:16,790
Uncle, what's the meaning of us waging wars all along?

339
00:29:17,731 --> 00:29:19,711
For the opportunity...

340
00:29:20,331 --> 00:29:22,690
to have a say over them.

341
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:28,411
I think I've seen this handwriting before.

342
00:29:28,411 --> 00:29:33,310
It's similar to the perfect answer of the first session.

343
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:36,591
This candidate wrote the poor verse yesterday.

344
00:29:36,591 --> 00:29:39,890
This candidate might have a good memory and is insightful.

345
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:43,471
They could be a compatible rival against Shen Jinghong.

346
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:47,291
I think this person is just average.

347
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:49,871
We mustn't let this person pass the examination.

348
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:53,857
   

349
00:30:02,111 --> 00:30:04,011
Your Highness.

350
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:05,830
Was it Mu Zhuohua?

351
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,270
Yes.

352
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:10,650
Lord Ding sent her to the examination hall himself.

353
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:13,111
All the way from Yanzhou.

354
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:14,610
Your Majesty,

355
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:19,271
is she the daughter of one of the deceased warriors like Yun Xiangyue?

356
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:22,410
The emperor halted my action against Yan'er.

357
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:27,971
I can't sit by and wait till his lead points to me.

358
00:30:30,631 --> 00:30:33,291
I need to know everything about her.

359
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:35,291
The more detailed, the better.

360
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,610
- Start investigating. 
 - Yes.

361
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:45,650
Merciful deity,

362
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,170
I did nothing wrong.

363
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:51,450
Everything I've done is for the sake of Ju'er and Chen'er.

364
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:55,011
Sadly, they always take Yan'er's side.

365
00:30:55,011 --> 00:30:57,010
That truly upsets me.

366
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:00,090
As of now, I have to protect myself too.

367
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:02,351
Things are getting more difficult for me.

368
00:31:03,491 --> 00:31:06,191
Merciful deity, please.

369
00:31:10,508 --> 00:31:13,170
   

370
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:15,600
   

371
00:31:23,211 --> 00:31:24,811
 Young Lady! 

372
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,910
Young Lady.

373
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:33,351
Young Lady, I returned from outside and was told that the results announcement is today.

374
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:34,970
Is that so?

375
00:31:36,391 --> 00:31:38,291
Young Lady, why aren't you anxious about it?

376
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:41,231
Everyone is waiting for the announcement. We should go there now.

377
00:31:41,231 --> 00:31:43,330
No, this is beneath me!

378
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:46,670
The master scholar wouldn't check for their rank by themselves.

379
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:51,291
They always stay composed and wait for the good news at home.

380
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:53,431
- Wait for good news at home? 
 - Yeah.

381
00:31:53,431 --> 00:31:54,510
That makes sense.

382
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,251
You're surely the master scholar.

383
00:31:56,251 --> 00:31:58,130
Young Lady, you must stay here and go nowhere.

384
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:00,951
- Wait for your word of success. 
 - I won't go anywhere. Go ahead.

385
00:32:10,291 --> 00:32:12,390
I mustn't go. No, I can't.

386
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:17,591
If I fail the examination, I'll be a laughingstock under the announcement board.

387
00:32:18,131 --> 00:32:20,031
Oh, my.

388
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,770
What was wrong with me?

389
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:26,771
It's apparent that both Lord Ding and First Prince support wars.

390
00:32:26,771 --> 00:32:29,051
Why did I write nonsense like such?

391
00:32:29,051 --> 00:32:30,691
Wait.

392
00:32:30,691 --> 00:32:35,310
Had I written an ingratiating answer that defied my own will,

393
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,991
it wouldn't have been a good answer.

394
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:42,791
Forget it.

395
00:32:42,791 --> 00:32:44,390
Just let it be.

396
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:50,951
I'm going to pack my luggage and seek another place to stay.

397
00:32:50,951 --> 00:32:55,590
I will study for another three years and resit for the metropolitan examination.

398
00:32:55,590 --> 00:33:00,011
I can't really ask Lord Ding to support me for three years.

399
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,450
Is she back already?

400
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,951
Miss... Miss Song.

401
00:33:15,951 --> 00:33:18,031
Why are you here?

402
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:22,750
- Are you feeling unwell? 
 - No, I'm good.

403
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:27,310
Can't I come here to pay you a visit?

404
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,751
Of course, you can.

405
00:33:28,751 --> 00:33:31,030
Miss Song, come on in.

406
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,910
Zhuohua, did you know?

407
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:42,491
All of the ladies like the scented sachets you gave them.

408
00:33:42,491 --> 00:33:45,650
They'd like to order a dozen from you.

409
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:48,811
And yet you're leaving soon.

410
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:53,050
Actually, you can stand on your own feet

411
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:57,170
in the capital with your healing skill

412
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,930
other than fixating on the examination.

413
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:04,371
Miss Song, the capital is too lively to be a place to study.

414
00:34:04,371 --> 00:34:07,970
Becoming an official is my life's pursuit.

415
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:12,210
And I work as a physician just to feed myself.

416
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:17,951
By the way, Miss Song, I will give you the formula for the scented sachet later.

417
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,731
The imperial examination is a tough journey.

418
00:34:22,731 --> 00:34:27,511
So, don't get upset if you fail it.

419
00:34:28,211 --> 00:34:31,471
Zhuohua, your courage in trying it

420
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:35,651
has already set you apart from the rest of the women in this era.

421
00:34:35,651 --> 00:34:36,651
Think about it.

422
00:34:36,651 --> 00:34:41,370
Not many people in this world dare put all their eggs in one basket.

423
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,130
It's tough for women...

424
00:34:44,211 --> 00:34:46,290
to live in the current society.

425
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:52,470
So, I hope you will live your life, come what may. All right?

426
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:55,370
I will, Miss Song.

427
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,990
Young Lady!

428
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:02,070
You made it!

429
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,731
Me?

430
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:06,671
I made it?

431
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:08,251
Am I the master scholar?

432
00:35:08,251 --> 00:35:10,370
You're overconfident, Young Lady.

433
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,950
The master scholar can only be Young Master Jinghong.

434
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:15,131
What about me?

435
00:35:15,131 --> 00:35:16,370
My rank?

436
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,590
You won 17th place.

437
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,711
17th place?

438
00:35:20,711 --> 00:35:23,131
Blimey! 17th is a good rank, too.

439
00:35:23,131 --> 00:35:25,450
Great! You really made the cut!

440
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:28,291
This is what I'm going to do. I'll bring the good news to all the ladies.

441
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,770
- That's great, Young Lady. 
 - 17th? Did you get it right?

442
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:33,090
Yes, you won 17th place.

443
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,390
I made it! Hurrah!

444
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,091
- This is indeed a great surprise. 
 - Miss Mu made the cut!

445
00:35:38,091 --> 00:35:39,071
She's the 17th.

446
00:35:39,071 --> 00:35:40,291
- 17th? That's great. 
 - Exactly.

447
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:42,130
- 17th place? 
 - Yes

448
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,811
Come here.

449
00:35:43,811 --> 00:35:45,771
She made it. She won 17th place.

450
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:47,150
What?

451
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,190
I've been looking for you, Madam Lu.

452
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,551
Zhuohua made the cut.

453
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:52,711
- Really? 
 - Yes.

454
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:57,671
Ladies, gather here. Zhuohua made the cut!

455
00:35:57,671 --> 00:36:00,270
I told you. I told you this early.

456
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:02,950
- People who rent my house come out as great literati. 
 - Rightfully so.

457
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:05,630
The former was a poet and now is a metropolitan graduate.

458
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:09,391
 Miss Mu won 17th place. Miss Mu won 17th place. 

459
00:36:09,391 --> 00:36:10,751
Come over.

460
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,170
 She won 17th place! She made the cut! 

461
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,391
 Miss Mu won 17th place. 

462
00:36:13,391 --> 00:36:15,291
 Zhuohua! 

463
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:16,251
 Miss Mu. 

464
00:36:16,251 --> 00:36:18,331
- Miss Song. Madam Lu.  
 - I gathered everyone here
to congratulate you.

465
00:36:18,331 --> 00:36:19,611
You're all here?

466
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:20,670
I'm so glad for you.

467
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,190
Thank you, Miss Song. Thank you so much.

468
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,611
- Applause! 
 - Thank you so much, ladies.

469
00:36:23,611 --> 00:36:25,151
Thank you so much, ladies.

470
00:36:25,151 --> 00:36:26,491
Thank you.

471
00:36:29,971 --> 00:36:31,371
A woman?

472
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:34,990
The candidate who wrote about nurturing enemies on the border was a woman?

473
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:38,851
The candidate who's been on par with Shen Jinghong is actually a woman?

474
00:36:38,851 --> 00:36:42,190
Yes, so it seems.

475
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:46,210
Mu Zhuohua.

476
00:36:46,791 --> 00:36:48,490
Mu Zhuohua?

477
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:52,250
This name rings a bell.

478
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,891
Think harder.

479
00:36:58,351 --> 00:36:59,951
I can't recall anything.

480
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:04,790
But I must find a chance to meet her in person to vent...

481
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,650
To vent my anger.

482
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:09,331
She actually wrote nonsense.

483
00:37:09,331 --> 00:37:11,670
How could she win 17th place?

484
00:37:24,323 --> 00:37:27,403
   

485
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,951
We've been separated for five years.

486
00:37:44,951 --> 00:37:48,590
This is your first time paying respect to the ancestors after coming back.

487
00:37:49,531 --> 00:37:53,531
I'm to blame for not staying in the capital to do my duty as a daughter.

488
00:37:53,531 --> 00:37:56,731
It's fine. Your great-grandmother has always been kind to her children.

489
00:37:56,731 --> 00:37:58,950
She won't blame you.

490
00:38:02,368 --> 00:38:03,611
   

491
00:38:03,611 --> 00:38:07,250
Great-grandmother is the only woman monarch in the dynasty.

492
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:12,090
I heard that during her reign, she first allowed females to take part in the imperial exam.

493
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,110
Yes, she did.

494
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:17,950
I'm just following in her footsteps.

495
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:25,510
Father, your decision is the greatest grace for all women.

496
00:38:26,331 --> 00:38:31,890
If I weren't a princess, I'd like to partake in the imperial examinations as a commoner.

497
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:37,571
Perhaps I could realize my ambitions like Great-Grandmother did.

498
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:42,551
Instead, I would prefer you to lead a happy life.

499
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:46,650
Among my children, you're my favorite.

500
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:51,111
Also, I feel so sorry for you in particular.

501
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:53,890
Why do you say so, Father?

502
00:38:54,831 --> 00:38:57,431
You lost your mother when you were little and had been staying in Jiangnan.

503
00:38:57,431 --> 00:39:02,131
Of all my children, you're the only one who didn't stay with me.

504
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:07,250
And when your husband was chosen, Xue Xiaotang died in the war at Juma River.

505
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:14,591
Come to think of it, you've been alone all these years and moving around.

506
00:39:14,591 --> 00:39:18,570
I owe you too much.

507
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,850
Please don't say that, Father.

508
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:24,051
Though I've been living in Jiangnan alone,

509
00:39:24,051 --> 00:39:30,131
I keep receiving care from Great-Grandaunt and you.

510
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:32,651
I never feel lonely.

511
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:39,810
From now on, I want to stay by your side and never leave again, Father.

512
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,190
Sure.

513
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:45,310
It's my eager intention to have you with me.

514
00:39:48,531 --> 00:39:51,931
By the way, back then, Xue Xiaotang passed away unexpectedly

515
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,971
and you insisted on being in mourning for him.

516
00:39:53,971 --> 00:39:58,551
Now that the five-year mourning is up soon, what's your plan?

517
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:14,040


518
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:23,516
♫  I can't forget the love that is still is nipping at my ears and temples  ♫

519
00:40:23,516 --> 00:40:30,716
♫  Memories keep slamming into rocks and have nowhere to berth  ♫

520
00:40:30,716 --> 00:40:34,356
♫  Both sides gaze at each other in the drizzling rain, but one has turned into clouds and mist  ♫

521
00:40:34,356 --> 00:40:38,076
♫  Both sides gaze at each other in the drizzling rain, but one has turned into clouds and mist  ♫

522
00:40:38,076 --> 00:40:46,676
♫  Leaving the isolated heart's island, like waves without a shore  ♫

523
00:40:46,676 --> 00:40:50,416
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

524
00:40:50,416 --> 00:40:54,076
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

525
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:57,996
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

526
00:40:57,996 --> 00:41:01,476
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

527
00:41:01,476 --> 00:41:05,096
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

528
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:08,716
♫  Obviously willing to swear life and death 
 to be entangled for a lifetime  ♫

529
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:12,916
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

530
00:41:12,916 --> 00:41:19,016
♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

531
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:39,816
♫  I can't forget the turmoil of love and hate, 
 even if the next day is far away  ♫

532
00:41:39,816 --> 00:41:48,276
♫  Two souls embrace in chaos, how can it be written off?  ♫

533
00:41:48,276 --> 00:41:52,156
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

534
00:41:52,156 --> 00:41:55,896
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

535
00:41:55,896 --> 00:41:59,676
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

536
00:41:59,676 --> 00:42:03,216
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

537
00:42:03,216 --> 00:42:06,916
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

538
00:42:06,916 --> 00:42:10,496
♫  Obviously can't be erased, and haunted by lingering dreams  ♫

539
00:42:10,496 --> 00:42:14,576
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

540
00:42:14,576 --> 00:42:22,056
♫  Want to have one more glimpse of you, 
 even just for a second more  ♫
