1
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:25,260


2
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,459
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:35,080
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:47,879
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,200
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,259
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,400
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,580
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,579
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:18,739
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

12
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:24,100
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,239
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:36,619
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:39,020
   

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,060
   

17
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,885
   

18
00:01:44,885 --> 00:01:48,210
   

19
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,885
   

20
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,910
Young Lady, do you want to bring along all the scrolls?

21
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,831
Yes, put them here.

22
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:18,690
Why does the bridal sedan chair enter from the side door?

23
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,891
She's only a concubine.

24
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:21,791
The Mu family is indeed the wealthiest in Jiangnan.

25
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,251
Old Master Mu has already taken in over a dozen concubines.

26
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:25,131
And now, he's marrying one more.

27
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,711
Young Lady, First Madam and the rest are coming this way.

28
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:34,211
Hurry up. Let's go and take a look.

29
00:02:34,211 --> 00:02:36,430
Coming.

30
00:02:37,631 --> 00:02:39,411
    
 I heard that she looks gorgeous.

31
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:42,211
    
 Why would Old Master marry an ugly one?

32
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,051
    
 Peach blossoms in graceful brilliance.

33
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:52,170
     
 The maiden is asked for her hand. 

34
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,811
Look at Mu Qi.

35
00:02:53,811 --> 00:02:56,250
Is she really aiming for Zhuangyuan? 
  (The scholar who has the highest score) 

36
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,251
She's soon becoming the wife of the county magistrate.

37
00:02:58,251 --> 00:03:00,491
Why bother studying all this stuff?

38
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,430
Are you not paying your respect to me?

39
00:03:06,331 --> 00:03:07,970
 The ceremony is about to start. 

40
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,471
 Why are you concerned about whether Qi will continue her studies or get married? 

41
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:15,150
 Peach blossoms bloom with lush green leaves. 

42
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,990
 The maiden is asked for her hand to build a harmonious family. 

43
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,530
 - Peach blossoms bloom... 
 - Young Lady. Young Lady, stop reading. 

44
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,031
 They've gone. 

45
00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:25,511
Luckily, Old Master always holds a grandeur wedding whenever he marries a concubine.

46
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:26,631
 And we can make good use of this chance. 

47
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:28,531
 All right, let's go. 

48
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,050
   

49
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,211
Careful. Watch your step.

50
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:39,511
Bride bows to husbandry livestock.

51
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,330
May the livestock thrive.

52
00:03:43,611 --> 00:03:46,150
Bride bows to the wellspring.

53
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,291
May the offspring flourish.

54
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,851
On this fortunate day, a new concubine is taken in before the witness of the deity.

55
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:56,892
   

56
00:03:56,892 --> 00:03:58,090
    
 Please bring forth the God of Stove.

57
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,831
Bride, bow.

58
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,851
You came last to this residence. You should listen to us from now on.

59
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:09,991
I'm the seventeenth concubine. You must respect me.

60
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,351
Let's go.

61
00:04:43,611 --> 00:04:47,210
You may cross your arms and drink.

62
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,971
Unveil.

63
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:01,400
    
 Let's see. I shall unveil my twentieth... twentieth...

64
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,450
It's the eighteenth.

65
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,551
Oh, right. The eighteenth.

66
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:10,551
I shall unveil my eighteenth sweetheart.

67
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:18,640
   

68
00:05:20,785 --> 00:05:23,635
   

69
00:05:24,485 --> 00:05:25,891
   

70
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:28,831
    
 Young Lady, we should be on our way now.

71
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:32,611
Let's go.

72
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,151
Young Lady, why are you still reading in the carriage?

73
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:47,111
It's bumpy.

74
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:50,950
Women will end up getting married if they don't study well.

75
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,790
Young Lady, aren't all women meant to get married?

76
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,390
Old Master has already married eighteen concubines.

77
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,571
Well, mortal hearts always grow fond of young and dainty faces.

78
00:06:00,571 --> 00:06:04,811
It'll be a wonderful scene if the house is filled with delicate beauties.

79
00:06:04,811 --> 00:06:07,690
Isn't it too many in our residence?

80
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,211
Well, the more, the merrier.

81
00:06:10,211 --> 00:06:11,431
True, though.

82
00:06:11,431 --> 00:06:16,471
County Magistrate Zhuang still wants to marry you when he has already had so many concubines.

83
00:06:16,471 --> 00:06:20,291
Strangely, both Old Master and First Madam reckon that this marriage is beyond your station.

84
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:23,130
If a man indulges in love, he can still break free from it.

85
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,311
But if a woman indulges in love, she'll be trapped forever.

86
00:06:26,311 --> 00:06:28,930
Young Lady, what does it mean?

87
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:35,011
It means once a woman engages in marriage, her entire life is doomed.

88
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:38,511
What if the man's only loyal to his wife?

89
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:42,731
My father even vowed to my mother

90
00:06:42,731 --> 00:06:45,830
that he would never marry other women.

91
00:06:47,071 --> 00:06:49,930
But if you don't get married, you'll have to stand on your own feet.

92
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:55,071
As long as I can  earn my place in the examination, no one can boss me around.

93
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:58,810
I'll be the county magistrate myself, instead of a magistrate's wife.

94
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,490
Only five days before my wedding to Mu Qi. 
    

95
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,191
 [Butler Zhou, Butler of Zhou Residence  
 But she runs off before the wedding.

96
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,990
What does she take me for?

97
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,930
Mu Qi will never escape my grasp.

98
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,370
Go after her.

99
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,870
 Yes! 

100
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,710
   

101
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,185
   

102
00:07:27,731 --> 00:07:30,270
Towering city walls stretches into infinity.

103
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,251
Outside the woods, there's a shoal surrounded by water.

104
00:07:33,251 --> 00:07:34,570
Juli,

105
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:38,010
we'll reach the capital after passing through the forest ahead.

106
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,410
Sure thing.

107
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:58,690
   

108
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:03,551
- How magnificent. 
 - This is truly the great capital.

109
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:04,710
That's right, Young Lady.

110
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,290
Look over there.

111
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,270
How lively.

112
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,230
There are many delicious foods too.

113
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,590
Lord Ding has returned to the capital.

114
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,471
Look at the grandeur.

115
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,991
Look, Juli.

116
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:41,050
That's Lord Ding's carriage.

117
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,711
Is he Lord Ding who petitioned for the reopening of women's examination candidacy?

118
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:50,971
Rumors have it that he's wise as a fox, as proud as a wolf, and as cruel as a tiger.

119
00:08:50,971 --> 00:08:55,411
He's a nefarious demon who can silence a bawling child in Northern Liang.

120
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:57,351
He's truly amazing.

121
00:08:57,351 --> 00:09:01,010
Eight years ago, Lord Ding led the 30,000 soldiers of the Cangwu Army

122
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:04,370
to defeat the 10,000 soldiers of Northern Liang in Yan City.

123
00:09:04,371 --> 00:09:10,470
And this war was also the dark turn of Northern Liang

124
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,171
as the Southern Chen has risen to be on par with them.

125
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:16,191
How did he manage that?

126
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,031
Tutor Shang didn't go into detail on this, though.

127
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:23,330
I will ask Lord Ding about this personally if I get to know him in the future.

128
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,691
All right.

129
00:09:30,244 --> 00:09:32,684
Lord Ding's Residence is right ahead. Let's get off the horse.

130
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:34,911
Hurry up.

131
00:09:34,911 --> 00:09:37,451
Oh, right. You haven't eaten yet.

132
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,330
Here. Take a bite.

133
00:09:42,371 --> 00:09:43,890
Give me the rein.

134
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:53,371
Young Lady, we're moving towards the demon's troop.

135
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,871
 I must take this risk. 

136
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:02,930
Mother! Mother!

137
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,300
    
 Mother!

138
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,292
    
 Wait for me, Mother! I'm to blame!

139
00:10:12,252 --> 00:10:14,510
   

140
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,690
What do we do now?

141
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,431
Come on. Keep on searching.

142
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:33,931
Come on.

143
00:10:45,071 --> 00:10:48,071
Young Lady, you gave me a good scare.

144
00:10:48,071 --> 00:10:51,971
You were actually running toward the demon's troop just now. You're tempting your fate.

145
00:10:51,971 --> 00:10:56,151
I guess Lord Ding's men wouldn't simply kill.

146
00:10:56,151 --> 00:11:01,251
But the hand at the window doesn't seem to be Lord Ding's.

147
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,870
The hand looked smooth and flawless.

148
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,571
It's nothing like the hand of a battle-hardened warrior.

149
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:12,410
I smell a rat here.

150
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:15,810
Young Lady! You have such keen eyes.

151
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,271
Think about this. After the war in Yan City,

152
00:11:18,271 --> 00:11:22,551
both Northern Liang and Southern Chen still struggle in the tug of war,

153
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:25,131
even though we've turned the tide.

154
00:11:25,131 --> 00:11:29,511
In fact, it's because Lord Ding experienced a fatal defeat in the war of Juma River

155
00:11:29,511 --> 00:11:31,490
and the Cangwu Army suffered heavy casualties.

156
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:36,031
Since then, Lord Ding has been keeping in low profile.

157
00:11:36,031 --> 00:11:40,010
However, his return is on the crowd's radar this time.

158
00:11:41,531 --> 00:11:46,230
I think there must be more to it than meets the eye.

159
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,810
By the way, Young Lady, how long can we hide here?

160
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,250
County Magistrate Zhuang's men have spotted us here.

161
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:57,390
Lord Ding has given me an idea.

162
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,450
We need more than one place to hide.

163
00:12:04,535 --> 00:12:06,450
   

164
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,810
You shouldn't have done that.

165
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,051
It was just a little girl who rushed toward her ailing mother.

166
00:12:12,051 --> 00:12:13,771
Why did you draw your sword?

167
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,971
Luckily, I stopped you in time.

168
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:21,731
Aren't you afraid of attracting the city guards after you kill her?

169
00:12:21,731 --> 00:12:22,911
   

170
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,151
His Lordship has delayed his return.

171
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:28,590
I had to pretend to be him and sit in the carriage for such a long time.

172
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,011
My body is sore.

173
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:32,871
I need to get some rest.

174
00:12:35,435 --> 00:12:36,835
   

175
00:12:36,835 --> 00:12:37,811
   

176
00:12:37,811 --> 00:12:39,585
   

177
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,490
My Lord,

178
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,851
    
 you don't have to come here personally.

179
00:13:07,851 --> 00:13:12,610
Besides, Zhimo and Butler Zhang had to put on a show pretending that you'd returned to the capital.

180
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,510
I don't want things to become complicated.

181
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,770
Yes.

182
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,311
My Lord, I didn't expect this place to have a peach blossom forest.

183
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,710
We've been searching for so many years.

184
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,990
Never had we thought it would be in the capital.

185
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,610
   

186
00:14:31,785 --> 00:14:35,131
   

187
00:14:35,131 --> 00:14:36,690
    
 Yuan Chengming.

188
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,330
Finally, we found you.

189
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,891
You have nowhere to hide now.

190
00:14:39,891 --> 00:14:41,970
I'm going to dig your grave now.

191
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,431
Let's see if you're dead or hiding somewhere else.

192
00:14:47,491 --> 00:14:52,190
My Lord! In the war of Juma River, 30,000 troops perished in Ci City.

193
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,471
Yuan Chengming is a traitor.

194
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:56,191
He failed your trust

195
00:14:56,191 --> 00:14:59,971
and disappointed the 30,000 heroes of the Cangwu Army.

196
00:14:59,971 --> 00:15:02,410
Yet to this day,

197
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:05,332
I still don't believe he betrayed us.

198
00:15:05,332 --> 00:15:07,150
My Lord!

199
00:15:15,271 --> 00:15:17,351
 Yuan Chengming betrayed us! 

200
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,231
 We're being ambushed. 

201
00:15:29,385 --> 00:15:32,485
   

202
00:15:34,171 --> 00:15:36,651
Yun Xiangyue?

203
00:15:43,071 --> 00:15:45,090
Send someone to search through the islet in the middle of the lake.

204
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:49,510
Also, exhume his body for investigation and look into Yun Xiangyue,

205
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:52,470
who erected this tombstone under the name of his daughter.

206
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,630
Yes.

207
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:57,810
I must bring the truth back to light.

208
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:01,890
    
 Walk slowly.

209
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,470
Are you drunk, Mr. Qin?

210
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,771
No, I didn't drink much.

211
00:16:04,771 --> 00:16:07,011
I'll be waiting for you here. Please come again.

212
00:16:07,011 --> 00:16:08,911
Sure, I'll come again.

213
00:16:08,911 --> 00:16:10,970
All right. Take care.

214
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,771
Please see him off.

215
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:15,090
    
 People considered fancy ladies undesirable

216
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:19,271
and don't want to come here scared of their names being tainted.

217
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:22,570
However, my mother came from here

218
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,010
and I feel rather familiar with this place.

219
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,450
Young Lady, don't be sad.

220
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:33,090
If it weren't for Third Madam, we wouldn't have had a place to hide.

221
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:36,630
She's still protecting us even though she has left.

222
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:43,971
I'm sure Butler Zhou and the rest won't know lthatwe'd settle in here.

223
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,591
It's a good hiding place.

224
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:52,770
But we won't have a lot of money left after paying for the rental for half a year.

225
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,011
We'll make it through somehow.

226
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:57,151
I'll figure something out.

227
00:16:57,151 --> 00:16:58,851
Don't worry.

228
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,135
   

229
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,550
You're looking for a house, right?

230
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,350
Yes.

231
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,651
This street is called Flower Alley.

232
00:17:11,651 --> 00:17:13,690
Over here, some sell flowers.

233
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,710
And over there, they sell flowers too.

234
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,370
But it's different flowers.

235
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,735
   

236
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:26,791
- Why don't we go inside first? 
 - Sure.

237
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,431
Come on in.

238
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,270
This is a good place.

239
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,290
But you ought to be careful when you go out.

240
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,370
Thank you for telling us.

241
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,810
To be honest, I came here to sit for the metropolitan examination.

242
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,631
I won't cause you any trouble.

243
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:44,350
I didn't expect you to be a provincial graduate, young girl.

244
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:48,031
My mother passed away when I was little. So, my father tutored me for a few years.

245
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,890
Still, you're a well-educated lady.

246
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,470
Not to mention the reopening of women's examination candidacy lately,

247
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,230
even during the reign of Empress Yuanguang,

248
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:59,011
when women's examination candidacy was at its peak, female provincial graduates were rarely seen.

249
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,351
After all, female education is a challenging endeavor.

250
00:18:02,351 --> 00:18:05,550
If you encounter any problems, seek my help.

251
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,911
My surname is Lu. I live at the entrance of this alley.

252
00:18:07,911 --> 00:18:09,370
Thank you so much.

253
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:10,930
- I really appreciate that, Madam Lu. 
 - You're welcome.

254
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,291
- Come on. Let's go in. 
 - Sure. 
 - Sure.

255
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,651
Let's go.

256
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,630
Come in and have a look.

257
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,490
Please look around. This is a good place to stay.

258
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,971
It's just that the house is decrepit

259
00:18:21,971 --> 00:18:23,971
- and has been standing empty for quite some time. 
 - It's all right.

260
00:18:23,971 --> 00:18:25,531
One moment. I'll light the candle.

261
00:18:25,531 --> 00:18:27,060
Thank you.

262
00:18:27,831 --> 00:18:29,650
Let's take a look around here.

263
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,451
Girls, come over here.

264
00:18:33,451 --> 00:18:35,151
This way.

265
00:18:38,691 --> 00:18:39,971
Madam Lu,

266
00:18:39,971 --> 00:18:42,451
why are there so many scrolls?

267
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:46,270
To be honest, the former tenant was an idle poet

268
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,330
who visited Xiaoqin Pleasure House every day.

269
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,230
All fancy ladies like his poems.

270
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,911
And these are scrolls left by him.

271
00:18:53,911 --> 00:18:55,630
Where is the poet now?

272
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,530
He's dead.

273
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,391
He's dead?

274
00:18:59,391 --> 00:19:00,871
Died in failure and depression.

275
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:04,631
This is why this house is rented at a low price.

276
00:19:07,151 --> 00:19:08,631
Young Lady.

277
00:19:08,631 --> 00:19:11,951
Girls, if you dislike this house...

278
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:14,990
No, not at all. Madam Lu, we're fine with this.

279
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,150
Good to know that. Tomorrow, I'll send someone to clean everything up.

280
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,351
I'll get rid of these scrolls, too.

281
00:19:20,351 --> 00:19:21,791
No.

282
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,111
Please leave them here, Madam Lu.

283
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:27,250
I want to read them.

284
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,070
Well, you can have them.

285
00:19:29,731 --> 00:19:31,911
You're quite amusing, girl.

286
00:19:31,911 --> 00:19:35,651
So open-minded. No wonder you have the guts to come for the exam with just a maid beside you.

287
00:19:35,651 --> 00:19:40,770
By the way, I found that your hands were cold when I touched them just now.

288
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:44,470
Also, the white of your eyes is tinged yellow.

289
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,850
Do you always feel numb in your limbs?

290
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,211
And do you find that you're afraid of cold

291
00:19:50,211 --> 00:19:52,470
and you can't sleep well at night?

292
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,431
Exactly. How did you know about that?

293
00:19:54,431 --> 00:19:56,431
Are you a physician, too?

294
00:19:56,431 --> 00:19:59,390
One of my family members works as a physician and I've learned something since I was little.

295
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,790
That's why I have some knowledge.

296
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,151
You have qi and blood deficiency.

297
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:05,791
This is a common sickness for women.

298
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:07,750
Juli, give me the sachet.

299
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,350
I want the sachet.

300
00:20:10,191 --> 00:20:11,791
Here.

301
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:15,490
Madam Lu, I made this scented sachet with some herbs.

302
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,871
You can keep this. Maybe it'll be helpful for you.

303
00:20:17,871 --> 00:20:19,890
This is a precious gift.

304
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,710
I can't accept this.

305
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,790
It's fine.

306
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,270
We still stick with the rental we negotiated before. Right?

307
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,650
I'm fine with the rental.

308
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,831
Please keep this sachet. Don't worry.

309
00:20:30,831 --> 00:20:32,451
Well, I'll take it, then.

310
00:20:32,451 --> 00:20:35,351
You may settle down here. I won't disturb you any longer.

311
00:20:35,351 --> 00:20:36,780
Sure.

312
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,290
   

313
00:20:44,931 --> 00:20:46,070
Young Lady,

314
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:50,231
Third Madam told you to keep your skill from others.

315
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:55,491
There is still some time before the metropolitan examination,

316
00:20:55,491 --> 00:20:59,571
and the cost of the writing supplies will be high.

317
00:20:59,571 --> 00:21:04,390
Not only that, food expenses in the capital are heftier than in other places,

318
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:08,011
so we must make money to feed ourselves.

319
00:21:08,011 --> 00:21:09,291
Rest assured, Young Lady.

320
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,790
You have me, you won't go hungry.

321
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,111
Silly girl, I don't want you to get hungry.

322
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:19,130
All right, go and clean up this place.

323
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:23,871
I'm going to take a good look at the poems.  Go ahead.

324
00:21:23,871 --> 00:21:25,831
All right.

325
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,530
   

326
00:21:34,535 --> 00:21:37,185
   

327
00:21:47,151 --> 00:21:50,051
Young Lady, I have great strength.

328
00:21:50,051 --> 00:21:52,950
I should've carved this for you.

329
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,550
This is for my dearest mother.

330
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,850
I must do this myself.

331
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:01,060
   

332
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,019
Mother,

333
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:13,090
My effort all these years turns out to be worthwhile.

334
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:16,990
Your daughter has become a provincial graduate.

335
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:20,550
Soon, I'll ascend as a metropolitan graduate, too.

336
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,810
Don't worry.

337
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:27,711
I'll surely make something of myself and earn an imperial mandate.

338
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,170
Once I settle down in the capital,

339
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,871
I'll search for your home

340
00:22:33,871 --> 00:22:37,911
and you can rest in peace in your home.

341
00:22:39,051 --> 00:22:40,270
Third Madam,

342
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:46,571
please bless Young Lady for her success and bless us with food, too.

343
00:22:52,606 --> 00:22:55,706
   

344
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,390
Can I help you?

345
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:03,910
Madam Lu told me there's a physician here.

346
00:23:06,631 --> 00:23:08,531
Yes, I am.

347
00:23:08,531 --> 00:23:10,131
I...

348
00:23:14,011 --> 00:23:15,811
Please come in.

349
00:23:23,671 --> 00:23:25,951
Please lie down. I'm going to check you.

350
00:23:25,951 --> 00:23:27,530
You...

351
00:23:28,531 --> 00:23:30,951
Aren't you curious about me?

352
00:23:32,671 --> 00:23:36,251
I guess you live across the street.

353
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:46,070
Aren't you afraid that I'll sully your place?

354
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:50,450
To me, all patients are the same.

355
00:23:51,491 --> 00:23:52,890
Please lie down.

356
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,071
Juli, give it to me.

357
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,670
Please lie down.

358
00:23:58,635 --> 00:24:00,790
   

359
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:03,671
His Lordship caught a cold while traveling on the water amidst the cold weather.

360
00:24:03,671 --> 00:24:05,090
He's been coughing.

361
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:07,750
When will Imperial Physician Zhao come over?

362
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,410
No idea.

363
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,451
Zhimo is at it again, My Lord.

364
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:15,010
He barely responds and only shows his book to others.

365
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:17,551
Had I known it'd turn out like this, I would've come to the capital first.

366
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:21,871
Since Zhimo didn't bring this up, it's not something serious.

367
00:24:21,871 --> 00:24:23,990
Just let him be.

368
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:26,991
You're biased toward him.

369
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:38,230
- Your Highness. 
 - Greetings, Your Highness.

370
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,770
Uncle, why didn't you give a response?

371
00:24:41,451 --> 00:24:42,951
And what of it?

372
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:46,531
Should I go to His Majesty tomorrow

373
00:24:46,531 --> 00:24:49,631
and tell him the First Prince picks on a sick man?

374
00:24:49,631 --> 00:24:51,750
    
 It's not that, Uncle.

375
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,231
    
 I came here to pay you a visit.

376
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:10,171
You were badly hurt by the abortion medicine and lack enough rest for recovery.

377
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:14,070
The bleeding has continued for more than a month. Right?

378
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,530
Haven't you seen a physician even once?

379
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,870
Careful.

380
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:25,791
No physician out there will treat me.

381
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:31,591
I'm merely an old and unattractive prostitute

382
00:25:31,591 --> 00:25:35,470
who got pregnant.

383
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,591
Is there no one here to take care of you?

384
00:25:37,591 --> 00:25:42,210
Madams are busy with the Selection of the Courtesan

385
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:45,110
instead of looking after old ones like us.

386
00:25:50,011 --> 00:25:52,651
When I saw Zhimo alone here,

387
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:56,310
I knew you'd gone somewhere else.

388
00:25:58,668 --> 00:26:03,890
Does His Majesty blame me for not offering my greetings to him in the palace?

389
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,451
Father said you must be tired from the long journey.

390
00:26:07,451 --> 00:26:10,331
You may come to the palace once you have enough rest.

391
00:26:12,731 --> 00:26:18,210
I'll bring gifts for you, Second Prince, and Third Prince when I come back.

392
00:26:18,211 --> 00:26:19,711
That won't do.

393
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,630
I want two gifts, then.

394
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:27,251
You can pick anything you like from my storehouse.

395
00:26:27,251 --> 00:26:28,891
Thank you, Uncle.

396
00:26:31,691 --> 00:26:36,691
By the way, are you feeling better?

397
00:26:36,691 --> 00:26:38,310
Still the same.

398
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:43,891
Imperial Physician Zhao's been searching for medicine for you.

399
00:26:43,891 --> 00:26:47,031
I believe you can be healed very soon.

400
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:51,951
You should've come back earlier today.

401
00:26:51,951 --> 00:26:55,391
Did you go somewhere else to search for new clues again?

402
00:26:55,391 --> 00:26:59,510
Five years ago, Father eradicated all those involved.

403
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:03,531
Uncle, do you still suspect someone else was behind it?

404
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:07,290
 My Lord, He Xin sent you something. 

405
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:11,171
Look. Clues started coming in once we found something.

406
00:27:11,691 --> 00:27:13,091
Come on in.

407
00:27:14,771 --> 00:27:16,271
My Lord.

408
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:21,431
The tomb of Yuan Chengming we found earlier was newly built.

409
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:24,451
But his remains weren't found anywhere in the peach blossom forest.

410
00:27:24,451 --> 00:27:27,631
But He Xin sent us an update.

411
00:27:33,935 --> 00:27:35,011
   

412
00:27:35,011 --> 00:27:39,230
They found Yuan Chengming's trace at Tiantong Mountain in Zhuozhou after the war of Juma River.

413
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:42,051
And they also traced down Yun Xiangyue.

414
00:27:42,051 --> 00:27:44,650
She's Yuan Xiyue, the daughter of Yuan Chengming.

415
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:47,210
After falling from grace and entering a brothel, she changed her name to Yun Xiangyue.

416
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,891
As of now, she's the prominent courtesan in Xiaoqin Pleasure House.

417
00:28:00,731 --> 00:28:01,890
Here's your prescription.

418
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,170
Thank you.

419
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:06,010
You need to buy the herbs yourself.

420
00:28:06,931 --> 00:28:11,990
I, Song Yun, will repay the favor you extended to me today.

421
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,070
Juli.

422
00:28:24,011 --> 00:28:26,610
Young Lady, we made some money.

423
00:28:27,731 --> 00:28:30,550
But is this silver genuine?

424
00:28:33,051 --> 00:28:35,631
She reminds me of my parents.

425
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:38,730
I used to hate my father all these years.

426
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:42,491
But after meeting Miss Song Yun,

427
00:28:43,211 --> 00:28:46,750
for no reason, I started to ponder

428
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:51,871
what dire situation my mother would have faced

429
00:28:51,871 --> 00:28:56,791
and how she would have lived on if she hadn't married my father.

430
00:28:56,791 --> 00:28:59,011
She would've starved.

431
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:06,711
She would've been left in a dark corner as she grew old.

432
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:09,850
My mother came from a noble origin

433
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,731
and was forced to serve at the brothel.

434
00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:17,570
However, no flowers would want to be mired down.

435
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:23,211
I believe many flowers wish to grow into trees.

436
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:28,110
Sadly, time keeps flowing.

437
00:29:29,691 --> 00:29:32,951
Out with the old, in with the new.

438
00:29:35,731 --> 00:29:37,331
Juli,

439
00:29:37,331 --> 00:29:39,051
we mustn't be just flowers.

440
00:29:39,051 --> 00:29:43,790
We should be like trees, tall and sturdy,

441
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:47,231
standing still against cold and bluster.

442
00:29:47,971 --> 00:29:50,931
Young Lady, trees are ugly. That won't do.

443
00:29:50,931 --> 00:29:52,431
You have a dainty look.

444
00:29:52,431 --> 00:29:53,951
It's a waste if you can't be a flower.

445
00:29:53,951 --> 00:29:55,551
That's not what I want.

446
00:29:55,570 --> 00:30:00,310
Per state laws, married women aren't allowed to become officials in the court.

447
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:05,931
So, I'm not going to marry anyone.

448
00:30:05,931 --> 00:30:07,611
You're not marrying anyone?

449
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,870
That's not appropriate, though.

450
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,631
The poet read this, too?

451
00:30:14,631 --> 00:30:16,610
   

452
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:18,310
Young Lady, I've seen this before.

453
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,350
Fortune tellers on the street display this drawing at their stores.

454
00:30:22,251 --> 00:30:24,051
We feed ourselves by offering medical treatments.

455
00:30:24,051 --> 00:30:27,550
Probably the poet lived on this physiognomy art.

456
00:30:29,251 --> 00:30:31,171
    
 Look at this.

457
00:30:32,951 --> 00:30:35,351
"Brings harm to husbands?"

458
00:30:35,351 --> 00:30:36,951
   

459
00:30:36,951 --> 00:30:40,191
My Lord, the Selection of the Courtesan is strict with the participants.

460
00:30:40,191 --> 00:30:44,310
Not only do they require invitations, but participants also have to pay for gold flowers.

461
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,951
I suggest that we climb over the walls and go in.

462
00:30:46,951 --> 00:30:49,891
Given your identity, walking in through the main entrance is not decent.

463
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,150
Climb over the walls?

464
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,751
Do you think it's a decent way?

465
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:58,010
My Lord.

466
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:00,090
I didn't mean that.

467
00:31:03,285 --> 00:31:04,985
   

468
00:31:10,531 --> 00:31:13,830
When will the bright moon appear?

469
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,690
I hold my glass aside and ask.

470
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:23,531
Young Lady, though you can't write good poems, you're good at reciting poems.

471
00:31:23,531 --> 00:31:25,510
Well, just eat the flatbread.

472
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,251
Look! So many beautiful lanterns over there.

473
00:31:28,251 --> 00:31:29,891
Let's go there and take a look.

474
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:31,411
How beautiful.

475
00:31:31,411 --> 00:31:34,390
I'll buy you one when I have money.

476
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,091
Physician Mu.

477
00:31:38,051 --> 00:31:39,370
Physician Mu.

478
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:41,271
I was on my way to your place.

479
00:31:42,211 --> 00:31:45,610
Could you please come to the Xiaoqin Pleasure House with me?

480
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:49,251
Xiaoqin Pleasure House?

481
00:31:49,251 --> 00:31:52,731
I'm sorry to make this unpleasant request.

482
00:31:52,731 --> 00:31:55,371
But please help me.

483
00:31:57,931 --> 00:31:59,390
Okay.

484
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:06,592
You can't go, Young Lady. I'm worried about you.

485
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:08,130
I must go there with you.

486
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,771
Don't worry. I'll be very careful.

487
00:32:09,771 --> 00:32:11,211
Wait for me at home.

488
00:32:11,211 --> 00:32:14,690
- Young Lady, I must go... 
 - Don't move. Stay put.

489
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:24,710
Young Lady, isn't this an ominous mole that brings harm to your husband?

490
00:32:24,731 --> 00:32:26,451
Xiaoqin Pleasure House is a complicated place.

491
00:32:26,451 --> 00:32:28,811
It may help to shield off rotten luck.

492
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,871
Stand still and wait for me here.

493
00:32:32,871 --> 00:32:35,130
You must take care of yourself.

494
00:32:36,235 --> 00:32:39,470
   

495
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:43,371
 Mister, please come in. 

496
00:32:44,891 --> 00:32:49,441
   

497
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,551
    
 Young Lady.

498
00:33:28,551 --> 00:33:30,235
   

499
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:32,170
Young Lady.

500
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:34,510
Why don't we wait until next year?

501
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,631
If I miss out on this,

502
00:33:38,631 --> 00:33:41,051
how can I marry into an affluent and influential family

503
00:33:41,051 --> 00:33:45,690
to find myself a rock to rely on safely?

504
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,730
Suyi...

505
00:33:49,451 --> 00:33:51,591
I'm running out of time.

506
00:33:57,691 --> 00:33:59,230
- Please. 
 - Sure.

507
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:02,431
Miss Yun, this is Physician Mu.

508
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:04,031
This is Miss Yun.

509
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,431
Thank you for coming.

510
00:34:07,431 --> 00:34:09,351
I feel indebted to you.

511
00:34:09,351 --> 00:34:11,011
You flatter me.

512
00:34:12,971 --> 00:34:16,790
 Take care. Please come again. 

513
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:19,760
   

514
00:34:20,411 --> 00:34:21,891
How gorgeous.

515
00:34:21,891 --> 00:34:23,011
Misters.

516
00:34:23,011 --> 00:34:25,751
Can I have a look at your invitation card?

517
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:35,931
Please come in. Please.

518
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:42,951
Miss, acupuncture therapy can't heal your sickness.

519
00:34:42,951 --> 00:34:48,610
Your sickness will relapse if you get cold on the stage later.

520
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:53,670
I don't mean to pry, but the courtesan selection is held annually.

521
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,751
But you're weak...

522
00:34:55,751 --> 00:34:58,251
Yes, the selection is held annually,

523
00:34:58,251 --> 00:35:01,050
but this is my sole opportunity...

524
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,211
to get chosen.

525
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,011
 Bravo! 

526
00:35:22,201 --> 00:35:23,601
 Bravo! 

527
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:56,870
- Her dancing is stunning, isn't it? 
 - Yes, it's stunning.

528
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:07,650
 Bravo! 

529
00:36:08,371 --> 00:36:09,771
 Bravo! 

530
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:13,610
 Good! 

531
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:15,970
 Good! 

532
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:32,331
 Excellent! 

533
00:36:32,331 --> 00:36:33,931
 Graceful. 

534
00:36:35,931 --> 00:36:38,331
Feng Shuangshuang should be the top courtesan of the year.

535
00:36:38,331 --> 00:36:40,170
Yun Xiangyue hasn't performed yet.

536
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:43,031
- She's the newest prominent courtesan this year. 
 - Really?

537
00:36:43,051 --> 00:36:43,891
 Yun Xiangyue! 

538
00:36:43,891 --> 00:36:45,051
 Yun Xiangyue! 

539
00:36:45,051 --> 00:36:46,290
 Yun Xiangyue! 

540
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,411
 Yun Xiangyue! 

541
00:36:47,411 --> 00:36:48,451
 Yun Xiangyue! 

542
00:36:48,451 --> 00:36:53,051
 Yun Xiangyue! 

543
00:36:53,051 --> 00:36:54,930
    
 Here she is.

544
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:12,331
 Great! 

545
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:15,410
 Bravo! 

546
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:23,311
 Excellent! 

547
00:37:55,035 --> 00:37:56,690
   

548
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:58,570
   
 Qi, stop dancing. 

549
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,051
 You should study now. 

550
00:38:00,051 --> 00:38:02,491
 Mother, is dancing not good? 

551
00:38:02,491 --> 00:38:05,630
 You dance too. Why must I study? 

552
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,811
   
 Nothing's wrong with dancing. 

553
00:38:07,811 --> 00:38:12,451
 However, through studies, you'll be sensible and capable of telling right from wrong. 

554
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:15,351
 By that time, you can distinguish whether dancing is good or not. 

555
00:38:15,351 --> 00:38:17,431
 Not just listen to me. 

556
00:38:17,431 --> 00:38:19,031
 Understood? 

557
00:38:23,931 --> 00:38:25,531
Miss Song,

558
00:38:25,531 --> 00:38:29,830
does Miss Yun truly love dancing?

559
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:35,271
To be frank, when one steps into this house of ill repute,

560
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:39,271
they'll start loathing dancing, even if they used to enjoy it.

561
00:38:39,271 --> 00:38:41,791
But Yun is different.

562
00:38:41,791 --> 00:38:46,590
After she came here, she was reticent.

563
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:50,951
In less than three months, she has already mastered all songs and dances

564
00:38:50,951 --> 00:38:53,550
and became a prominent courtesan before long.

565
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:56,451
Why must she work so hard?

566
00:38:56,451 --> 00:38:58,210
I wonder too.

567
00:39:19,951 --> 00:39:23,331
 Bravo! 

568
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:33,791
 Yun Xiangyue! 

569
00:39:38,728 --> 00:39:42,250
The top courtesan last year was worth more than 1,600 gold flowers.

570
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,531
We shall wait and see.

571
00:39:43,531 --> 00:39:45,531
Perhaps Yun Xiangyue is more valuable.

572
00:39:45,531 --> 00:39:50,570
Gentlemen, offer your gold flowers to the beauty for an amorous and long night.

573
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:53,791
I wonder who will bring home this delicate beauty.

574
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:57,311
I'll go for 2,000 gold flowers.

575
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,051
 Wow, 2,000. 

576
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:03,811
2,500 gold flowers.

577
00:40:09,371 --> 00:40:11,251
3,000 gold flowers.

578
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:13,270
3,000?

579
00:40:15,051 --> 00:40:16,851
3,500.

580
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:25,631
Are they splurging a fortune just for Yun Xiangyue?

581
00:40:28,411 --> 00:40:30,011
As expected of men.

582
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:34,610
I'll go for 4,000. She's mine.

583
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,411
No way, 4,000?

584
00:40:39,411 --> 00:40:41,930
4,500 gold flowers.

585
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,531
Congratulations, mister.

586
00:40:47,531 --> 00:40:50,231
You won her with 4,500 gold flowers.

587
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:53,650
Congratulations to Yun Xiangyue on becoming the new top courtesan of the year.

588
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,411
What a silly moneybag.

589
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,511
He spent so much money.

590
00:41:03,931 --> 00:41:08,091
 Tsk-tsk, men. It's useless even though he looks good from the back. 

591
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,911
 I'm better off going back to study. 

592
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,651
I'm leaving.

593
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,750
Physician Mu,

594
00:41:15,311 --> 00:41:16,811
I...

595
00:41:16,811 --> 00:41:19,291
Is there anything I can help you with?

596
00:41:20,451 --> 00:41:22,931
Can I ask you for a favor?

597
00:41:22,931 --> 00:41:26,570
Well... many of my friends in the backyard have been feeling very sick.

598
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:30,510
Physician Mu, if you have time now, could you please...

599
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:33,110
Yes, sure. Please show me the way.

600
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,451
Thank you so much.

601
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:36,011
Please accept a bow from me.

602
00:41:36,011 --> 00:41:37,130
No, please.

603
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:39,231
- Let's go, Miss Song. 
 - Come on.

604
00:42:25,271 --> 00:42:28,351
I... I'm a physician. Please don't kill me.

605
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:41,010


606
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:51,600
♫  I can't forget the love that is still is nipping at my ears and temples  ♫
