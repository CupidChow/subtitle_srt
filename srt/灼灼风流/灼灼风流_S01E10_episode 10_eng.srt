2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,459
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:35,000
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:47,879
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,059
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:58,159
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:03,379
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:08,480
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,579
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:18,639
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

12
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:24,000
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,239
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:36,918
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,019
   

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,959
   

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,939
   

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,939
   

19
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,185
   

20
00:01:54,735 --> 00:01:56,795
The porridge is too watery.

21
00:01:56,795 --> 00:01:59,155
The kids are growing.

22
00:01:59,155 --> 00:02:01,055
Put more rice into this.

23
00:02:02,134 --> 00:02:05,035
Your Highness, the rice price is on the rise.

24
00:02:05,035 --> 00:02:07,374
Jishan Hall in the capital opened not long ago.

25
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:11,835
We don't have an abundance of money or rice.

26
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:16,974
I received a handsome reward at the palace.

27
00:02:16,974 --> 00:02:19,295
We'll put that to use.

28
00:02:19,295 --> 00:02:20,914
Yes.

29
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,334
Is there anything else?

30
00:02:27,334 --> 00:02:30,814
I'm afraid Official Shen won't be here again.

31
00:02:30,815 --> 00:02:34,495
After all, you refused to marry him in front of everyone.

32
00:02:34,495 --> 00:02:38,554
Mr. Shen, what does your name mean?

33
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,394
Jinghong Yipie?

34
00:02:46,394 --> 00:02:49,394
Isn't this your name?

35
00:02:49,394 --> 00:02:52,415
This line is an idiom.

36
00:02:52,415 --> 00:02:57,534
    
 It means a great wonder that is transient

37
00:02:57,534 --> 00:02:59,855
but not easily forgotten.

38
00:02:59,855 --> 00:03:02,114
It stays in your memory.

39
00:03:03,854 --> 00:03:06,193
- Understood? 
 - Yes.

40
00:03:35,134 --> 00:03:36,334
I've been searching all day.

41
00:03:36,335 --> 00:03:38,755
There you are, our Master Scholar.

42
00:03:38,755 --> 00:03:41,155
Time to receive your decree.

43
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:43,914
The imperial decree arrives!

44
00:03:50,034 --> 00:03:53,094
Shen Jinghong of Huaizhou,

45
00:03:53,094 --> 00:03:56,514
the Master Scholar of the 24th year of the Zhaoming Reign,

46
00:03:56,514 --> 00:03:59,834
will hereby receive the Primary Six-Rank position of editor,

47
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:02,214
implemented by the head of Hanlin Academy.

48
00:04:02,214 --> 00:04:05,514
The 24th year of the Zhaoming Reign, on the fifth day of the third month.

49
00:04:05,514 --> 00:04:07,534
The end.

50
00:04:07,535 --> 00:04:09,695
I'm grateful to His Majesty.

51
00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:39,915
I am here to congratulate you on winning first place.

52
00:04:39,915 --> 00:04:42,935
I was waiting at your home, but you never showed up.

53
00:04:42,935 --> 00:04:46,574
As it turned out, you're at my sister's place.

54
00:04:46,575 --> 00:04:48,354
My apologies, Your Highness.

55
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:51,493
Well, I'm not that petty of a person.

56
00:04:51,494 --> 00:04:53,514
Chen'er, it's not Mr. Shen's fault.

57
00:04:53,514 --> 00:04:56,074
He's been helping out at Jishan Hall lately.

58
00:04:56,074 --> 00:04:58,375
The kids love him.

59
00:04:59,694 --> 00:05:01,654
You're kind as ever.

60
00:05:02,575 --> 00:05:06,554
If Jishan Hall needs anything, let me know.

61
00:05:06,575 --> 00:05:09,155
Chen'er, you have my thanks.

62
00:05:09,155 --> 00:05:11,975
Don't mention it, Sister.

63
00:05:11,975 --> 00:05:17,373
I was going to celebrate for you, but it seems you have work at hand.

64
00:05:17,374 --> 00:05:19,094
I appreciate the thought, Your Highness.

65
00:05:19,095 --> 00:05:23,034
However, I promised the children to give them a lesson.

66
00:05:23,034 --> 00:05:25,754
It's all right. We can meet up later.

67
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:29,234
Sister, I take my leave now.

68
00:05:29,234 --> 00:05:30,795
See His Highness off for me.

69
00:05:30,795 --> 00:05:32,295
Yes.

70
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,774
- Come with me. 
 - Yes.

71
00:05:52,135 --> 00:05:54,754
Becoming the Master Scholar is worth celebrating.

72
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,395
I have a book titled "Records of Governance."

73
00:05:57,395 --> 00:05:59,214
It's my gift to you.

74
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,994
The court is unpredictable. A great duty warrants a long journey.

75
00:06:02,994 --> 00:06:04,954
Do not give up halfway.

76
00:06:04,954 --> 00:06:06,895
I'll remember that.

77
00:06:34,814 --> 00:06:36,613
The First Prince has high expectations of you.

78
00:06:36,614 --> 00:06:38,334
Your career should be your priority.

79
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,175
Do your best as his aide.

80
00:06:40,175 --> 00:06:44,834
Do not waste your time and effort on distractions.

81
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:52,215
An officer must serve the people.

82
00:06:52,215 --> 00:06:56,775
What I did today is a service for the people.

83
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,280
   

84
00:07:24,035 --> 00:07:27,374
Young Lady, everything is packed up.

85
00:07:27,374 --> 00:07:30,614
Housing in Zhuque Street comes with too steep a price.

86
00:07:30,614 --> 00:07:34,614
We barely have money left after we pay the rent.

87
00:07:34,614 --> 00:07:36,714
Don't worry.

88
00:07:36,714 --> 00:07:39,707
I will do my best to make more money.

89
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,308
I won't let you starve.

90
00:07:41,308 --> 00:07:43,314
None of us should starve.

91
00:07:43,314 --> 00:07:46,575
Indeed. No one will be starved.

92
00:07:49,934 --> 00:07:52,915
By the way, Juli, pack these herbs up for me.

93
00:07:52,915 --> 00:07:55,915
Send them to Madam Lu and Miss Song.

94
00:07:55,915 --> 00:07:59,593
After we move to Zhuque Street, we'll live pretty far from Flower Alley.

95
00:07:59,593 --> 00:08:02,675
Commuting won't be as easy as now.

96
00:08:02,675 --> 00:08:05,853
Save the frequently used herbs for them in case of an emergency.

97
00:08:05,854 --> 00:08:07,454
Yes.

98
00:08:12,035 --> 00:08:17,655
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

99
00:08:17,655 --> 00:08:21,594
- It's beautiful. 
 - Yeah, Young Lady.

100
00:08:23,895 --> 00:08:25,375
Look at that.

101
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,514
♫  ...across treacherous heights  ♫

102
00:08:27,514 --> 00:08:29,435
Look at this, Young Lady. I was right!

103
00:08:29,435 --> 00:08:33,075
Yeah. This house is so spacious.

104
00:08:33,075 --> 00:08:36,614
- Young Lady, that house is gorgeous. 
 - It's on a lake!

105
00:08:37,614 --> 00:08:39,433
These are all ours now.

106
00:08:39,433 --> 00:08:42,505
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

107
00:08:42,505 --> 00:08:48,565
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

108
00:08:48,565 --> 00:08:55,055
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

109
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:05,075
Young Lady, our new home is amazing.

110
00:09:05,075 --> 00:09:08,614
It's much bigger than the house in Flower Alley.

111
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,814
But the rent is a bit pricey.

112
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:12,613
We could get tons of marinated trotters with it.

113
00:09:12,614 --> 00:09:15,214
But for Third Madam, it's worth every penny.

114
00:09:15,215 --> 00:09:16,915
Yes.

115
00:09:16,915 --> 00:09:20,994
Now, I have a job and we have a place to stay.

116
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:23,835
When we get the day off, we must start looking for the place

117
00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:25,373
where my mother once lived.

118
00:09:25,374 --> 00:09:26,475
Yes.

119
00:09:26,475 --> 00:09:28,533
Let's learn the truth about my mother's past.

120
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:31,574
Once I get promoted at work, I'll get a substantial raise.

121
00:09:31,575 --> 00:09:34,674
You can get as many trotters as you want then.

122
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,495
How nice of you.

123
00:09:36,495 --> 00:09:38,835
Young Lady, what would you like to have?

124
00:09:38,835 --> 00:09:41,133
Is food all you can think about?

125
00:09:41,134 --> 00:09:43,013
Food is bliss.

126
00:09:43,014 --> 00:09:45,555
But dinner tonight was a bit too salty.

127
00:09:45,555 --> 00:09:48,634
- I'll ease up on the seasoning next time. 
 - Okay.

128
00:09:48,634 --> 00:09:49,653
Go to sleep.

129
00:09:49,654 --> 00:09:52,995
I must report to Hanlin Academy tomorrow morning.

130
00:10:01,215 --> 00:10:03,554
You're already asleep?

131
00:10:03,554 --> 00:10:05,614
What a silly girl.

132
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:23,215
 From now on, 

133
00:10:23,215 --> 00:10:27,234
 I must never place my fate in another's hand. 

134
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,414
 I must walk this path on my own. 

135
00:11:02,815 --> 00:11:04,315
Who is there?

136
00:11:10,134 --> 00:11:11,854
No one's here.

137
00:11:22,718 --> 00:11:27,472
   

138
00:11:38,494 --> 00:11:43,434
I was told that you and that female Tanhua have been very close.

139
00:11:45,315 --> 00:11:47,855
We don't always get female scholars.

140
00:11:47,855 --> 00:11:49,993
I admire her talents.

141
00:11:49,993 --> 00:11:52,695
So I thought I should help her out.

142
00:11:59,374 --> 00:12:03,174
You are always too kind.

143
00:12:06,695 --> 00:12:09,695
You've only known her for a few days.

144
00:12:10,695 --> 00:12:15,195
I bet you don't even know where she comes from.

145
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:21,654
 You'd enlightened me when I was little, Your Highness. 

146
00:12:22,295 --> 00:12:24,314
 How fated we are. 

147
00:12:24,314 --> 00:12:26,135
 Was it in Jiangnan? 

148
00:12:26,135 --> 00:12:27,253
 Your Highness. 

149
00:12:27,254 --> 00:12:28,493
 Do you remember that? 

150
00:12:28,494 --> 00:12:33,074
 Your accent sounds like folks from Huaizhou, Jiangnan. 

151
00:12:34,455 --> 00:12:37,534
 I am from Yanzhou, actually. 

152
00:12:39,654 --> 00:12:41,975
I do know where she is from.

153
00:12:41,975 --> 00:12:44,454
She was born in Yanzhou of Jiangnan.

154
00:12:44,454 --> 00:12:47,555
She passed the imperial examination in spite of her young age.

155
00:12:47,555 --> 00:12:49,635
She has outstanding talents.

156
00:12:51,614 --> 00:12:53,114
All right.

157
00:12:53,134 --> 00:12:55,915
You've been serving me for long enough.

158
00:12:55,915 --> 00:12:58,353
You must be tired. You may go back now.

159
00:12:59,795 --> 00:13:02,854
Grandmother, rest well.

160
00:13:13,774 --> 00:13:15,274
Your Majesty.

161
00:13:15,935 --> 00:13:18,414
I've been watching Mu Zhuohua for days.

162
00:13:18,415 --> 00:13:20,115
There's nothing unusual.

163
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:24,094
- Except for... 
 - What is it?

164
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,074
She moved to a new house.

165
00:13:26,074 --> 00:13:27,594
She is now an official, after all.

166
00:13:27,594 --> 00:13:30,114
It may not be suitable for her to live on Flower Alley anymore.

167
00:13:30,114 --> 00:13:33,514
It's normal if she wants to live closer to where she works.

168
00:13:35,854 --> 00:13:37,755
If there's nothing unusual,

169
00:13:38,975 --> 00:13:42,615
stop wasting your time on this woman.

170
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:45,274
Yes. I understand.

171
00:14:07,215 --> 00:14:08,515
Juli!

172
00:14:09,195 --> 00:14:11,514
Juli, it's time to wake up.

173
00:14:11,514 --> 00:14:13,254
Wake up!

174
00:14:14,815 --> 00:14:16,415
How do I look?

175
00:14:18,654 --> 00:14:19,533
Young Lady.

176
00:14:19,534 --> 00:14:21,574
Why are you up so early?

177
00:14:21,575 --> 00:14:24,094
We did cleaning and moved house yesterday.

178
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:25,334
Aren't you tired at all?

179
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:26,294
Not at all.

180
00:14:26,295 --> 00:14:27,934
This is my first day at work.

181
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:31,575
I must embrace this new chapter of life in my best condition.

182
00:14:35,985 --> 00:14:38,753
   

183
00:14:39,774 --> 00:14:43,414
Here at Hanlin Academy, we write books and record history,

184
00:14:43,614 --> 00:14:45,214
    
 and we compose the edicts.

185
00:14:45,215 --> 00:14:45,975
   

186
00:14:45,976 --> 00:14:52,014
We may not hold high ranks here, but this place grooms great leaders.

187
00:14:53,215 --> 00:14:56,934
What you're seeing is where we write books and record history.

188
00:14:56,935 --> 00:15:00,275
This shall be your workplace from now on.

189
00:15:01,075 --> 00:15:02,753
These tasks may look simple.

190
00:15:02,753 --> 00:15:05,575
But they require great wisdom and knowledge.

191
00:15:06,434 --> 00:15:07,934
Official Sun.

192
00:15:07,935 --> 00:15:13,554
By the way, if there is anything you need help with,

193
00:15:13,554 --> 00:15:15,295
feel free to ask me.

194
00:15:16,075 --> 00:15:17,414
 Much obliged, sir. 

195
00:15:17,415 --> 00:15:18,214
You're welcome.

196
00:15:18,215 --> 00:15:19,955
Here, let's go inside.

197
00:15:20,774 --> 00:15:22,074
Come on.

198
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:31,393
For the first time, there is a female officer in Hanlin Academy!

199
00:15:31,393 --> 00:15:33,295
That is your desk.

200
00:15:33,854 --> 00:15:36,294
This is Miss Mu's desk.

201
00:15:36,295 --> 00:15:37,895
Look at her.

202
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:41,574
The uniform looks preposterous on a woman!

203
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:44,215
A lady should be delicate and gentle.

204
00:15:44,215 --> 00:15:45,733
Only then is she likable.

205
00:15:45,734 --> 00:15:50,653
Do you expect her to come here with rouge on her face while wearing an extravagant outfit?

206
00:15:51,254 --> 00:15:52,773
Why not?

207
00:15:52,774 --> 00:15:54,613
What can a woman like her possibly do?

208
00:15:54,614 --> 00:15:57,253
She will have to get married and have children eventually.

209
00:15:57,254 --> 00:16:00,434
Why not dress up and please our eyes?

210
00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:02,175
That should work!

211
00:16:02,175 --> 00:16:07,513
In that case, I think men should get married and have a family of their own.

212
00:16:07,513 --> 00:16:09,974
They can do well keeping the wife and children company.

213
00:16:09,975 --> 00:16:13,013
Why don't you go home and start preparing dinner?

214
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,273
    
 Wouldn't that be great?

215
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:19,893
Besides, how can you be sure the virtues of our ancestors were not the same as womanly virtues?

216
00:16:19,893 --> 00:16:23,373
Judging by the gentlemen's logic, we will all die eventually.

217
00:16:23,374 --> 00:16:25,733
Why do you two even bother becoming officers?

218
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,915
Why not buy yourself a coffin and sleep in it?

219
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,934
Our Master Scholar and Tanhua are really eloquent.

220
00:16:31,935 --> 00:16:33,675
Your logic is certainly outstanding.

221
00:16:33,675 --> 00:16:35,094
Well said.

222
00:16:35,754 --> 00:16:39,795
Don't forget, Mr. Sun, you're an outstanding Bangyan yourself. 
  (Candidate who came second in the Hanlin examination) 

223
00:16:39,795 --> 00:16:41,575
I'm flattered.

224
00:16:43,774 --> 00:16:45,854
 There goes her insolence again. 

225
00:16:45,894 --> 00:16:49,493
 How could Father assign me a tutor like her? 

226
00:17:05,455 --> 00:17:07,615
 Your Highness. 

227
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:12,555
As the chief examiner of the day,

228
00:17:12,555 --> 00:17:16,015
I shall do one last thing for you.

229
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:21,975
I came to relay His Majesty's decree.

230
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:31,555
Shen Jinghong,

231
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:33,875
Sun Yunqian...

232
00:17:40,774 --> 00:17:42,695
and Mu Zhuohua.

233
00:17:44,935 --> 00:17:48,355
In a few days, you shall start giving lessons at Zhixing College.

234
00:17:49,294 --> 00:17:51,875
 Much obliged, Your Majesty. 

235
00:17:55,415 --> 00:17:56,915
Rise.

236
00:18:00,215 --> 00:18:03,274
Over the years, old scholars have been giving us lessons.

237
00:18:03,274 --> 00:18:05,595
But Father changed the rules this year.

238
00:18:06,175 --> 00:18:11,055
You must live up toFather's expectations.

239
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:13,414
 Yes, Your Highness. 

240
00:18:23,254 --> 00:18:27,294
The academy is full of conifers.

241
00:18:27,294 --> 00:18:29,915
But an osmanthus tree stands out among them.

242
00:18:30,515 --> 00:18:33,255
What an unsightly view.

243
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:46,013
Your Highness, I think the osmanthus tree looks pretty.

244
00:18:46,014 --> 00:18:48,514
The strength of character is not inferior to the green pines and verdant cypresses.

245
00:18:48,534 --> 00:18:54,695
Miss Mu, are you not afraid that this beautiful tree will be destroyed by the wind?

246
00:18:55,814 --> 00:18:58,614
Your Highness and I share the same thought.

247
00:18:58,615 --> 00:19:02,754
I also think the osmanthus tree is really beautiful in the forest.

248
00:19:08,135 --> 00:19:11,255
You are good with your words, Miss Mu.

249
00:19:11,255 --> 00:19:14,315
Indeed, Your Highness.

250
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:26,134
Very well. I shall wait and see

251
00:19:26,134 --> 00:19:30,215
how talented and skilled Miss Mu is.

252
00:19:33,695 --> 00:19:36,355
 Safe travel, Your Highness. 

253
00:19:45,254 --> 00:19:49,274
Now that she gets the chance to be His Highness' tutor.

254
00:19:49,274 --> 00:19:52,415
Who knows when she will become a consort?

255
00:19:52,415 --> 00:19:56,355
Now that you mention it, I wish I were a woman.

256
00:19:58,355 --> 00:20:00,055
Don't be silly.

257
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:25,695
From what I see, the only osmanthus tree in the yard

258
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:27,614
will grow to be tall and strong.

259
00:20:31,334 --> 00:20:33,234
Thank you, Shen.

260
00:20:33,234 --> 00:20:37,294
I believe when there is a will, there is a way.

261
00:20:37,294 --> 00:20:39,633
Endeavors shall be rewarded.

262
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:41,134
Well said.

263
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:47,415
What do you plan to teach the three princes?

264
00:20:47,415 --> 00:20:49,474
Good question.

265
00:20:50,054 --> 00:20:51,835
I'll teach geography.

266
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:53,435
Geography?

267
00:20:53,455 --> 00:20:55,713
You certainly are knowledgeable.

268
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,034
I'm flattered.

269
00:20:57,034 --> 00:20:59,654
I may not know as much as you and Official Sun.

270
00:20:59,655 --> 00:21:01,894
But I have read a variety of books.

271
00:21:01,895 --> 00:21:06,315
I can teach the princes about the cultures and customs of the nation.

272
00:21:06,315 --> 00:21:08,994
I hope they like it.

273
00:21:10,175 --> 00:21:12,815
These three are no pushovers.

274
00:21:12,815 --> 00:21:16,055
Jinghong, you'll have to take the lead.

275
00:21:16,055 --> 00:21:20,115
When Miss Mu isn't afraid, why are you worried?

276
00:21:20,115 --> 00:21:21,554
Good point.

277
00:21:23,494 --> 00:21:25,495
Brother Sun. Brother Shen.

278
00:21:25,495 --> 00:21:29,813
Do you think that we can stand tall and proud like the trees

279
00:21:29,814 --> 00:21:34,994
years from now and become pillars of Xuanzheng Palace?

280
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:37,334
I'm sure we can.

281
00:21:38,734 --> 00:21:42,094
A life with grand ambitions

282
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:45,015
shall not bring disappointments as the rivers flow.

283
00:21:45,714 --> 00:21:48,235
With ten years...

284
00:21:48,294 --> 00:21:51,574
No, just five years.

285
00:21:51,574 --> 00:21:55,775
I shall bring changes to the imperial court of Southern Chen.

286
00:21:57,814 --> 00:22:01,654
I don't share Jinghong's grand ambitions and visions.

287
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:03,573
My focus is managing the Ministry of Works.

288
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:05,533
We build cities and fix houses.

289
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:08,495
None shall ever lose their homes again.

290
00:22:08,534 --> 00:22:10,013
Brother Sun. Brother Shen.

291
00:22:10,014 --> 00:22:12,854
This osmanthus tree shall be our witness today.

292
00:22:12,855 --> 00:22:17,474
Five years from now, the three of us shall make a name for ourselves in the imperial court.

293
00:22:17,494 --> 00:22:19,194
- Yes! 
 - Yes!

294
00:22:29,534 --> 00:22:32,534
Young Lady, what are you drawing?

295
00:22:33,415 --> 00:22:35,215
This is a map.

296
00:22:36,094 --> 00:22:37,813
In a few days, we, the three top scholars,

297
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:40,634
will be giving the three princes lessons.

298
00:22:40,634 --> 00:22:44,075
Shen Jinghong is close to the First Prince.

299
00:22:44,075 --> 00:22:48,015
Sun Yunqian is the cousin of the other two princes.

300
00:22:49,294 --> 00:22:50,994
But me?

301
00:22:52,294 --> 00:22:54,875
You have no one to back you up, Young Lady.

302
00:22:56,534 --> 00:23:02,134
But I am someone who's already escaped a marriage.

303
00:23:02,134 --> 00:23:03,894
I topped the imperial examination.

304
00:23:03,895 --> 00:23:06,533
I even earned Lord Ding's trust.

305
00:23:06,534 --> 00:23:09,533
I made it through all of these great challenges.

306
00:23:09,534 --> 00:23:13,374
Why would I be scared of giving lessons to the three princes?

307
00:23:15,615 --> 00:23:19,854
By the way, Juli, didn't I tell you to prepare some presents?

308
00:23:19,855 --> 00:23:21,395
Are they ready?

309
00:23:21,395 --> 00:23:22,654
I have a day off tomorrow.

310
00:23:22,655 --> 00:23:25,614
We should help my mother find her old home.

311
00:23:25,615 --> 00:23:26,934
I have them ready, Young Lady.

312
00:23:26,935 --> 00:23:28,654
We can set out tomorrow morning.

313
00:23:28,655 --> 00:23:30,794
Great, we'll do just that.

314
00:23:37,655 --> 00:23:40,433
Young Lady, are you sure we can find her home this way?

315
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:44,134
Yes. I remember Mother once told me this when I was little.

316
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:49,954
 Mother, do you like apricot blossoms? 

317
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,835
 I don't. 

318
00:23:54,855 --> 00:23:56,934
 When I was little, 

319
00:23:56,934 --> 00:24:02,334
 there was a spring where apricot blossoms covered the trees. 

320
00:24:02,334 --> 00:24:05,433
 The petals fell into the pond. 

321
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:09,415
 I tried to pick them up. 

322
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:12,994
 But I fell into the water and almost drowned. 

323
00:24:13,895 --> 00:24:15,134
 What happened then? 

324
00:24:15,135 --> 00:24:16,735
 Then? 

325
00:24:17,615 --> 00:24:19,535
 I can't remember. 

326
00:24:25,355 --> 00:24:27,994
An apricot tree and a pond?

327
00:24:27,994 --> 00:24:28,934
Yes.

328
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:34,294
If this street is full of elder imperial physicians, we should ask around.

329
00:24:34,294 --> 00:24:36,773
- Let's start with this. 
 - Yes.

330
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:44,115
 Coming. 

331
00:24:45,935 --> 00:24:46,913
Greetings.

332
00:24:46,913 --> 00:24:50,013
Young ladies, is there anything I can help you with?

333
00:24:50,014 --> 00:24:51,533
We just moved here recently.

334
00:24:51,534 --> 00:24:53,694
We live in the 17th courtyard of the street.

335
00:24:53,695 --> 00:24:57,154
We came by to visit our neighbors.

336
00:24:57,154 --> 00:24:58,594
Juli.

337
00:24:59,175 --> 00:25:01,053
We prepared a little gift for you.

338
00:25:01,054 --> 00:25:02,754
I hope you like it.

339
00:25:02,754 --> 00:25:03,894
That is very nice of you.

340
00:25:03,895 --> 00:25:05,233
- Come in. 
 - Yes. Thank you.

341
00:25:05,233 --> 00:25:08,735
There is no need to bring me a gift for a visit.

342
00:25:08,735 --> 00:25:11,853
People move in and out all the time.

343
00:25:11,853 --> 00:25:15,915
But I've never met anyone who is as well-mannered as you.

344
00:25:15,935 --> 00:25:18,675
The apricot tree is beautiful.

345
00:25:19,294 --> 00:25:24,355
Our apricot tree has the most beautiful blossoms on Zhuque Street.

346
00:25:24,355 --> 00:25:30,113
Madam, do you mean there are other houses with apricot trees in the yard?

347
00:25:30,114 --> 00:25:32,335
They symbolize great skills.

348
00:25:32,335 --> 00:25:35,033
In the past, physicians from the Imperial Academy of Medicine

349
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,875
loved to have an apricot tree in the yard.

350
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:42,274
So there must be many imperial physicians on the street.

351
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:43,414
In the past, yes.

352
00:25:43,415 --> 00:25:45,674
But not anymore.

353
00:25:45,674 --> 00:25:50,674
About 30 years ago, several imperial physicians were in grave trouble.

354
00:25:51,315 --> 00:25:53,433
The others thought it was a bad omen.

355
00:25:53,433 --> 00:25:55,274
So, they moved away.

356
00:25:55,895 --> 00:25:57,575
Grave trouble?

357
00:25:58,814 --> 00:26:00,414
Yes.

358
00:26:00,414 --> 00:26:04,254
Rumor has it that they failed to save a person of prestige in the palace.

359
00:26:04,254 --> 00:26:05,913
Their family wealth was confiscated.

360
00:26:05,913 --> 00:26:09,775
Even their wives and children were banished as outcasts.

361
00:26:14,975 --> 00:26:18,414
We were on the street the whole day.

362
00:26:18,415 --> 00:26:20,454
Many houses have an apricot tree in the yard.

363
00:26:20,455 --> 00:26:23,494
But none of them has a pond.

364
00:26:23,494 --> 00:26:25,654
All that's left is the one next door.

365
00:26:25,654 --> 00:26:28,913
No one knows its owner.

366
00:26:28,913 --> 00:26:31,455
No one has seen anyone move in either.

367
00:26:32,094 --> 00:26:34,435
But it's such a huge house.

368
00:26:35,075 --> 00:26:37,215
There must be a pond in there.

369
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:40,274
Young Lady, are you saying...

370
00:26:40,294 --> 00:26:42,374
Juli, get me a ladder.

371
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:43,775
Yes.

372
00:26:47,054 --> 00:26:48,893
Young Lady, why do you need a ladder?

373
00:26:48,893 --> 00:26:51,253
I want to check out the house. Go get me a ladder.

374
00:26:51,254 --> 00:26:52,913
Young Lady, wait here.

375
00:26:52,913 --> 00:26:54,314
Wait here.

376
00:27:02,175 --> 00:27:04,594
There should be a pond.

377
00:27:07,695 --> 00:27:08,654
I got it, Young Lady.

378
00:27:08,655 --> 00:27:10,455
Come closer.

379
00:27:14,615 --> 00:27:16,415
That's safe.

380
00:27:16,415 --> 00:27:20,214
Silly girl, I'm visiting a neighbor, not entering a thieves' den.

381
00:27:20,214 --> 00:27:21,253
Is this necessary?

382
00:27:21,254 --> 00:27:24,975
Just in case the house is a den of a tiger or worse.

383
00:27:24,975 --> 00:27:27,854
If a tiger lived there, would this mole save me?

384
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:30,295
Would a tiger be picky with its food?

385
00:27:31,014 --> 00:27:32,414
Get me the ladder, quick.

386
00:27:32,415 --> 00:27:33,815
Go.

387
00:27:38,655 --> 00:27:40,434
Young Lady, here you go.

388
00:27:55,655 --> 00:27:58,474
Juli, wait for me at home.

389
00:27:58,474 --> 00:28:01,474
Young Lady, stay safe!

390
00:28:28,234 --> 00:28:31,093
 That person looks so familiar from the back. 

391
00:28:31,094 --> 00:28:32,573
Zhimo.

392
00:28:32,574 --> 00:28:34,274
Get me a cloak.

393
00:28:34,274 --> 00:28:35,855
Zhimo?

394
00:28:36,814 --> 00:28:38,714
 He is Lord Ding! 

395
00:28:40,054 --> 00:28:41,454
Zhimo?

396
00:28:44,175 --> 00:28:45,733
Get me a cloak.

397
00:28:45,734 --> 00:28:46,854
 I should run. 

398
00:28:46,855 --> 00:28:48,013
 No! 

399
00:28:48,014 --> 00:28:49,915
 What if he turns around? 

400
00:28:49,935 --> 00:28:52,614
 Whatever, I'm taking my chances. 

401
00:29:14,975 --> 00:29:16,815
Lord Ding, it's me.

402
00:29:18,774 --> 00:29:20,274
Mu Zhuohua?

403
00:29:21,254 --> 00:29:22,754
It's you again.

404
00:29:23,494 --> 00:29:24,994
My Lord...

405
00:29:26,094 --> 00:29:29,074
My Lord, I was merely curious about who lived here.

406
00:29:29,074 --> 00:29:31,475
I came over because I thought no one was here.

407
00:29:31,494 --> 00:29:35,115
I didn't know this was your house.

408
00:29:36,895 --> 00:29:38,694
My Lord, your cloak.

409
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:41,054
Let me get it for you.

410
00:29:45,294 --> 00:29:47,074
What are the odds?

411
00:29:48,734 --> 00:29:53,254
Perhaps we are fated to meet here.

412
00:29:56,574 --> 00:29:58,174
Mu Zhuohua,

413
00:29:58,895 --> 00:30:01,735
your footsteps betrayed you.

414
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:07,655
My Lord, I didn't mean to keep it a secret.

415
00:30:07,655 --> 00:30:08,894
My Lord.

416
00:30:08,895 --> 00:30:11,493
You-You are a kind person.

417
00:30:11,494 --> 00:30:13,174
Please forgive me.

418
00:30:13,175 --> 00:30:14,934
It won't happen again.

419
00:30:14,935 --> 00:30:16,335
Never.

420
00:30:24,975 --> 00:30:27,635
 Oh no! What is he doing? 

421
00:30:27,635 --> 00:30:29,934
 How could I have known he'd be here? 

422
00:30:29,935 --> 00:30:31,654
 I haven't made up my mind. 

423
00:30:31,654 --> 00:30:33,895
 Why did I get myself in this situation again? 

424
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:39,854
Come with me.

425
00:30:41,695 --> 00:30:43,095
What?

426
00:30:47,655 --> 00:30:49,493
 An apricot tree and a pond. 

427
00:30:49,494 --> 00:30:51,914
 My mother's parents lived here. 

428
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,875
Judging by what you said earlier,

429
00:31:04,814 --> 00:31:06,954
you live next door.

430
00:31:08,054 --> 00:31:14,655
I thought that was quite a coincidence.

431
00:31:14,655 --> 00:31:16,375
Indeed.

432
00:31:17,655 --> 00:31:20,935
You are an editor of Hanlin Academy.

433
00:31:20,935 --> 00:31:24,275
Hanlin Academy is far from Zhuque Street.

434
00:31:26,114 --> 00:31:28,535
Why did you choose to move here?

435
00:31:29,795 --> 00:31:35,494
My Lord, I moved here because the rent here is cheap.

436
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:38,314
You are a man of prestigious status.

437
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:42,314
You wouldn't know the hardship of those who have to drift around.

438
00:31:42,314 --> 00:31:46,775
That day at Fuyun Temple, I gave you 500 taels.

439
00:31:48,035 --> 00:31:50,355
You've used up all that money already?

440
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:57,274
 Oh no. Playing poor won't work. 

441
00:31:57,274 --> 00:31:59,274
 I need another idea. 

442
00:31:59,774 --> 00:32:01,274
My Lord!

443
00:32:03,774 --> 00:32:05,274
I...

444
00:32:06,415 --> 00:32:09,574
I moved here because I admire you.

445
00:32:10,935 --> 00:32:13,554
But you always ignore me.

446
00:32:13,574 --> 00:32:19,414
So I followed you here to quench this lovesickness.

447
00:32:19,935 --> 00:32:25,134
Living next door helps me close the distance between the two of us.

448
00:32:25,134 --> 00:32:28,994
I get to see you more often.

449
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,195
What is this nonsense?

450
00:32:41,534 --> 00:32:43,434
My Lord.

451
00:32:43,434 --> 00:32:48,414
On my way back to the city that day, I suddenly caught a cold.

452
00:32:49,014 --> 00:32:53,835
You were the one who took care of me so attentively.

453
00:32:54,895 --> 00:32:57,533
No one has ever been so nice to me.

454
00:32:57,534 --> 00:33:02,934
Therefore, I fell for you.

455
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:09,895
However, I am aware of my lowly background.

456
00:33:09,895 --> 00:33:11,453
I'm not worthy of you.

457
00:33:11,453 --> 00:33:17,495
So I thought I could just stay by your side in silence.

458
00:33:18,154 --> 00:33:22,754
I can recognize you simply by looking at the back of your head.

459
00:33:22,754 --> 00:33:27,434
My love for you is deep and true.

460
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,994
I am surprised.

461
00:33:32,935 --> 00:33:35,255
You're good at flirting.

462
00:33:36,254 --> 00:33:40,374
My Lord, anything is worth it if I can get your attention.

463
00:33:41,814 --> 00:33:47,355
I wouldn't have been bold enough to come here

464
00:33:47,355 --> 00:33:49,915
if you hadn't seduced me first.

465
00:33:52,474 --> 00:33:55,414
When did I ever seduce you?

466
00:33:55,414 --> 00:33:58,454
My Lord, if you didn't like me at all,

467
00:33:58,455 --> 00:34:01,535
why would you take great care of me on the way?

468
00:34:01,535 --> 00:34:05,675
Given your status, you could ask your servants to do so instead.

469
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:11,214
When a man cares so much about a woman,

470
00:34:11,214 --> 00:34:15,074
he is undoubtedly in love with her.

471
00:34:22,735 --> 00:34:23,927
One more thing.

472
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:27,088
That's the peony I won.

473
00:34:27,088 --> 00:34:30,034
You could have all the famous and glamorous flowers you want.

474
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:33,994
But this flower carries my love.

475
00:34:33,994 --> 00:34:40,715
If you didn't like me, why did you take my flower?

476
00:34:40,715 --> 00:34:43,035
You might as well say...

477
00:34:43,635 --> 00:34:46,055
the jade pendant I gave you...

478
00:34:47,154 --> 00:34:49,735
is a token of our love.

479
00:34:51,415 --> 00:34:53,115
My Lord.

480
00:34:53,115 --> 00:34:57,655
Do you admit you're in love with me?

481
00:34:58,694 --> 00:35:01,294
You claim you're in love with me.

482
00:35:01,294 --> 00:35:04,414
You didn't know which path to take.

483
00:35:04,415 --> 00:35:08,015
Do you have the answer now?

484
00:35:11,014 --> 00:35:14,415
My Lord, they're two different matters.

485
00:35:14,415 --> 00:35:16,274
They are not related.

486
00:35:25,074 --> 00:35:26,814
 He is staring straight at me. 

487
00:35:26,815 --> 00:35:29,675
 Did he see through my lie? 

488
00:35:36,415 --> 00:35:37,875
 Don't touch me! 

489
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:40,055
 I just haven't made up my mind. 

490
00:35:47,494 --> 00:35:48,994
What is this?

491
00:35:51,255 --> 00:35:52,653
My Lord.

492
00:35:52,654 --> 00:35:55,894
It's not easy for a woman to survive outside.

493
00:35:55,895 --> 00:35:58,494
I want to cover it.

494
00:35:58,494 --> 00:36:02,155
This mole brings bad luck to the husband.

495
00:36:04,415 --> 00:36:05,774
My Lord.

496
00:36:05,775 --> 00:36:09,555
Are you still mad at me?

497
00:36:10,895 --> 00:36:15,055
If I am mad at you, what will you do?

498
00:36:17,935 --> 00:36:20,653
If you're still mad at me, I'll...

499
00:36:20,654 --> 00:36:24,715
I'll figure out a way to cheer you up.

500
00:36:28,694 --> 00:36:32,275
Very well. I forgive you.

501
00:36:33,355 --> 00:36:35,775
Thank you for your kindness.

502
00:36:36,855 --> 00:36:39,494
The floor is cold. Get up.

503
00:36:39,494 --> 00:36:41,094
Yes.

504
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:47,053
I shouldn't bother you any longer.

505
00:36:47,054 --> 00:36:50,294
I'll be on my way now.

506
00:37:06,295 --> 00:37:08,735
My Lord, time for your medicine.

507
00:37:16,054 --> 00:37:17,354
My Lord,

508
00:37:17,354 --> 00:37:20,694
she must be lying when she said she loved you.

509
00:37:20,694 --> 00:37:25,133
Just days ago, she sent gifts to every household on Zhuque Street,

510
00:37:25,134 --> 00:37:26,995
especially the backstreet.

511
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,914
She visited every family.

512
00:37:30,975 --> 00:37:33,314
She is profit-oriented.

513
00:37:33,314 --> 00:37:35,393
She wouldn't be so kind without an ulterior motive.

514
00:37:35,393 --> 00:37:39,954
Given she's visited every house, she must be looking for something.

515
00:37:39,954 --> 00:37:42,654
What do you think she's looking for?

516
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:48,254
Judging by her previous whereabouts, she doesn't know the true identity of her mother.

517
00:37:48,254 --> 00:37:52,433
She also mentioned to you she wanted her mother to rest in her hometown.

518
00:37:52,433 --> 00:37:57,274
Could it be her grandfather was Fu Shengru?

519
00:37:57,295 --> 00:37:59,634
His only daughter...

520
00:37:59,654 --> 00:38:03,274
She was indeed banished as an outcast.

521
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:12,495
That matches her description of her mother's past.

522
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,294
 Had my mother not died while giving birth, 

523
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,995
 which gave the mastermind an opening, 

524
00:38:19,995 --> 00:38:23,174
 her mother wouldn't have suffered from such a cruel fate. 

525
00:38:23,174 --> 00:38:26,173
 Perhaps she could've had a better life. 

526
00:38:26,173 --> 00:38:27,653
My Lord,

527
00:38:27,654 --> 00:38:29,714
Mu Zhuohua is full of lies.

528
00:38:29,714 --> 00:38:33,613
Even if she's not related to the mastermind, she is certainly up to no good.

529
00:38:34,054 --> 00:38:37,914
Why not expose her identity and lure the villains out?

530
00:38:39,134 --> 00:38:42,814
A righteous man must act righteously.

531
00:38:42,814 --> 00:38:44,595
My apologies.

532
00:38:46,255 --> 00:38:50,714
So... should we tell her about Fu Shengru?

533
00:38:50,714 --> 00:38:54,775
It might not be wise to tell her the truth.

534
00:38:56,075 --> 00:39:01,535
After tonight, I doubt she'll act recklessly again.

535
00:39:17,614 --> 00:39:19,114
Zhijian.

536
00:39:20,094 --> 00:39:24,894
Why do you think people cherish flowers?

537
00:39:27,415 --> 00:39:30,915
Because... they are beautiful.

538
00:39:32,054 --> 00:39:33,954
Because they are full of life.

539
00:39:39,554 --> 00:39:43,495
 They always move up toward the sun. 

540
00:39:43,495 --> 00:39:48,734
 A person like myself, who has been stranded in this stagnant water, 

541
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:51,054
 yearns for this very much. 

542
00:39:54,835 --> 00:39:57,175
Here... Here...

543
00:39:58,754 --> 00:40:00,254
Young Lady.

544
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:03,755
This might sting a little.

545
00:40:05,014 --> 00:40:08,314
By the way, you broke into Lord Ding's house.

546
00:40:08,335 --> 00:40:10,415
Wasn't he mad?

547
00:40:11,255 --> 00:40:13,173
He wasn't mad at me.

548
00:40:13,174 --> 00:40:17,474
But I think he never believed the story I made up.

549
00:40:17,474 --> 00:40:19,615
What story did you make up?

550
00:40:20,735 --> 00:40:23,915
I told him I was in love with him.

551
00:40:24,694 --> 00:40:27,093
Young Lady, you flirted with Lord Ding!

552
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:28,653
I wasn't flirting.

553
00:40:28,654 --> 00:40:30,335
I was trying to save my neck.

554
00:40:30,335 --> 00:40:35,854
What if he thought I was spying with ill intent and had me executed?

555
00:40:35,855 --> 00:40:37,814
Please, you're scaring me.

556
00:40:37,815 --> 00:40:38,653
It's all right.

557
00:40:38,654 --> 00:40:41,073
Therefore, I put my wits to good use.

558
00:40:41,073 --> 00:40:45,874
I told him I loved him, so he couldn't do anything to me.

559
00:40:45,874 --> 00:40:47,354
Good to hear that.

560
00:40:49,415 --> 00:40:53,214
By the way, did the Third Madam live...

561
00:40:55,014 --> 00:40:59,774
Juli, for us to survive, we must keep that secret to ourselves.

562
00:40:59,775 --> 00:41:03,454
Lord Ding wouldn't want me to be caught up in this plot.

563
00:41:03,455 --> 00:41:05,055
Keep that in mind.

564
00:41:05,055 --> 00:41:09,435
Yes. I insisted that I loved him. That's the deal.

565
00:41:10,494 --> 00:41:14,014
Young Lady, I need to apply the ointment here too.

566
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:19,073
Juli, I need an outfit that can cover this mark.

567
00:41:19,073 --> 00:41:21,974
I have a gathering with my colleagues tomorrow.

568
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:36,990
