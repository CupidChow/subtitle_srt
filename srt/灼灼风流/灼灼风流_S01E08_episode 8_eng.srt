1
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:25,160


2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,459
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:35,080
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:47,879
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,060
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:58,259
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,380
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,480
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,579
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:18,639
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

12
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:24,000
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,239
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:36,719
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:39,020
   

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,960
   

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,940
   

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
   

19
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,790
By the way, back then, Xue Xiaotang passed away unexpectedly

20
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,790
and you insisted on being in mourning for him.

21
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:59,190
Now that the five-year mourning is up soon, what's your plan?

22
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:07,670
Father, I suddenly remember that tomorrow is the Floral Poetry Gathering.

23
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,190
I need to go back and prepare.

24
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,050
All right.

25
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,010
You may go.

26
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,230
That was captivating.

27
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,611
Help yourselves to the food. I feel honored to be able

28
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:58,390
to witness their graceful dance performance.

29
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,170
- Then drink more! 
 - Here. Let me pour you some more.

30
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,011
- Come and enjoy the drinks.  
 - Drink up, Juli.

31
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:04,930
- Drink up. You must drink. 
 - Here.

32
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,630
- Congratulations! 
 - Cheers!

33
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,030
- Thank you. Thank you very much. 
 - Congratulations.

34
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,290
Thank you very much.

35
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,030
Listen.

36
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:21,990
It's all thanks to you that the value of my courtyard is rising.

37
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,990
I can't take credit for that.

38
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,770
Look at Madam Lu. She must be quite drunk.

39
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,710
- Look how she's spilling her thoughts. 
 - Come on, drink more.

40
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,070
- It's such a joyful day. 
 - Cheers.

41
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,150
 Mother, I've passed the metropolitan examination. 

42
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,490
 Are you seeing this? 

43
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,530
 I am one step closer to my dream. 

44
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,810
Young Lady, someone's here.

45
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,610
All right.

46
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,070
- You are... 
 - Are you Miss Mu?

47
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,610
Yes, I am.

48
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,970
I'm Man'er. I serve Her Highness, Princess Roujia.

49
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,650
Miss Mu, Her Highness is hosting a Floral Poetry Gathering

50
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,330
at the imperial garden tomorrow.

51
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,190
She heard you've brought honor to women

52
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,490
by ranking seventeenth in the metropolitan examination.

53
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,070
She sent me here to extend an invitation to you.

54
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,130
Accept it.

55
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,990
Thank you, miss.

56
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,590
- It's from Princess Roujia! 
 - An invitation from Princess Roujia!

57
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,290
Let's read what it says.

58
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,911
Young Lady. 
    

59
00:04:59,911 --> 00:05:05,390
Young Lady, do you think your poem is up to par?

60
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,910
I...

61
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,290
You're right about that. My poem is...

62
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:25,110
My Lord, we obtained new clues on the Revival Powder.

63
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,930
Fu Shengru, the former head of the Imperial Academy of Medicine,

64
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,970
had developed a new medicine.

65
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,450
According to the records of the Imperial Dispensary,

66
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,830
he used a significant amount of Immortal Fruits.

67
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,010
Was Fu Shengru

68
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,990
the imperial physician whose property was confiscated

69
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,030
after my mother's tragic death during childbirth?

70
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,730
That's right.

71
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,050
He joined the Imperial Academy of Medicine in the 25th year of the Yuanguang reign.

72
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,490
In the third year of the Tongtai reign, he was promoted to the academy's head.

73
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,110
He later committed suicide because his treatment of Consort Yun was lacking.

74
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,091
After his death, his family's property was also ransacked.

75
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:01,810
Why weren't the other involved imperial physicians' properties confiscated?

76
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,090
Perhaps, because he was the head,

77
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,950
he had to take the primary responsibility.

78
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,330
Your reasoning makes sense.

79
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:16,950
However, I think there's more to this matter.

80
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,910
My Lord, are you suspecting

81
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,330
that the mastermind behind this took advantage

82
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,630
of the late emperor's fury over Consort Yun's death

83
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,530
to hide some unspeakable secrets

84
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,390
and also destroy crucial evidence?

85
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,190
My Lord, Mu Zhuohua's background appears to be genuine.

86
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:45,590
There was nothing suspicious during our trip to Tiantong Mountain.

87
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,990
Could it be that she has no connection with the mastermind?

88
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,830
Do you actually hope she's connected to the mastermind?

89
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,530
Well, I...

90
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:00,890
I only want to find the mastermind quickly.

91
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:04,590
If she's an enemy, we can gather clues from her.

92
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,230
She may not be directly involved in this.

93
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,270
But she has helped me clear up quite a bit of confusion

94
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,170
and unravel the situation for me.

95
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,590
You're not really considering having her work for you, are you?

96
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,990
I'm in a position where dangers are everywhere.

97
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,670
And she's afraid of death.

98
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,210
So forget it.

99
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:34,390
Inform He Xin to hasten and personally go to Jiangnan.

100
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,780
   

101
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,390
Brother Jinghong.

102
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,390
Brother Sun.

103
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,390
Brother Jinghong, you're finally here.

104
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,810
I'm Fang Zhiyuan.

105
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,730
I ranked tenth in this year's national examination.

106
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,250
Brother Shen, you ranked first in all subjects and won first place.

107
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,150
I'm truly impressed.

108
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,790
You're flattering me, Brother Fang.

109
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,250
Brother Jinghong, let's sit over here.

110
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,010
I heard a group of matchmakers were chasing you that day.

111
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:42,230
I wonder if you've picked any matchmakers.

112
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,110
Please stop joking about this.

113
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,610
How can I consider getting married when I haven't achieved success?

114
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,990
You achieved top scores in two consecutive imperial exams.

115
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,370
How can you call that not a success?

116
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,750
I will not consider marriage if I'm not a first-ranked official.

117
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,190
Oh, of course, your ambitions are still sky-high.

118
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,330
It makes us feel truly ashamed.

119
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,330
Stop joking about Brother Shen already.

120
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,370
Brother Jinghong, just ignore them. Let's drink.

121
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,230
 Everyone, enjoy your drinks. 

122
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,390
He's nothing but an opportunist.

123
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,430
Sun Yunqian's father is the Minister of Works, Sun Ru.

124
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:27,030
By the way, have any of you seen the other peculiar person on the list?

125
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,430
Are you referring to Mu Zhuohua who ranked seventeenth?

126
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,390
Exactly.

127
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:35,250
This is the highest ranking for a female participant in the examination.

128
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,870
I remember Mu Zhuohua.

129
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,310
She excelled in the Classics subject just like Brother Shen.

130
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,210
The Classics? But there were only two perfect papers in the Classics.

131
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,910
Rote memorization is enough for the Classics.

132
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:50,730
True talents are shown in poetry and political discourse.

133
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,110
Her poetry is average,

134
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,270
and her political discourse was slightly above average.

135
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,310
There were one hundred candidates this year.

136
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:02,430
Out of the one hundred candidates, ninety-nine of them advocated war.

137
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,990
They all answered, "Eradicate enemies on the border."

138
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,590
But there's one paper that scored as the second-highest tier

139
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,950
that advocated peace and answered, "Nurture enemies on the border."

140
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,450
Advocating peace? With Northern Liang?

141
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,090
Northern Liang invades our Southern Chen borders.

142
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,350
Their treacherous intentions never cease.

143
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,230
How can we submit to such humiliating negotiations?

144
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,930
How can such a paper score the second-highest tier?

145
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:21,990
Don't you all agree?

146
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,790
Can someone like this truly care about our country's future?

147
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,410
 "Nurture enemies on the border"? 

148
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,610
 I can't believe she actually wrote this as her answer. 

149
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,110
 That's how narrow-minded an ordinary woman is. 

150
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,210
 Brother Jinghong, what do you think? 

151
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:48,450
 I think Miss Mu's essay is very interesting and insightful, too. 

152
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,770
 Brother Jinghong, why would you say that? 

153
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:55,510
 Only those who fear death would write such a strategy. 

154
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,490
 A true man should stand upright. 

155
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,550
 Advocating peace doesn't mean fear of death. 

156
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:05,210
 Appeasing others without resorting to warfare is the wisest course. 

157
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,030
 Those Northern Liang people... 

158
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:11,370
 are resolute and willing to die rather than to submit. 

159
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:19,150
For a woman, fear of losing her life is common.

160
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,810
It's not surprising she advocates peace.

161
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,430
Women are born delicate and vulnerable.

162
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,270
This world of politics and warfare has no place for them, to begin with.

163
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,610
Mu Zhuohua is probably too afraid to come today.

164
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,690
With her poetic talent, attending would likely be an embarrassment.

165
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,710
A woman mingling with men, now that is truly inappropriate. 
    

166
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,550
It will also compromise her virtue as a woman.

167
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,130
 - You're right. 
 - That's right. 

168
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,510
 What ill fortune. 

169
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,450
 Why worry about ill fortune when you're not marrying her? 

170
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,970
I heard Oriental magpies singing joyfully early this morning.

171
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,410
I knew it was a sign of good news.

172
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,590
Indeed, I could already hear people talking about me from afar.

173
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:05,630
I, Mu Zhuohua, am honored to meet my peers.

174
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,130
Miss Mu.

175
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:19,170
Brother Shen, congratulations on securing the top rank.

176
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,690
In the Wenzheng Parlor, I had the privilege of witnessing your remarkable elegance.

177
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,450
Truly talented and remarkable, unaffected by gossip,

178
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,350
and not conforming to mediocrity.

179
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,590
Truly admirable.

180
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,310
Miss Mu, you're flattering me.

181
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,770
Ignorant woman.

182
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,610
Who are you calling mediocre?

183
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,130
She's on the list by pure luck.

184
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:44,110
Yet, she dares to boast in front of us.

185
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,510
I...

186
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,950
Do you think she'll lose to them?

187
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:56,850
Excuse me. I was only complimenting Brother Shen.

188
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,790
How is that boasting?

189
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,810
I accept being called a woman.

190
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,490
But I'm puzzled about being called ignorant.

191
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:09,490
I studied hard and sat for the examination with my ability.

192
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:13,790
After being evaluated by the esteemed examiners, I managed to pass the examination.

193
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,210
How can that be labeled as ignorance?

194
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:19,890
Oh, I get it now.

195
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:26,530
If you put it this way, it seems I'm not a "master of both literary and martial arts."

196
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,830
You...

197
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,270
Well said.

198
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:36,050
   

199
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,110
   

200
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,430
 - Greetings, Your Highness. 
 - Greetings, Your Highness. 

201
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,190
You may drop the formalities.

202
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,010
I'm not talented.

203
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:20,630
It's all thanks to your presence that I'm able to host the Floral Poetry Gathering.

204
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,930
 Your Highness, you possess both virtue and talent. 

205
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:26,530
 You're a model for women everywhere. 

206
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,490
Do you know me that well?

207
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:38,170
All you did was hear some things about me

208
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:42,110
and concluded that I am virtuous and talented.

209
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:49,430
But when it comes to Miss Mu, you assumed she lacked talent and virtue

210
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:54,430
when you heard that she was a woman with a humble background.

211
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,930
 - Forgive us, Your Highness. 
 - Forgive us, Your Highness. 

212
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,890
What is the level of your knowledge...

213
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,930
compared to the examiners?

214
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,610
 - We are inferior. 
 - We are inferior. 

215
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,090
Since you're aware of that,

216
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,750
why do you question the examiners' judgment?

217
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,650
In terms of talent, I'm not comparable to all of you.

218
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,830
To avoid facing public criticism and gossip,

219
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:29,590
I can step down from being the host.

220
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,130
You can consider me here to enjoy the flowers.

221
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,190
The rest of you may carry on as you wish.

222
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,990
Your Highness, please calm down.

223
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,790
The fault lies with me today.

224
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,090
Indeed.

225
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,870
As the master scholar,

226
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,290
you lead everyone.

227
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,230
If you were impartial and set an example,

228
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:08,650
they wouldn't act improperly and unjustly criticize a young lady.

229
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,630
Your Highness's advice is wise.

230
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:19,250
We read countless books but cannot compare to Your Highness's experiences.

231
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,670
We studied the words of sages.

232
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,910
Yet, we failed to comprehend their meanings.

233
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,230
I'm fortunate to have learned from Your Highness.

234
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,630
Your words hit me like a wake-up call.

235
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:35,070
What Mu Zhuohua said earlier was true.

236
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:40,010
Your disrespect towards her not only questions her talent

237
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:44,510
but also challenges the examiners' integrity and the court's fairness.

238
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,110
This Floral Poetry Gathering is widely watched.

239
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,010
Do you really think I'm the only one here today?

240
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,450
If this matter gets out,

241
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:59,430
what will become of your reputation and future?

242
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,310
Chen'er, don't forget.

243
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,450
We're just here to watch.

244
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,290
Sister is biased toward that female candidate.

245
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,410
I can't sit by and do nothing anymore.

246
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,770
The court is capable of tolerating when being questioned.

247
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,250
Besides, Mu Zhuohua's ranking is indeed debatable.

248
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,310
We're in luck.

249
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,670
First Prince and Lord Ding are speaking up for us.

250
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,690
First Prince isn't siding with us.

251
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,970
He's clearly unhappy about Princess criticizing Shen Jinghong.

252
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:39,190
 - Greetings, Your Highness. 
 - Greetings, Lord Ding. 

253
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,490
Since the rankings have already been announced, how can you say they're debatable?

254
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:47,470
Her essay has poor intent and is full of nonsense.

255
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,850
Greetings, Uncle.

256
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,570
 - Greetings, Lord Ding. 
 - Greetings, Lord Ding. 

257
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,810
 This is my answer. 

258
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:24,190
 Isn't this the small fry at Wenzheng Parlor that Uncle was interested in? 

259
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:27,070
 Uncle seems to have a special interest in her. 

260
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:33,930
Oh, it's just during the grading, a few examiners had some differences.

261
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,210
Isn't that right, Uncle?

262
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,590
You end what you started.

263
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,530
Don't drag me into this.

264
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,730
Today is the Floral Poetry Gathering.

265
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,910
You're all here to compose and recite poems.

266
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:53,850
Don't let our presence get in your fun.

267
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:57,870
If it weren't for your bias, I wouldn't have come.

268
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,630
Who is biased?

269
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,210
They haven't even read her essay.

270
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:06,410
Yet, they criticize her gender and background.

271
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:10,050
Do you think this is fair, Your Highness?

272
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,790
These people are biased.

273
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,990
But Shen Jinghong didn't judge.

274
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,070
Why did you scold him so harshly?

275
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:19,010
As the top scorer, he should set an example.

276
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:22,450
If he can't set an example, then he's not worthy of being first.

277
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:28,650
Since he's in a high position, it's natural to have higher expectations.

278
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,590
You always have reasons for everything.

279
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,990
Uncle, what do you think?

280
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:38,510
Human nature is naturally biased.

281
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,550
To see past someone's appearance and identity...

282
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,190
is indeed difficult.

283
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,870
Uncle's words make sense.

284
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,530
Previous Floral Poetry Gatherings were about flowers.

285
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,670
Everyone composed poems individually and was judged by the people.

286
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:58,550
Then, some would ingratiate themselves with influential people.

287
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:01,830
This also lacks fairness in judgment.

288
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,470
Today's event might be better if we follow the examination format.

289
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,170
Everyone anonymously writes poems.

290
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,490
One person will read them and let everyone judge.

291
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,990
What do you think?

292
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:14,130
Who's hosting this, you or me?

293
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,230
You, of course.

294
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:20,470
So, did you set these new rules just for entertainment?

295
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:25,510
Since Uncle and I are here, we'll naturally participate.

296
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:30,110
I'm just curious about what rewards you prepared.

297
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,690
Do what you want.

298
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,130
I'm hosting the Floral Poetry Gathering.

299
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,530
Of course, I've prepared some rewards.

300
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,490
Everyone, please take your seats.

301
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:56,800
   

302
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,640
   

303
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,610
My Lord.

304
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,570
When one overachieves, one will invite trouble.

305
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,610
Keep a low profile.

306
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,470
I shall remember Your Lordship's advice.

307
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,190
What's the matter?

308
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,790
Uncle, I'm going to prove to you that the person

309
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:06,690
I've chosen will be more exceptional than that girl.

310
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,450
I shall wait and see.

311
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,090
 With His Lordship's striking appearance, 

312
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:25,890
 it wasn't my fault to mistake him for a male prostitute back then. 

313
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:31,330
Today's poetry gathering's theme is peonies.

314
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:36,410
The reward shall be this Green Dragon Rests in the Ink Pond.

315
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:41,490
As for the other reward, it shall be the "Chronicles of Cangling."

316
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,670
 "Chronicles of Cangling"? 

317
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,070
"Chronicles of Cangling"?

318
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:51,570
 It's the final work of Mr. Cangling. 

319
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,150
 There's only one copy in this world. 

320
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,350
 I can't believe it's the reward for today. 

321
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,710
 If "Chronicles of Cangling" is the reward, 

322
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,990
 I don't mind being like a bird that dies in pursuit of food. 

323
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,170
Come here.

324
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,450
 My Lord, please forgive me. 

325
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,310
 I can't keep a low profile. 

326
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,010
Miss Mu.

327
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:31,250
His Lordship says you'll write better if you're not hungry.

328
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,930
Thank you.

329
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,890
 Just like a starving squirrel. 

330
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:16,380
   

331
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,950
 His Lordship and First Prince sure have a lot of free time. 

332
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:28,730
 Their presence has turned the poetry gathering into the complex world of government officials. 

333
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,690
 They're just making things worse. 

334
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:57,070
Time's up!

335
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,930
 I struggled to come up with these four lines. 

336
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:39,770
 I really want to win the "Chronicles of Cangling." 

337
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,650
 I must find a way. 

338
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,630
Thank you.

339
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:57,730
I'm sure you'll win first place.

340
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:01,090
There are strengths and weaknesses in everything.

341
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,430
One must remain humble to have achievements.

342
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,830
Arrogance leads to failure in most things.

343
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:09,170
Understanding others is wisdom, and knowing oneself is enlightenment.

344
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,790
Did you write that borderland poem today?

345
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:21,330
Today, I wrote about blooming Yulan magnolia flowers.

346
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:30,110
A good poem needs the right person to read it to truly appreciate its essence.

347
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,430
Then...

348
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,830
Mu Zhuohua, why don't you do it?

349
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,430
Yes, Your Highness.

350
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,190
   

351
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,590
Your Highness.

352
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:07,750
I lack poetic talent and cannot compose a good poem.

353
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:12,290
I'm here at Her Highness's command to read a poem for everyone.

354
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:15,400
   

355
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,190
Number one.

356
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:21,850
"As peonies fade, apricot blossoms bloom.

357
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:25,550
Peonies overshadow the green moss.

358
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:28,930
I resent the heartless willow trees.

359
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:33,830
Lonely mountains frequently host monkeys at night."

360
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,330
Number five.

361
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,650
"Born with golden and jade-like petals.

362
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:47,670
Partial to the old village.

363
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,510
When will we reunite?

364
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:54,330
Safe within my thoughts of longing."

365
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:55,410
This one is good.

366
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,110
I wrote it.

367
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,430
Number fifteen.

368
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:19,930
"Rosy clouds accumulate like gold,

369
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,450
a cluster of red tassels...

370
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:28,810
embellishes the landscape."

371
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:33,150
 The choice of words and sentence construction is quite straightforward and rough. 

372
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:35,790
 - Indeed. 
 - It's not good enough. 

373
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:42,030
"Facing hardships on horseback,

374
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:48,130
a clean administration brings peace."

375
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,530
Uncle.

376
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,490
It's nothing.

377
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,730
This is undoubtedly His Lordship's poem.

378
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:07,330
 This is likely the first-ever borderland peony poem in history. 

379
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,170
 Indeed. 

380
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:11,410
 This is groundbreaking, creating a new style. 

381
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,010
 Absolutely. 

382
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:21,530
Uncle, is this poem really that good?

383
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:25,030
I somehow feel it's not as good as the fifth one.

384
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,470
The one with "Born with golden and jade-like petals."

385
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,830
Number thirteen.

386
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:37,470
"Countless flowers vie for beauty,

387
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:41,370
new branches are delicate and pristine as frost."

388
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,810
Now, let's announce the voting results.

389
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,430
 Number five. 

390
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:54,070
- Miss Mu, reading the poems was quite a task. 
  - Number fifteen. 

391
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,490
 Number fifteen. 

392
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,750
 Number one. 

393
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,530
 Number three. 

394
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,230
 - Number five.  
 - Please have some tea.

395
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,710
 Number fifteen. 

396
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,310
Thank you, My Lord.

397
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,610
 Number fifteen. 

398
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,010
 Number five. 

399
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,570
 Number fifteen. 

400
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:36,790
 Did he notice that I took advantage of him? 

401
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,010
 Number fifteen. 

402
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,130
 Number fifteen. 

403
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,290
 Number fifteen. 

404
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,750
 Number fifteen. 

405
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,530
 Number one. 

406
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,310
 Number thirteen. 

407
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,110
 Number fifteen. 

408
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:09,970
We have the results.

409
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,650
The winner is the author of poem number fifteen.

410
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:18,090
So now, let's have the author of this poem step forward.

411
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,430
 It must be His Lordship's poem. 

412
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,930
 It has to be. 

413
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:23,390
 Yes, definitely His Lordship. 

414
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,550
Uncle, you won.

415
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,570
Of course, it's the outcome I desired.

416
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,110
It doesn't matter.

417
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:31,810
But you don't usually compose poems this bad, Uncle.

418
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:36,390
I wrote that poem.

419
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,590
Mu Zhuohua?

420
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,530
 How could this be? 

421
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,750
 How is that her poem? 

422
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:49,530
Truly a talented woman.

423
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,030
Congratulations.

424
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:54,470
This year's winner for Floral Poetry Gathering is you.

425
00:31:55,570 --> 00:32:00,410
The Green Dragon Ink Pool and the "Chronicles of Cangling" are yours.

426
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:03,450
Thank you, Your Highness.

427
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,790
Gosh, that's the "Chronicles of Cangling." How could it...

428
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,270
How could this poem win first place?

429
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,330
Are these people blind or foolish?

430
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:21,770
Perhaps being too clever has led them astray.

431
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,590
Don't you understand yet?

432
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:28,810
In fact, we should've never come today.

433
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:34,250
To be honest, it's truly hard to comprehend that today's winner isn't you.

434
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:37,570
Circumstances and luck play a role. Winning also depends on fate.

435
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,890
Congratulations, Miss Mu.

436
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,910
Brother Shen.

437
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:52,970
I envy you for getting hold of the unique copy of "Chronicles of Cangling".

438
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:54,690
Brother Shen, rest assured.

439
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:57,050
I will lend it to you.

440
00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:00,910
In that case, I'll thank you in advance.

441
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:04,410
Brother Shen, I...

442
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:08,330
I wonder if I am the first person who has won against you in a poetry contest.

443
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:11,711
 How come she does not know how she got first place? 

444
00:33:11,711 --> 00:33:12,850
Yes, you're the first.

445
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,710
You're a literary genius.

446
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,890
I'm truly impressed.

447
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,510
Really?

448
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:23,550
If so, it's indeed an honor.

449
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,830
Thank you, Brother Shen.

450
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,710
This poetry contest today is truly unfair.

451
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:41,030
Weren't the rules changed according to your wishes?

452
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,430
But...

453
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,950
How could Mu Zhuohua win first place with her talent and ability?

454
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,830
The people's choice.

455
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,470
We have to acknowledge it.

456
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,730
Uncle, say something.

457
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:57,730
This is a matter for you young folks.

458
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,810
What does it have to do with me?

459
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:04,450
You're so protective of Shen Jinghong.

460
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:07,950
Is it to let everyone know he's under your wing?

461
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,690
What if they do know?

462
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,790
I know your love for talent.

463
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:16,410
But Shen Jinghong is wild and unruly.

464
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:18,650
You need to be cautious.

465
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:21,730
How is Shen Jinghong wild and unruly?

466
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:25,230
Sister, you misjudge people.

467
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:29,790
But Mu Zhuohua can be considered a talented individual.

468
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:33,030
She has unique ideas and eloquent speech.

469
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:37,590
In the palace examination, she might even gain Father's favor

470
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,670
and be listed among the top scholars.

471
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:43,130
I didn't expect that you actually admire her so much.

472
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:46,250
She has some likable cunning thoughts.

473
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,390
Indeed, she's quite endearing.

474
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:52,790
Even Shen Jinghong treats her differently.

475
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:58,230
In my opinion, her admission to the Hanlin Academy is almost certain.

476
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,450
Mu Zhuohua is just being opportunistic and playing it safe.

477
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:05,270
She's also fearful of death.

478
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:09,770
But you and Uncle...

479
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:15,230
Could I really have misjudged her?

480
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,490
Never mind.

481
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,750
You can value your Shen Jinghong.

482
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,250
But you shouldn't single out Mu Zhuohua.

483
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,550
You were born noble.

484
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:32,550
But you don't understand how difficult it is for a woman like her to have such an accomplishment.

485
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,790
Your Highness.

486
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:02,610
Mu Zhuohua took the examination as a woman

487
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,730
and competed with all those men for a place.

488
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,570
It was already incredibly challenging.

489
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:11,370
Today, I took her side and criticized you harshly.

490
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,110
Please don't take it personally.

491
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,510
Your kindness and compassion are renowned.

492
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:18,090
How could I ever mind such things?

493
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:29,110
What do you think of her winning the poetry contest today?

494
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:34,310
Some strive to win by traveling far and wide.

495
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:37,770
Some strive to win through intricate plans.

496
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:40,330
Some strive to win by any means necessary.

497
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:47,690
Mu Zhuohua displayed clever tactics in this matter, which is truly admirable.

498
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:49,550
You do stand out from the norm.

499
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:53,530
Your insights are keen and clear.

500
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,730
Your Highness.

501
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,470
Someone left a painting here.

502
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:27,110
   

503
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,810
   

504
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:42,590
Have some water.

505
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:49,330
Princess Roujia sure is nice.

506
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,610
Guo Juli is also nice.

507
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:54,130
You sure are.

508
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,450
You're the closest person to me.

509
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:02,630
Young Lady, so is Lord Ding good or bad?

510
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:06,470
About Lord Ding...

511
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:09,430
I don't really know.

512
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:13,390
But I feel he doesn't trust me. Guess what?

513
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:17,210
At the poetry gathering, he poured a searing hot tea for me.

514
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:22,630
I think he was punishing me for associating his name with that lousy poem.

515
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:27,410
But he didn't expose it publicly.

516
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,550
So he's considered a decent person.

517
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,310
Look at these flowers.

518
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,610
You can show me around while at it.

519
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,590
My Lord, this courtyard has been abandoned for a long time.

520
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,390
There is dust everywhere.

521
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,810
It's all right.

522
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,390
When Fu Shengru's properties were seized,

523
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:56,070
only some worthless household items and an aged yellowed medical book were left behind.

524
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:58,350
There are also some moldy herbs in the storage room.

525
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,310
My Lord, I quickly searched through everything.

526
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,791
But I didn't find any clues related to the Revival Powder.

527
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:31,150
Nothing here either.

528
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:35,970
My Lord, how about asking Imperial Physician Zhao to come and take a look?

529
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:39,110
Bring him here after cleaning this place.

530
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:43,110
I want to inspect Fu Shengru's belongings one by one.

531
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,570
- Yes, My Lord. 
 - Yes, My Lord.

532
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:02,290
 In the war at Juma River, thirty thousand people died in vain. 

533
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:12,770
 The world fears me and narrow-minded people resent me 

534
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:15,710
 because they believe I have disloyal intentions. 

535
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:18,490
 I've always had a clear conscience. 

536
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:25,130
 But I never expected even those close to me would suspect me. 

537
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:30,010
 For this, they're even willing to undermine the country's foundation and sacrifice so many lives. 

538
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,370
Is it true...

539
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:42,010
that there's no familial bond within the royal family?

540
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:45,050
Familial bond?

541
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,750
The Merciful One can see clearly.

542
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:53,530
I gave all my affection to my own flesh and blood.

543
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,910
Why should I give any to others?

544
00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:00,130
When I was young, I was willing to share my affection as well.

545
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:02,570
But what did that bring me?

546
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:09,510
Your Highness, the investigator has returned from Yanzhou.

547
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:14,190
I think there is nothing suspicious about Mu Zhuohua's background.

548
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:21,330
   

549
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:22,810
She is from Yanzhou.

550
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:25,630
She's related to the Mu family in Huaizhou.

551
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:30,710
Her family is pretty wealthy, which gives her the chance to study and take exams.

552
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:37,770
If she really has nothing to do with the past events,

553
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:42,530
why did Liu Yan take her to Tiantong Mountain?

554
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:47,470
I heard she has an attractive face.

555
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:54,430
It looks like Lord Ding is not immune to feelings and desires, after all.

556
00:41:55,670 --> 00:42:00,690
A young girl like her probably can't cause much trouble.

557
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:05,710
But just to be safe, keep an eye on her.

558
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:20,070


559
00:42:22,734 --> 00:42:30,094
♫  I can't forget the love that is still is nipping at my ears and temples  ♫

560
00:42:30,094 --> 00:42:37,394
♫  Memories keep slamming into rocks and have nowhere to berth  ♫

561
00:42:37,394 --> 00:42:44,834
♫  Both sides gaze at each other in the drizzling rain, but one has turned into clouds and mist  ♫

562
00:42:44,834 --> 00:42:53,354
♫  Leaving the isolated heart's island, like waves without a shore  ♫

563
00:42:53,354 --> 00:42:57,094
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

564
00:42:57,094 --> 00:43:00,754
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

565
00:43:00,754 --> 00:43:04,774
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

566
00:43:04,774 --> 00:43:08,154
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

567
00:43:08,154 --> 00:43:11,674
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

568
00:43:11,674 --> 00:43:15,394
♫  Obviously willing to swear life and death 
 to be entangled for a lifetime  ♫

569
00:43:15,394 --> 00:43:19,694
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

570
00:43:19,694 --> 00:43:25,694
♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

571
00:43:39,094 --> 00:43:46,494
♫  I can't forget the turmoil of love and hate, 
 even if the next day is far away  ♫

572
00:43:46,494 --> 00:43:55,254
♫  Two souls embrace in chaos, how can it be written off?  ♫

573
00:43:55,254 --> 00:43:58,834
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

574
00:43:58,834 --> 00:44:02,474
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

575
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:06,454
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

576
00:44:06,454 --> 00:44:09,894
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

577
00:44:09,894 --> 00:44:13,594
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

578
00:44:13,594 --> 00:44:17,274
♫  Obviously can't be erased, and haunted by lingering dreams  ♫

579
00:44:17,274 --> 00:44:21,254
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

580
00:44:21,254 --> 00:44:28,734
♫  Want to have one more glimpse of you, 
 even just for a second more  ♫
