1
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:25,260


2
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,459
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:35,080
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:47,879
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,060
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:58,359
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:03,480
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,580
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,679
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,739
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

12
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:24,100
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,239
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:36,919
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,020
   

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,060
   

17
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,935
   

18
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:47,910
   

19
00:01:54,235 --> 00:01:56,754
Young Lady, are you sure this will work?

20
00:01:56,754 --> 00:01:58,454
It will.

21
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:03,154
All right.

22
00:02:13,474 --> 00:02:15,114
Greetings, Young Master.

23
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:18,795
Wait.

24
00:02:19,354 --> 00:02:22,155
Please get Miss Yun and me some tea.

25
00:02:29,995 --> 00:02:31,855
Young Master, please have a seat.

26
00:02:31,855 --> 00:02:33,574
You can drop the formalities.

27
00:03:04,674 --> 00:03:09,794
This tea smells like the tender buds of Banta.

28
00:03:09,794 --> 00:03:12,995
I'm surprised you know this tea from the remote countryside.

29
00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:15,795
It's my second time drinking this tea.

30
00:03:17,995 --> 00:03:22,634
I still remember back when my close friend had a birthday feast.

31
00:03:22,634 --> 00:03:24,735
He poured tea for me

32
00:03:24,735 --> 00:03:29,774
and said all he wanted in this life was to have his wife and daughter by his side

33
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:32,015
and achievements to his name.

34
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:36,354
This friend seems to hold great importance to you.

35
00:03:39,674 --> 00:03:43,694
I thought I'd never get to drink this tea again in my life.

36
00:03:45,574 --> 00:03:51,574
Miss, are you not curious about my friend's name?

37
00:03:52,354 --> 00:03:55,295
May I know what his name is?

38
00:03:57,074 --> 00:03:59,254
His last name is Yuan.

39
00:04:04,754 --> 00:04:08,995
Young Lady, I'll go to the kitchen and check on those dishes.

40
00:04:18,994 --> 00:04:22,794
Miss Yuan, I hope you're well.

41
00:04:23,674 --> 00:04:25,855
Since you came for me,

42
00:04:26,674 --> 00:04:29,154
there's no need to involve others.

43
00:04:48,395 --> 00:04:49,974
Lord Ding.

44
00:04:51,434 --> 00:04:55,515
Your tactics are clever.

45
00:04:55,515 --> 00:05:01,375
But hiding out like this isn't a good long-term strategy.

46
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:05,874
As long as I can survive, that's the best strategy.

47
00:05:09,615 --> 00:05:14,295
The thirty thousand soldiers from five years ago also wanted to survive.

48
00:05:15,395 --> 00:05:18,155
What happened five years ago has nothing to do with me.

49
00:05:18,955 --> 00:05:23,615
I'm just a courtesan, less than a dog.

50
00:05:24,794 --> 00:05:26,695
Why won't you leave me alone?

51
00:05:26,695 --> 00:05:28,515
It's not that I won't.

52
00:05:28,515 --> 00:05:30,455
But I can't.

53
00:05:32,474 --> 00:05:35,295
Someone else is responsible for this.

54
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:37,795
Lord Ding, you've got the wrong person.

55
00:05:38,874 --> 00:05:41,175
Even ants strive to live.

56
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,934
If you want to survive,

57
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:46,355
of course, it's fine.

58
00:05:48,095 --> 00:05:50,235
I don't think I'm the only one...

59
00:05:51,234 --> 00:05:53,734
who's desperately trying to survive here.

60
00:05:55,694 --> 00:05:57,395
   
 Take His Lordship and go! 

61
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,100
   

62
00:06:03,535 --> 00:06:07,235
 My Lord, you must stay alive. 

63
00:06:12,134 --> 00:06:14,134
You're right.

64
00:06:14,134 --> 00:06:19,255
Isn't it laughable for someone of your high status to accuse me like this?

65
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:22,454
Whether it's funny or desperate,

66
00:06:23,155 --> 00:06:26,954
I will make sure to seek the justice that's due.

67
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:33,614
If Yuan Chengming was wronged, I will seek justice for him.

68
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:36,955
And your mother, Ms. Zhao.

69
00:06:37,515 --> 00:06:39,735
I will find her for you as well.

70
00:06:43,515 --> 00:06:45,015
All right.

71
00:06:46,554 --> 00:06:48,154
I'll tell you.

72
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:53,574
My father was loyal and brave

73
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:56,494
He would never betray his country.

74
00:06:57,114 --> 00:07:00,215
Someone used my mother and my life to threaten him.

75
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:10,895
My Lord!

76
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:24,675
Help me.

77
00:07:25,354 --> 00:07:26,735
Help me.

78
00:07:26,735 --> 00:07:28,834
I don't want to die.

79
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:30,655
I don't want to...

80
00:07:36,715 --> 00:07:38,215
Yun Xiangyue.

81
00:07:44,574 --> 00:07:46,274
 She was poisoned. 

82
00:07:48,254 --> 00:07:49,754
My Lord.

83
00:07:50,874 --> 00:07:52,874
You should leave first.

84
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:55,614
Guard Yun Xiangyue's body...

85
00:07:56,554 --> 00:07:58,855
and don't touch her blood.

86
00:07:58,855 --> 00:08:00,355
Yes, My Lord.

87
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,775
I... I am a physician. Please don't kill me!

88
00:08:58,775 --> 00:09:01,494
I'm a physician who can treat you.

89
00:09:02,995 --> 00:09:04,495
Please don't kill me.

90
00:09:34,515 --> 00:09:36,475
His qi and blood are surging.

91
00:09:37,554 --> 00:09:39,914
Seems like he's under the effect of an aphrodisiac.

92
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:42,175
Many meridians are congested,

93
00:09:42,794 --> 00:09:45,915
like old ailments.

94
00:09:48,175 --> 00:09:51,075
Xiaoqin Pleasure House's madam sure is inhumane.

95
00:09:51,075 --> 00:09:53,514
Despite your old age and weak vitality,

96
00:09:53,514 --> 00:09:56,514
she even made you take an aphrodisiac to serve your guests.

97
00:10:02,794 --> 00:10:04,814
Sniff this first.

98
00:10:04,814 --> 00:10:09,155
It can relieve the heat in your body and help you fall asleep.

99
00:10:17,035 --> 00:10:20,695
This pill can generate body fluids, reduce heat, nourish Yin, and replenish qi.

100
00:10:20,695 --> 00:10:22,214
It targets your symptoms.

101
00:10:22,214 --> 00:10:23,735
Eat it.

102
00:10:29,235 --> 00:10:32,295
It's your life. Forget it if you don't want it.

103
00:10:50,314 --> 00:10:53,914
Consider yourself lucky to run into someone as kind as me.

104
00:10:57,674 --> 00:10:59,275
Look at this. Look.

105
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:00,775
Look.

106
00:11:04,194 --> 00:11:05,475
Stop being suspicious.

107
00:11:05,475 --> 00:11:06,954
Can you trust me now?

108
00:11:06,954 --> 00:11:09,194
Here. Eat it.

109
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:14,795
Remove your inner clothing. I'll give you acupuncture.

110
00:11:22,035 --> 00:11:24,075
Why aren't you undressing?

111
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:35,075
Your customers can see your body, but not a physician?

112
00:11:35,075 --> 00:11:37,515
Treat me as a customer, then.

113
00:11:42,395 --> 00:11:45,054
Come on, I'll perform acupuncture.

114
00:11:57,074 --> 00:11:58,855
 Undergarment? 

115
00:12:09,135 --> 00:12:11,535
I...

116
00:12:11,535 --> 00:12:15,735
You... Please bear with it a bit and try not to move.

117
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,954
I'll be gentle.

118
00:12:22,194 --> 00:12:23,995
It might hurt a bit.

119
00:12:23,995 --> 00:12:26,194
Bear with it a little.

120
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,535
Did that hurt you?

121
00:12:37,554 --> 00:12:39,035
I'll be gentler. I'll be gentler.

122
00:12:39,035 --> 00:12:40,035
I'll be gentler.

123
00:12:54,755 --> 00:12:58,855
We can remove the needles after one hour.

124
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,815
 He Xin, Captain of the Falcon Squad] 

125
00:13:24,815 --> 00:13:27,414
Guard her. I'll go and find His Lordship.

126
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:42,935
If you follow this prescription and take it for half a month, it will show improvement.

127
00:13:42,935 --> 00:13:48,114
Do your old injuries cause your joints to ache when it rains or snows?

128
00:13:48,115 --> 00:13:51,455
You must always make sure to keep yourself warm.

129
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,515
The needle marks might hurt a bit.

130
00:13:57,515 --> 00:13:59,615
But it'll be fine by tomorrow.

131
00:14:09,554 --> 00:14:14,215
If you have health issues, you can find me at Flower Alley.

132
00:14:14,215 --> 00:14:16,675
Miss Song Yun knows where I live.

133
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,375
My Lord.

134
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,454
Forgive me for coming late.

135
00:14:37,454 --> 00:14:42,535
I had no idea I looked like a male prostitute.

136
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:46,655
Did the person who just left say that?

137
00:14:46,655 --> 00:14:48,055
I'll go and kill her.

138
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,455
Come back.

139
00:14:53,155 --> 00:14:58,294
My Lord, the assassins killed themselves with poison.

140
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:02,674
Suicide warriors.

141
00:15:03,395 --> 00:15:05,314
We've been searching for Yuan Chengming for so many years.

142
00:15:05,314 --> 00:15:07,354
We finally obtained some clues.

143
00:15:07,354 --> 00:15:10,855
But the clues directed us to the suicide warriors' ambush.

144
00:15:11,395 --> 00:15:14,274
This strange thing is when Your Lordship left, they didn't pursue you.

145
00:15:14,274 --> 00:15:17,115
Instead, they were focused on taking Yun Xiangyue's body.

146
00:15:17,115 --> 00:15:19,855
It wasn't the assassins who wanted to kill me,

147
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:23,254
but the poison on Yun Xiangyue's body.

148
00:15:33,714 --> 00:15:36,614
You didn't allow us to touch Yun Xiangyue's body.

149
00:15:36,614 --> 00:15:40,235
Could the poison on her body be transmitted through blood?

150
00:15:40,235 --> 00:15:44,315
Could finding out how she was poisoned lead us to new clues?

151
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:49,914
Never mind that.

152
00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:51,515
Let's return to the residence for now.

153
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:53,355
What about Yun Xiangyue's body?

154
00:15:55,314 --> 00:15:56,814
Leave it.

155
00:15:58,275 --> 00:16:03,315
Tell the Capital Governor to investigate those who have visited Xiaoqin Pleasure House.

156
00:16:04,015 --> 00:16:06,975
It's easier for him to investigate it compared to us.

157
00:16:06,975 --> 00:16:12,935
Also, search Yun Xiangyue's room to see if there are any clues.

158
00:16:12,935 --> 00:16:14,354
Yes, My Lord.

159
00:16:16,395 --> 00:16:19,635
That female physician saved my life just now.

160
00:16:20,475 --> 00:16:23,014
She came in a timely manner.

161
00:16:23,794 --> 00:16:28,794
We need to investigate if she's really a physician or part of the plot.

162
00:16:29,314 --> 00:16:32,575
Zhimo, I'm assigning this task to you.

163
00:16:49,714 --> 00:16:52,974
Juli, how did you fall asleep standing here?

164
00:16:53,434 --> 00:16:55,834
Young Lady, you're finally back.

165
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:58,014
Have you been standing here the whole time?

166
00:16:58,014 --> 00:17:00,495
Didn't you tell me to stand still here?

167
00:17:00,495 --> 00:17:02,735
Silly girl, you can move now. Come on, let's go.

168
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:04,474
- That's great. 
 - Come on.

169
00:17:04,474 --> 00:17:05,915
I was standing here without moving.

170
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:07,834
- You can move now. 
 - I couldn't even find you.

171
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:10,215
- Everything's fine now. 
 - I was so worried.

172
00:17:10,215 --> 00:17:12,135
Sit down.

173
00:17:12,135 --> 00:17:16,575
I want to show you something nice.

174
00:17:18,435 --> 00:17:20,696
- What is this? 
 - It's a silver ingot.

175
00:17:21,214 --> 00:17:23,834
Young Lady, you got money when you went out.

176
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,134
- We have money now. 
 - We have money.

177
00:17:27,275 --> 00:17:30,774
Young Lady, why do you still have this mole?

178
00:17:31,755 --> 00:17:33,575
I forgot to wipe it off just now.

179
00:17:33,575 --> 00:17:36,175
This won't do. I'll go and get some water for you to wipe it off.

180
00:17:36,175 --> 00:17:38,734
What if this unlucky mole affects me?

181
00:17:38,734 --> 00:17:40,774
It's a mole that brings ill fate to the husband.

182
00:17:40,774 --> 00:17:42,374
Are you my husband?

183
00:17:42,374 --> 00:17:44,015
Silly girl.

184
00:17:44,554 --> 00:17:46,594
I'll go get some water for you to wash up, then.

185
00:17:46,594 --> 00:17:48,835
- It must be tiring for you.  
 - Be careful.

186
00:17:50,915 --> 00:17:53,235
- Don't run. 
 - Okay.

187
00:18:08,435 --> 00:18:10,734
 It was such a restless night. 

188
00:18:18,074 --> 00:18:20,874
My Lord, put on a cloak.

189
00:18:20,874 --> 00:18:22,455
Don't catch a cold.

190
00:18:24,475 --> 00:18:26,814
How's the situation in Zhuozhou?

191
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,335
He Xin has led the Falcon Squad to Tiantong Mountain.

192
00:18:29,335 --> 00:18:31,334
We should receive news soon.

193
00:18:33,035 --> 00:18:34,735
There is another thing.

194
00:18:35,874 --> 00:18:40,495
Fifteen minutes ago, Yun Xiangyue's maid suddenly spat blood and died.

195
00:18:41,195 --> 00:18:43,995
Her symptoms indicate poisoning.

196
00:18:46,235 --> 00:18:48,054
They sure are ruthless.

197
00:18:48,675 --> 00:18:50,714
They did not even spare her.

198
00:19:35,314 --> 00:19:38,254
 This stone is not heavy at all. 

199
00:20:11,494 --> 00:20:13,294
 All right. 

200
00:20:14,915 --> 00:20:16,815
 My pastry is ready. 

201
00:20:45,354 --> 00:20:47,054
 Are you hurt? 

202
00:20:49,074 --> 00:20:52,235
I was not attracted to your looks. I was trying to save you.

203
00:20:52,235 --> 00:20:54,755
I... I was saving you.

204
00:20:55,874 --> 00:20:57,674
Is it time for breakfast?

205
00:21:01,515 --> 00:21:04,354
Juli, someone's knocking on the door. Go get the door.

206
00:21:04,354 --> 00:21:06,054
Coming!

207
00:21:09,275 --> 00:21:10,875
Coming.

208
00:21:13,294 --> 00:21:14,675
You are...?

209
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:16,834
Is Mu Zhuohua staying here?

210
00:21:18,755 --> 00:21:22,154
Sir, I... I am Mu Zhuohua.

211
00:21:22,154 --> 00:21:24,154
All right, come with us.

212
00:21:25,794 --> 00:21:27,194
Get out of the way.

213
00:21:27,675 --> 00:21:29,035
Why are you arresting her for no reason?

214
00:21:29,035 --> 00:21:31,355
We didn't do anything wrong.

215
00:21:31,355 --> 00:21:33,634
Last night, there was a murder at Xiaoqin Pleasure House.

216
00:21:33,634 --> 00:21:36,475
Everyone who was there needs to be questioned.

217
00:21:37,354 --> 00:21:39,515
It's all right. Don't worry.

218
00:21:39,515 --> 00:21:41,834
I'm just going to cooperate with the investigation,

219
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,435
and I'll come back after answering some questions.

220
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:47,114
Young Lady, you must be careful by yourself.

221
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:50,755
Official investigations are fair and impartial.

222
00:21:50,755 --> 00:21:51,955
Am I right?

223
00:21:51,955 --> 00:21:53,394
I'll be back very soon.

224
00:21:53,394 --> 00:21:54,994
Don't worry.

225
00:21:58,335 --> 00:22:00,074
   

226
00:22:00,074 --> 00:22:03,834
The poison has been suppressed.

227
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:05,815
You are fine now.

228
00:22:05,815 --> 00:22:07,615
Thank you, Imperial Physician Zhao.

229
00:22:08,554 --> 00:22:10,655
I slept well last night.

230
00:22:12,894 --> 00:22:17,294
I wonder if it's because of this sachet.

231
00:22:22,915 --> 00:22:27,214
Besides the usual sandalwood, this sachet

232
00:22:27,214 --> 00:22:31,414
also contains cloves, acorus gramineus, and borneol.

233
00:22:31,414 --> 00:22:37,035
It not only soothes the mind but also helps with sleep.

234
00:22:37,035 --> 00:22:41,174
My Lord, you can use it without worries.

235
00:22:41,174 --> 00:22:42,554
All right.

236
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,410
   

237
00:22:49,755 --> 00:22:51,435
    
 You're also a provincial graduate, huh?

238
00:22:51,435 --> 00:22:52,874
Yes, sir.

239
00:22:52,874 --> 00:22:55,294
You're a scholar, huh?

240
00:22:55,294 --> 00:22:58,834
As a lady, why are you at Xiaoqin Pleasure House at that hour?

241
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:02,834
Sir, I was there for a medical visit.

242
00:23:02,834 --> 00:23:06,175
Miss Song Yun from Xiaoqin Pleasure House can testify.

243
00:23:06,175 --> 00:23:10,134
After you tell me what happened that day and if there's nothing suspicious,

244
00:23:10,134 --> 00:23:12,875
I will naturally not make things difficult for you.

245
00:23:13,834 --> 00:23:19,395
Around 7:00 last night, Miss Song Yun of Xiaoqin Pleasure House came to me for help.

246
00:23:19,395 --> 00:23:22,195
So I packed my medical box and went with her.

247
00:23:22,195 --> 00:23:27,574
It takes about a quarter of an hour to walk from where I stay to Xiaoqin Pleasure House.

248
00:23:28,515 --> 00:23:30,035
    
 Well, did you know

249
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:32,435
    
 Miss Yun Xiangyue, who you had treated,

250
00:23:32,435 --> 00:23:34,534
died from poison last night?

251
00:23:38,035 --> 00:23:39,535
Miss Yun...

252
00:23:41,314 --> 00:23:43,454
She's dead?

253
00:23:45,035 --> 00:23:46,594
The timing is quite coincidental.

254
00:23:46,594 --> 00:23:49,274
Did you poison her during this opportune moment?

255
00:23:51,915 --> 00:23:54,394
 They choose a top courtesan every year. 

256
00:23:54,394 --> 00:23:58,054
 - But your health... 
 - Yes, they choose a top courtesan every year. 

257
00:23:58,054 --> 00:24:00,975
 But the chance to be the top courtesan for the month... 

258
00:24:01,715 --> 00:24:03,334
 comes only once. 

259
00:24:03,934 --> 00:24:06,574
Ms. Mu, are you the killer?

260
00:24:07,894 --> 00:24:09,015
Sir, please investigate this wisely.

261
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:11,715
I traveled far from home to sit for the imperial examination.

262
00:24:11,715 --> 00:24:13,955
It's also my first time in the capital.

263
00:24:13,955 --> 00:24:17,074
And I only met Miss Yun yesterday.

264
00:24:17,074 --> 00:24:20,214
We have no grudges or conflicts. I have no reason to harm her.

265
00:24:21,475 --> 00:24:27,095
Then, did you see anyone suspicious or hear anything suspicious?

266
00:24:38,214 --> 00:24:42,215
I wouldn't dare to pry in a place like that.

267
00:24:42,235 --> 00:24:46,854
If it weren't to treat someone, I wouldn't go to such a place.

268
00:24:52,035 --> 00:24:57,735
Imperial Physician Zhao, please take a look at the prescription I have here.

269
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,374
Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

270
00:25:05,374 --> 00:25:08,435
This physician is bold in the use of medicine.

271
00:25:08,435 --> 00:25:10,875
The dosage is absolutely precise.

272
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:12,354
A little less would be ineffective.

273
00:25:12,354 --> 00:25:14,854
A little more would be harmful to health.

274
00:25:14,854 --> 00:25:20,474
My Lord, you've encountered an incredible healer.

275
00:25:21,475 --> 00:25:23,855
Just by pure coincidence.

276
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:27,634
I shall take my leave, then.

277
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:41,274
It looks like this prescription uses the Imperial Academy of Medicine's method back then.

278
00:25:41,755 --> 00:25:47,234
You mean the decapitated incompetent physicians

279
00:25:47,234 --> 00:25:49,534
who failed to save your mother?

280
00:25:51,275 --> 00:25:57,075
Chen, you tend to be extreme in your judgments.

281
00:25:58,114 --> 00:26:01,615
A healer should be bold yet careful.

282
00:26:01,615 --> 00:26:04,254
If one is overly cautious

283
00:26:04,254 --> 00:26:08,355
and uses only mild remedies, it works for minor illnesses.

284
00:26:08,355 --> 00:26:11,835
But what about serious illness?

285
00:26:13,635 --> 00:26:17,700
   

286
00:26:19,095 --> 00:26:20,595
Young Lady.

287
00:26:20,595 --> 00:26:21,955
Young Lady, I was worried sick.

288
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,694
- Are you all right? 
 - I'm fine.

289
00:26:23,694 --> 00:26:25,694
I was worried they might punish you severely.

290
00:26:25,694 --> 00:26:26,534
No, they won't.

291
00:26:26,534 --> 00:26:29,534
I'm at least a scholar who doesn't kneel before officials easily.

292
00:26:29,534 --> 00:26:31,675
They won't resort to torture easily.

293
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:35,154
They just called me in to ask some questions. So don't worry.

294
00:26:35,154 --> 00:26:36,780
I'm glad to hear that.

295
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,050
   

296
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,210
   

297
00:26:51,354 --> 00:26:52,854
Young Lady.

298
00:26:53,275 --> 00:26:55,394
Young Lady, here.

299
00:26:55,394 --> 00:26:57,634
Eat something to get rid of bad luck.

300
00:26:57,634 --> 00:27:00,035
The capital's pork trotter noodles are particularly delicious.

301
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,435
They taste different from the Huaizhou flavor.

302
00:27:01,435 --> 00:27:03,315
Come and try them.

303
00:27:05,955 --> 00:27:07,654
What's wrong, Young Lady?

304
00:27:07,654 --> 00:27:10,755
You haven't been yourself since leaving the government office today.

305
00:27:12,314 --> 00:27:18,475
I was just thinking about how Yun Xiangyue must have fought hard to survive

306
00:27:18,475 --> 00:27:21,415
even at the brothel.

307
00:27:21,415 --> 00:27:23,254
But in the end,

308
00:27:25,154 --> 00:27:27,294
she didn't even get a chance to plead for herself.

309
00:27:27,294 --> 00:27:30,634
Young Lady, did you really see her?

310
00:27:36,214 --> 00:27:37,914
She had a tough life.

311
00:27:38,654 --> 00:27:42,314
Young Lady, do you know who killed the top courtesan?

312
00:27:43,114 --> 00:27:44,614
Listen.

313
00:27:58,285 --> 00:28:00,154
   

314
00:28:00,154 --> 00:28:03,895
Juli, what was your question just now?

315
00:28:04,454 --> 00:28:08,234
Young Lady, can you tell me who killed the top courtesan?

316
00:28:08,234 --> 00:28:10,235
Come closer to me.

317
00:28:13,675 --> 00:28:15,195
You must never tell anyone about this.

318
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:27,190
   

319
00:28:50,675 --> 00:28:53,674
Juli, get some rest.

320
00:28:53,674 --> 00:28:55,855
No, I must protect you.

321
00:28:55,855 --> 00:28:58,114
What if something happens?

322
00:29:11,874 --> 00:29:15,034
Miss Mu, please come with me. You have a patient waiting for you.

323
00:29:15,034 --> 00:29:16,195
Who are you?

324
00:29:16,195 --> 00:29:18,534
Why should she go with you?

325
00:29:18,534 --> 00:29:21,194
Juli, I think it's going to be all right this time.

326
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:24,094
I'm ready. We can go now.

327
00:29:24,094 --> 00:29:25,335
No, Young Lady.

328
00:29:25,335 --> 00:29:26,454
Take me with you.

329
00:29:26,454 --> 00:29:28,054
I'll protect you. I'm very strong.

330
00:29:28,054 --> 00:29:29,874
You'll be safer with me around.

331
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,600
Okay, you must listen to me, then. Follow me.

332
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,300
Okay, I'll follow you.

333
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:38,515
Don't you want to know where you're going?

334
00:29:39,454 --> 00:29:43,435
I'll go anywhere as long as a patient is waiting for me.

335
00:29:43,435 --> 00:29:45,874
Don't you want to know who that patient is?

336
00:29:45,874 --> 00:29:47,974
I don't discriminate against my patients.

337
00:29:49,475 --> 00:29:51,555
Aren't you afraid it's a trap?

338
00:29:52,235 --> 00:29:54,454
I'm penniless and unarmed.

339
00:29:54,454 --> 00:29:57,290
If you had any ill intentions, you would have acted already.

340
00:30:04,794 --> 00:30:07,574
Don't you have anything to ask me?

341
00:30:08,955 --> 00:30:13,054
Even if I do, you wouldn't tell me.

342
00:30:13,834 --> 00:30:14,874
Let's go.

343
00:30:14,874 --> 00:30:16,374
He's so fierce.

344
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:22,085
   

345
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:33,734
Juli, wait for me here.

346
00:30:43,154 --> 00:30:46,214
My Lord, please spare me.

347
00:30:46,214 --> 00:30:49,054
When did you find out about my identity?

348
00:30:50,035 --> 00:30:55,035
Your Lordship, I found out last night.

349
00:30:57,214 --> 00:31:00,154
What gave my identity away?

350
00:31:06,235 --> 00:31:08,035
Well, Your Lordship.

351
00:31:08,554 --> 00:31:12,754
First of all, it was the calluses on your hands.

352
00:31:12,755 --> 00:31:16,235
They're on the purlicues and palms,

353
00:31:16,235 --> 00:31:21,275
and these marks are left by years of using weapons like spears, blades, and bows.

354
00:31:21,275 --> 00:31:24,335
Your Lordship's finger joints are strong.

355
00:31:24,335 --> 00:31:29,314
Though the calluses are still there, they've clearly thinned.

356
00:31:29,314 --> 00:31:32,135
This shows exceptional martial skills in the past.

357
00:31:32,135 --> 00:31:34,415
But it's been a while since they were practiced.

358
00:31:35,314 --> 00:31:40,114
Secondly, there's a grim scar on Your Lordship's back.

359
00:31:40,114 --> 00:31:43,334
It indicates a deep wound.

360
00:31:43,874 --> 00:31:48,534
But it has healed remarkably well, leaving only a faint mark.

361
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:51,275
Such effects are rarely achieved without extraordinary medicine.

362
00:31:51,275 --> 00:31:54,094
To use such good medicine,

363
00:31:54,094 --> 00:31:56,454
one must have a high status.

364
00:31:57,515 --> 00:32:02,915
Thirdly, the clothes Your Lordship wore didn't fit.

365
00:32:02,915 --> 00:32:05,554
They were obviously not yours.

366
00:32:05,554 --> 00:32:09,055
And the attire that truly belongs to you

367
00:32:09,055 --> 00:32:11,515
is...

368
00:32:11,515 --> 00:32:14,475
- It's... 
 - It's what?

369
00:32:15,354 --> 00:32:17,254
Undergarment.

370
00:32:32,074 --> 00:32:33,874
Keep talking.

371
00:32:35,035 --> 00:32:39,354
The fabric used for your undergarment is a tribute.

372
00:32:40,254 --> 00:32:42,435
It's produced by a Jiangnan silk workshop.

373
00:32:42,435 --> 00:32:44,735
Only a few can afford such material.

374
00:32:44,735 --> 00:32:48,914
And the fragrance on you is the priceless agarwood scent.

375
00:32:48,914 --> 00:32:52,274
It's a rare treasure from the Southern Dynasties that can soothe and relieve pain.

376
00:32:52,274 --> 00:32:55,575
Taking all of these four points into account,

377
00:32:55,575 --> 00:32:57,714
there's only one person in the entire world...

378
00:32:58,594 --> 00:33:00,974
who matches these descriptions.

379
00:33:00,974 --> 00:33:02,695
In that case,

380
00:33:03,995 --> 00:33:06,635
you recognized me long ago.

381
00:33:07,634 --> 00:33:11,575
Yet, you deliberately put on an act before me.

382
00:33:18,554 --> 00:33:22,794
A commoner like me fears death and wants to escape trouble.

383
00:33:22,794 --> 00:33:26,475
It seems Your Lordship is kind-hearted.

384
00:33:26,475 --> 00:33:30,475
You wouldn't execute a kind-hearted physician.

385
00:33:33,935 --> 00:33:37,995
Did you say a kind physician who fears death?

386
00:33:37,995 --> 00:33:44,054
Why didn't you add eloquence and audacious behavior?

387
00:33:46,435 --> 00:33:49,594
Since you acted as if you didn't recognize me,

388
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:53,674
why did you deliberately hide the truth

389
00:33:53,674 --> 00:33:58,275
of seeing me in the woodshed when the Capital Governor was questioning you?

390
00:33:58,275 --> 00:34:01,634
I presumed your men were observing secretly

391
00:34:01,634 --> 00:34:05,035
when the Capital Governor was questioning me.

392
00:34:05,035 --> 00:34:08,554
If I had told the truth aboutencountering an injured man that day,

393
00:34:08,554 --> 00:34:11,575
first of all, Xiaoqin Pleasure House wouldn't be able to find out who that was.

394
00:34:11,575 --> 00:34:13,315
I wouldn't be able to explain it.

395
00:34:13,315 --> 00:34:19,835
Secondly, your men might have killed me from the shadows

396
00:34:19,835 --> 00:34:21,634
before I could finish my sentence.

397
00:34:21,634 --> 00:34:25,835
And since I didn't say anything, your men would probably know

398
00:34:25,835 --> 00:34:28,055
that I had already recognized Your Lordship.

399
00:34:28,055 --> 00:34:29,674
At the same time,

400
00:34:30,594 --> 00:34:32,895
it would attract deadly consequences.

401
00:34:32,895 --> 00:34:38,074
So after you returned, you pretended to tell your maidservant...

402
00:34:39,435 --> 00:34:41,375
that you knew who the murderer was.

403
00:34:42,154 --> 00:34:43,754
Yes.

404
00:34:43,754 --> 00:34:48,595
To find out the murderer's identity, your men wouldn't kill me on the spot.

405
00:34:48,595 --> 00:34:51,354
Once I get to meet Your Lordship,

406
00:34:51,354 --> 00:34:55,595
I'd have a glimmer of hope.

407
00:34:55,595 --> 00:35:00,134
Why do you think your life will be spared after meeting me?

408
00:35:03,374 --> 00:35:05,675
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

409
00:35:05,675 --> 00:35:11,814
Although my life is of little value, I still wanted to take a chance.

410
00:35:17,435 --> 00:35:20,794
Since you're so clever, why not guess...

411
00:35:21,674 --> 00:35:23,975
whether you can leave this place alive today?

412
00:35:25,194 --> 00:35:27,355
Your Lordship didn't kill me yesterday.

413
00:35:27,355 --> 00:35:30,995
So I know you're a compassionate person.

414
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:35,214
I... I'm an honest person.

415
00:35:35,214 --> 00:35:39,154
I go to Xiaoqin Pleasure House just to make a living.

416
00:35:39,154 --> 00:35:41,114
You were stationed at the border for many years.

417
00:35:41,114 --> 00:35:42,754
You know the hardships of the common people.

418
00:35:42,754 --> 00:35:45,315
I'm sure you'll understand my plight.

419
00:35:49,234 --> 00:35:52,554
You might be able to deceive the Capital Governor.

420
00:35:52,554 --> 00:35:55,794
But you can't fool me that easily.

421
00:35:55,794 --> 00:35:59,295
Every word I say is true. I have no intention to deceive you.

422
00:36:04,035 --> 00:36:10,254
I can tell from your complexion that you seem a bit better than yesterday.

423
00:36:10,274 --> 00:36:14,395
Perhaps the medicine I gave you did work.

424
00:36:16,554 --> 00:36:21,374
If you don't mind, I'm willing to work hard to serve you.

425
00:36:21,995 --> 00:36:23,635
Work hard to serve me?

426
00:36:25,835 --> 00:36:30,735
Do you know once you're associated with me...

427
00:36:38,274 --> 00:36:40,414
My Lord. My Lord.

428
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:49,635
My Lord, pressing the acupoint in your chest area can temporarily relieve your cough and chest pain.

429
00:37:01,355 --> 00:37:03,775
Combining it with the acupoint between your thumb and forefinger

430
00:37:03,775 --> 00:37:06,874
can temporarily alleviate your current discomfort.

431
00:37:18,114 --> 00:37:20,374
You're indeed a compassionate physician...

432
00:37:22,154 --> 00:37:24,414
who doesn't care about worldly norms.

433
00:37:25,835 --> 00:37:29,855
If I cared about worldly norms in the woodshed yesterday,

434
00:37:29,855 --> 00:37:34,755
I'm afraid you wouldn't have the energy to interrogate me.

435
00:37:50,815 --> 00:37:53,014
 The legend says Lord Ding is as wise as a fox, 

436
00:37:53,014 --> 00:37:56,335
 proud and aloof as a wolf, and steadfast as a tiger. 

437
00:37:56,335 --> 00:37:58,835
 I didn't expect him to be so dashing. 

438
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,435
What were you thinking about?

439
00:38:13,435 --> 00:38:14,835
I...

440
00:38:15,475 --> 00:38:17,635
I wasn't thinking about anything.

441
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,534
Don't try to do anything funny in front of me.

442
00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:24,454
Or you'll lose your head.

443
00:38:27,655 --> 00:38:31,435
I was just thinking that...

444
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:34,675
you're good-looking.

445
00:38:36,515 --> 00:38:39,595
Forgive me for being ignorant.

446
00:38:39,595 --> 00:38:41,735
What a smooth-talker.

447
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:44,635
You have an honest appearance.

448
00:38:44,635 --> 00:38:46,354
But you're pretty cunning.

449
00:38:48,795 --> 00:38:50,955
That's because you don't know me.

450
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:56,554
You'll know soon enough that I'm an honest person both inside and out.

451
00:38:56,554 --> 00:38:59,154
I may be cunning.

452
00:38:59,154 --> 00:39:02,395
But I have a pretty good heart.

453
00:39:06,035 --> 00:39:07,735
Come with me.

454
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:23,990


455
00:39:25,731 --> 00:39:33,191
♫  I can't forget the love that is still is nipping at my ears and temples  ♫

456
