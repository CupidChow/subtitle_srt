 Subtitles and Timing brought to you by the ❦Team of A Dazzling Love❀ @viki.com 

2
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,459
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:35,080
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:47,879
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,159
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,180
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:03,479
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,579
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,479
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:18,539
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

12
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:24,000
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,139
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:36,918
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,019
   

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,959
   

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,939
   

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,980
   

19
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:53,339
You thought that, at worst, you would lose your life for it.

20
00:01:53,339 --> 00:01:55,440
Yet, by doing so,

21
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:01,379
Zhimo will lose the only family he has.

22
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:03,919
But I have been waiting for this moment.

23
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,380
I didn't know who my enemy was.

24
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:12,500
But now, I have a target.

25
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,640
I don't want to waste this opportunity.

26
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,560
Official Mu,

27
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,700
do you know how this feels?

28
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,200
You're willing to die for it,

29
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,940
but Zhimo will not let you risk your life like this.

30
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,679
If you do this, you're hurting Zhimo.

31
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:36,779
For His Lordship,

32
00:02:36,779 --> 00:02:41,880
Zhimo and you are more important than vengeance.

33
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,280
Zhijian, to die is easy.

34
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:53,399
To live, especially to live meaningfully,

35
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:56,180
that's a challenge.

36
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,179
Can't you see?

37
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:09,779
 Our parents are dead anyway. 

38
00:03:09,779 --> 00:03:11,659
 Why celebrate birthdays? 

39
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:13,799
 Because it's important. 

40
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:39,239
 If I'm gone one day, 

41
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,099
 you need to celebrate your birthday, too. 

42
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,860
Get some rest.

43
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,980
I'll take care of him.

44
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,159
It wasn't until you were injured

45
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:15,660
that I found out a human could bleed this much.

46
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,199
But...

47
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:22,540
But I'm your elder brother.

48
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,480
I'm supposed to protect you.

49
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,159
Enough, Your Lordship.

50
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,039
He learned his lesson.

51
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:44,220
Stop making him kneel.

52
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,600
If not, he will have bad knees forever.

53
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:55,240
Retain your lesson.

54
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:58,899
Do not repeat the same mistake.

55
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:02,039
Yes, My Lord.

56
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,860
Get up.

57
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:13,720
Zhimo's condition has stabilized,

58
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,439
though he still needs some time to heal.

59
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,180
Your Highness.

60
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,719
I heard that you were attacked.

61
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,780
Were you hurt?

62
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,040
I am fine. The assassin did not hurt me.

63
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,919
I'm relieved, then.

64
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:50,860
But who is that malicious assailant?

65
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,878
My guards fought him.

66
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,940
Judging from his technique,

67
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,919
he must be Zhijian.

68
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,620
Lord Ding's subordinate?

69
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,300
Does this mean that Lord Ding is suspecting you?

70
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:10,179
So? He has no evidence.

71
00:06:10,179 --> 00:06:12,660
Making speculations is all he can do.

72
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:23,999
 In this life, I made one mistake after another. 

73
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,820
 There is no turning back. 

74
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:33,199
 Only in death can I atone for my sins. 

75
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,960
Since Lord Ding already suspects me,

76
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:01,140
we should strike first instead of playing passively.

77
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,920
We can catch them by surprise.

78
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:07,440
My uncle holds Chen'er dearly.

79
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,220
And Chen'er respects him a lot.

80
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,420
They are very close.

81
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:21,379
And that bond of steel sticks out like a sore thumb.

82
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:27,540
But it's not easy to drive a wedge between them.

83
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,059
No worries.

84
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,459
Only thin water can flow for a long time.

85
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:37,600
When the opportunity presents itself, sow the seed of doubt.

86
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,999
It will grow and fester.

87
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,639
She died so soon.

88
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,060
She should have suffered more.

89
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:11,320
Grandmother went to a temple to get this for me

90
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,679
on my 18th birthday.

91
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:20,139
She said that it would protect me from harm.

92
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:22,879
She told me to carry it always.

93
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,580
But rebellious as I was,

94
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:29,700
I never wore it.

95
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,900
Now that Father and Grandmother left me,

96
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,800
I learned...

97
00:08:37,579 --> 00:08:43,619
the true pain of regret.

98
00:08:45,979 --> 00:08:48,199
My condolences, Your Majesty.

99
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:52,800
You still have your nation and the Dowager Empress.

100
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,360
Please take care of yourself.

101
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:05,740
Princess Roujia, you should take care of yourself, too.

102
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,900
Before the Grand Dowager Empress passed away,

103
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,220
she cared most about you.

104
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:16,139
Thank you for your concern, Uncle.

105
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:21,639
I'm sure she thought about you, too.

106
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,139
After Father passed away,

107
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:36,940
Grandaunt made the trip here immediately.

108
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,840
I guess she must be close by.

109
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,100
But before she could arrive,

110
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,619
Grandmother had already gone.

111
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:52,919
Knowing her age,

112
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,699
Grandaunt will be heartbroken.

113
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:04,499
First, it was Ju'er.

114
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:07,380
Now, it's my sister.

115
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,359
You are a filial son.

116
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,099
I can imagine your grief.

117
00:10:13,099 --> 00:10:17,600
Fortunately, you're here with me, Grandaunt.

118
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,679
You're a grown-up now.

119
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:30,018
Grandaunt, I'll accompany you to pay respect to Father and Grandmother later.

120
00:10:30,018 --> 00:10:31,318
Okay.

121
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:35,940
Grandaunt, you remind me of the Evil-erasing Sword.

122
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:41,439
Well, when I was little, I was afraid of it.

123
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:45,240
The sword that Grandfather used in his battle.

124
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:51,419
For years, you kept it hidden from the public's eyes.

125
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,900
A bloody blade is ill-suited for public display.

126
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,420
Indeed.

127
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,100
The appearance of the Evil-erasing Sword

128
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,600
can only mean that Southern Chen is at war.

129
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:11,780
May it never reappear.

130
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,535
   

131
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:28,840
Your mind is wandering, Your Highness.

132
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:35,079
I made a wrong move.

133
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:38,400
Alas, I cannot take it back.

134
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,380
All right.

135
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,599
I surrender.

136
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,699
The Border Defender Princess has returned to the capital.

137
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,380
I heard she carries the Evil-erasing Sword with her.

138
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,519
That blade was left behind by Grandfather.

139
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:09,900
It is a symbol of his presence.

140
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:14,660
Even Father had to show it some respect.

141
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:18,720
If I can get that blade...

142
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:25,620
Grandaunt adores me.

143
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,720
It is not impossible to get it from her.

144
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,740
However, Lord Ding is here.

145
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,839
He might try to impede our plan.

146
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:44,860
It is time to sow the seed of doubt.

147
00:12:47,885 --> 00:12:48,799
   

148
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,299
His Lordship wishes to return to his fiefdom?

149
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:51,539
No way.

150
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:52,559
Why not?

151
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:55,080
It's widely spread now.

152
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,459
His Majesty barely claimed the throne.

153
00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:00,119
He can't possibly keep the high-achieving Lord Ding by his side.

154
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:02,279
I feel bad for Lord Ding.

155
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,060
He is being sidelined.

156
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,260
I'm returning to my fiefdom.

157
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,920
Are you not worried?

158
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,020
We can write to each other.

159
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,119
You're heartless.

160
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,620
Your Lordship.

161
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,159
A message from the Falcon Squad.

162
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:47,360
The rumors are being circulated by merchants and poor and humbled scholars.

163
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:55,359
A concise and persuasive article.

164
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:57,840
Not bad.

165
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,838
It was most probably written by Shen Jinghong.

166
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:10,040
Besides, I once saw him imitate someone's handwriting.

167
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:18,999
In that case, he quite likely forged the testamentary edict then.

168
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,279
Your Lordship, he is really working for Princess Roujia.

169
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:30,559
Everything is expected.

170
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:36,678
Princess Roujia is regarded as the Holy Maiden.

171
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:41,598
And among the poor and humble scholars, Shen Jinghong is profoundly respected.

172
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,480
They make a formidable duo.

173
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:54,279
Roujia made a brilliant move by using Shen Jinghong.

174
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,200
Your Lordship, they are trying to force you away from the capital.

175
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,940
Noted.

176
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:21,859
Your Majesty, there have been rumors circulating about.

177
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:31,199
They say Lord Ding is ready to usurp your position.

178
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,639
Usurp my position?

179
00:15:42,685 --> 00:15:45,885
   

180
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:50,419
All princes are to manage their fiefdoms upon coming of age

181
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:52,819
unless summoned by the emperor.

182
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:59,078
Yet Lord Ding has stayed in the capital for a decade now.

183
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:00,798
He has never visited his fiefdom.

184
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,540
I'm afraid this is inappropriate.

185
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,779
I agree with Official Sun.

186
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:14,118
The late emperor was benevolent enough to allow Lord Ding to stay in the capital.

187
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,798
But we now have a new emperor.

188
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,399
Some might think that Lord Ding's powerful position

189
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,378
might influence policy-making.

190
00:16:23,378 --> 00:16:29,399
He should recuse himself and return to his fiefdom.

191
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:44,599
I have heard about the rumors concerning Lord Ding.

192
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:49,220
They say he might usurp my position.

193
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:55,899
They are the same words repeated to my father when he was alive.

194
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,499
It's been a decade now.

195
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,780
Are you not tired of it?

196
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,351
But I am.

197
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,619
Now, focus on your duty and stop speculating.

198
00:17:10,139 --> 00:17:12,440
I am not blind.

199
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,640
During Father's reign,

200
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,500
Lord Ding fought in dangerous battles

201
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,419
and emerged victorious.

202
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:26,220
I acceded to the throne recently.

203
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:32,659
And despite his ill health, Lord Ding returned to politics to help me.

204
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:38,500
What could a ruler possibly want more than a faithful minister like him?

205
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:52,359
"By His Majesty's decree, Lord Ding will be appointed as the Prince Regent.

206
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,718
He will be given a seat in the imperial court

207
00:17:54,719 --> 00:17:56,799
and is allowed to carry his sword to the court.

208
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,759
Thus concludes this decree."

209
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,160
You have my gratitude, Your Majesty.

210
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,959
Grandaunt resides in Jiangzuo.

211
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:35,019
How does she fare in the capital?

212
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:37,119
She adapts to the environment very well.

213
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,039
However, many socialites would love to visit her.

214
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,739
She has no love for such occasions,

215
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:46,559
so she feigns sickness to turn them away.

216
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,160
I see.

217
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:52,239
That reassures me.

218
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:56,080
I should congratulate you, Uncle.

219
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,500
I was forced to assume the office.

220
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,739
Uncle, you don't sound too happy.

221
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,479
Perhaps it's a blessing in disguise.

222
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:26,019
Roujia,

223
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:34,520
I remember that before your father became the emperor, you were his only child.

224
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,600
Back then, he often brought you with him to visit me.

225
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,479
One time, you fell on the ground.

226
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:48,960
To cheer you up, he pushed you on the swing for the entire afternoon.

227
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:55,099
But shortly after, I was sent away from the capital.

228
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:00,280
In the following ten years, Father never came to see me.

229
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:04,999
When I returned,

230
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:08,420
I had three other brothers.

231
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:14,400
You know very well what happened then.

232
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,760
Your father had no choice.

233
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,899
He wanted to protect you.

234
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,699
I know Father did all this for my own good.

235
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:34,300
You have always been his favorite child.

236
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,999
Before he passed away,

237
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:41,619
he dreamed of a peaceful nation and a harmonious family.

238
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:48,259
But Yu'er made a mistake and hurt Father's feelings.

239
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:54,500
Yet he learned from his mistake.

240
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,899
And now, he enjoys his life in his fiefdom as a free and wealthy nobleman.

241
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:04,060
His Majesty has a generous soul.

242
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,100
I'm sure my father would be happy to see this.

243
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,540
I can only wish...

244
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,079
that it would remain this way.

245
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,820
If I may ask, Uncle,

246
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,740
why don't you return to your fiefdom?

247
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:34,200
Sorry for my forwardness.

248
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,160
Pardon me.

249
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,719
I will return.

250
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,679
Now is not the right time.

251
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:01,399
   

252
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,900
Official Shen,

253
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:05,179
do you remember?

254
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:13,960
The weather was as good as today

255
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,879
when we first came to the Department of State Affairs.

256
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,479
You have a good memory, Official Mu.

257
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:20,260
It is, indeed.

258
00:22:23,479 --> 00:22:25,340
I don't have a good memory.

259
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,739
It's just that I remember why I came here.

260
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,659
After this long journey, do you still remember...

261
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:37,640
why you wish to serve the people?

262
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,519
Of course.

263
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:44,440
I wish to see a prosperous nation and a peaceful society.

264
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:49,239
And at the moment,

265
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:51,180
do you still harbor the same wish?

266
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:55,099
My heart has never changed.

267
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:06,319
I pray in the future that you'll remember what you said today.

268
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:11,360
What do you mean, Official Mu?

269
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,140
Despite the unrest outside,

270
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,060
we have this short moment of respite.

271
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,020
We should cherish it.

272
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,059
Plain, uneventful days are the best, aren't they?

273
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:04,739
Just like the time we spent in the hut.

274
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:10,200
When we woke up, we saw plants.

275
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,339
Everything was simple.

276
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:18,818
We drank the morning dew and feasted upon the leaves of chrysanthemums.

277
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,580
You reminisce about the old days.

278
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,200
Why? Do you want to give your career up now?

279
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:35,239
Those peaceful days make me realize how heavy my duty is.

280
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:38,359
But I won't give up.

281
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:41,599
On the contrary, I will do what I can

282
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:49,099
to give the people of Southern Chen the peace they deserve.

283
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,160
Isn't that your wish, too?

284
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:13,159
Who would have thought that the ones supporting Zhuang Wenfeng were the Suns?

285
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:17,460
The Suns have a long history in Jiangnan.

286
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,758
This explains why Zhuang Wenfeng went unpunished for years

287
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,820
despite the atrocities he committed.

288
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,599
I thought we would have several days of respite,

289
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,279
but God has denied me of this luxury.

290
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,759
It has nothing to do with God.

291
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:42,939
It's human greed.

292
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,160
God's will could not be defied,

293
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,779
but human greed should not be allowed to run rampant.

294
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:53,459
Yes.

295
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:57,919
And we will make an example of him.

296
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:01,985
   

297
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,639
Sun Ru,

298
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,399
what can you still explain?

299
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,079
Is it as what Lord Ding claimed here

300
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:15,759
that you embezzled the relief fund when a disaster struck Jiangnan?

301
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,498
Your Majesty! I am innocent.

302
00:27:19,498 --> 00:27:21,919
I do not know Zhuang Wenfeng at all.

303
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,519
I don't know why my name appeared in his letters.

304
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:31,038
I'm afraid my loyalty attracted some political enemies,

305
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,079
and they colluded with Zhuang Wenfeng to frame me.

306
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:39,500
I would confront Zhuang Wenfeng if he wasn't dead!

307
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,278
Prince Regent, you only answer to His Majesty, all right.

308
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,599
But that doesn't mean you can frame an innocent soul

309
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,540
with these letters.

310
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,799
Official Sun, you do make a point.

311
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:01,419
Several letters aren't enough to prove you are guilty.

312
00:28:01,419 --> 00:28:02,900
Besides...

313
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:09,540
Your Majesty, I also think that Official Sun is innocent.

314
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:15,979
Your Majesty.

315
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:21,939
Prince Regent, you wanted to persecute Official Sun.

316
00:28:21,939 --> 00:28:24,678
Now, you say that he was framed.

317
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:27,799
This court is not a place for jests,

318
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,758
so please explain everything at once.

319
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:35,199
Otherwise, you did more than just lie to His Majesty's face.

320
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:43,360
Official Zhou, Zhuang Wenfeng was the one framing Official Sun.

321
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,079
I merely presented the evidence I found to His Majesty.

322
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:51,699
The Sun family is one of the most noble families in Southern Chen.

323
00:28:51,699 --> 00:28:53,800
They are ministers for generations,

324
00:28:54,920 --> 00:29:00,460
so they lead a wealthy life.

325
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:04,918
Why would they collude with a lowly county magistrate like Zhuang Wenfeng

326
00:29:04,918 --> 00:29:10,379
and commit embezzlement?

327
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,660
Your Majesty.

328
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:25,640
I disagree with the Prince Regent.

329
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:33,099
Official Shen, do you have any opinion?

330
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,319
Zhuang Wenfeng is dead.

331
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:42,179
We can't possibly interrogate the truth out of him.

332
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:48,120
However, since this discovery concerns Official Sun,

333
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:52,598
even if he isn't the culprit, he must have something to do with this mystery.

334
00:29:52,598 --> 00:29:56,200
I suggest that we get to the bottom of the case.

335
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,060
Your Majesty.

336
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,960
Zhuang Wenfeng is dead, so is the clue.

337
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:10,319
For the proper functioning of the court, we can hold off on the investigation

338
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,620
until the dust settles.

339
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:18,000
How many corrupted county magistrates are there in our nation?

340
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,819
Do you know that, Official Wang?

341
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,559
If we do not get to the bottom of this,

342
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,920
how many more will continue to line the pocket of the main culprit?

343
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:33,840
Should we only conduct an investigation whenever another Zhuang Wenfeng dies?

344
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:37,820
Who should the exploited citizens turn to?

345
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:41,339
- I... 
 - Or are you saying that a family's reputation is more important

346
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,079
than the people's welfare?

347
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:46,900
These are fabricated accusations!

348
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,319
Your Majesty, he twisted my words.

349
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,820
Your Majesty,

350
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:56,580
I believe the root of this problem is the Protected Appointments System.

351
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:01,219
Eliminating it enables all scholars to begin their careers on an equal footing.

352
00:31:01,219 --> 00:31:02,639
Everyone will be equal.

353
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,640
No one will enjoy a background advantage.

354
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,760
This is an important decision.

355
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,780
We can discuss it in the future.

356
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,859
Let's call it a day.

357
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:30,719
Adjourn.

358
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:32,858
Court adjourned!

359
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:36,220
Thank you, Your Majesty.

360
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,060
Wait, Official Mu.

361
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:53,020
Official Shen, your endorsement of equality in the court today was admirable.

362
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,600
Official Mu, you are often the talkative one.

363
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,279
Why did you remain silent today?

364
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,920
The Protected Appointments System has its flaws,

365
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,860
but it works for a reason.

366
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,540
We both went through the imperial examination

367
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,378
and know how it discriminates against humble and poor scholars.

368
00:32:11,378 --> 00:32:13,640
If we refuse to stand up,

369
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,180
we enable the noble families to exploit us and the other poor scholars.

370
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,400
You are absolutely right, Official Shen.

371
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,599
We come from a humble background,

372
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:27,319
so our view is shaped by it.

373
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:29,839
But His Majesty rules everyone.

374
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,718
He has to face noble families and the commoners.

375
00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:34,478
He is squeezed in between.

376
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:38,220
As His Majesty's ministers, we are supposed to reduce his burden.

377
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,579
I beg to differ, Official Mu.

378
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,100
Humble—

379
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,840
Didn't I say to leave me alone?

380
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,220
Did you not hear what I said?

381
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:52,000
Did we embezzle the relief fund?

382
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,280
No.

383
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,719
Don't look at me like that.

384
00:34:02,719 --> 00:34:07,198
If I was guilty, His Majesty would have punished me already.

385
00:34:07,199 --> 00:34:09,020
He didn't.

386
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,599
So I'm innocent.

387
00:34:13,979 --> 00:34:15,579
Father,

388
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,919
you are awfully verbose today.

389
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,400
If you're here to confront me, you may leave.

390
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,078
You have never cared about your family.

391
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:29,919
You don't need to do it now.

392
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,820
Father, why?

393
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:38,460
Do we not have enough wealth?

394
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,819
Why would you forsake your principles?

395
00:34:41,819 --> 00:34:43,820
Forsake my principles?

396
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:48,479
You are the guiltiest of us all.

397
00:34:48,479 --> 00:34:54,900
As the eldest son of the family, you did nothing for this family.

398
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:01,880
Do you think it's that easy to continue our legacy?

399
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:04,739
Then let it go.

400
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:06,440
You...

401
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,879
You traitor.

402
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,580
Get out.

403
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,180
Now!

404
00:35:31,979 --> 00:35:37,579
 If my comfort is built upon the misappropriation of public funds, 

405
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:43,819
 then I am ashamed to have admired this beautiful view in my garden. 

406
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:48,239
 The blossoming plants merely remind me 

407
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:52,619
 of my incompetence, naivete, and inaction. 

408
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:57,220
 I was born into such a family. 

409
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,799
 Though I never committed a crime, 

410
00:36:01,799 --> 00:36:05,200
 I bear responsibility for my family's sins. 

411
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,199
My dear.

412
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:19,419
Are you all right?

413
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,600
You seem to be deeply troubled. 
    

414
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,159
Did something happen during work?

415
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,118
I'm your wife.

416
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,598
You ought to share your woes with me.

417
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,720
I will do what I can to help you.

418
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,639
Qian'er.

419
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,199
Mother.

420
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,119
Why did you argue with your father again?

421
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,698
Listen to me.

422
00:36:50,698 --> 00:36:53,219
Don't talk back to your father.

423
00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:58,520
He wants you to grow up sooner to be the pillar of this family.

424
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,120
Like father, like son.

425
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,580
Both of you are equally stubborn.

426
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,038
We're a family.

427
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:06,779
You can talk it out.

428
00:37:06,779 --> 00:37:08,940
Don't keep everything to yourself.

429
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,618
Worry not, Mother-in-law.

430
00:37:14,618 --> 00:37:16,459
I will talk to Yunqian.

431
00:37:16,459 --> 00:37:18,858
It's getting late. Let's eat.

432
00:37:18,858 --> 00:37:20,759
Otherwise, you will have indigestion.

433
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,660
Okay.

434
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,139
If only you were as sensible as your wife.

435
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,740
Let's go.

436
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:42,598
You chastised me for not taking care of myself.

437
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:46,519
But now, you're the one falling sick.

438
00:37:47,479 --> 00:37:51,680
As your physician, I have to keep an eye on you.

439
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,320
You keep tabs on everything, huh?

440
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,799
Of course.

441
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,120
I am not as generous as you think.

442
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,919
So once in a while, I'll air your dirty laundry

443
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:07,840
so that you know not to mess around with me.

444
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:12,339
The land deed already falls under your name.

445
00:38:12,339 --> 00:38:16,460
What more do you want from me?

446
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:20,059
Your heart, needless to say.

447
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:28,860
However, My Lord, you set up the perfect ruse in the court today.

448
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:34,279
Those few letters are enough to send the Zhous and the Suns into a panic.

449
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:37,900
You also exposed the shortcomings of the Protected Appointments System.

450
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,700
Shen jumped on the occasion and suggested its abolition.

451
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,779
But it's too radical of a move.

452
00:38:44,779 --> 00:38:47,920
He wants to get rid of the pest as soon as possible,

453
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,719
yet the noble families are no ordinary pests.

454
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,478
They are more like venomous snakes ready to bare their fangs.

455
00:38:53,479 --> 00:38:56,079
He's too impatient.

456
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,739
We shall proceed slowly.

457
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:02,639
Eventually, we will depose those influential families.

458
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,479
Lord Ding uses Zhuang Wenfeng to wage a war against the noble families.

459
00:39:13,479 --> 00:39:18,099
Well, we can use this opportunity

460
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:23,119
to push for a systemic reform and get rid of those generational leeches.

461
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:29,079
But Prince Regent doesn't seem to favor a radical approach.

462
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:32,940
He wants to proceed slowly

463
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,820
and eliminate them one by one.

464
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:42,059
But those noble families are the source of pestilence.

465
00:39:42,059 --> 00:39:47,899
Letting it fester will only make the court increasingly hostile.

466
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:50,619
I agree.

467
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,740
The noble families do not lack in cunning foxes.

468
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:58,000
They won't sit by and allow someone to remove them from power.

469
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,720
Once they know what's happening, they will retaliate for sure.

470
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:08,259
We want them to fight.

471
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,520
If my uncle prefers a careful approach,

472
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,799
we can just stoke the flame ourselves.

473
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,540
He holds an important position and is supported by the people.

474
00:40:27,479 --> 00:40:30,700
He is the greatest obstacle on my path to becoming the empress.

475
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:37,040
However, he is very fond of Zhuohua.

476
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,120
If we can implicate her in this plan,

477
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,080
maybe my uncle will side with us.

478
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:47,359
He will have no choice but to do that.

479
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,240
Besides,

480
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,220
that arrangement will create distrust between His Majesty and Prince Regent.

481
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:03,240
After all, when sovereignty clashes with the interests of the noble families,

482
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,009
none can walk away from it.

483
00:41:06,009 --> 00:41:08,335
   

484
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:55,259
This book by Mr. Shang only has the first part but not the second one.

485
00:41:55,259 --> 00:41:57,319
Why is that?

486
00:41:57,319 --> 00:42:00,740
    
 However, it is well-written

487
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,520
and easy to understand.

488
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,479
 And it resonates deeply with my advocacy.

♫  Leaving the isolated heart's island, like waves without a shore  ♫

494
00:42:56,233 --> 00:42:59,973
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

495
00:42:59,973 --> 00:43:03,633
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

496
00:43:03,633 --> 00:43:07,553
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

497
00:43:07,553 --> 00:43:10,933
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

498
00:43:10,933 --> 00:43:14,553
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

499
00:43:14,554 --> 00:43:18,273
♫  Obviously willing to swear life and death 
 to be entangled for a lifetime  ♫

500
00:43:18,274 --> 00:43:22,573
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

501
00:43:22,573 --> 00:43:28,774
♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

502
00:43:41,974 --> 00:43:49,473
♫  I can't forget the turmoil of love and hate, 
 even if the next day is far away  ♫

503
00:43:49,473 --> 00:43:58,033
♫  Two souls embrace in chaos, how can it be written off?  ♫

504
00:43:58,033 --> 00:44:01,713
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

505
00:44:01,713 --> 00:44:05,353
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

506
00:44:05,353 --> 00:44:09,233
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

507
00:44:09,234 --> 00:44:12,673
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

508
00:44:12,674 --> 00:44:16,373
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

509
00:44:16,373 --> 00:44:20,153
♫  Obviously can't be erased, and haunted by lingering dreams  ♫

510
00:44:20,154 --> 00:44:24,133
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

511
00:44:24,133 --> 00:44:31,614
♫  Want to have one more glimpse of you, 
 even just for a second more  ♫
