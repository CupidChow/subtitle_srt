1
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:25,050


2
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,359
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,980
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,999
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:47,779
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,779 --> 00:00:53,059
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:58,159
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:03,379
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:08,480
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,679
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:18,739
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

12
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:24,000
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,139
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:36,418
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,418 --> 00:01:39,320
   

16
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,060
   

17
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,939
    
    

18
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,310
   

19
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:54,015
Did I make a mistake?

20
00:01:56,735 --> 00:02:02,155
I promised Yunqian that I would protect his family.

21
00:02:03,974 --> 00:02:06,195
But who would've known?

22
00:02:08,235 --> 00:02:11,130
I could not even protect him.

23
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,680
   

24
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,415
You're upset with me.

25
00:02:23,654 --> 00:02:25,635
I just think that...

26
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,255
if it weren't for me,

27
00:02:29,214 --> 00:02:31,294
he wouldn't have died.

28
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:35,454
The Sun family deserved it.

29
00:02:36,174 --> 00:02:40,194
Sun Ru colluded with Zhuang Wenfeng and embezzled the disaster relief fund.

30
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:44,514
This caused widespread starvation and millions of people were left without a home.

31
00:02:44,514 --> 00:02:47,015
Did he not deserve to die?

32
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:53,014
As for your friend, I gave him the opportunity to live.

33
00:02:54,315 --> 00:02:56,854
But he chose to die.

34
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:10,135
Am I wrong?

35
00:03:13,714 --> 00:03:15,214
Life is cruel.

36
00:03:15,214 --> 00:03:17,155
Who doesn't suffer?

37
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:22,195
He was luckier than most, yet he did not appreciate it.

38
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:26,454
It's good that he's dead.

39
00:03:26,454 --> 00:03:30,055
A weak man does not deserve to live in this world.

40
00:03:31,514 --> 00:03:33,114
Your Highness,

41
00:03:34,355 --> 00:03:36,155
do you still remember your initial goals?

42
00:03:36,155 --> 00:03:37,855
Of course.

43
00:03:38,714 --> 00:03:40,854
To become an empress,

44
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:43,636
bring change to the corrupted government of Southern Chen,

45
00:03:43,636 --> 00:03:46,375
and make this country a better place.

46
00:03:47,334 --> 00:03:49,975
Then, is everything that you do now...

47
00:03:50,535 --> 00:03:52,934
for the sake of that goal?

48
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:55,215
I know what you mean.

49
00:03:58,935 --> 00:04:00,835
Let me ask you.

50
00:04:02,214 --> 00:04:05,734
The life of one man and one family.

51
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:07,794
Which matters more?

52
00:04:08,575 --> 00:04:11,475
The life of a family and a country.

53
00:04:11,475 --> 00:04:13,595
Which matters more?

54
00:04:14,714 --> 00:04:20,774
What is wrong with giving up on a man and a family for the sake of a country's people?

55
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:29,800
Everything comes... at a price

56
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,455
Both were black sheep,

57
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:35,354
but why must Sun Ru die

58
00:04:35,354 --> 00:04:38,275
yet Zhou Cishan can live?

59
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:42,774
It's only temporary.

60
00:04:42,774 --> 00:04:44,554
When the timing is right,

61
00:04:44,554 --> 00:04:47,030
he will receive the penalty he deserves.

62
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,354
Fine.

63
00:04:52,314 --> 00:04:53,914
Fine.

64
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,730
   

65
00:05:07,035 --> 00:05:09,234
Such a temper.

66
00:05:25,734 --> 00:05:27,434
Uncle?

67
00:05:33,074 --> 00:05:35,794
I was not expecting you, sorry for my rudeness.

68
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:38,315
I hope you can forgive me.

69
00:05:38,315 --> 00:05:40,595
I came uninvited.

70
00:05:40,595 --> 00:05:42,575
Sorry for intruding, Your Highness.

71
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:47,235
Do you need something from me, Uncle?

72
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,654
It's nothing.

73
00:05:51,654 --> 00:05:54,615
I just wanted to speak with you.

74
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:58,914
Please feel free. I'm all ears.

75
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,835
Don't go too far.

76
00:06:12,234 --> 00:06:14,654
What do you mean, Uncle?

77
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:19,814
The one thing your father hated most

78
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:22,015
was to see sibling rivalry between you all.

79
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:27,335
He wished for his children to live in peace.

80
00:06:27,335 --> 00:06:31,914
He wished to see you live in harmony

81
00:06:31,914 --> 00:06:34,035
and care for each other.

82
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,900
Unfortunately,

83
00:06:37,455 --> 00:06:40,155
not everything goes according to what you wish for.

84
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,334
It seems...

85
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:46,615
that you don't plan to turn away from the wrong path.

86
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,415
The wrong path?

87
00:06:49,815 --> 00:06:53,855
Uncle, what do you think is the right path?

88
00:06:53,855 --> 00:06:57,935
The right path is your father's will.

89
00:06:57,935 --> 00:07:00,155
Since he willed for Chen'er to inherit the throne,

90
00:07:00,155 --> 00:07:02,735
I will protect him at all costs.

91
00:07:03,275 --> 00:07:08,214
If anyone with ill intentions dares shake up the foundation of Southern Chen,

92
00:07:09,214 --> 00:07:12,055
I will not hold back.

93
00:07:13,514 --> 00:07:15,734
If so,

94
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:17,934
I shall look forward to it.

95
00:07:21,885 --> 00:07:25,150
   

96
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,715
Back in the day,

97
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:33,680
you and I, along with Brother Sun,

98
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,054
ranked on the honor roll together

99
00:07:36,054 --> 00:07:38,234
and toured the streets on horseback.

100
00:07:38,234 --> 00:07:41,074
We were so high-spirited.

101
00:07:41,754 --> 00:07:43,934
But in such a short time...

102
00:07:49,995 --> 00:07:52,035
But in such a short time,

103
00:07:54,235 --> 00:07:56,895
he left us eternally.

104
00:08:09,674 --> 00:08:13,034
Brother Sun had a big heart

105
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,434
and held no prejudice.

106
00:08:15,434 --> 00:08:19,720
He always took extra care of me

107
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,175
and I'm very grateful.

108
00:08:22,175 --> 00:08:24,074
Did you know?

109
00:08:25,194 --> 00:08:27,914
Brother Sun once told me this.

110
00:08:31,035 --> 00:08:33,574
Though he is in the ancestral hall,

111
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,675
his heart is with the world.

112
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:46,974
His biggest wish was to see the world like a wild free crane.

113
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:50,135
And during his free time,

114
00:08:50,135 --> 00:08:54,450
to exchange drinks with close friends...

115
00:08:55,915 --> 00:08:58,275
would have been paradise.

116
00:09:00,314 --> 00:09:03,135
Indeed, he lived a solitary life.

117
00:09:05,374 --> 00:09:07,074
But...

118
00:09:09,055 --> 00:09:11,394
he mistrusted one man.

119
00:09:19,914 --> 00:09:22,214
I wasn't sure before,

120
00:09:24,454 --> 00:09:27,055
but seeing how sad you are,

121
00:09:28,354 --> 00:09:32,454
I am certain that you did not...

122
00:09:34,015 --> 00:09:36,595
intentionally cause Brother Sun's death,

123
00:09:36,595 --> 00:09:41,735
but it was the one who supported you that led it to happen.

124
00:09:43,654 --> 00:09:45,755
Brother Shen,

125
00:09:45,755 --> 00:09:49,075
do you really know Princess Roujia?

126
00:09:50,195 --> 00:09:52,294
Did you know?

127
00:09:52,294 --> 00:09:54,235
My tutor...

128
00:09:55,255 --> 00:09:57,995
also had an unnatural death.

129
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:04,254
And the cause was your endorsement.

130
00:10:17,574 --> 00:10:19,574
I know.

131
00:10:19,574 --> 00:10:22,995
You did not intend for him to die.

132
00:10:22,995 --> 00:10:27,547
It was Princess Roujia who used you to lure me in,

133
00:10:27,547 --> 00:10:32,734
then sent men to kill my tutor then later, blamed it on the Sun family.

134
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,915
But, Brother Shen, I know you may not have wanted to be part of it.

135
00:10:41,915 --> 00:10:45,415
Since you know everything so clearly,

136
00:10:45,415 --> 00:10:46,954
are you sure...

137
00:10:47,574 --> 00:10:52,315
that you will still enable such deeds for your own agenda?

138
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,935
Zhuohua?

139
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,754
Why are you here?

140
00:11:12,735 --> 00:11:18,435
I'm so sorry for disturbing you, Your Highness.

141
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:26,095
My uncle said something similar, too.

142
00:11:26,095 --> 00:11:30,495
You must know why I'm here, then.

143
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:34,234
Why are you so polite with me, Zhuohua?

144
00:11:35,015 --> 00:11:40,215
I believe that you understand why, Your Highness.

145
00:11:45,174 --> 00:11:48,874
You and I are like-minded with similar circumstances.

146
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,154
We have poor relationships with our families, and are both aware...

147
00:11:52,895 --> 00:11:57,494
of how challenging our paths are as women.

148
00:11:57,494 --> 00:11:59,174
Since that is the case,

149
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:06,054
we should be of one mind and help each other to finish this race.

150
00:12:13,694 --> 00:12:17,994
In my opinion, you're not quite right, Your Highness.

151
00:12:17,994 --> 00:12:19,754
Which part of it?

152
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:26,574
In the beginning, I really thought that we could walk together.

153
00:12:27,855 --> 00:12:29,555
Later on,

154
00:12:30,654 --> 00:12:33,674
I thought that we just worked differently toward the same goal.

155
00:12:34,735 --> 00:12:37,074
But now, I realize...

156
00:12:39,015 --> 00:12:41,935
that we are no longer going in the same direction...

157
00:12:43,294 --> 00:12:45,275
and have parted ways.

158
00:13:13,774 --> 00:13:15,675
Our relationship...

159
00:13:17,654 --> 00:13:19,694
is just like this hairpin.

160
00:13:32,615 --> 00:13:35,094
Since she does not appreciate my kindness,

161
00:13:36,975 --> 00:13:39,454
then I will not hold back.

162
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:46,130
   

163
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:07,413
♫  The love that opened my eyes  ♫

164
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:12,014
 Your Highness, what kind of person are you? 

165
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,870
♫  A dream of a goose and a phoenix crossing together  ♫

166
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,839
♫  Tenderness is like parting and complaints  ♫

167
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:30,139
♫  Going around for a lifetime, constantly cut and scattered,

00:14:36,233 --> 00:14:38,034
 - Are you okay? 
 - Thank you. 

171
00:14:38,034 --> 00:14:41,654
 Thank you, Your Highness. 

172
00:14:41,654 --> 00:14:43,935
 I'm not worthy of your thanks. 

173
00:14:43,935 --> 00:14:46,014
 The world owes it to you. 

174

are you willing...

180
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:23,674
to get drunk with a sinner like me?

Shen Jinghong, you're burning up.

190
00:16:14,615 --> 00:16:16,215
Wake up.

191
00:16:26,514 --> 00:16:27,694
Don't move.

192
00:16:27,694 --> 00:16:29,635
Do you want some medicine?

193
00:16:30,915 --> 00:16:32,334
My head hurts.

194
00:16:32,335 --> 00:16:33,453
It hurts?

195
00:16:33,454 --> 00:16:35,474
Do you want a massage?

196
00:16:38,895 --> 00:16:40,495
Take it slow.

197
00:16:45,495 --> 00:16:47,195
You're awake.

198
00:16:47,195 --> 00:16:49,214
Have some medicine.

199
00:16:53,635 --> 00:16:55,135
Why are you here?

200
00:16:55,135 --> 00:16:58,115
I walked right in.

201
00:16:58,115 --> 00:16:59,653
Your door was open.

202
00:16:59,654 --> 00:17:02,453
Also, if I didn't save you,

203
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:04,633
you would have gotten brain damage from the fever.

204
00:17:04,633 --> 00:17:07,334
But why don't you have any servants at home?

205
00:17:07,335 --> 00:17:11,394
You were in the yard all night and nobody noticed.

206
00:17:12,974 --> 00:17:16,735
I wanted to be alone so I gave them a day off.

207
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,453
Since you don't have servants now,

208
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,234
all the more reason I should stay and look after you.

209
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,334
Thank you for helping, Princess Jing'an.

210
00:17:26,335 --> 00:17:27,933
I'm fine now.

211
00:17:27,934 --> 00:17:29,814
Please return, Princess Jing'an.

212
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,675
But...

213
00:17:32,855 --> 00:17:34,595
Don't move.

214
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,094
Do you really want to get brain damage?

215
00:17:39,955 --> 00:17:41,654
It's none of your business. Right?

216
00:17:41,654 --> 00:17:43,355
You...

217
00:17:46,414 --> 00:17:47,814
Fine.

218
00:17:47,815 --> 00:17:50,715
Finish the medicine and I will leave.

219
00:17:50,715 --> 00:17:52,874
I will watch you finish it.

220
00:18:05,254 --> 00:18:06,954
Are you happy now?

221
00:18:20,295 --> 00:18:22,973
I'm a foreign princess,so I can be excused for my manners.

222
00:18:22,974 --> 00:18:26,595
Princess Roujia, shouldn't you be a precious and pure being?

223
00:18:26,595 --> 00:18:29,855
How can you come to a man's home in the morning?

224
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:32,335
You've misunderstood, Jing'an.

225
00:18:32,335 --> 00:18:36,594
I'm here to meet Official Shen to discuss matters regarding Jishan Hall.

226
00:18:36,594 --> 00:18:38,534
Stop pretending.

227
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:41,235
I'm not a fool who would believe you.

228
00:18:42,114 --> 00:18:43,173
Never mind.

229
00:18:43,174 --> 00:18:47,435
You're young and unfiltered, so I will not find fault with you.

230
00:18:47,435 --> 00:18:49,895
But don't go too far.

231
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:54,515
Don't forget, your brother is concerned about you.

232
00:19:18,055 --> 00:19:19,755
Are you unwell?

233
00:19:31,955 --> 00:19:34,135
Why are you here, Your Highness?

234
00:19:34,135 --> 00:19:35,814
Please return.

235
00:19:35,814 --> 00:19:37,434
Why?

236
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:43,795
My humble abode is unworthy of your presence.

237
00:20:34,535 --> 00:20:36,575
What are you doing?

238
00:20:37,174 --> 00:20:39,655
Lowering your temperature with alcohol.

239
00:20:44,615 --> 00:20:46,555
Don't worry about me, Your Highness.

240
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,455
I'm much better now.

241
00:20:50,855 --> 00:20:52,455
Is that so?

242
00:20:53,014 --> 00:20:55,555
I see that your ears are still red

243
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:57,634
so I thought you still had a fever.

244
00:21:03,014 --> 00:21:05,794
I know you're angry at me.

245
00:21:05,794 --> 00:21:09,755
I was a little harsh that day,

246
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:15,635
but Sun Yunqian's death was a surprise to me.

247
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,714
Of course, I knew you were friends.

248
00:21:18,714 --> 00:21:22,435
Even if I did not care about him, I cared about your feelings.

249
00:21:32,855 --> 00:21:34,974
After recovering,

250
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:38,494
you should replenish your nutrients.

251
00:21:42,575 --> 00:21:45,314
Your Highness is precious,

252
00:21:45,314 --> 00:21:47,334
so you don't have to waste time here.

253
00:21:47,335 --> 00:21:50,014
Since you know Her Highness is precious,

254
00:21:50,014 --> 00:21:53,574
then you should know that Her Highness has never taken care of others like so.

255
00:21:53,575 --> 00:21:56,795
She even scalded her fingers to make soup for you.

what do you think?

273
00:23:53,335 --> 00:23:54,735
Official Mu.

274
00:23:55,335 --> 00:23:57,475
Were you listening to me?

275
00:23:58,174 --> 00:24:01,455
Your Majesty, my apologies for my manners before the throne.

276
00:24:01,455 --> 00:24:03,435
No need to kneel.

277
00:24:04,794 --> 00:24:06,814
I was just asking.

278
00:24:07,734 --> 00:24:09,374
What is wrong with you today?

279
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:12,135
You have been so restless.

280
00:24:13,254 --> 00:24:14,654
Your Majesty,

281
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:16,815
my...

282
00:24:16,815 --> 00:24:21,195
my back is slightly aching.

283
00:24:21,195 --> 00:24:23,054
I don't feel quite well.

284
00:24:26,855 --> 00:24:31,234
I'm sure it's because you are worn out from working on the Talent Appreciation System.

285
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:37,494
Summon an imperial physician.

286
00:24:38,454 --> 00:24:41,835
Your Majesty, I am afraid...

287
00:24:41,835 --> 00:24:45,013
that it's just a minor discomfort.

288
00:24:45,014 --> 00:24:46,313
I will get better in a few days.

289
00:24:46,313 --> 00:24:48,334
There is no need to summon an imperial physician.

290
00:24:48,335 --> 00:24:50,534
- It's just... 
 - Your Majesty.

291
00:24:50,535 --> 00:24:52,094
I'm fine, really.

292
00:24:52,095 --> 00:24:53,695
But...

293
00:24:57,254 --> 00:25:01,874
Your Majesty, in my opinion, I don't think Official Mu is unwell.

294
00:25:03,254 --> 00:25:05,054
If not, then what?

295
00:25:05,694 --> 00:25:08,695
Perhaps it's menstruation.

296
00:25:17,615 --> 00:25:19,634
Well, it's like that.

297
00:25:20,654 --> 00:25:22,254
I...

298
00:25:23,254 --> 00:25:25,554
I misunderstood.

299
00:25:28,855 --> 00:25:31,755
Well, why don't I give you half a day off?

300
00:25:31,755 --> 00:25:34,154
You may go home and rest.

301
00:25:34,815 --> 00:25:36,094
Thank you, Your Majesty.

302
00:25:36,095 --> 00:25:40,614
I shall complete my work at the Ministry of Revenue before I return home.

303
00:25:41,934 --> 00:25:43,213
Sure.

304
00:25:43,214 --> 00:25:45,335
You should take care.

305
00:25:47,135 --> 00:25:48,935
Don't overwork yourself.

306
00:25:50,535 --> 00:25:52,335
Yes.

307
00:25:52,335 --> 00:25:54,934
I shall take my leave, then.

308
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:03,053
Your Majesty, please excuse me for being honest.

309
00:26:03,053 --> 00:26:04,634
   

310
00:26:04,634 --> 00:26:07,075
My greetings to you, Lord Ding.

311
00:26:12,135 --> 00:26:13,835
Thank you, My Lord.

312
00:26:18,174 --> 00:26:20,895
This is the palace carriage.

313
00:26:21,895 --> 00:26:24,574
His Majesty knew that I was unwell

314
00:26:24,575 --> 00:26:27,775
and fetched the palace carriage to send me home.

315
00:26:28,775 --> 00:26:31,054
His Majesty is so kind to you.

316
00:26:31,974 --> 00:26:33,493
His Majesty is kind to you, My Lord.

317
00:26:33,494 --> 00:26:35,414
I'm nothing compared to you.

318
00:26:38,414 --> 00:26:41,035
Is somebody being jealous?

319
00:26:41,035 --> 00:26:44,554
Oh, it's my man!

320
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:49,890
   

321
00:26:49,895 --> 00:26:50,973
Grandaunt,

322
00:26:50,974 --> 00:26:53,454
can't you just stay in the capital?

323
00:26:53,454 --> 00:26:57,675
You should allow me to show my filialty to you.

324
00:26:57,675 --> 00:27:00,253
That's right. It's so far and distant.

325
00:27:00,253 --> 00:27:03,895
Once you depart from here, we won't know when we can meet again.

326
00:27:03,895 --> 00:27:06,054
I've lived in Jiangnan for too long.

327
00:27:06,054 --> 00:27:09,135
I'm not used to the capital's climate.

328
00:27:12,775 --> 00:27:16,775
Your Majesty is the emperor and has many responsibilities.

329
00:27:16,775 --> 00:27:20,495
I'm honored that you are here to bid me farewell.

330
00:27:20,495 --> 00:27:22,435
What do you mean?

331
00:27:22,435 --> 00:27:24,114
I am a junior.

332
00:27:24,114 --> 00:27:27,294
Juniors typically bid their elders farewell.

333
00:27:27,295 --> 00:27:29,175
I'm just doing what I should be.

334
00:27:29,175 --> 00:27:33,493
Ordinary people at your age

335
00:27:33,494 --> 00:27:36,254
would have already gotten married and had children.

336
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:37,574
That's right.

337
00:27:37,575 --> 00:27:40,315
But nothing I say will work.

338
00:27:40,315 --> 00:27:44,254
His Majesty always gives excuses.

339
00:27:44,254 --> 00:27:46,294
Why are we talking about this?

340
00:27:50,694 --> 00:27:52,594
Your Majesty.

341
00:27:52,594 --> 00:27:55,294
Be honest with me.

342
00:27:55,295 --> 00:27:58,095
Do you have someone you like?

343
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:03,774
How is that possible?

344
00:28:08,775 --> 00:28:12,854
It seems Liu Chen has feelings for Zhuohua.

345
00:28:12,854 --> 00:28:15,914
I noticed it when we were in Jiangnan.

346
00:28:17,454 --> 00:28:22,154
Will he lose focus on this

347
00:28:22,154 --> 00:28:26,675
and fall out with Liu Yan for her sake?

348
00:28:26,675 --> 00:28:29,654
You're so sharp, Your Highness.

349
00:28:34,135 --> 00:28:39,813
Speaking of which, a few days ago, I saw the female Tanhua of Southern Chen.

350
00:28:39,813 --> 00:28:41,795
She is very witty.

351
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:44,554
That's right.

352
00:28:44,554 --> 00:28:48,614
Zhuohua is talented and not inferior to men.

353
00:28:55,615 --> 00:28:57,474
You're a young lady now.

354
00:28:57,474 --> 00:28:59,614
Why are you acting cute

355
00:28:59,614 --> 00:29:02,335
like when you were younger?

356
00:29:03,414 --> 00:29:05,414
Grandaunt,

357
00:29:05,414 --> 00:29:08,175
I would like to ask for something from you.

358
00:29:08,175 --> 00:29:11,275
What's mine is yours.

359
00:29:11,275 --> 00:29:17,594
Even if you want the stars of the sky, I will try to get them for you.

360
00:29:18,535 --> 00:29:22,335
Grandaunt, can you give me the Evil-erasing Sword?

361
00:29:24,815 --> 00:29:28,854
The Evil-erasing Sword is a national weapon.

362
00:29:28,854 --> 00:29:33,874
It can only appear when the country is in danger.

363
00:29:33,874 --> 00:29:35,774
Noble families are in power.

364
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:38,955
Is this not a sign of a dying country?

365
00:29:40,174 --> 00:29:41,774
Jiaojiao,

366
00:29:41,774 --> 00:29:46,594
since when have you been interested in political matters?

367
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:51,715
I am also of royal blood.

368
00:29:51,715 --> 00:29:54,375
It is only normal for me to be concerned

369
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,695
about the national matters of Southern Chen.

370
00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:59,074
Normal?

371
00:30:03,174 --> 00:30:04,574
Jiaojiao,

372
00:30:05,615 --> 00:30:10,015
could it be that you wish to take that seat?

373
00:30:11,295 --> 00:30:12,795
Grandaunt.

374
00:30:13,974 --> 00:30:18,573
Did you not teach me all this knowledge on governance for national stability?

375
00:30:19,295 --> 00:30:24,994
You should know very well that I am more capable than Liu Chen.

376
00:30:24,994 --> 00:30:28,294
If I become the empress, it will bless the people.

377
00:30:31,575 --> 00:30:33,695
I taught you such things

378
00:30:33,695 --> 00:30:36,654
so that you would have a sense of discernment.

379
00:30:36,654 --> 00:30:40,415
I did not expect to encourage such ideas.

380
00:30:41,895 --> 00:30:45,055
What is wrong with having these ideas?

381
00:30:45,055 --> 00:30:46,735
Jiaojiao,

382
00:30:46,735 --> 00:30:49,914
that is a road of no return.

383
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:51,814
While it seems noble and glorified,

384
00:30:51,815 --> 00:30:53,894
it is actually like walking on thin ice.

385
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:55,894
You cannot lower your guard for even an instance.

386
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,535
Only an incapable ruler would walk on thin ice.

387
00:31:00,895 --> 00:31:05,095
I will definitely be a wise ruler who is loved by the country.

388
00:31:06,974 --> 00:31:08,674
Jiaojiao,

389
00:31:09,414 --> 00:31:11,895
you've had a rough childhood.

390
00:31:11,895 --> 00:31:15,315
I cannot bear to see you take such risks.

391
00:31:15,855 --> 00:31:20,494
I just hope to see you live happily as the First Princess of Southern Chen.

392
00:31:30,775 --> 00:31:32,275
Grandaunt,

393
00:31:33,295 --> 00:31:35,835
but I only want that seat.

394
00:31:37,055 --> 00:31:39,594
If you really care about me,

395
00:31:39,615 --> 00:31:42,174
give me the Evil-erasing Sword.

396
00:31:47,895 --> 00:31:50,194
Impossible.

397
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:54,254
Jiaojiao,

398
00:31:54,254 --> 00:31:57,013
why would you have such ideas?

399
00:31:57,014 --> 00:32:00,034
Just forget about it. This is impossible!

400
00:32:04,454 --> 00:32:07,335
Grandaunt, calm down.

401
00:32:25,895 --> 00:32:28,434
Grandaunt, calm down.

402
00:32:28,434 --> 00:32:30,775
It's my fault,

403
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:32,874
don't be angry anymore.

404
00:32:48,654 --> 00:32:50,054
Jiaojiao,

405
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:51,973
return to Jiangzuo with me.

406
00:32:51,974 --> 00:32:53,453
We will live a peaceful life.

407
00:32:53,454 --> 00:32:54,754
Okay?

408
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:57,913
- Listen to me. 
 - Grandaunt.

409
00:32:58,654 --> 00:33:01,454
I will not return to Jiangzuo with you.

410
00:33:01,454 --> 00:33:04,114
I just want to tend to you in the capital.

411
00:33:07,874 --> 00:33:10,795
Why am I feeling dizzy?

412
00:33:19,295 --> 00:33:21,195
Jiaojiao.

413
00:33:23,275 --> 00:33:25,875
You drugged me?

414
00:33:27,775 --> 00:33:30,075
Grandaunt,

415
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:32,695
this drug is harmless.

416
00:33:34,174 --> 00:33:36,774
It will only make you weak.

417
00:33:38,734 --> 00:33:41,775
I would never hurt you.

418
00:33:48,096 --> 00:33:49,905
   

419
00:33:50,515 --> 00:33:52,715
Qi.

420
00:33:53,694 --> 00:33:55,954
Look at you.

421
00:33:55,954 --> 00:34:00,595
Those who know what happened would know that you requested Qi to do the Mu family a favor.

422
00:34:00,595 --> 00:34:03,314
But those who don't would think you're unwilling to part with her.

423
00:34:03,314 --> 00:34:07,714
Why are you pointing it out?

424
00:34:09,295 --> 00:34:12,413
Mother. Old Master Mu.

425
00:34:12,413 --> 00:34:16,855
Since His Majesty has made the judgment, it's time to wrap it up.

426
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:21,274
In the future, if we just do as we're told,

427
00:34:21,274 --> 00:34:23,575
there will be nothing to worry about.

428
00:34:23,575 --> 00:34:26,434
Don't worry. I will keep an eye on him.

429
00:34:27,594 --> 00:34:32,314
Even if I can't do it myself, I have 18 sisters to help me out.

430
00:34:47,255 --> 00:34:50,895
Qi, I don't mean to lecture you.

431
00:34:50,895 --> 00:34:55,554
Though I'm quite the playboy, I gave every concubine the acknowledgment they deserved.

432
00:34:55,554 --> 00:34:57,834
They are all part of the Mu family.

433
00:34:57,834 --> 00:35:01,814
But you are even worse than I am.

434
00:35:01,814 --> 00:35:04,854
Can't you even acknowledge him?

435
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:09,975
Such behavior is really unfair.

436
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:11,875
So, you're fair?

437
00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:14,834
But our home is running out of space.

438
00:35:14,834 --> 00:35:18,855
Do you think Qi cannot see what kind of player you are?

439
00:35:18,855 --> 00:35:22,475
You want to be the Prince Regent's father-in-law, don't you?

440
00:35:22,475 --> 00:35:24,394
Stop calling me out.

441
00:35:24,394 --> 00:35:28,174
Enough, let's go or we won't reach the lodging in time.

442
00:35:28,175 --> 00:35:30,075
We'll get going, then.

443
00:35:31,314 --> 00:35:35,134
Qi, you are meant to do great things.

444
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:37,335
The Mu family is unable to support you,

445
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:39,314
but don't worry, you have me.

446
00:35:39,314 --> 00:35:41,775
They will not cause you more trouble.

447
00:35:41,775 --> 00:35:44,815
Just walk forward fearlessly.

448
00:35:44,815 --> 00:35:46,575
Thank you, Mother.

449
00:36:10,182 --> 00:36:14,332
♫  The flowing water bends and reflects the round moon  ♫

Let me do it myself.

00:36:18,714 --> 00:36:21,174
- Delicious, right? 
 - Delicious.

457
00:36:42,795 --> 00:36:44,334
Would you like a steamed bun?

460

00:37:00,695 --> 00:37:03,114
When I have ever starved you?

464
00:37:14,414 --> 00:37:16,254
I was thinking of getting a free meal

465
00:37:16,255 --> 00:37:18,781
but I didn't expect it to be sold out.

466
00:37:21,014 --> 00:37:23,613
My Lord, shall we go to Shixiang House?

467
00:37:23,614 --> 00:37:27,913
I heard from Juli that they hired a good chef who's skilled in pastries.

468
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,401
Sure.

469
00:37:29,402 --> 00:37:33,231
♫  Toiling away long hours together with the candle's light  ♫

475
00:38:06,782 --> 00:38:11,214
 Should I acknowledge him? 

476
00:38:23,775 --> 00:38:25,694
This hairpin is luxurious.

477
00:38:25,695 --> 00:38:28,734
If other women wear it, it would outshine them.

478
00:38:28,734 --> 00:38:30,474
Only you can match up to it, Yunyun.

479
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,214
As expected of a most outstanding noble lady.

480
00:38:37,255 --> 00:38:40,633
I'm sorry. That was rude of me.

481
00:38:40,633 --> 00:38:43,214
You shouldn't say that, Your Highness.

482
00:38:43,214 --> 00:38:45,554
You are my savior.

483
00:38:45,554 --> 00:38:48,734
I am so grateful to you, Your Highness.

484
00:38:48,734 --> 00:38:50,613
Every injustice has its perpetrator.

485
00:38:50,614 --> 00:38:53,414
I will make sure Mu Zhuohua pays for it.

486
00:38:54,275 --> 00:38:58,394
Zhuohua may have her reasons.

487
00:39:00,114 --> 00:39:03,814
Never mind. If you have any troubles,

488
00:39:03,815 --> 00:39:07,975
just let me know and I will help you as much as I can.

489
00:39:09,074 --> 00:39:11,074
Thank you, Your Highness.

490
00:39:17,594 --> 00:39:19,894
Jing'an, you're back?

491
00:39:19,894 --> 00:39:22,694
You look very happy.

492
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:26,255
I presume you enjoyed yourself.

493
00:39:26,255 --> 00:39:30,235
I'd be happy doing anything as long as I'm with Official Shen.

494
00:39:33,274 --> 00:39:35,593
Princess Jing'an has been in Southern Chen for a while now,

495
00:39:35,593 --> 00:39:38,093
yet your manners are still lacking.

496
00:39:38,094 --> 00:39:40,573
I'm afraid you're overly focused on romance

497
00:39:40,574 --> 00:39:42,914
and overlooked your priorities.

498
00:39:44,414 --> 00:39:49,214
I wonder who has been crushing on the Prince Regent for years

499
00:39:49,214 --> 00:39:52,294
and eventually became a maiden.

500
00:39:52,294 --> 00:39:55,515
You fight every time you meet.

501
00:39:55,515 --> 00:39:59,394
We are family. We should live in harmony together.

502
00:39:59,394 --> 00:40:01,775
Who are you calling family?

503
00:40:09,255 --> 00:40:11,575
You have skin as smooth as porcelain.

504
00:40:12,414 --> 00:40:17,074
I'm sure these pearls will make you even more dazzling.

505
00:40:23,215 --> 00:40:26,695
Yunyun is not completely wrong.

506
00:40:26,695 --> 00:40:28,573
The Mid-Autumn Palace Banquet is tomorrow.

507
00:40:28,574 --> 00:40:31,114
You must be careful to guard your dignity.

508
00:40:31,114 --> 00:40:35,433
After all, you didn't come to Southern Chen just for sightseeing and leisure.

509
00:40:36,514 --> 00:40:39,413
All right. I shall excuse myself.

510
00:40:59,895 --> 00:41:01,795
Grandaunt,

511
00:41:02,795 --> 00:41:04,894
I know you're awake.

512
00:41:05,955 --> 00:41:08,655
Do you dislike seeing me so much?

513
00:41:21,554 --> 00:41:23,454
Grandaunt.

514
00:41:25,574 --> 00:41:28,334
I'm your beloved Jiaojiao.

515
00:41:29,095 --> 00:41:35,755
Did you not say that you would even give me the stars of the sky?

516
00:41:37,314 --> 00:41:42,195
Now, I am only asking for the Evil-erasing Sword.

517
00:41:43,014 --> 00:41:45,615
Why won't you give it to me?

518
00:41:46,974 --> 00:41:48,874
"Only"?

519
00:41:51,414 --> 00:41:56,315
When civil unrest begins, poverty will strike.

520
00:41:57,635 --> 00:42:03,335
The ones who suffer are the country's people.

521
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:09,014
Jiaojiao, don't be so unrepentant.

522
00:42:09,014 --> 00:42:11,255
"Unrepentant"?

523
00:42:15,915 --> 00:42:17,715
Grandaunt,

524
00:42:18,695 --> 00:42:21,975
I never understood that about you.

525
00:42:21,975 --> 00:42:23,855
You had the capabilities,

526
00:42:23,855 --> 00:42:26,515
yet you had no courage to ascend the throne.

527
00:42:26,515 --> 00:42:31,274
Back then, you were only one step away from the throne.

528
00:42:36,855 --> 00:42:38,875
But I am not like you.

529
00:42:39,895 --> 00:42:44,074
I will not remain in a small place like Jiangnan, wasting my life away.

530
00:42:49,295 --> 00:42:54,354
Let me do what you never did.

531
00:42:55,215 --> 00:42:57,674
You can remain in the capital

532
00:42:57,674 --> 00:43:00,615
and watch how I resurrect the Liu Clan's glory.

533
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:15,050


534
00:43:18,122 --> 00:43:25,581
♫  I can't forget the love that is still is nipping at my ears and temples  ♫

535
00:43:25,581 --> 00:43:32,781
♫  Memories keep slamming into rocks and have nowhere to berth  ♫

536
00:43:32,781 --> 00:43:40,221
♫  Both sides gaze at each other in the drizzling rain, but one has turned into clouds and mist  ♫

537
00:43:40,221 --> 00:43:48,741
♫  Leaving the isolated heart's island, like waves without a shore  ♫

538
00:43:48,741 --> 00:43:52,481
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

539
00:43:52,481 --> 00:43:56,241
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

540
00:43:56,241 --> 00:44:00,161
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

541
00:44:00,161 --> 00:44:03,641
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

542
00:44:03,642 --> 00:44:07,161
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

543
00:44:07,162 --> 00:44:10,881
♫  Obviously willing to swear life and death 
 to be entangled for a lifetime  ♫

544
00:44:10,882 --> 00:44:15,181
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

545
00:44:15,181 --> 00:44:21,482
♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

546
00:44:34,582 --> 00:44:41,881
♫  I can't forget the turmoil of love and hate, 
 even if the next day is far away  ♫

547
00:44:41,881 --> 00:44:50,441
♫  Two souls embrace in chaos, how can it be written off?  ♫

548
00:44:50,441 --> 00:44:54,221
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

549
00:44:54,221 --> 00:44:57,961
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

550
00:44:57,961 --> 00:45:01,941
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

551
00:45:01,941 --> 00:45:05,281
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

552
00:45:05,282 --> 00:45:08,981
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

553
00:45:08,981 --> 00:45:12,662
♫  Obviously can't be erased, and haunted by lingering dreams  ♫

554
00:45:12,662 --> 00:45:16,741
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

555
00:45:16,741 --> 00:45:24,622
♫  Want to have one more glimpse of you, 
 even just for a second more  ♫
