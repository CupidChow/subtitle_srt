1
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:25,260


2
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,459
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:34,980
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,999
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:47,879
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,159
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,259
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,479
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,579
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,579
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:18,539
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

12
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:24,000
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,239
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:36,918
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,019
   

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,959
   

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,939
   

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
   

19
00:01:52,706 --> 00:01:56,226
Your Highness, you came to visit the Dowager Empress again.

20
00:01:56,226 --> 00:01:59,725
She keeps mentioning you.

21
00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:05,965
Just now, His Majesty and Prince Regent had another row.

22
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:07,045
His Majesty was furious.

23
00:02:07,046 --> 00:02:09,644
He had Prince Regent copy the genealogy a thousand times

24
00:02:09,645 --> 00:02:12,265
before allowing his return to the imperial court.

25
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,985
After all, His Majesty is the monarch.

26
00:02:15,985 --> 00:02:18,386
Uncle has crossed the line.

27
00:02:18,386 --> 00:02:21,246
Exactly. Mind your step.

28
00:02:21,246 --> 00:02:27,935
   

29
00:02:34,246 --> 00:02:36,786
Are you sure you want to go in, Your Highness?

30
00:02:36,786 --> 00:02:38,905
Of course.

31
00:03:02,986 --> 00:03:07,665
I find that the servants here can really take a hint.

32
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:11,766
You're free to come and go around here.

33
00:03:14,046 --> 00:03:17,705
Concerning our relationship, they won't stop me.

34
00:03:19,046 --> 00:03:20,646
Why?

35
00:03:20,646 --> 00:03:25,446
Do you want me to climb over the wall like Yemu Zhen did?

36
00:03:28,106 --> 00:03:31,686
I wonder how I've offended you.

37
00:03:31,686 --> 00:03:37,646
You'd rather drink alone and play chess than meet me.

38
00:03:40,525 --> 00:03:45,125
I've disgraced myself for your sake.

39
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:49,125
Do you insist on giving me the cold shoulder?

40
00:03:55,026 --> 00:04:00,226
Why? Just because I used Zhuohua,

41
00:04:00,226 --> 00:04:02,485
you don't want to see as much.

42
00:04:02,485 --> 00:04:07,046
Does she hold more importance than I do in your heart?

43
00:04:11,445 --> 00:04:13,445
Do you really mean what you said?

44
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:17,346
I have a question.

45
00:04:17,346 --> 00:04:21,346
On your road towards the throne,

46
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:23,865
to what extent will you go?

47
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,565
To slay the dragon,

48
00:04:27,526 --> 00:04:30,605
I have to sacrifice some of my pawns.

49
00:04:31,546 --> 00:04:35,465
Everything that has been done is for the final result.

50
00:04:40,486 --> 00:04:43,946
It's time to wrap up the game.

51
00:04:44,846 --> 00:04:48,065
However, there's one more thing we need to fight for.

52
00:04:48,885 --> 00:04:51,685
I wonder if you're interested

53
00:04:51,685 --> 00:04:54,565
in finishing this game with me.

54
00:04:54,565 --> 00:04:57,006
You should know

55
00:04:57,006 --> 00:05:00,465
that I'm always standing toe to toe against those noble families.

56
00:05:00,465 --> 00:05:04,984
I'm afraid you can't afford to lose help from the Zhou family in this game.

57
00:05:05,785 --> 00:05:10,985
Therefore, I'm not in for this.

58
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:13,346
Why do you care about those noble families?

59
00:05:15,885 --> 00:05:18,165
We do all this for our great endeavor.

60
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:22,506
When this is over, I'll remove them one by one.

61
00:05:44,506 --> 00:05:46,886
Sooner or later, you will know...

62
00:05:47,646 --> 00:05:50,365
I made the right choice.

63
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:07,766
Official Zhou, are you positive about what you said?

64
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:09,186
You said that once the plan succeeds,

65
00:06:09,186 --> 00:06:11,145
the Talent Appreciation System will be replaced

66
00:06:11,145 --> 00:06:14,825
by the perpetual heritability.

67
00:06:14,825 --> 00:06:16,746
 Certainly. 

68
00:06:21,286 --> 00:06:23,186
Your Highness.

69
00:06:24,345 --> 00:06:27,626
I understand that you don't have complete trust in me now.

70
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:32,045
Today, I'll give you all a gift.

71
00:06:33,365 --> 00:06:35,646
Turn in these missives

72
00:06:35,685 --> 00:06:39,425
during the morning assembly tomorrow.

73
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:43,626
The biggest obstacle to your prosperous life

74
00:06:43,626 --> 00:06:46,005
will then be crushed.

75
00:06:49,445 --> 00:06:51,465
Is this feasible?

76
00:06:52,865 --> 00:06:56,665
These may not be enough, Your Highness.

77
00:06:59,365 --> 00:07:02,746
Read this and see if it's enough, Official Zhou.

78
00:07:06,046 --> 00:07:10,826
On this day, the late emperor passed away.

79
00:07:31,526 --> 00:07:33,985
Why are you coughing again?

80
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:42,746
Perhaps it got worse after the row with His Majesty.

81
00:07:45,685 --> 00:07:48,666
After all, His Majesty is in a different position now.

82
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:52,146
He has his own perspective and concerns.

83
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:55,026
You should try another way to talk to him.

84
00:07:58,046 --> 00:08:01,825
Besides, he has been under great duress recently

85
00:08:01,825 --> 00:08:03,605
and has become a bit grumpy.

86
00:08:03,605 --> 00:08:06,145
That was why he quarreled roundly with you.

87
00:08:15,365 --> 00:08:18,705
However, I think the punishment he gave is a good one.

88
00:08:18,705 --> 00:08:22,946
During these days, you can copy the genealogy at home

89
00:08:22,946 --> 00:08:23,905
and get some good rest.

90
00:08:23,905 --> 00:08:25,965
You haven't rested since returning

91
00:08:25,966 --> 00:08:29,846
and your body doesn't recover well.

92
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,966
Zhuohua.

93
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:43,165
If one day I'm gone,

94
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,186
what will you do?

95
00:08:48,126 --> 00:08:53,444
I'll find a young and handsome man and take him to your tomb every day

96
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:56,406
to show you how lovable I am.

97
00:09:00,945 --> 00:09:06,065
What a unique turn of mind you have.

98
00:09:06,065 --> 00:09:12,385
I shall see who has the guts to visit my tomb with you.

99
00:09:13,665 --> 00:09:16,445
If you're worried that I can't find a brave man,

100
00:09:16,445 --> 00:09:20,885
you'd better stay well and accompany me for a long time.

101
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:31,286
You still have a wonderful life ahead.

102
00:09:32,766 --> 00:09:38,426
You must live on well even without me.

103
00:09:39,685 --> 00:09:42,645
Why are you saying all this to me all of a sudden?

104
00:09:46,346 --> 00:09:53,826
I just feel that my body is somewhat weak.

105
00:09:54,866 --> 00:10:00,006
All the more reason you should take good care of your health.

106
00:10:02,006 --> 00:10:03,706
I will.

107
00:10:07,835 --> 00:10:09,306
   

108
00:10:09,306 --> 00:10:10,724
My honored subordinates,

109
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:14,905
if you have nothing else to report, we should call it a day.

110
00:10:15,845 --> 00:10:18,586
I have something to report, Your Majesty.

111
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:21,605
I want to accuse Prince Regent of amassing military power

112
00:10:21,605 --> 00:10:24,026
and disrespecting the monarch.

113
00:10:24,026 --> 00:10:27,105
Your Majesty, I have something to report, too.

114
00:10:27,105 --> 00:10:30,745
I want to accuse Prince Regent of launching carnage

115
00:10:30,745 --> 00:10:33,705
and abducting lady folks.

116
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,345
I have something to report, Your Majesty.

117
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:39,605
I want to accuse Prince Regent of embezzling military funds.

118
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,564
I have something to report, Your Majesty.

119
00:10:41,565 --> 00:10:44,346
I have something to report, Your Majesty.

120
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,666
Something's looming over.

121
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:02,986
Did she bring an umbrella?

122
00:11:06,286 --> 00:11:10,466
Amassed military power, deployed army without permission,

123
00:11:10,466 --> 00:11:15,285
launched carnage, pillaged people and military funds,

124
00:11:15,286 --> 00:11:18,446
defied the monarch, and plotted a treason.

125
00:11:19,406 --> 00:11:21,545
Prince Regent,

126
00:11:21,545 --> 00:11:24,125
very well done.

127
00:11:31,085 --> 00:11:32,084
Your Majesty,

128
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:35,444
the seven condemnations are merely an allegation.

129
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:39,844
They presented the evidence; however, their accusations are conflicting and flawed.

130
00:11:39,844 --> 00:11:41,365
Please investigate this thoroughly, Your Majesty.

131
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:43,806
Please uphold justice for Prince Regent.

132
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:47,926
I have something to report, Your Majesty.

133
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:58,465
I'm presenting the entrance record of the palace gate on the day of the late emperor's death.

134
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:01,684
Before the late emperor's passing,

135
00:12:01,685 --> 00:12:04,484
Prince Regent sought an audience with the Grand Dowager Empress

136
00:12:04,485 --> 00:12:07,406
and he deployed the army without permission.

137
00:12:07,406 --> 00:12:10,425
Afterward, someone falsified the entrance record.

138
00:12:10,425 --> 00:12:14,765
This is blatant proof of Prince Regent's sinister intention.

139
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:18,150
I'm afraid the truth behind the late emperor's death

140
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,440
has something to do with him, too.

141
00:12:21,445 --> 00:12:25,065
I've spared no effort to obtain this record.

142
00:12:25,065 --> 00:12:28,564
Thanks to my nephew, the chief commander of the imperial guards.

143
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:32,906
He is scrupulous enough and is able to bring the truth to light.

144
00:12:33,526 --> 00:12:37,724
Your Majesty, Prince Regent's action is very likely to be treason.

145
00:12:37,725 --> 00:12:42,266
- Please punish him heavily, Your Majesty. 
  - Please punish him heavily, Your Majesty. 

146
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:45,604
Your Majesty, Prince Regent is loyal to the country.

147
00:12:45,605 --> 00:12:48,006
He'd never commit to such a heinous conduct.

148
00:12:48,006 --> 00:12:52,804
I suggest we should find the person who falsified the entrance record of the palace gate.

149
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:57,384
I fear someone's causing trouble because that's their ulterior motive.

150
00:12:57,384 --> 00:12:59,285
Official Mu,

151
00:12:59,285 --> 00:13:02,464
everyone knows the relationship between Prince Regent and you.

152
00:13:02,464 --> 00:13:04,564
Needless to say, you defend him.

153
00:13:04,565 --> 00:13:07,365
However, we have the conclusive proof here.

154
00:13:07,365 --> 00:13:11,925
Why would Prince Regent falsify the entrance record if he had done nothing wrong?

155
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:17,085
And why is only his name removed from the falsified record?

156
00:13:17,085 --> 00:13:19,606
- Your Majesty... 
 - Enough!

157
00:13:20,845 --> 00:13:24,565
 Please simmer down, Your Majesty. 

158
00:13:24,565 --> 00:13:29,126
Prince Regent is sacrilegious and shall not be forgiven.

159
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:34,345
Have the imperial guards imprison him for interrogation.

160
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,204
- Court adjourned. 
 - Your Majesty!

161
00:13:38,204 --> 00:13:39,825
Your Majesty!

162
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,285
Who let you in?

163
00:14:09,286 --> 00:14:10,844
This is the Prince Regent's residence.

164
00:14:10,845 --> 00:14:13,084
We know exactly where we are.

165
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:17,985
Under the imperial edict, we're here to arrest the traitor, Liu Yan.

166
00:14:17,985 --> 00:14:19,906
Who do you call a traitor?

167
00:14:20,886 --> 00:14:23,065
- Prince Regent, for sure. 
 - How dare you?

168
00:14:23,065 --> 00:14:24,566
Stop.

169
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,830
   

170
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,926
Greetings, Prince Regent.

171
00:14:36,485 --> 00:14:40,684
Prince Regent committed a heinous crime.

172
00:14:40,685 --> 00:14:46,905
Under the imperial edict, we'll incarcerate you in the dungeon until a verdict is delivered.

173
00:14:46,905 --> 00:14:49,765
My Lord, you can't go with them.

174
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:53,284
Your Lordship, this is an imperial edict.

175
00:14:53,284 --> 00:14:56,466
Do you want to defy it?

176
00:14:56,466 --> 00:15:01,286
I'm afraid things could turn ugly for you if our hands are forced.

177
00:15:01,286 --> 00:15:05,885
Since this is an imperial edict, I'll obey it.

178
00:15:05,886 --> 00:15:07,684
- No, My Lord. 
 - No, My Lord.

179
00:15:07,684 --> 00:15:10,946
Please, Your Lordship.

180
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,145
My Lord.

181
00:15:23,485 --> 00:15:24,559
Where's His Lordship?

182
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,526
He was taken to the Court of Judicial Review by the imperial guards.

183
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:29,964
I would've fought them if His Lordship didn't stop me.

184
00:15:29,965 --> 00:15:31,245
His Lordship was right.

185
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:33,965
At this pivotal moment, we must remain composed.

186
00:15:33,965 --> 00:15:35,885
But His Lordship is under arrest now.

187
00:15:35,886 --> 00:15:38,226
This is a humiliation.

188
00:15:38,226 --> 00:15:41,705
We must help His Lordship clear his name.

189
00:16:02,766 --> 00:16:04,466
Grandaunt,

190
00:16:05,325 --> 00:16:07,425
look.

191
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:12,286
Something is looming over Southern Chen, finally.

192
00:16:12,286 --> 00:16:13,786
Jiaojiao.

193
00:16:15,085 --> 00:16:19,066
You can still turn back before it's too late.

194
00:16:25,286 --> 00:16:27,506
Do you say this because you care for me?

195
00:16:27,506 --> 00:16:30,006
Why don't you give me the Evil-erasing Sword?

196
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:37,005
With its help, no one will be in my way.

197
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,126
It's fine.

198
00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:04,746
Grandaunt,

199
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:10,185
you're my dearest family in this world.

200
00:17:10,886 --> 00:17:12,926
I won't hurt you.

201
00:17:13,886 --> 00:17:19,406
I'll have ways and means to forge my way to the throne...

202
00:17:20,245 --> 00:17:22,706
even without the Evil-erasing Sword.

203
00:17:28,826 --> 00:17:30,526
Your Majesty,

204
00:17:30,526 --> 00:17:35,084
each and every accusation against Lord Ding has been supported by conclusive evidence.

205
00:17:35,084 --> 00:17:39,484
In my humble opinion, he should be stripped of his title as the Prince Regent

206
00:17:39,484 --> 00:17:41,706
and demoted to a commoner.

207
00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:45,525
Your Majesty.

208
00:17:45,525 --> 00:17:48,166
I disagree with Minister Zhou.

209
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:52,586
Lord Ding owned the military troops and intended to rebel.

210
00:17:52,586 --> 00:17:58,205
He must be punished severely so as to convince the people.

211
00:17:58,205 --> 00:17:59,726
I second that.

212
00:17:59,726 --> 00:18:02,846
 We second that. 

213
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:10,386
Never let your guard down till the last minute.

214
00:18:10,386 --> 00:18:11,945
 Precisely, Your Highness. 

215
00:18:11,945 --> 00:18:14,105
 Rightfully so, Your Highness. 

216
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:31,625
Send these to the Court of Judicial Review and see how Liu Yan will respond.

217
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,025
Yes.

218
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,206
Take them back.

219
00:18:47,366 --> 00:18:50,366
If His Majesty has already made assumptions,

220
00:18:50,366 --> 00:18:53,926
my defense is futile.

221
00:18:55,326 --> 00:18:56,484
Your Majesty,

222
00:18:56,485 --> 00:18:59,906
Prince Regent responded that his defense would be futile.

223
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:03,745
It's better to remain silent.

224
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:07,926
How insolent!

225
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:15,026
Does he still regard me as the emperor?

226
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,505
Who are you?

227
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:37,951
    
 I'm Mu Zhuohua from the Ministry of Revenue.

228
00:19:37,951 --> 00:19:39,725
Who do you come here for, Ms. Mu?

229
00:19:39,725 --> 00:19:41,325
Prince Regent.

230
00:19:41,326 --> 00:19:42,964
Do you have the imperial edict?

231
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:44,465
I...

232
00:19:46,606 --> 00:19:48,545
According to His Majesty, Prince Regent is a felon,

233
00:19:48,545 --> 00:19:50,626
and no visit is allowed without permission.

234
00:20:00,035 --> 00:20:04,834
   

235
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:08,480
   

236
00:20:10,185 --> 00:20:12,185
- Chief Eunuch. 
 - Ms. Mu.

237
00:20:12,185 --> 00:20:15,865
Chief Eunuch, did His Majesty summon me?

238
00:20:15,865 --> 00:20:18,805
Ms. Mu, please leave.

239
00:20:18,806 --> 00:20:22,005
His Majesty has been preoccupied with state affairs and isn't able to sleep well at night.

240
00:20:22,005 --> 00:20:25,984
He finally got to have some rest now. So, please leave.

241
00:20:55,846 --> 00:20:57,546
Mu Zhuohua,

242
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,265
how dare you...

243
00:21:01,285 --> 00:21:03,826
frame my sister?

244
00:21:05,926 --> 00:21:09,885
Your Majesty, I'm telling the truth.

245
00:21:09,886 --> 00:21:15,245
You claim Princess Roujia orchestrated a plot against the Grand Dowager Empress,

246
00:21:15,245 --> 00:21:19,466
slandered Prince Regent, and intended to initiate a rebellion.

247
00:21:19,485 --> 00:21:21,684
Prove your claim.

248
00:21:21,685 --> 00:21:23,185
I...

249
00:21:24,026 --> 00:21:25,906
If you don't have evidence,

250
00:21:27,126 --> 00:21:30,526
how can I believe your words without the support of proof?

251
00:21:56,045 --> 00:22:01,285
Ms. Mu, you're talented and your comments are on point.

252
00:22:01,926 --> 00:22:06,305
But you used the wrong way, and you're too naive.

253
00:22:06,305 --> 00:22:08,585
No wonder His Majesty doesn't believe you.

254
00:22:13,285 --> 00:22:18,945
Official Shen, it seems that you're going to stick to your choice to the end.

255
00:22:30,686 --> 00:22:32,645
 "Because Liu Yan, the Prince Regent, 
   

256
00:22:32,646 --> 00:22:36,125
disdained the natural law and went against reason.

257
00:22:36,126 --> 00:22:39,464
He killed the late emperor with a toxic liquor, intending to usurp the throne.

258
00:22:39,464 --> 00:22:43,466
His vicious sin is beyond belief

259
00:22:43,525 --> 00:22:46,025
and laid bare to the public."

260
00:22:46,025 --> 00:22:50,044
- This... 
 - Isn't Prince Regent revered as a valiant general

261
00:22:50,045 --> 00:22:51,724
for having fought against the Northern Liang for years?

262
00:22:51,725 --> 00:22:53,244
He should be a worthy general.

263
00:22:53,245 --> 00:22:54,645
 That's right. 

264
00:22:56,485 --> 00:22:58,244
His reputation has surpassed the emperor.

265
00:22:58,245 --> 00:23:01,125
That's why the emperor is less influential than him.

266
00:23:01,126 --> 00:23:03,845
Your Highness, the words have been spread.

267
00:23:04,345 --> 00:23:08,846
As the rumor makes the rounds, it can kill him wherever it spreads.

268
00:23:10,965 --> 00:23:15,065
Uncle, you will never be able to turn over again.

269
00:23:15,525 --> 00:23:17,306
I've been thinking about this.

270
00:23:17,306 --> 00:23:21,866
As of now, the Evil-erasing Sword, possessed by Border Defender Princess,

271
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:24,284
is the sole chance for His Lordship.

272
00:23:24,285 --> 00:23:27,245
You plan to make use of that?

273
00:23:28,886 --> 00:23:32,365
But we know that Border Defender Princess

274
00:23:32,366 --> 00:23:34,866
has been staying in the mansion of Princess Roujia.

275
00:23:34,866 --> 00:23:39,645
If Border Defender Princess doesn't leave the mansion,

276
00:23:39,645 --> 00:23:41,966
our hands are tied.

277
00:23:43,485 --> 00:23:45,406
True.

278
00:23:45,406 --> 00:23:48,966
I have an idea to discuss with you.

279
00:24:00,765 --> 00:24:02,405
Let's go and check it out.

280
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,300
- Where's he? 
 - I saw a moving shadow.

281
00:24:09,345 --> 00:24:11,265
I'll report this to Her Highness.

282
00:24:17,285 --> 00:24:22,026
Five carriages leave the mansion simultaneously and drive in different directions.

283
00:24:23,406 --> 00:24:25,926
What a brilliant camouflage.

284
00:24:27,245 --> 00:24:29,266
I'm to blame.

285
00:24:29,266 --> 00:24:30,926
Don't blame yourself.

286
00:24:30,926 --> 00:24:35,245
The Princess's residence is heavily guarded and there's no way we can break into it.

287
00:24:35,245 --> 00:24:37,805
That's why we make use of her suspicious character

288
00:24:37,806 --> 00:24:42,545
so that she will move both Border Defender Princess and Evil-erasing Sword to somewhere else.

289
00:24:44,445 --> 00:24:46,166
Jishan Hall.

290
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:48,565
 Your guess was right, Your Highness. 

291
00:24:48,566 --> 00:24:53,725
Lord Ding is a fallen enemy now, and he poses no threats to us anymore.

292
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:55,244
Official Zhou,

293
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:57,185
are you satisfied with this already?

294
00:24:58,005 --> 00:25:00,185
Are you suggesting that...

295
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:04,726
Liu Chen has yet to determine whether or not to kill Liu Yan.

296
00:25:04,726 --> 00:25:08,766
Besides, someone is trying to save Liu Yan.

297
00:25:08,766 --> 00:25:13,185
We mustn't let our guard down till the last minute.

298
00:25:13,986 --> 00:25:16,866
Do you have any thoughts on this, Your Highness?

299
00:25:16,866 --> 00:25:20,245
Liu Yan has been kept away from the army for five years.

300
00:25:20,245 --> 00:25:25,084
However, the remnants of the Cangwu Army are still at his beck and call.

301
00:25:27,865 --> 00:25:29,904
They're like a double-edged sword.

302
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:33,805
They can serve him and destroy him.

303
00:25:37,445 --> 00:25:40,905
Let's charge into the capital to rescue His Lordship!

304
00:25:44,406 --> 00:25:48,145
Let's charge into the capital to rescue His Lordship!

305
00:26:14,566 --> 00:26:26,666
 Charge into the capital to rescue His Lordship! 

306
00:26:26,666 --> 00:26:30,566
   

307
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:42,167
 Lord Ding is innocent! Release Lord Ding! 

308
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,498
They're besieging the city gate.

309
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:50,506
This is outrageous!

310
00:26:51,765 --> 00:26:53,565
Your Majesty.

311
00:26:53,565 --> 00:26:56,466
Apparently, they're starting a riot.

312
00:26:56,466 --> 00:27:00,726
"Let's charge into the capital to rescue Liu Yan!"

313
00:27:00,726 --> 00:27:03,285
Are they trying to rebel?

314
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:12,426
Your Majesty, please allow me to speak.

315
00:27:13,945 --> 00:27:15,545
Go on.

316
00:27:23,445 --> 00:27:26,525
Your Majesty, with all due respect,

317
00:27:26,525 --> 00:27:29,284
it's imperative to pacify the rioting army

318
00:27:29,285 --> 00:27:33,704
to prevent more serious consequences instead of calling them to account.

319
00:27:34,665 --> 00:27:37,045
Do you have any suggestions, Official Shen?

320
00:27:37,045 --> 00:27:41,945
Currently, only one person can tackle the roots of the problem.

321
00:27:43,326 --> 00:27:45,226
Who?

322
00:27:45,226 --> 00:27:47,166
Prince Regent.

323
00:28:26,865 --> 00:28:29,165
You're truly exceptional, Your Lordship.

324
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:33,525
You remain collected even though you're in the dungeon.

325
00:28:34,405 --> 00:28:41,044
Surprisingly, you're my first visitor, Official Shen.

326
00:28:41,045 --> 00:28:43,725
Aren't you startled

327
00:28:43,725 --> 00:28:45,665
or curious about this?

328
00:28:48,066 --> 00:28:54,525
Judging by that tone, it seems that you know something.

329
00:28:55,685 --> 00:28:57,485
Surely, you jest.

330
00:29:01,646 --> 00:29:05,945
Official Shen, you came all the way here to visit me.

331
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:09,505
You did not come for an idle talk, did you?

332
00:29:09,505 --> 00:29:13,225
Please get straight to the point.

333
00:29:13,225 --> 00:29:18,386
The Cangwu Army from the Barracks of the Capital Region has gathered at the city gate

334
00:29:18,386 --> 00:29:21,524
and intends to break through it after learning of your imprisonment.

335
00:29:21,524 --> 00:29:24,425
They want to charge into the capital to rescue you.

336
00:29:26,485 --> 00:29:29,185
They wouldn't start this without a reason.

337
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:32,725
Someone must be helping to cook this up.

338
00:29:36,266 --> 00:29:40,066
Official Shen, do you know who it is?

339
00:29:46,806 --> 00:29:51,766
I implore you to pacify the soldiers and quell the brewing mutiny.

340
00:29:55,746 --> 00:29:58,946
Your Lordship, there's no time for delay.

341
00:29:58,946 --> 00:30:03,026
If this keeps going on, both sides will suffer losses.

342
00:30:03,026 --> 00:30:06,886
I suppose you wouldn't want that to happen. Right?

343
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:14,586
Did His Majesty send you here?

344
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:17,046
Yes.

345
00:30:18,145 --> 00:30:21,085
Why doesn't he meet me in person?

346
00:30:29,126 --> 00:30:33,345
Everyone hates me

347
00:30:33,345 --> 00:30:37,346
and misunderstands me, I don't care.

348
00:30:37,346 --> 00:30:43,266
But I didn't expect that my nephew, whom I watched grow up,

349
00:30:45,086 --> 00:30:48,406
would become estranged from me.

350
00:30:53,045 --> 00:30:54,545
Your Lordship.

351
00:31:08,606 --> 00:31:10,786
I, Liu Yan, the sinner,

352
00:31:11,685 --> 00:31:13,385
accept the edict.

353
00:31:15,285 --> 00:31:25,866
 Lord Ding is innocent! Release Lord Ding! 

354
00:31:25,866 --> 00:31:36,284
 Lord Ding is innocent! 

355
00:31:36,284 --> 00:31:48,905
 Lord Ding is innocent! 

356
00:31:48,905 --> 00:32:04,644
 Lord Ding is innocent! 

357
00:32:04,646 --> 00:32:08,424
 Lord Ding is innocent! 

358
00:32:08,424 --> 00:32:11,064
   
 Lord Ding is innocent! 

359
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:21,406
Attention!

360
00:32:24,226 --> 00:32:26,026
Sheathe your swords!

361
00:32:36,786 --> 00:32:39,026
What do you think you're doing?

362
00:32:41,366 --> 00:32:43,986
Are you trying to suppress the emperor

363
00:32:43,986 --> 00:32:46,166
or start a rebellion?

364
00:32:47,126 --> 00:32:50,085
Are you aware of your identity?

365
00:32:51,306 --> 00:32:55,546
Are you invaders or traitors?

366
00:32:56,245 --> 00:32:58,985
Do you know your duties?

367
00:32:59,826 --> 00:33:01,665
To defend the capital...

368
00:33:02,786 --> 00:33:05,126
or to start internal strife?

369
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:25,665
I know you want to save me.

370
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:33,800
But you're the soldiers of Southern Chen, not mine.

371
00:33:33,826 --> 00:33:38,866
It's the people of Southern Chen who provide for you,

372
00:33:38,866 --> 00:33:40,765
not me.

373
00:33:41,865 --> 00:33:46,785
You should fight for Southern Chen and for the people.

374
00:33:46,785 --> 00:33:49,525
Not for me.

375
00:33:49,525 --> 00:33:52,320
And never break faith with the imperial court for me!

376
00:33:53,685 --> 00:33:55,585
If you disband,

377
00:33:56,746 --> 00:33:59,225
Northern Chen will suffer in chaos.

378
00:34:01,366 --> 00:34:05,045
You're not the private army of Liu Yan.

379
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:07,806
You're the army of the emperor

380
00:34:07,806 --> 00:34:10,525
and Southern Chen.

381
00:34:10,525 --> 00:34:13,926
Bear this in mind!

382
00:34:30,246 --> 00:34:32,346
As for me...

383
00:34:34,085 --> 00:34:36,426
I'm not worth your sacrifice.

384
00:34:38,545 --> 00:34:40,726
I'm sinful...

385
00:34:41,445 --> 00:34:43,645
and I should be executed.

386
00:34:44,645 --> 00:34:49,746
But now, you've become sinful

387
00:34:49,746 --> 00:34:52,226
as you defy the imperial edict.

388
00:34:52,226 --> 00:34:54,526
Not only are you sinful,

389
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:57,686
but your families will be impacted as well.

390
00:35:06,626 --> 00:35:11,346
If you still appreciate me,

391
00:35:12,545 --> 00:35:15,205
please safeguard the nation...

392
00:35:17,626 --> 00:35:20,626
for the sake of Southern Chen.

393
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:29,940
   

394
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,560
   

395
00:36:09,926 --> 00:36:12,686
Is there anything else, Official Shen?

396
00:36:13,445 --> 00:36:16,186
On behalf of the people of Southern Chen,

397
00:36:16,186 --> 00:36:18,186
I appreciate your effort.

398
00:36:19,985 --> 00:36:21,785
Hearing this...

399
00:36:23,186 --> 00:36:29,306
from a jackal is indeed ludicrous.

400
00:36:31,985 --> 00:36:34,285
Whether you believe it or not,

401
00:36:35,505 --> 00:36:37,665
I've always admired you.

402
00:36:37,665 --> 00:36:43,466
But a mild policy isn't effective for the nation currently.

403
00:36:43,466 --> 00:36:47,645
Do the ruthless methods by you and Roujia

404
00:36:47,645 --> 00:36:49,866
suit the nation better?

405
00:36:49,866 --> 00:36:54,826
At least, the power of the noble families has been weakened.

406
00:36:55,766 --> 00:36:57,806
Are you sure?

407
00:36:57,806 --> 00:37:02,606
Zhou Cishan still holds the position of Minister of War,

408
00:37:03,366 --> 00:37:05,845
and a bunch of officials originating from the Zhou family

409
00:37:05,846 --> 00:37:11,106
are doing well in the imperial court, no?

410
00:37:12,806 --> 00:37:14,906
But she's different from the late emperor

411
00:37:14,906 --> 00:37:17,465
and His Majesty.

412
00:37:17,465 --> 00:37:22,565
It's just that we still need help from Zhou Cishan. She gave me her word.

413
00:37:22,565 --> 00:37:26,306
She will get rid of those noble families eventually.

414
00:37:26,306 --> 00:37:28,225
Official Shen,

415
00:37:29,406 --> 00:37:34,065
don't you find what you said hilarious?

416
00:37:34,065 --> 00:37:35,305
We are doing the same thing.

417
00:37:35,305 --> 00:37:39,226
You see yourself as patient and restrained when you do it.

418
00:37:39,226 --> 00:37:43,686
But you see others mediocre and slow when others do it.

419
00:37:47,406 --> 00:37:49,686
What shakes your will?

420
00:37:50,545 --> 00:37:53,186
Are you deluding yourself?

421
00:37:53,186 --> 00:37:57,605
Is this vulnerable nation...

422
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:01,226
what you want?

423
00:38:10,266 --> 00:38:15,186
Is it you can't answer this, or you dare not?

424
00:38:20,285 --> 00:38:21,564
   

425
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:22,644
 Your Majesty, 

426
00:38:22,645 --> 00:38:24,004
 regarding the mutiny, 

427
00:38:24,005 --> 00:38:27,505
Prince Regent has already put an end to it.

428
00:38:29,286 --> 00:38:30,686
Your Majesty,

429
00:38:30,686 --> 00:38:32,626
in my humble opinion,

430
00:38:32,626 --> 00:38:38,865
Prince Regent should take the credit for quelling the mutiny.

431
00:38:43,226 --> 00:38:44,845
I second that.

432
00:38:44,846 --> 00:38:46,145
Your Majesty,

433
00:38:46,145 --> 00:38:51,185
Prince Regent pacified the soldiers, which shows his loyalty to you.

434
00:38:51,185 --> 00:38:56,365
Prince Regent used to fight for the nation and is left with injuries.

435
00:38:56,365 --> 00:38:59,604
The dungeon of the Court of Judicial Review is damp and cold.

436
00:38:59,605 --> 00:39:05,365
I'm afraid it will worsen his physical condition.

437
00:39:05,965 --> 00:39:07,665
Your Majesty,

438
00:39:07,665 --> 00:39:13,466
I realized Prince Regent had a pale complexion when I visited him.

439
00:39:15,965 --> 00:39:17,825
In that case,

440
00:39:18,686 --> 00:39:20,646
let him...

441
00:39:20,646 --> 00:39:26,626
Your Majesty, Prince Regent is the cause of the mutiny in front of the city gate.

442
00:39:26,645 --> 00:39:32,544
All the soldiers obeyed him and stopped the riot as soon as he came to the city tower.

443
00:39:32,544 --> 00:39:38,185
Isn't that solid proof of his malicious influence?

444
00:39:39,366 --> 00:39:45,805
To the soldiers, they prefer Prince Regent over you, Your Majesty.

445
00:39:47,525 --> 00:39:49,505
How dare he?

446
00:39:49,505 --> 00:39:54,506
How dare he! How bold of him!

447
00:39:54,506 --> 00:39:56,265
Your Majesty.

448
00:39:56,265 --> 00:40:00,805
Official Zhou is misleading you.

449
00:40:01,286 --> 00:40:03,066
He has been training the troops.

450
00:40:03,066 --> 00:40:06,246
But who does the military serve?

451
00:40:06,246 --> 00:40:08,066
Answer me!

452
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:15,325
Your Majesty,

453
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:19,086
how will you deal with Prince Regent?

454
00:40:39,343 --> 00:40:43,603
After all, he contributed to the country.

455
00:40:46,726 --> 00:40:48,826
Give him the poisonous liquor.

456
00:40:51,485 --> 00:40:54,484
I'll grant him a quick death.

457
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:59,366
- Your Majesty... 
  - This is a wise decision, Your Majesty. 

458
00:41:13,746 --> 00:41:16,144
- Careful, it's hot. 
 - All right.

459
00:41:21,886 --> 00:41:23,386
Chen'er.

460
00:41:31,085 --> 00:41:32,785
Get up.

461
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:42,004
Chen'er,

462
00:41:42,005 --> 00:41:45,086
you look terrible.

463
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:46,604
Are you feeling unwell?

464
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:48,526
Don't worry, Mother.

465
00:41:48,526 --> 00:41:50,245
I'm all right.

466
00:41:51,165 --> 00:41:54,865
I came here for your congee.

467
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:59,285
Sure, you can have it. I'll prepare it for you now.

468
00:42:11,826 --> 00:42:14,106
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

469
00:42:16,065 --> 00:42:17,765
Sister,

470
00:42:18,945 --> 00:42:20,885
just now, I...

471
00:42:21,786 --> 00:42:23,966
I gave him the poisonous liquor.

472
00:42:25,366 --> 00:42:26,966
Who?

473
00:42:27,525 --> 00:42:29,325
Uncle.

474
00:42:35,485 --> 00:42:37,185
Your Majesty,

475
00:42:38,165 --> 00:42:40,046
why did you do that?

476
00:42:40,645 --> 00:42:42,686
I didn't mean to.

477
00:42:44,006 --> 00:42:45,506
But...

478
00:42:47,286 --> 00:42:49,626
I had no choice.

479
00:42:59,325 --> 00:43:01,305
Jiao, you...

480
00:43:02,905 --> 00:43:05,226
After all, he's our uncle.

481
00:43:06,545 --> 00:43:09,606
I'd like to bid him the last farewell.

482
00:43:09,606 --> 00:43:11,845
Please grant my wish, Your Majesty.

483
00:43:12,765 --> 00:43:14,565
Go ahead.

484
00:43:16,405 --> 00:43:19,165
Please bid Uncle the last farewell

485
00:43:19,165 --> 00:43:21,646
on my behalf.

486
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:37,050


487
00:43:40,714 --> 00:43:48,173
♫  I can't forget the love that is still is nipping at my ears and temples  ♫

488
00:43:48,173 --> 00:43:55,473
♫  Memories keep slamming into rocks and have nowhere to berth  ♫

489
00:43:55,473 --> 00:44:02,813
♫  Both sides gaze at each other in the drizzling rain, but one has turned into clouds and mist  ♫

490
00:44:02,813 --> 00:44:11,433
♫  Leaving the isolated heart's island, like waves without a shore  ♫

491
00:44:11,433 --> 00:44:15,173
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

492
00:44:15,173 --> 00:44:18,833
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

493
00:44:18,833 --> 00:44:22,753
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

494
00:44:22,753 --> 00:44:26,134
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

495
00:44:26,134 --> 00:44:29,753
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

496
00:44:29,754 --> 00:44:33,473
♫  Obviously willing to swear life and death 
 to be entangled for a lifetime  ♫

497
00:44:33,474 --> 00:44:37,773
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

498
00:44:37,773 --> 00:44:44,074
♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

499
00:44:57,174 --> 00:45:04,573
♫  I can't forget the turmoil of love and hate, 
 even if the next day is far away  ♫

500
00:45:04,573 --> 00:45:13,033
♫  Two souls embrace in chaos, how can it be written off?  ♫

501
00:45:13,033 --> 00:45:16,913
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

502
00:45:16,913 --> 00:45:20,553
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

503
00:45:20,553 --> 00:45:24,633
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

504
00:45:24,633 --> 00:45:27,973
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

505
00:45:27,973 --> 00:45:31,573
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

506
00:45:31,573 --> 00:45:35,253
♫  Obviously can't be erased, and haunted by lingering dreams  ♫

507
00:45:35,253 --> 00:45:39,333
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

508
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:46,914
♫  Want to have one more glimpse of you, 
 even just for a second more  ♫
