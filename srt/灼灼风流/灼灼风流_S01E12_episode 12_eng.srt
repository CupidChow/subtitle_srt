1
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:25,160


2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,459
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:35,080
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:47,879
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,159
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,259
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,379
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:08,579
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,679
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:18,639
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

12
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:24,000
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,239
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:36,918
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,019
   

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,959
   

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,939
   

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
   

19
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,909
My Lord, the First Prince and the Third Prince are fighting at Zhixing College.

20
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,910
Please go and mediate.

21
00:01:56,231 --> 00:01:57,990
How long has this been going on?

22
00:01:57,991 --> 00:01:59,430
About twenty minutes.

23
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:02,771
Zhixing College is probably going to be torn apart by these two princes.

24
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,309
Who is giving the lecture to the princes today?

25
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,010
It's Mu Zhuohua.

26
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:12,510
Grandmother, she really has nothing to do with this. 
    

27
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:16,591
As a civil official, how could she stop us if we wanted to fight?

28
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:18,290
Chen'er.

29
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,990
Please calm down, Grandmother.

30
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,131
We have to thank Miss Mu for today.

31
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:29,510
She may not be a physician.

32
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:31,149
But her heart is full of compassion for the world.

33
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,350
If it weren't for her unconventional methods in helping the First Prince stop the bleeding,

34
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,611
the consequences would have been more dire.

35
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,290
He's right, Grandmother.

36
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,010
At that time, the First Prince was bleeding profusely.

37
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,589
Not at all.

38
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,869
Grandmother, my injuries may appear grim.

39
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,750
But it is not that serious.

40
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:57,411
Using unconventional methods to stop the First Prince's bleeding?

41
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:00,869
The entire court knows of her romantic affairs.

42
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,930
She has such improper behaviors.

43
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,411
You shouldn't let her sweet words deceive you.

44
00:03:07,411 --> 00:03:13,050
Forgive me, Empress Dowager. I was incompetent to stop the princes in time.

45
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,951
I'm willing to accept any punishment.

46
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:18,649
It's just that those rumors about my romantic affairs are completely fabricated.

47
00:03:18,649 --> 00:03:22,030
I would never dare to deceive the two princes.

48
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,869
Empress Dowager, please judge this fairly.

49
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,590
Chen'er and Jin'er may have disagreements.

50
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,411
But they had never resorted to violence.

51
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:36,791
Yet, they got into a real fight because of jealousy in your lecture!

52
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:43,051
As a woman, you frequently visit the brothel.

53
00:03:43,051 --> 00:03:45,070
It's already lacking in virtue.

54
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:48,251
How dare you claim innocence!

55
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:49,970
Empress Dowager,

56
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:55,450
people generally consider brothels as disreputable.

57
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:00,971
But in reality, those places are temporary stops for helpless women.

58
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:04,570
How can we judge them so biased?

59
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,770
I sympathize with what they've gone through

60
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,971
and they also treat me sincerely.

61
00:04:10,971 --> 00:04:13,271
How's that lacking in virtue?

62
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:17,651
Sincerity, indeed.

63
00:04:18,511 --> 00:04:23,030
But in places of indulgence, how can it be sincere?

64
00:04:23,991 --> 00:04:30,070
Your association with people of questionable morals shows a lack of proper manners.

65
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,190
Though I dare not call myself virtuous,

66
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:36,070
I've been taught by wise teachings since childhood.

67
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,990
So, I have a clear conscience.

68
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,391
Stop trying to argue.

69
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:44,710
It's all right for you to have everything you need among the courtiers.

70
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,651
You dare to entertain such wicked thoughts about my grandsons.

71
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:58,130
Someone! Mu Zhuohua, editor of Hanlin Academy, lacks conduct

72
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,231
and seduced the princes.

73
00:05:00,231 --> 00:05:02,891
She shall be dismissed from her teaching position

74
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:06,410
and punished with twenty floggings as a warning to others!

75
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,810
Empress Dowager, I...

76
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,190
- Do it now! 
 - Empress Dowager!

77
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:11,310
- Grandmother! 
 - Empress Dowager, I accept the punishment.

78
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,730
But the crime is my inability to stop the princes' actions in time,

79
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,470
not a lack of moral character!

80
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:52,751
Stop right there!

81
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:55,930
Grandmother, she truly has nothing to do with this.

82
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,311
You must not falsely accuse her.

83
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,170
Grandmother, please calm down.

84
00:06:09,191 --> 00:06:12,651
Mr. Shen and Miss Mu are fellow colleagues.

85
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:15,890
Their close interactions are understandable.

86
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:19,810
About today's incident, Miss Mu has merit without fault.

87
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:27,369
Grondmother, my elder brother and I were only slightly injured and it's not life-threatening.

88
00:06:27,369 --> 00:06:29,631
Please spare her.

89
00:06:31,751 --> 00:06:34,490
Mu Zhuohua,

90
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,990
do you know what you've done wrong?

91
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:42,711
I... I admit my fault.

92
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:51,610
It was my fault for not stopping both princes' actions in time.

93
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,870
Besides that, I have a clear conscience.

94
00:06:54,871 --> 00:06:57,130
A clear conscience.

95
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,551
Give her a good beating!

96
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:03,431
Grandmother!

97
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:18,771
 Lord Ding has arrived! 

98
00:07:31,411 --> 00:07:33,149
Uncle, you're finally here.

99
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,331
Please plead with Grandmother to let Mu Zhuohua go.

100
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,960
   

101
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,011
Greetings, Your Majesty.

102
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:51,830
Yan'er, you're here.

103
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:58,751
What crime did Editor Mu commit to have angered you so much?

104
00:07:58,751 --> 00:08:01,430
Mu Zhuohua is supposed to be an exemplary teacher.

105
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:06,710
Yet, she neglected her moral conduct and incited the princes into fighting.

106
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,291
Her despicable actions are truly detestable.

107
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:14,510
After hearing what you said, Mu Zhuohua is indeed wicked.

108
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,710
A few floggings would be too lenient.

109
00:08:19,991 --> 00:08:25,091
In my opinion, she should be imprisoned and trialed by the Three Judicial Agencies.

110
00:08:25,091 --> 00:08:28,210
Then her crimes should be made known by everyone.

111
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,951
Uncle, we cannot do that.

112
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:40,851
If this gets out, it would tarnish the royal family's reputation.

113
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:45,610
Mu Zhuohua is a student of the emperor and a teacher of the princes,

114
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,991
as well as a court-appointed official.

115
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:50,150
She has committed such a grave offense.

116
00:08:50,151 --> 00:08:52,230
It is truly unforgivable.

117
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,390
She deserves severe punishment to appease the anger of the people.

118
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,471
Uncle, must you do this?

119
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:05,330
For just a person like Mu Zhuohua, there's no need to make such a fuss.

120
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,390
Since you say so,

121
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:15,551
with a benevolent heart like yours, why bother with her?

122
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:21,851
This is a strategic retreat, pleading for her.

123
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,371
 Princess Roujia has arrived! 

124
00:09:38,671 --> 00:09:42,591
Today's incident sure is dramatic.

125
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,330
Greetings, Grandmother.

126
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,311
Greetings, Uncle.

127
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,830
Are you also here to plead for Mu Zhuohua?

128
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:57,391
Grandmother, I'm here to visit you.

129
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:05,469
Grandmother, you know what my younger brothers are like.

130
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:09,130
When they start fighting, even I, as their older sister, can't stop them.

131
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:13,110
Let alone Editor Mu.

132
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,410
So calm down.

133
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:19,450
If you get sick from anger, the younger generations will feel very distressed.

134
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,030
Empress Dowager, please prioritize your health.

135
00:10:23,031 --> 00:10:24,910
Don't let this affect your health.

136
00:10:24,911 --> 00:10:26,751
That's right, Grandmother.

137
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,930
Please calm down.

138
00:10:29,951 --> 00:10:31,891
That's right, Grandmother.

139
00:10:31,891 --> 00:10:33,430
You have the most benevolent heart.

140
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:36,331
If she bleeds from the flogging, with a kind heart like yours,

141
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:39,310
you'll end up visiting Bodhisattva for days.

142
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:45,449
Now that my brothers are fine, please show some leniency and spare Editor Mu.

143
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,190
Inform Imperial Physician Zhao to go to the Mu Residence on Zhuque Street.

144
00:10:57,191 --> 00:10:58,469
Yes.

145
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:02,491
My Lord, these floggings hurt more than I had expected.

146
00:11:02,491 --> 00:11:06,989
 It looks like you can't escape from this complicated situation. 

147
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,890
Return to the residence.

148
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:14,570
   

149
00:11:17,391 --> 00:11:20,270
Empress Dowager, she was taken to Lord Ding's Residence.

150
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:22,391
Imperial Physician Zhao has gone there, too.

151
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:24,751
Lord Ding's Residence?

152
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:32,190
Grandmother, Uncle probably wants Editor Mu to receive treatment as soon as possible.

153
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:36,611
That's why he took her to his residence, which is nearer to the palace.

154
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:43,170
It seems our ambitious Lord Ding has truly revealed his human side this time.

155
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:48,431
Grandmother, how is this revealing his human side?

156
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:53,170
Allowing women to attend the imperial exam was Uncle's idea, to begin with.

157
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,910
She also ranked third and became a Tanhua.

158
00:11:55,911 --> 00:11:59,011
It's hard for him to ignore her.

159
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:02,151
You have a point.

160
00:12:02,151 --> 00:12:09,050
I see her as a woman before she's an official.

161
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:14,691
It's been many years since Southern Chen had appointed female officials.

162
00:12:17,085 --> 00:12:19,509
   

163
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,310
Go and tidy up the courtyard.

164
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:22,711
Yes, sir.

165
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:29,850
In Lord Ding's Residence, even the fish is male.

166
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,510
It truly lacks vitality.

167
00:12:34,951 --> 00:12:36,790
What happened to this young lady? How did she get so severely injured?

168
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,190
Prepare hot water, towels, and gauze.

169
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,109
Should we get Madam Li from the kitchen to come over?

170
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,410
Yes.

171
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:55,170
My Lord, how could you carry a young lady to the front courtyard of your residence?

172
00:12:56,671 --> 00:13:00,350
I should get things prepared for that matter.

173
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,610
My Lord.

174
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:10,509
How is she?

175
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,071
My Lord, Official Mu has a fit body.

176
00:13:13,071 --> 00:13:15,070
She may have a fever, but it's nothing serious.

177
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:20,770
She only needs cold compresses to reduce her temperature.

178
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,150
- Thank you, Imperial Physician Zhao. 
 - You're welcome.

179
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,930
I shall take my leave now.

180
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,510
Zhimo, walk him to the door.

181
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:34,130
My Lord, I did no wrong.

182
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,470
I won't admit it.

183
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:41,390
My Lord, it really hurts.

184
00:13:47,031 --> 00:13:49,331
Get some proper rest.

185
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:52,430
You won't be punished like this again.

186
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,310
May the various deities bless us.

187
00:13:57,311 --> 00:14:01,109
Bless His Lordship to have two children in three years and three children in five years.

188
00:14:01,109 --> 00:14:05,050
Regardless of gender, the more, the better.

189
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,390
Please bless His Lordship.

190
00:14:07,391 --> 00:14:10,330
Please bless His Lordship. Please bless him.

191
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,690
I ask for a blessing.

192
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:20,771
My Lord.

193
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,470
My Lord, is that young lady awake?

194
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,850
Not yet.

195
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,390
She's such a decent young lady.

196
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:32,830
So beautiful, like a flower.

197
00:14:33,951 --> 00:14:35,751
Like a flower?

198
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:37,891
Her?

199
00:14:37,891 --> 00:14:40,470
How much suffering she must have endured.

200
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:44,110
Without someone caring for her, how lonely she is.

201
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,331
She has a maidservant.

202
00:14:46,331 --> 00:14:48,251
You're always around, huh?

203
00:14:49,131 --> 00:14:53,150
My Lord, she has suffered such serious injuries.

204
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,510
She really needs proper care.

205
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,850
There's a lack of physicians and medicine outside.

206
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,870
What if something bad happens?

207
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:04,070
You see, you already brought her back.

208
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:07,911
If you send her away again, won't that be too heartless?

209
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:12,390
- Then she may stay. 
 - All right.

210
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:16,070
Then I'll ask the servants to clean the back courtyard

211
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:18,230
so you can stay in comfort.

212
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,690
Back courtyard?

213
00:15:21,271 --> 00:15:25,031
Imperial Physician Zhao told me that she must not be moved.

214
00:15:25,031 --> 00:15:28,831
Didn't you carry her into your room?

215
00:15:28,831 --> 00:15:30,591
Why don't you...

216
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,410
Just clean the place.

217
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,950
All right.

218
00:15:39,391 --> 00:15:41,191
Is there anything else?

219
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,229
My Lord,

220
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:48,530
seeing how badly injured this girl is and that she's in an unfamiliar place,

221
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:53,670
maybe we should send something to make her feel better.

222
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:59,251
When she wakes up, I'll personally go and visit her.

223
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:09,430
 His Lordship has finally come to his senses. 

224
00:16:10,031 --> 00:16:14,791
My Lord, our secret agent has reported that Northern Liang is sending an envoy to Southern Chen.

225
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:18,291
It seems your plan of luring the enemy out is working effectively.

226
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:25,069
Since that's the case, we should prepare in advance to welcome the Northern Liang delegation.

227
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:27,751
Why should we welcome the Northern Liang people?

228
00:16:28,851 --> 00:16:33,291
We must treat them with respect but also be cautious.

229
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,950
I understand.

230
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,349
I'll make preparations both inside and outside in advance

231
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,831
to ensure a proper welcome for Northern Liang's delegates.

232
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,510
My Lord...

233
00:16:43,311 --> 00:16:45,251
Is there anything you'd like to say?

234
00:16:45,891 --> 00:16:49,151
What do you think Butler Zhang is up to?

235
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,749
First, he made you stay in the backyard.

236
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,670
Then he made you send things to Miss Mu.

237
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:54,391
Now there's a big feast set up there.

238
00:16:54,391 --> 00:16:56,470
Is he trying to...

239
00:17:02,391 --> 00:17:04,931
 How much suffering she must have endured. 

240
00:17:04,931 --> 00:17:08,650
 Without someone caring for her, how lonely she is. 

241
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:13,410
Since you can't keep quiet, how about you run some errands for me?

242
00:17:14,131 --> 00:17:17,110
Go to Zhuque Street and bring her maidservant here.

243
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:20,311
My Lord, why not let Zhimo go instead?

244
00:17:20,311 --> 00:17:24,050
Whenever she sees me, it's like a rat running into a cat.

245
00:17:43,911 --> 00:17:45,711
Hello, Zhimo.

246
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:47,871
Oh, this is for you.

247
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:50,291
Miss Mu is injured.

248
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:56,410
Young Lady, are you all right?

249
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,710
Don't worry. I'll be fine after some recuperating.

250
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,991
I really thought something really bad had happened.

251
00:18:01,991 --> 00:18:05,251
Does it hurt, Young Lady?

252
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:08,411
- My Lord... 
 - Young Lady. Young Lady, don't move.

253
00:18:08,411 --> 00:18:10,191
Stay still.

254
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,590
Thank you for saving my life, My Lord.

255
00:18:23,351 --> 00:18:25,251
What's this?

256
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:29,029
A gift from the palace. Don't finish it too quickly.

257
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,910
Thank you.

258
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:37,950
Leave us.

259
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,351
Go.

260
00:18:52,011 --> 00:18:53,711
My Lord.

261
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:03,230
So, did today's flogging seem unfair?

262
00:19:07,911 --> 00:19:09,611
Yes.

263
00:19:09,611 --> 00:19:12,990
But it's not at the same time.

264
00:19:13,931 --> 00:19:15,970
The matter may happen suddenly.

265
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,709
But after giving it careful thought,

266
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:22,610
there were signs before the incident happened.

267
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:26,510
The Third Prince didn't seem like a studious person;

268
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,491
yet, he actively asked me about Northern Liang.

269
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:33,911
His intention was to bring up the war at Juma River.

270
00:19:33,911 --> 00:19:37,711
It's a thorn in the First Prince's flesh.

271
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:43,590
Then he and the Second Prince started playing the good and the bad person.

272
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,631
All just to provoke the First Prince.

273
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:50,431
With the First Prince's impulsiveness,

274
00:19:50,431 --> 00:19:53,990
he'd definitely fall for it when that happens.

275
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:59,630
Then he'll be labeled as aggressive and hot-tempered,

276
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,311
which damages his image as a future emperor.

277
00:20:02,311 --> 00:20:08,230
So, this was actually a premeditated power struggle.

278
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:21,911
But you seem to have a deep understanding of Chen'er.

279
00:20:23,731 --> 00:20:27,610
I think the First Prince has a rare innocent heart.

280
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:30,110
His emotions are written all over his face.

281
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,251
It's not hard to know.

282
00:20:35,351 --> 00:20:39,731
Sun Yunqian is Yu'er and Jin''ers cousin,

283
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:46,550
and Shen Jinghong has the ability to keep Chen'er in check.

284
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:55,450
So, a seemingly useless pawn like me

285
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:59,911
is like a pillow offered to them when they're napping.

286
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,870
This fight was truly an unwarranted calamity.

287
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,811
Truly unfair.

288
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,670
It hurts so bad.

289
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:14,510
Then, why do you also think that it's fair?

290
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:21,190
It's my carelessness that gave them the opportunity.

291
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,610
Be more cautious next time.

292
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,735
   

293
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,210
Greetings, Your Highness.

294
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,950
Looking at your apparel,

295
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:11,471
you didn't have the time to return to your residence after you finished teaching the princes. Right?

296
00:22:11,471 --> 00:22:14,170
I dare not delay when you summoned me.

297
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:17,671
I have a favor to ask of you.

298
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:23,110
What do you think about this pearl?

299
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:27,751
Elegant and luxurious.

300
00:22:27,751 --> 00:22:30,191
Comparable to your noble status.

301
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:34,631
What nobility do I have?

302
00:22:34,631 --> 00:22:37,510
It's merely due to my fortunate birth.

303
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,851
The quality of this pearl is good.

304
00:22:39,851 --> 00:22:42,351
But it is prone to turn yellow

305
00:22:42,351 --> 00:22:44,351
and not suitable for frequent wearing.

306
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:53,331
The jade bangle is flawless, crystal clear, and pure.

307
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:59,591
Though flawless, it's fragile.

308
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:10,830
That's how it is with precious materials like these.

309
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,930
Let's pick this one.

310
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:18,410
I also find these apricot blossoms quite unique.

311
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:22,110
If they're worn in your hair,

312
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,371
- they'll surely... 
 - You're wrong.

313
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:26,229
I intend to give it as a gift.

314
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,130
A gift?

315
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,851
What does it have to do with me?

316
00:23:30,851 --> 00:23:33,011
Naturally, it concerns you.

317
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:40,310
I need to trouble you to visit Lord Ding's Residence and deliver it to Zhuohua.

318
00:23:40,831 --> 00:23:45,650
I've already made Empress Dowager upset by going to Zhixing College.

319
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:50,051
I dare not go to Lord Ding's Residence and visit her now.

320
00:23:50,051 --> 00:23:52,270
So I can only trouble you.

321
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,690
But...

322
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:59,230
I may have a close bond with Editor Mu.

323
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,291
But we're only colleagues.

324
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,791
Why?

325
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:07,310
Can't you visit an injured colleague?

326
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,630
How are the preparations regarding the Northern Liang?

327
00:24:15,631 --> 00:24:17,531
Everything is ready.

328
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:26,509
Pay attention to any clues related to the hawk claw hook among the Northern Liang envoy.

329
00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:28,031
Yes, My Lord.

330
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:35,410
My Lord, how long do you plan to let Mu Zhuohua stay in the residence?

331
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,810
Why?

332
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,651
You don't want to see her here?

333
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:45,069
That was because you saw Mu Zhuohua get beaten to a pulp

334
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:47,729
and urgently wanted to provide her treatment by letting her stay here.

335
00:24:47,729 --> 00:24:50,110
For her, that's a great kindness.

336
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:54,251
I'm only concerned about the rumors.

337
00:24:57,591 --> 00:25:00,750
Why should I fear rumors?

338
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:06,151
Shen comes to visit Mu.

339
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:14,050
Didn't Mu Zhuohua keep insisting that there was nothing between Shen Jinghong and her?

340
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:18,409
Now, the only person daring to visit her at Lord Ding's Residence turns out to be Shen Jinghong.

341
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:23,309
My Lord, I fear you might be drawn into the gossip and rumors,

342
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:28,029
saying that you and the current Master Scholar are competing for the Tanhua.

343
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,290
His Lordship does know what I'm talking about.

344
00:25:32,985 --> 00:25:34,635
   

345
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:39,610
- "It seems to be the sound of melody in the air."  
  - Mr. Shen, Ms. Mu is recuperating here. 

346
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,451
Young Lady, someone is here with money.

347
00:25:42,451 --> 00:25:43,269
Calm down.

348
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:47,949
We are now people of status and can't sell poetry collections anymore.

349
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:56,190
Brother Shen, why are you here?

350
00:25:56,191 --> 00:25:58,390
Editor Mu, are you feeling better now?

351
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:01,011
Much better, thank you for asking.

352
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,650
Here.

353
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,050
Please take a seat.

354
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,530
Young Lady.

355
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:14,390
What's this?

356
00:26:14,391 --> 00:26:17,509
The First Prince entrusted me to bring you these precious medicinal herbs.

357
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:21,309
He's busy entertaining the Northern Liang envoy.

358
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,069
So he couldn't come and visit you personally.

359
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:26,551
By the way, he wants me to tell you that since you know medicine,

360
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:29,369
you should know what to do with these medicinal herbs.

361
00:26:29,369 --> 00:26:32,590
Then help me thank the First Prince on my behalf.

362
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,390
Young Lady, I'll go and decoct medicine for you.

363
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,991
All right.

364
00:26:43,951 --> 00:26:47,251
If we look closely, this matter is my fault.

365
00:26:47,251 --> 00:26:49,749
If it weren't for the rumors about us,

366
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,409
I don't think Empress Dowager would be this furious.

367
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:56,110
Brother Shen, how can this be your fault?

368
00:26:56,111 --> 00:26:57,751
You have nothing to do with it.

369
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:02,311
By the way, this one too.

370
00:27:02,311 --> 00:27:05,571
The Princess asked me to bring you this golden hairpin to you.

371
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:09,190
Her Highness is very kind indeed.

372
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,930
It's beautiful.

373
00:27:17,151 --> 00:27:18,390
Brother Shen,

374
00:27:18,391 --> 00:27:22,029
if those gossipmongers saw you giving me a hairpin,

375
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:24,770
who knows what rumors they'd come up with.

376
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:28,870
Are we the sort of people who care about such rumors?

377
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:30,790
Of course, we aren't.

378
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,910
But those people sure have a lot of free time.

379
00:27:34,911 --> 00:27:38,269
Besides, you giving me a hairpin is nothing.

380
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:41,250
Lord Ding has even let me stay at his residence.

381
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:46,150
I can see you've truly come to terms with these rumors.

382
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:49,110
Of course. I value my life.

383
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,770
I've thought it through now.

384
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:53,390
I'm determined to live a long and healthy life.

385
00:27:53,391 --> 00:27:54,991
That's the spirit.

386
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:05,170
Greetings, Lord Ding.

387
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,050
Editor Shen,

388
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,970
Editor Mu is feeling unwell.

389
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,670
She needs to take the medicine.

390
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,170
You can leave now.

391
00:28:16,351 --> 00:28:17,169
Brother Shen.

392
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:18,469
Then rest well.

393
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,070
I'll come and visit you again.

394
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:03,110
My Lord, this... Why is the medicine becoming more and more bitter?

395
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:25,969
This is not food.

396
00:29:25,969 --> 00:29:28,051
I can't share it with you.

397
00:29:31,191 --> 00:29:34,869
Young Lady said the imperial physician's decoction was too bitter.

398
00:29:34,869 --> 00:29:37,510
So she asked me to throw it away secretly.

399
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,029
Young Lady gave me a new prescription.

400
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,170
I have to go and prepare it for her.

401
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:56,210
Your master is truly capable.

402
00:30:05,431 --> 00:30:08,131
Juli, what took you so long?

403
00:30:08,131 --> 00:30:09,931
Come and have some snacks.

404
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:21,750
It seems you're living comfortably in my residence.

405
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:29,271
My Lord, why are you still up at this hour?

406
00:30:36,151 --> 00:30:37,651
Come in.

407
00:30:40,351 --> 00:30:41,951
Young Lady.

408
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:57,749
My Lord, you're really considerate of those under you.

409
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,409
But it's too late now.

410
00:31:00,409 --> 00:31:05,210
Maybe you should go back and rest.

411
00:31:18,591 --> 00:31:22,110
My Lord, this medicine is really too bitter.

412
00:31:22,111 --> 00:31:25,930
I had no other choice but to resort to this.

413
00:31:30,391 --> 00:31:33,590
My Lord, I feel much better now.

414
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,469
I want to go home!

415
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,410
 I want to go home! 

416
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:53,931
 If you still wish to work for me, 

417
00:31:53,931 --> 00:31:56,910
 I will certainly do my utmost to make sure you're safe. 

418
00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:00,751
 However, you should also be aware... 

419
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:05,531
 that this path will not be a ladder to success... 

420
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:09,751
 but rather a steep and challenging precipice. 

421
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:16,890
Juli, what do you think about Lord Ding?

422
00:32:18,391 --> 00:32:20,069
His Lordship may look stern.

423
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,191
But he's a kind person.

424
00:32:23,671 --> 00:32:26,930
Lord Ding may not smile often.

425
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:30,391
But he's really protective.

426
00:32:30,391 --> 00:32:32,830
He may feed me with bitter medicine,

427
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:35,930
but he also offers us a lot of delicious food.

428
00:32:41,111 --> 00:32:45,350
Do you remember what he asked me before?

429
00:32:45,351 --> 00:32:47,471
He told me to make a choice.

430
00:32:47,471 --> 00:32:51,991
At that time, I didn't know how to choose.

431
00:32:52,831 --> 00:32:54,730
But now,

432
00:32:56,091 --> 00:32:58,651
I think I know what I should choose.

433
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,910
My Lord.

434
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:19,450
Don't feel obligated to join me just because I saved you.

435
00:33:20,671 --> 00:33:23,911
I'm not the type who always wants to have something in return.

436
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,631
I hope you can follow your heart.

437
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:38,251
Don't forget to take the medicine,

438
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:41,130
and don't throw it away again.

439
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:47,091
My Lord,

440
00:33:48,351 --> 00:33:50,591
about what you asked me before.

441
00:33:50,591 --> 00:33:52,651
I have my answer now.

442
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,850
I want to keep walking with you.

443
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:08,284
♫  You are like the flowers and moon, stretching while unbroken my time and drifting away  ♫

444
00:34:10,311 --> 00:34:13,491
You should know it will be full of dangers and uncertainties.

445
00:34:14,391 --> 00:34:18,369
You won't be able to live a wealthy and comfortable life either.

446
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,190
I understand.

447
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:27,910
But I also know that the hardest thing to come by in this world is sincerity.

448
00:34:33,035 --> 00:34:37,011
I also know that you treat me sincerely.

449
00:34:51,831 --> 00:34:54,790
Young Lady, you're still reading when you're injured.

450
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:56,430
Be careful not to strain your eyes.

451
00:34:56,431 --> 00:34:58,651
It's all right. Let me read some more.

452
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,830
Is this the book you've been asking me to search for?

453
00:35:04,611 --> 00:35:07,111
This book is really useful.

454
00:35:08,951 --> 00:35:12,130
 But you said you wanted to share Lord Ding's worries. 

455
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:14,951
 Why are you reading books about Northern Liang? 

456
00:35:14,951 --> 00:35:18,430
 He has been working tirelessly day and night recently. 

457
00:35:18,431 --> 00:35:21,970
 It's all for the upcoming peace talks with Northern Liang. 

458
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:27,249
However, it's Lord Ding who initiated these talks with Northern Liang.

459
00:35:27,249 --> 00:35:30,589
He deliberately leaked news of wanting to negotiate peace with Eastern Xia.

460
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:34,489
This made Northern Liang anxious, thinking that Southern Chen would ally with Eastern Xia.

461
00:35:34,489 --> 00:35:36,750
 What does that have to do with us? 

462
00:35:36,751 --> 00:35:39,569
 To seek justice for the thirty thousand loyal souls, 

463
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:41,770
His Lordship has put himself on the line.

464
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:45,149
Since I've already made up my mind to follow him

465
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,469
 and become a good official that cares for the country and the people, 

466
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:50,310
then I must take practical action.

467
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:52,631
I can't always be boastful.

468
00:35:52,631 --> 00:35:57,111
 I'm someone who knows how to repay kindness. 

469
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,351
The medicine is ready.

470
00:36:06,135 --> 00:36:08,085
   

471
00:36:13,911 --> 00:36:16,509
My Lord, you've worked hard all day

472
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,469
and still came to deliver the medicine to me.

473
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,330
I'm truly touched.

474
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:25,190
By taking the medicine, you're already repaying me.

475
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:29,330
These are two separate matters.

476
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:35,230
My Lord, did you hear what I just said earlier?

477
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:41,251
Then, do you think you can give me a chance

478
00:36:41,251 --> 00:36:43,951
to observe and participate in the works of the Ministry of Rites?

479
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:57,509
If you can master Northern Liang's language within twenty days

480
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,330
and pass the test,

481
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:02,029
I'll allow you to join the works of the Ministry of Rites.

482
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,650
Of course, I'll do it.

483
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:08,509
But, My Lord, I still need some materials to study.

484
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:13,231
Can you lend me more books?

485
00:37:17,231 --> 00:37:19,610
It's getting late. You should get some rest early.

486
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,751
I won't be in your way anymore.

487
00:37:21,751 --> 00:37:25,751
Later, I'll have someone deliver the books to you.

488
00:37:25,751 --> 00:37:26,870
All right.

489
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:28,571
Thank you, My Lord.

490
00:37:31,311 --> 00:37:33,291
That's awesome, Young Lady.

491
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:37,411
Young Lady, the books are here.

492
00:37:37,411 --> 00:37:39,990
"Anecdotes of the Northern Liang."

493
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,751
Young Lady, here's your medicine.

494
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,370
It's so bitter.

495
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,490
Young Lady.

496
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:11,149
This is great, Young Lady.

497
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,430
You've almost fully recovered.

498
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,870
I can walk normally now.

499
00:38:14,871 --> 00:38:16,350
I've recovered.

500
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:19,850
Young Lady, there is so much delicious food in Lord Ding's Residence.

501
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,650
Stop that, Guo Juli.

502
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,671
We must return home.

503
00:38:23,671 --> 00:38:27,870
Butler Zhang talks to me about daily life every day and will go on for more than two hours.

504
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:32,410
Or he'll tell me, "Lord Ding grew up without parental care and love."

505
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:37,329
He will also tell me that Lord Ding has never been attracted to any woman.

506
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:40,310
I don't even have time to read in peace.

507
00:38:40,311 --> 00:38:42,170
You can tell him that you want some time alone.

508
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:47,850
Do you have the heart to turn someone kind who brings you food every day away?

509
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:52,270
So, I'll go and bid farewell to Lord Ding now.

510
00:38:52,271 --> 00:38:54,990
Pack up our things.

511
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:56,830
Don't be greedy for food.

512
00:39:09,271 --> 00:39:10,771
Uncle.

513
00:39:32,311 --> 00:39:34,430
You were severely injured a few days ago.

514
00:39:34,431 --> 00:39:36,271
So I couldn't bear to reprimand you.

515
00:39:36,871 --> 00:39:42,871
Uncle, please take into account that I came to you in person

516
00:39:42,871 --> 00:39:44,971
and spare me a few scoldings.

517
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:54,550
Chen'er, you're the eldest.

518
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:57,669
In this matter, you bear the biggest responsibility.

519
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,509
He was the one being disrespectful first.

520
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:02,730
He said that you had misjudged people and were deceived.

521
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,690
I couldn't hold my anger. That's why I...

522
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:08,790
They deliberately provoked you because they know your temper.

523
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:10,591
They did it on purpose?

524
00:40:14,431 --> 00:40:15,931
I get it now.

525
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:20,651
Liu Yu got Liu Jin to drag me down on purpose.

526
00:40:22,231 --> 00:40:25,189
I can't believe he was willing to put his younger brother at risk.

527
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,590
Chen'er,

528
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:30,431
the three of you are my nephews.

529
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:34,291
I should be impartial in this.

530
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:37,611
But now, your conflicts are getting more intense.

531
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:41,250
This will only sadden your father.

532
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,611
They drove me into a corner.

533
00:40:47,431 --> 00:40:49,591
You are the legitimate eldest son.

534
00:40:49,591 --> 00:40:54,450
As long as you don't make mistakes, everything will proceed smoothly.

535
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:57,629
Their goal is to force you to make a mistake.

536
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:01,671
And yet, you chose to act impulsively, falling right into their trap.

537
00:41:03,751 --> 00:41:07,051
From now on, you must control your temper

538
00:41:07,051 --> 00:41:10,450
and think carefully before you act in all matters.

539
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:13,211
 My Lord, Mu Zhuohua requests an audience. 

540
00:41:18,391 --> 00:41:19,991
Let her in.

541
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:35,160


542
00:41:36,917 --> 00:41:44,376
♫  I can't forget the love that is still is nipping at my ears and temples  ♫

543
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:51,676
♫  Memories keep slamming into rocks and have nowhere to berth  ♫

544
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:59,116
♫  Both sides gaze at each other in the drizzling rain, but one has turned into clouds and mist  ♫

545
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:07,636
♫  Leaving the isolated heart's island, like waves without a shore  ♫

546
00:42:07,636 --> 00:42:11,376
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

547
00:42:11,376 --> 00:42:15,036
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

548
00:42:15,036 --> 00:42:18,956
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

549
00:42:18,956 --> 00:42:22,436
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

550
00:42:22,437 --> 00:42:25,956
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

551
00:42:25,957 --> 00:42:29,676
♫  Obviously willing to swear life and death 
 to be entangled for a lifetime  ♫

552
00:42:29,677 --> 00:42:33,876
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

553
00:42:33,877 --> 00:42:39,777
♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

554
00:42:53,477 --> 00:43:00,776
♫  I can't forget the turmoil of love and hate, 
 even if the next day is far away  ♫

555
00:43:00,776 --> 00:43:09,536
♫  Two souls embrace in chaos, how can it be written off?  ♫

556
00:43:09,536 --> 00:43:13,116
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

557
00:43:13,116 --> 00:43:16,756
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

558
00:43:16,756 --> 00:43:20,636
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

559
00:43:20,637 --> 00:43:24,176
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

560
00:43:24,176 --> 00:43:27,776
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

561
00:43:27,776 --> 00:43:31,556
♫  Obviously can't be erased, and haunted by lingering dreams  ♫

562
00:43:31,557 --> 00:43:35,536
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

563
00:43:35,536 --> 00:43:42,817
♫  Want to have one more glimpse of you, 
 even just for a second more  ♫
