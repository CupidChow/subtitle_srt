00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:30,400
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,100
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:47,779
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,779 --> 00:00:50,759
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,219
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:58,180
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:03,479
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,579
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

11
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,600
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

12
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,839
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:24,000
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,139
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

15
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,900
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

16
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:40,080
   

17
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,960
   

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,739
    
    

19
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,350
   

20
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,808
Quit peeking!

21
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,530
Serves you right!

22
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,608
If I hadn't married you, I could have been an official.

23
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:10,369
Right. Right.

24
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:13,989
- Go back and cook!  
 - Yes. Yes.

25
00:02:21,929 --> 00:02:26,180
I can cook for you, too.

26
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,410
After seeing your dumplings, I highly doubt you can cook.

27
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,250
Come.

28
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,010
Look at the festive curtains and the red lanterns.

29
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,540
You were busy for the past few days to set them up?

30
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:00,130
Why, Official Mu?

31
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,570
Do you want to get married?

32
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,549
Me? No!

33
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:08,429
I just thought that this empty courtyard could use some decoration.

34
00:03:08,429 --> 00:03:13,109
But Juli made it look this festive.

35
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,009
I like it.

36
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:18,289
Festivity means happiness.

37
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:20,929
It's a nice view.

38
00:03:30,089 --> 00:03:33,080
Is this for me?

39
00:03:34,029 --> 00:03:37,620
Think of it as a betrothal token.

40
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,030
It might look a bit crude, though.

41
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,130
I like it.

42
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:50,929
You're wearing it now?

43
00:03:50,929 --> 00:03:54,550
It's not elegant enough for a man of your status.

44
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,389
I don't mind it.

45
00:03:57,389 --> 00:03:59,208
I do.

46
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:02,528
Everyone knows our relationship now.

47
00:04:02,529 --> 00:04:08,950
It's embarrassing to let everyone see how bad my handicraft is.

48
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,329
Yummy!

49
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,270
Have a drumstick, Zhimo.

50
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,270
You didn't eat at all.

51
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,089
This prawn is good, too.

52
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:42,889
Have some.

53
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,989
It's all good food here.

54
00:04:45,989 --> 00:04:47,790
Maybe he doesn't want to dirty his robe.

55
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,990
Is it that expensive?

56
00:04:52,429 --> 00:04:55,049
Why don't you frame it and worship it?

57
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:59,429
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

58
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:02,150
Young Lady once wanted to sew His Lordship a robe.

59
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:07,830
But she is so bad at sewing that a bolt of fabric was turned into a piece of cloth.

60
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,310
In the end, she settled with a purse.

61
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,329
Eat up.

62
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:18,010
Zhijian, why aren't you eating?

63
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,309
I am.

64
00:05:21,309 --> 00:05:23,129
These ducks look succulent. I'll roast them.

65
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,948
No! These are the betrothal ducks Young Lady gave to His Lordship.

66
00:05:25,948 --> 00:05:28,930
Calm down.

67
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,930
Get back here!

68
00:05:31,829 --> 00:05:33,729
Get back here!

69
00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:55,769
If I knew you meant to marry me,

70
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,690
I wouldn't have been this humble in front of others.

71
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:02,529
Why, Lord Ding?

72
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,010
Do you regret it now?

73
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,640
You know my heart...

74
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,160
belongs to you.

75
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,450
Why would I regret it?

76
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:20,690
When did it happen?

77
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,010
Why didn't I know?

78
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:36,390
Now, everyone in the capital knows we're together.

79
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,749
Is that not enough?

80
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:46,549
You're being pedantic here, Lord Ding.

81
00:06:47,897 --> 00:06:51,661
♫  It is much farther than just two consensual hearts  ♫

82
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:58,050
You must be bullying me, Lord Ding.

83
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:01,549
♫  Toiling away long hours together with the candle's light  ♫

84
00:07:01,549 --> 00:07:03,369
Feel free to bully me, too.

85
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,649
♫  Not caring about the high mountains, deep waters, and long roads  ♫

86
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:07,810
Can I?

87
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,420
Of course.

88
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:21,610
♫  You are like the flowers and moon, stretching while unbroken my time and drifting away  ♫

89
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:28,210
♫  Thousands of words are not enough 
 to accompany the long journey  ♫

90
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:36,730
♫  You are like the flowers and moon, 
 more graceful than a palace in the sky  ♫

91
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:43,230
♫  Accompanying you, calmly waiting 
 for the clouds to fade away  ♫

92
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:51,674
♫  The flowers and the moon are boundless, having to drift desperately in exchange for a long-cherished wish  ♫

93
00:07:51,674 --> 00:07:58,233
♫  The road is long, can the years be fulfilled?  ♫

94
00:07:58,233 --> 00:08:06,554
♫  The flowers and the full moon in the sky, 
 a touching poem that has reached the world  ♫

95
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:14,218
♫  The flowering period is not too late, to guard my little wish  ♫

96
00:08:14,218 --> 00:08:22,490
♫  There are flowers in the morning, a moon in the evening, 
 and still water throughout the year  ♫

97
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,890
   

98
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,250
What's happening?

99
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,089
 Geez, that Lord Ding. 

100
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:41,108
 Now that we have done everything, he has grown cocky. 

101
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,090
Official Mu.

102
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,729
His Majesty has summoned you.

103
00:08:51,729 --> 00:08:53,490
His Majesty?

104
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,630
    
 Greetings, Your Majesty.

105
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,689
Rise.

106
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:04,850
How may I help you, Your Majesty?

107
00:09:05,849 --> 00:09:10,390
I summoned you in regard to certain queries I have

108
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,890
concerning the Ministry of Revenue.

109
00:09:19,069 --> 00:09:24,289
Your Majesty, is there a problem with the ledger?

110
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:28,569
Take a seat.

111
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:31,549
I dare not.

112
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:33,809
We'll speak when you're seated.

113
00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:38,469
Thank you, Your Majesty.

114
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:00,649
Zhijian.

115
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:04,288
Yes, My Lord?

116
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:07,490
Why hasn't Official Mu come back?

117
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:11,210
She was summoned by His Majesty and has not returned.

118
00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:14,069
She hasn't returned yet?

119
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:17,210
Yes. It's been four hours now.

120
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,688
Your Majesty, it is getting late.

121
00:10:40,689 --> 00:10:46,089
Do you still have queries regarding...

122
00:10:48,349 --> 00:10:50,449
Yes, it is late.

123
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,910
It's time to eat.

124
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,349
Thank you so much, Official Mu.

125
00:10:55,349 --> 00:10:58,369
Why don't you have dinner here before leaving?

126
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,568
Official Mu will have dinner with me.

127
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:05,550
- Tell the Imperial Kitchen to prepare more Huaizhou specialties. 
 - Noted.

128
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,189
Your Majesty,

129
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,489
I'm afraid this is inappropriate.

130
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,929
How so? I am hungry.

131
00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:18,329
After dinner, we can continue the discussion.

132
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:22,408
- But I... 
 - Your Majesty, Prince Regent demands an audience.

133
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:24,409
Prince Regent?

134
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,730
Tell him I'm occupied.

135
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,649
I will see him later.

136
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:36,410
Yes, Your Majesty.

137
00:11:44,749 --> 00:11:48,150
My Lord, are you here to pick me up?

138
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:53,990
I heard that His Majesty kept you in Wende Hall for four hours.

139
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:58,169
He had some queries about the ledger.

140
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:03,330
You are not jealous, are you?

141
00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:07,270
Of course not.

142
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:13,110
However, isn't it unfair to make you work till late?

143
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:16,489
His Majesty saw that it was around dinnertime,

144
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:19,210
so he asked me to stay for dinner.

145
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:22,249
You're uncharacteristically petty today.

146
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:27,549
Isn't it our job as ministers to help His Majesty?

147
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,670
"Petty"?

148
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,029
How am I petty?

149
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:41,089
You are jealous. Just admit it.

150
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,120
   

151
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,469
They say a hero is often undone by a belle.

152
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:03,490
Even a man of integrity like my uncle is no exception.

153
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,470
The seed has been sowed.

154
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:14,029
We can only wait till His Majesty and my uncle become enemies.

155
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:16,069
Wise strategy, Your Highness.

156
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:23,349
You wish to speak?

157
00:13:25,289 --> 00:13:30,470
Your Highness, it has been days since Official Shen's last visit.

158
00:13:33,669 --> 00:13:36,669
Indeed.

159
00:13:43,643 --> 00:13:45,446
   

160
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,629
Are you still mad?

161
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:27,749
There, there. Don't be mad now.

162
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,650
Jinghong.

163
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:40,969
I might have a family, but I am not the favorite.

164
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,528
Grandaunt might dote on me,

165
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:45,889
♫  The love that opened my eyes  ♫

166
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,189
but she doesn't understand me.

167
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:54,510
You are... the only one...

168
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,351
who truly understands me.

169
00:14:57,351 --> 00:15:00,147
♫  A dream of a goose and a phoenix crossing together  ♫

170
00:15:00,147 --> 00:15:03,117
♫  Tenderness is like parting and complaints  ♫

171
00:15:03,117 --> 00:15:10,417
♫  Going around for a lifetime, constantly cut and scattered, 
 the world is day and night  ♫

172
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:18,277
♫  The fireworks of the world are like quicksand 
 of the world after all  ♫

173
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,809
When are you going to forgive me?

174
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:29,737
♫  Again, someone on the precipice of fate  ♫

175
00:15:29,737 --> 00:15:33,597
♫  Leaves tear stains behind while bidding farewell  ♫

176
00:15:33,597 --> 00:15:41,637
♫  The heartache is caused by the painful loneliness  ♫

177
00:15:57,097 --> 00:16:04,767
♫  The moon in the water asked the flowers 
 in the mirror why lovesickness hurt?  ♫

178
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:12,057
♫   The setting sun cannot clear the morning fog  ♫

179
00:16:12,057 --> 00:16:15,807
♫  The fleeting years burst into pieces  ♫

180
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:18,937
♫  The memories of them cause me pain  ♫

181
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:26,227
♫  I can't hold onto my lover's heart, turning back, 
 I realize there is nowhere to go  ♫

182
00:16:26,237 --> 00:16:34,287
♫  The fireworks of the world are like quicksand 
 of the world after all  ♫

183
00:16:34,287 --> 00:16:41,636
♫  In that moment of confusion, 
 I want to know what your answer will be  ♫

184
00:16:41,636 --> 00:16:45,616
♫  Again, someone on the precipice of fate  ♫

185
00:16:45,617 --> 00:16:49,297
♫  Leaves tear stains behind while bidding farewell  ♫

186
00:16:49,297 --> 00:16:57,157
♫  The heartache is caused by the painful loneliness  ♫

187
00:16:57,157 --> 00:17:01,249
Your Highness, you should go back.

188
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:10,986
♫  I cared about you with all my heart, 
 but how are you going to accept it?  ♫

189
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:15,966
♫  The sound of the wind is like 
 the desperate cries from the jackdaw  ♫

190
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:19,547
♫  This regret sprouts from the joys and sorrows  ♫

191
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:26,907
♫  The city in my heart collapsed from the loneliness and pain  ♫

192
00:17:26,907 --> 00:17:34,779
♫  In the years of deep love, I am willing to shield you from the wind and sand  ♫

193
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:42,427
♫  Watch as the scars scab and turn into yesterday's flowers  ♫

194
00:17:42,427 --> 00:17:46,106
♫  Who doesn't envy us whose hair have turned gray?  ♫

195
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:50,058
♫  But you and I are now separated  ♫

196
00:17:50,058 --> 00:17:55,928
♫  The world of mortals ends in loneliness and pain  ♫

197
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:57,688
Official Shen is ungrateful!

198
00:17:57,689 --> 00:18:01,750
You've already come to him, and yet, he turned you down.

199
00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:04,329
Your Highness?

200
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:10,490
Unlike others, I still have use of Shen Jinghong.

201
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,769
What makes Official Shen so special?

202
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:18,249
Indeed. What's so special about him?

203
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:26,470
   

204
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:30,749
Minister of Personnel is an important position.

205
00:18:30,749 --> 00:18:35,009
Uncle, your remark might be too judgmental.

206
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:36,488
Your Majesty,

207
00:18:36,489 --> 00:18:39,708
while Shen Jinghong is a director in the Ministry of Personnel,

208
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:44,989
his experience and capability are not a sufficient fit for the role of a minister.

209
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:50,410
I believe the Vice Minister of Rites is a better candidate

210
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:56,269
than Official Shen due to his stable personality and vast experience.

211
00:18:56,269 --> 00:19:00,710
Lu Yao is a veteran, but he is advanced in age.

212
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,290
He might not have the stamina for the role.

213
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:07,349
Besides, the older generation are often set in their ways.

214
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,828
We need new blood and new ideas.

215
00:19:10,828 --> 00:19:16,709
Your Majesty, even a fine steed will need a guide to tell it where to gallop.

216
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:19,650
Official Shen is indeed promising,

217
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:24,089
but his young age means that he lacks patience.

218
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:28,230
He needs more polishing to assume the role.

219
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:35,209
Besides, I heard that Official Shen frequents the Xiaoqin Pleasure House.

220
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:40,950
An indulgent individual cannot be a wise minister.

221
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,248
Don't worry, Your Highness.

222
00:19:45,249 --> 00:19:49,550
Official Shen will surely be the Minister of Personnel.

223
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,369
No.

224
00:19:53,369 --> 00:19:58,029
I want all of you to back Prince Regent's suggestion and support Vice Minister Lu.

225
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:03,949
Your Highness. Why?

226
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:10,990
I want His Majesty to see the true color of Prince Regent.

227
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,290
To protect him.

228
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:23,190
Your Majesty, I agree with Prince Regent.

229
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:28,129
Vice Minister Lu is a better candidate than Official Shen.

230
00:20:32,109 --> 00:20:35,148
I concur. None can deny Official Shen's talent.

231
00:20:35,148 --> 00:20:39,710
But he is too young to lead.

232
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:44,490
- I concur. 
  - I concur. 

233
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:55,249
If that is your collective wish,

234
00:20:57,169 --> 00:21:00,349
we shall proceed as Prince Regent suggested.

235
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,930
Wise choice, Your Majesty.

236
00:21:05,649 --> 00:21:09,109
Prince Regent, you lost your composure in the imperial court.

237
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:11,769
Your salary will be withheld for three years.

238
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:14,530
May this serve as your warning.

239
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:18,810
Your Majesty, may I know when I misbehaved?

240
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,629
When I say you committed contempt of court, you committed it.

241
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:33,189
- Adjourn. 
 - Court adjourned.

242
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,569
   

243
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:07,168
He was chastised in front of everyone?

244
00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:10,950
Yes, according to the messenger.

245
00:22:12,969 --> 00:22:14,928
First, His Majesty made him kneel before the Imperial Ancestral Temple.

246
00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:16,649
Then, he chastised him in public.

247
00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:19,769
His Majesty is trying to shun Lord Ding.

248
00:22:21,689 --> 00:22:24,250
I knew it.

249
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,510
His Majesty is quick-tempered.

250
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,909
He doesn't have what it takes to be a ruler.

251
00:22:28,909 --> 00:22:31,669
But Uncle didn't see through that.

252
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:34,190
He only has himself to blame.

253
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,049
It won't change a thing anyway.

254
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:39,049
It is obvious that His Majesty is fond of Mu Zhuohua.

255
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,448
Unless Prince Regent is willing to give her away,

256
00:22:41,449 --> 00:22:44,750
otherwise, His Majesty and Prince Regent are bound to fight.

257
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:49,550
That's why they say a hero is often undone by a belle.

258
00:22:50,689 --> 00:22:55,870
Well, Your Highness, if I may speak frankly...

259
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,169
Go ahead.

260
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:00,809
Princess Jing'an has been trying to see Official Shen.

261
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:05,750
Official Shen has turned her down many times, but she won't give up.

262
00:23:07,169 --> 00:23:09,249
Where is he nowadays?

263
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,070
Speak.

264
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:22,070
Official Shen is often seen drinking in Xiaoqin Pleasure House.

265
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:24,069
He stays there until late.

266
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,308
   

267
00:23:28,308 --> 00:23:31,069
Official Shen, the chamber that you want has been taken.

268
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:34,049
- And the new courtesan... 
 - Why hasn't he arrived?

269
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,289
Yes, Your Highness.

270
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,728
Someone took her, too.

271
00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:39,049
Perhaps I can show you to another chamber?

272
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,750
Let me check.

273
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:45,050
Oh, we've been waiting for you!

274
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,669
Come.

275
00:23:47,489 --> 00:23:49,289
Your Highness.

276
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:51,289
He is the smartest of us all.

277
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:54,570
He outwits all of us.

278
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:58,489
Now, now. You will hurt me deeply if you toss me away for him.

279
00:23:58,489 --> 00:24:00,408
Stop talking nonsense.

280
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:04,349
This is Official Shen, a director in the Ministry of Personnel.

281
00:24:06,249 --> 00:24:09,829
Try this, Your Highness.

282
00:24:09,829 --> 00:24:12,689
Shouldn't you feed me?

283
00:24:15,649 --> 00:24:19,110
That face of yours shouldn't be kept here.

284
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,970
Why don't you stay in my residence

285
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:25,690
so that I can pamper you properly?

286
00:24:26,969 --> 00:24:29,190
Thank you so much, Your Highness.

287
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:36,569
- Come, Your Highness. 
 - Drink up.

288
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:43,470
You're in a good mood today, Your Highness.

289
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:48,869
I think I shouldn't spoil it.

290
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:53,648
Official Shen?

291
00:24:53,649 --> 00:24:56,510
Official Shen, hear me out.

292
00:24:57,489 --> 00:24:59,089
Official Shen.

293
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:02,129
Official Shen! I'll get you another chamber.

294
00:25:02,129 --> 00:25:04,049
- All right, Official Shen? 
 - Your Highness, forget about him.

295
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:05,248
Let's have fun.

296
00:25:05,249 --> 00:25:06,488
Go away.

297
00:25:06,489 --> 00:25:08,488
Your Highness, drink with me.

298
00:25:08,489 --> 00:25:10,610
I said, go away!

299
00:25:11,689 --> 00:25:13,189
Let's go.

300
00:25:24,206 --> 00:25:27,132
   

301
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:31,790
Southern Chen's liquor is no fun.

302
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,830
Try Northern Liang's.

303
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:38,089
It hits much harder.

304
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:39,850
Perfect for sorrows.

305
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:40,889
Why are you here?

306
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:43,150
I'm here to drink with you.

307
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:45,389
Drinking alone is boring.

308
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:53,289
I'll let you know that I have a high tolerance for alcohol.

309
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:04,289
Ew! You call this liquor?

310
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:06,849
What is this? Water?

311
00:26:06,849 --> 00:26:08,330
It doesn't have any taste.

312
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,890
But it hits late and hard.

313
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,470
You can certainly hold your liquor!

314
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:05,970
To love is painful.

315
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:09,109
To be denied is also painful.

316
00:27:11,389 --> 00:27:13,690
I want her love,

317
00:27:14,489 --> 00:27:17,389
but she told me that she had long forsaken love.

318
00:27:25,249 --> 00:27:27,130
Little does she know...

319
00:27:28,249 --> 00:27:33,430
that I can love no one anymore.

320
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,870
I know.

321
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,770
But women in Northern Liang are a stubborn lot.

322
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:52,030
Once we fall in love with someone, we fight for it.

323
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,870
Even if our hearts might be shattered in the end,

324
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:58,349
it's better than a life of regret.

325
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:17,090
You know, I quite envy Official Mu and Prince Regent.

326
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:23,009
They could profess their mutual love in front of everyone.

327
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:24,890
I respect that.

328
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:14,170
I know why you're drinking alone.

329
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,749
Hear me out.

330
00:29:25,749 --> 00:29:31,350
Roujia might look innocent and harmless,

331
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:38,070
but deep down, she's ruthless.

332
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:43,310
If I were you, I would stay very, very far away from her.

333
00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:46,489
You're drunk.

334
00:29:46,489 --> 00:29:48,330
No, I'm not.

335
00:29:50,969 --> 00:29:54,049
During the war at Juma River,

336
00:29:54,049 --> 00:30:00,170
30,000 soldiers from Southern Chen died there.

337
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:03,949
Prince Regent almost lost his life, too.

338
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,648
She killed them.

339
00:30:06,649 --> 00:30:09,309
Roujia did.

340
00:30:18,729 --> 00:30:20,129
What?

341
00:30:20,129 --> 00:30:22,630
Ask Jing if you want.

342
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:26,570
She colluded with my third brother

343
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:29,529
and killed those men.

344
00:30:29,529 --> 00:30:32,470
So stay away from her!

345
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:36,469
She... She did it.

346
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,150
You didn't hear this from me.

347
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,109
Bye.

348
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:06,114
   

349
00:32:16,744 --> 00:32:18,229
   

350
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:21,130
Proceed as suggested in the memorandum.

351
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:24,829
If those noble families

352
00:32:24,829 --> 00:32:29,029
still wish to hinder the implementation of the Talent Appreciation System,

353
00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:33,049
let the Court of Judicial Review speak with them.

354
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,870
- Yes, Your Majesty. 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

355
00:32:36,649 --> 00:32:39,990
Official Mu, you may go now.

356
00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:42,909
By your leave.

357
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,270
Jinghong.

358
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:52,990
Even if it's wrong,

359
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:57,049
will you vie for someone who's taken?

360
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,590
You ask the wrong person here, Your Majesty.

361
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:06,949
I'm afraid I'm also in the same dilemma.

362
00:33:16,009 --> 00:33:17,509
Brother Shen.

363
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,750
You look exhausted.

364
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,169
I am fine.

365
00:33:27,169 --> 00:33:31,349
You should take care of yourself.

366
00:33:34,462 --> 00:33:36,828
   

367
00:33:36,828 --> 00:33:40,288
Southern Chen and Northern Lianghave forged an amicable bond.

368
00:33:40,288 --> 00:33:42,149
We have put down arms.

369
00:33:42,149 --> 00:33:44,489
Why is conscription still necessary?

370
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:48,469
It is but another redundant expenditure on our treasury.

371
00:33:48,469 --> 00:33:52,389
I do not approve the funding.

372
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:55,610
Your Majesty, I beg to differ.

373
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:58,088
Northern Liang is known for their ambition.

374
00:33:58,088 --> 00:34:02,309
A momentary peace doesn't mean we can put our guard down.

375
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:05,289
We should be prepared for all eventualities.

376
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:10,470
As the ruler, you should look at the bigger picture

377
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:14,310
and plan for the future.

378
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:18,509
Are you lecturing me on how to rule my nation?

379
00:34:18,509 --> 00:34:20,890
Of course not.

380
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:23,769
But I have fought against Northern Liang for years.

381
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:28,670
I daresay none here knows their duplicitous nature more than I do.

382
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:33,649
Conscription and increasing the military budget are our priorities now.

383
00:34:33,649 --> 00:34:35,448
I fought in war before, too.

384
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:37,669
And I have killed some Northern Liang scum.

385
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:41,830
I know very well how cunning they can be.

386
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,550
But peace has been restored now.

387
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:48,490
I want to focus on societal welfare.

388
00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:53,769
Your Majesty, charitable policies are welcome,

389
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:57,670
but the Ministry of Revenue can handle them.

390
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,989
This does not clash with my suggestion.

391
00:35:00,989 --> 00:35:04,689
I firmly believe that we should retain the current military policies.

392
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:09,050
Besides, conscription is a tradition in Southern Chen.

393
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:15,070
Are you trying to defy our ancestors' wishes?

394
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:20,449
Uncle, are you accusing me of forgetting my ancestral teachings?

395
00:35:21,009 --> 00:35:22,509
Of course not.

396
00:35:22,509 --> 00:35:24,989
But you implied it!

397
00:35:31,049 --> 00:35:35,149
Since you love quoting our ancestors,

398
00:35:35,149 --> 00:35:41,810
head back and copy the imperial genealogy chart a thousand times.

399
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:46,889
Before that, you are not allowed to attend the court.

400
00:35:46,889 --> 00:35:52,070
If that is your wish, Your Majesty, I shall comply.

401
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:57,330
However, please think about my advice.

402
00:35:58,609 --> 00:36:00,509
Uncle,

403
00:36:00,509 --> 00:36:02,629
you are dismissed.

404
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:08,310
By your leave.

405
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:30,020
