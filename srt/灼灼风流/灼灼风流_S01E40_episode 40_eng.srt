8
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,479

♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,139
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:36,918
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,019
   

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,059
   

17
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:45,039
   

18
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,940
   

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,761
What do you have left...

20
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:57,460
to throw your weight around in front of me?

21
00:02:02,601 --> 00:02:04,101
Your Majesty!

22
00:02:25,585 --> 00:02:33,135
♫  The love that opened my eyes  ♫

23
00:02:33,135 --> 00:02:37,059
♫  Moonlight illuminates the path once traveled  ♫

24
00:02:37,059 --> 00:02:39,781
I'll take the blame...

25
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,099
for everything.

26

27
00:02:47,364 --> 00:02:54,464

 the world is day and night  ♫

28
00:02:54,464 --> 00:03:02,624
♫  The fireworks of the world are like quicksand 
 of the world after all  ♫

29
00:03:02,624 --> 00:03:08,544
♫  In that moment of confusion, 
 I want to know what your answer will be  ♫

30
00:03:08,544 --> 00:03:10,101
You...

31
00:03:10,101 --> 00:03:13,984
♫  Again, someone on the precipice of fate  ♫

32
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:17,845
♫  Leaves tear stains behind while bidding farewell  ♫

33
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,239
How could you sacrifice your life for a piece of trash?

34
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,799
♫  The heartache is caused by the painful loneliness  ♫

35
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,240
I did it for you.

36
00:03:41,145 --> 00:03:48,915
♫  The moon in the water asked the flowers 
 in the mirror why lovesickness hurt?  ♫

37
00:03:48,915 --> 00:03:56,205
♫   The setting sun cannot clear the morning fog  ♫

38
00:03:56,205 --> 00:03:59,954
♫  The fleeting years burst into pieces  ♫

39
00:03:59,954 --> 00:04:03,284
♫  The memories of them cause me pain  ♫

40
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,740
With my blood,

41
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,279
I offer my apologies to the people of the nation.

42
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:18,234
♫  The fireworks of the world are like quicksand 
 of the world after all  ♫

43
00:04:18,234 --> 00:04:25,884
♫  In that moment of confusion, 
 I want to know what your answer will be  ♫

44
00:04:25,884 --> 00:04:29,664
♫  Again, someone on the precipice of fate  ♫

45
00:04:29,665 --> 00:04:31,980
♫  Leaves tear stains behind while bidding farewell  ♫

46
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,481
Jiaojiao,

47
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:38,300
♫  The heartache is caused by the painful loneliness  ♫

48
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,101
...turn back.

49
00:04:40,734 --> 00:04:48,639
♫  The fireworks of the world are like quicksand 
 of the world after all  ♫

50
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:55,989
♫  I cared about you with all my heart, 
 but how are you going to accept it?  ♫

51
00:04:55,989 --> 00:04:59,969
♫  The sound of the wind is like 
 the desperate cries from the jackdaw  ♫

52
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,750
♫  This regret sprouts from the joys and sorrows  ♫

53
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:08,919
♫  The city in my heart collapsed from the loneliness and pain  ♫

54
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,520
Well done.

55
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,380
Well done!

56
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,979
♫  In the years of deep love, I am willing to shield you from the wind and sand  ♫

57
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,819
You betrayed me first.

58
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:28,599
I'd trusted you so much for nothing.

59
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:32,760
You said you wouldn't leave me.

60
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:35,280
It was all lies!

61
00:05:37,201 --> 00:05:41,701
Do you think you can win my love?

62
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,980
Like Xue Xiaotang,

63
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:55,700
you're just a pawn in my hands!

64
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,600
First Princess,

65
00:06:04,201 --> 00:06:07,181
why do you have to deceive yourself like this?

66
00:06:10,181 --> 00:06:12,101
I'm afraid...

67
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:15,160
there's no one...

68
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:21,240
there's no one in the world who will love you more than he did.

69
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:24,941
 I've agreed to work with you, 

70
00:06:24,941 --> 00:06:27,921
 but you have to promise me one thing. 

71
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:32,241
 When it's all over, let Her Highness go. 

72
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,301
 Since ancient times, you must choose one or the other. 

73
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:52,380
 Southern Chen's peace is my bottom line. 

74
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,641
 For this bottom line, 

75
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,520
 I'm willing to betray my beloved woman. 

76
00:07:04,981 --> 00:07:07,121
 But I'll always remember... 

77
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:13,180
 that in my darkest days, 

78
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,800
 she was the one who gave me the light, 

79
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:19,101
 pulled me out of the muck, 

80
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,501
 and showed me the path I had to take. 

81
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:30,421
 She's on the wrong track now, 

82
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:36,080
 but I don't want to see her perish. 

83
00:07:38,101 --> 00:07:40,101
 This time, 

84
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,280
 I'll pull her out of the muck. 

85
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,520
I don't believe it.

86
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,220
I don't believe a word of it.

87
00:08:15,981 --> 00:08:18,981
He's just a pawn of mine.

88
00:08:21,421 --> 00:08:24,800
How could he say he's going to save me?

89
00:08:25,761 --> 00:08:28,480
He really overestimated himself.

90
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:39,601
Love?

91
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:42,600
I don't need it at all.

92
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,281
The only thing on my mind...

93
00:08:55,345 --> 00:08:57,965
is the throne.

94
00:09:00,401 --> 00:09:04,801
Roujia, stop being stubborn and going the wrong way.

95
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,681
Stubborn and going the wrong way?

96
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,821
All I've done...

97
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:16,741
is wish for the betterment of this nation.

98
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:18,541
Tell me...

99
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,720
what I can do.

100
00:09:24,401 --> 00:09:26,001
Your Highness,

101
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,181
you once asked me if I thought I was on the right track.

102
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,340
Now,

103
00:09:37,261 --> 00:09:39,760
I'd like to ask you the same question.

104
00:09:45,521 --> 00:09:47,500
If you had helped me,

105
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:51,241
you wouldn't have had to ask me that.

106
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,300
I remember when I was little...

107
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:01,341
and saw you for the first time,

108
00:10:01,341 --> 00:10:04,300
you showed me a different picture,

109
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,361
and made me determined not to be a weak flower

110
00:10:08,361 --> 00:10:10,500
but to be a fearless tree.

111
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,821
Then, I came to the capital in a terrible state.

112
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,321
When I was most helpless,

113
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:26,941
you were the first to lend me a helping hand.

114
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,621
Your encouragement and trust

115
00:10:32,621 --> 00:10:35,281
had given me great courage.

116
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,300
But later,

117
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,960
you forgot your original intention,

118
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:48,460
betrayed those who believed in you and hurt innocent people.

119
00:10:49,521 --> 00:10:52,121
You told me...

120
00:10:52,121 --> 00:10:54,141
it's not easy being a woman,

121
00:10:54,141 --> 00:10:56,120
and you want to make Southern Chen a better place.

122
00:10:56,121 --> 00:11:00,381
You always said you were doing it for others.

123
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:08,061
But now, it seems you were doing everything for yourself.

124
00:11:08,061 --> 00:11:11,021
Is this what you call the path of becoming the emperor?

125
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:13,861
Let me ask you.

126
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,240
If you were to save 10,000 people,

127
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,681
you had to kill 100 first.

128
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:22,181
What would you do?

129
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Your Highness, the fact that you can ask such a question

130
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,819
means people of Southern Chen

131
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:34,160
are just the cornerstone of your fame in the history

132
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:36,300
but not your people.

133
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,260
If that's the case,

134
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,900
how can you deserve to be the empress?

135
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:46,107
It's easy for you onlookers to make a comment.

136
00:11:46,107 --> 00:11:48,401
Have any emperors through the ages...

137
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,301
never sacrificed anyone else's life?

138
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:06,720
I have lost completely.

139
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:11,781
At this point,

140
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:15,580
I have nothing else to say.

141
00:14:52,463 --> 00:14:57,218
   

142
00:15:10,841 --> 00:15:12,441
You're back.

143
00:15:20,021 --> 00:15:22,001
Your Lordship,

144
00:15:22,001 --> 00:15:26,140
I'm impressed that you're setting an example

145
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,000
by working...

146
00:15:28,921 --> 00:15:30,961
while sick.

147
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:47,040
Look... I'm feeling much better now.

148
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:51,241
That's good.

149
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:55,340
It's about time for us to settle some old scores.

150
00:16:01,801 --> 00:16:03,501
Zhuohua,

151
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,840
you did find out about the jade pendant. Right?

152
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,900
 This is the jade pendant representing love between me and His Lordship. 

153
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,041
 He promised me that he'd take it with him all the time. 

154
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:32,460
 How could such an important item be left here? 

155
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,260
 Did he leave it for me 

156
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,719
 to tell me he had another plan? 

157
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:41,681
 That's great. 

158
00:16:41,681 --> 00:16:43,961
 At least, he's still alive. 

159
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:49,600
I knew you'd realize my plan when you saw the jade pendant.

160
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,540
Look.

161
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:57,680
We've always shared the same mind.

162
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,880
So you and His Majesty started working together after the Mid-Autumn Festival?

163
00:17:03,661 --> 00:17:05,261
Yes.

164
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:11,601
 Your Majesty, please play along with me. 

165
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:14,240
 I'll explain to you later. 

166
00:17:19,481 --> 00:17:20,920
 Greetings, Your Majesty. 

167
00:17:20,921 --> 00:17:24,621
 Uncle, there's no one else here. 

168
00:17:24,621 --> 00:17:26,821
 Just spare the formalities. 

169
00:17:26,821 --> 00:17:32,041
 Uncle, why do you come to see me at this late hour? 

170
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,640
 Chen'er, the death of your late father, 

171
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,599
 the death of the Grand Dowager Empress, 

172
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,380
 and the recent conflict between you and the noble families 

173
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:49,039
 are all the result of someone stirring up trouble behind your back to seize the throne. 

174
00:17:50,721 --> 00:17:52,321
 Who is it? 

175
00:17:54,221 --> 00:17:56,221
 Your sister, 

176
00:17:56,861 --> 00:17:58,841
 Princess Roujia. 

177
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,820
 Are you kidding me? 

178
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,600
 On the night of your father's death, 

179
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,540
 there was a mutiny in the palace. 

180
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:27,520
 So you've suffered so much on your own. 

181
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,420
 Your Majesty, we need to stop Roujia as soon as possible, 

182
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,320
 or there will be dire consequences. 

183
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,760
 Uncle, 

184
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,101
 what are you going to do? 

185
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:48,000
 As before, you'll continue to work with me 

186
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,519
 to make it look like we're in conflict and that we're not getting along, 

187
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:54,761
 in order to get Roujia to drop her guard. 

188
00:18:55,901 --> 00:19:00,900
And those fights you had before were all an act?

189
00:19:02,621 --> 00:19:04,121
Yes.

190
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,661
It's a pity that you aren't a stage actor.

191
00:19:11,941 --> 00:19:16,141
It's fine for you to lie, but even His Majesty has learned to lie.

192
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,860
 When the time comes, you'll put me in prison, 

193
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,560
 and then give me poisoned wine. 

194
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,440
 No way. 

195
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,100
 How could I risk your life? 

196
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,300
 No way. 

197
00:19:39,521 --> 00:19:43,420
 Roujia's got a lot of patience and is cautious in everything she does. 

198
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:48,321
 If I don't die, she won't make a move. 

199
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,700
 Your Majesty, this is Soul-deadening Powder. 

200
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,080
 After taking it, I'll be in a dying state. 

201
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,561
 That will definitely fool Roujia. 

202
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,740
 This is too dangerous. 

203
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,640
 Your Majesty, under such circumstances, we have no choice. 

204
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,159
 It's a dangerous plan. 

205
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:22,880
 If something goes wrong, it could cost me my life. 

206
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,641
 I'm sure Zhuohua won't allow me to take the risk. 

207
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:31,241
 That's why we can't tell her. 

208
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,060
 So when are you going to let her know? 

209
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,200
 I have my own way of reassuring her. 

210
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:45,021
 Chen'er, once this plan is implemented, 

211
00:20:45,021 --> 00:20:47,740
 you'll lose all the men on your side. 

212
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,761
 Since you're not afraid, 

213
00:20:56,761 --> 00:20:59,120
 what's there for me to be afraid of? 

214
00:21:00,001 --> 00:21:04,000
There was Soul-deadening Powder in the wine?

215
00:21:07,461 --> 00:21:12,641
I've read about Soul-deadening Powder in medical books before.

216
00:21:12,641 --> 00:21:16,661
This drug is so strong that it will really make someone

217
00:21:16,661 --> 00:21:19,660
fall into a state of dying.

218
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,900
His whole body will be paralyzed, and he will lose all his breath.

219
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:27,381
And there's a good chance that the person who takes it

220
00:21:27,381 --> 00:21:29,621
won't wake up again.

221
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,560
Even if he does, he'll be seriously injured.

222
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,741
How could you take such a bet?

223
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,100
Look.

224
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:48,540
I won the bet.

225
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:53,340
After I faked my death, Roujia had no more scruples

226
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:57,381
and became blatant in her actions.

227
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,520
She joined forces with the Zhou family to force His Majesty to abdicate.

228
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:04,381
And it gave us a good reason to send troops.

229
00:22:04,381 --> 00:22:08,160
Did His Majesty approve of your use of the Soul-deadening Powder?

230
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:13,500
His Majesty had no choice.

231
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,860
 Uncle, why are your hands so cold? 

232
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,801
 It's been three days. 

233
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,421
 Why haven't you woken up? 

234
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,000
 It's so dangerous. 

235
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,641
 I shouldn't have agreed with you in the first place. 

236
00:22:40,801 --> 00:22:44,701
 Chen'er, don't cry. 

237
00:22:46,201 --> 00:22:47,801
 Uncle. 

238
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,920
 Uncle. 

239
00:22:56,861 --> 00:22:59,680
 What took you so long to wake up? 

240
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,141
 Let's not talk about that now. 

241
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,780
 Your Majesty, 

242
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:13,240
 I'd appreciate it if you'd arrange something for me. 

243
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:17,920
 I have to head to the camp of Cangwu Army right away. 

244
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,961
 Uncle, you should at least get some rest. 

245
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,761
 There's no time for that. 

246
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,381
Do you know how worried I was about you?

247
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,100
So...

248
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:44,261
I could only tell you that I was alive.

249
00:23:47,481 --> 00:23:49,660
You could call me paranoid.

250
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,200
What if His Majesty believed Shen Jinghong,

251
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,521
was mad at you, and wanted to kill you

252
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:57,721
because of the late emperor's death?

253
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,961
I watched him grow up.

254
00:24:01,961 --> 00:24:05,120
He's arrogant and willful,

255
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,521
but he's kind.

256
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:09,700
I trust him.

257
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,400
Besides,

258
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,840
I've escaped the jaws of death more than once.

259
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,161
But as long as you're with me,

260
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:22,000
I'll come back safely.

261
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,441
This is your life, and you gambled it in this way.

262
00:24:25,441 --> 00:24:27,540
What if something had gone wrong?

263
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,020
Remember this.

264
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:35,700
If you ever risk your life again,

265
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,841
I'll never forgive you.

266
00:24:37,841 --> 00:24:39,601
I won't...

267
00:24:40,761 --> 00:24:42,661
and I dare not.

268
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:05,040
I hope to spend the rest of my life with you.

269
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,821
What brings you here?

270
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,061
I have something to tell you.

271
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:53,260
- You came to tell me... 
 - I like you.

272
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,981
Who likes me?

273
00:25:54,981 --> 00:25:56,480
I mean me.

274
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,300
I like you.

275
00:25:59,101 --> 00:26:01,001
I know.

276
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,119
- You knew? 
 - I know.

277
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:07,020
You like me as much as His Lordship likes Young Lady.

278
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,680
I...

279
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,601
will be nice to you.

280
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:13,901
You're nice enough to me now.

281
00:26:13,901 --> 00:26:17,121
I'll be nicer to you.

282
00:26:17,121 --> 00:26:19,241
Much nicer.

283
00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:21,521
Then I'll be nicer to you, too.

284
00:26:21,521 --> 00:26:23,221
Much nicer.

285
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,521
Greetings, Your Majesty.

286
00:27:20,481 --> 00:27:24,960
Official Mu, you're so late.

287
00:27:25,581 --> 00:27:32,160
I'm not used to you being so respectful to your teacher.

288
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,860
I didn't know you to be so vindictive.

289
00:27:40,581 --> 00:27:46,521
Looking back on the past, didn't you think you had gone a little too far?

290
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,980
Yes, a little.

291
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,020
Only a little?

292
00:27:54,801 --> 00:27:56,601
I went too far.

293
00:27:58,201 --> 00:28:01,561
I was too young

294
00:28:01,561 --> 00:28:04,401
and foolish to reflect on myself back then,

295
00:28:04,401 --> 00:28:08,681
and I'm ashamed to recall it now.

296
00:28:10,001 --> 00:28:12,540
You've really matured.

297
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:17,521
You and I...

298
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,700
are first teacher and student,

299
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:24,500
then emperor and official.

300
00:28:25,201 --> 00:28:29,301
Now, I can't even see you...

301
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:33,941
as my official.

302
00:28:37,101 --> 00:28:40,681
If I'm not an official of yours, what am I?

303
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,580
Uncle has already submitted a request to resign as Prince Regent,

304
00:28:50,661 --> 00:28:54,160
and your transfer papers will be issued soon.

305
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:01,540
You're going to the border, aren't you?

306
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,019
Yes.

307
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:06,240
I plan to go to the fiefdom with His Lordship

308
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:08,259
to try the policy of strengthening the borders.

309
00:29:08,259 --> 00:29:10,000
If this policy is really effective,

310
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,420
it will solve a major problem for Southern Chen without any bloodshed.

311
00:29:16,761 --> 00:29:21,841
If it works, you'll be the greatest contributor.

312
00:29:23,181 --> 00:29:24,919
I'm just a civil official.

313
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:29,320
If this policy can really stop the war at the border

314
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,081
and bring peace to the world,

315
00:29:31,081 --> 00:29:36,640
it's the credit of the people at the border, the officers, and soldiers,

316
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,480
as well as yours.

317
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,020
You don't have to drag me into this.

318
00:29:48,481 --> 00:29:53,281
Your Majesty, you don't have to belittle yourself.

319
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,141
In the case of Princess Roujia's treason,

320
00:29:57,141 --> 00:30:03,060
everyone said that Prince Regent is a man of great integrity who disregarded his safety.

321
00:30:07,141 --> 00:30:09,660
But in my eyes,

322
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:14,060
you are also a man of honor and patience, persevering for a greater good.

323
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,860
You bode your time,

324
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:19,240
pretended to be an incompetent ruler, were spurned by the world,

325
00:30:19,241 --> 00:30:21,281
misunderstood by the people,

326
00:30:21,281 --> 00:30:25,721
and suffered the pain of possibly losing your uncle.

327
00:30:26,441 --> 00:30:28,701
Please forgive me for being frank.

328
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:33,880
In the past, you might have been weak.

329
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,881
But now,

330
00:30:37,521 --> 00:30:39,721
you will certainly be a wise ruler.

331
00:30:47,561 --> 00:30:51,660
Are you flattering me?

332
00:31:13,521 --> 00:31:15,121
Sister,

333
00:31:17,761 --> 00:31:20,000
you and I went against each other.

334
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:24,300
You lost and died,

335
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:30,400
but I dare not call myself a winner.

336
00:31:31,521 --> 00:31:35,921
I will choose the right people for the job...

337
00:31:37,441 --> 00:31:39,740
and rule the nation in order.

338
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,540
I don't wish to achieve...

339
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,640
great things...

340
00:31:51,981 --> 00:31:56,001
but only wish to live up to the expectations of the people...

341
00:31:58,521 --> 00:32:00,500
and the nation.

342
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:29,760
Jiaojiao, I'm taking you home,

343
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,460
away from politics, to be at peace,

344
00:32:35,661 --> 00:32:40,020
and to be with those you love.

345
00:32:51,281 --> 00:32:53,860
Why do you want to be by my side?

346
00:32:54,761 --> 00:32:58,341
I didn't have any plans when I was following His Lordship.

347
00:32:58,341 --> 00:33:00,019
Everything was guided by him.

348
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:03,541
Now, I want to try to be on my own.

349
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:05,181
That's true.

350
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:09,600
Uncle has a lover by his side.

351
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,400
You're an eyesore there.

352
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,100
I think it's good the way it is now. I'm used to being alone.

353
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,240
You're...

354
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,900
Nothing.

355
00:33:25,481 --> 00:33:30,640
I just think the Commander's uniform suits you.

356
00:34:04,231 --> 00:34:06,779
♫  It's you who stripped me of my armor  ♫

357
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:11,280
Watching the first snow together, we'll be together till we grow old.

358
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,580
Your Lordship, shall you go out in the snow with me

359
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,979
so that we can grow old together?

360

362

a grand wedding?

363
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,620
No.

364
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,921
I'm satisfied with what I have.

365
00:34:37,921 --> 00:34:43,860
It's great to spend the rest of my life with you like this.

00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,040
Your Lordship, something bad has happened.

370
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,919
His Majesty has been busy with political affairs and is so exhausted

371
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:23,400
that he fainted upon arriving at your residence.

372
00:35:30,821 --> 00:35:32,780
Young Lady, something bad has happened.

373
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,900
- What's it? 
 - Well...

374
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,800
His Majesty has been busy with political affairs and is so exhausted

375
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,680
- that he fainted upon arriving at your residence. 
 - Yes.

376
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,220
- Yes. 
 - He fainted?

377
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,760
Yes.

378
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,760
Let's go and take a look.

379
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,920
- Young Lady. 
 - Let's go.

380
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:07,041
 Congratulations! 

381
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,460
 Congratulations! 

382
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:16,960
 Congratulations! 

383
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,880
How's it?

384
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,760
Your Majesty.

385
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:35,101
Your Majesty, according to the laws of Southern Chen...

386
00:36:35,601 --> 00:36:40,201
When two people are in love, getting married is just a natural thing.

387
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:43,701
How can it be bound by those old rules?

388
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,601
And it's not just you two.

389
00:36:47,601 --> 00:36:52,281
From now on, all the female officials will have the freedom to decide on their marriage

390
00:36:52,281 --> 00:36:55,201
and will no longer be subject to the laws.

391
00:36:55,201 --> 00:36:58,480
 Congratulations! Congratulations! 

392
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,141
 Congratulations! 

393
00:37:07,741 --> 00:37:12,041
Lord Ding is finally getting married.

394
00:37:20,681 --> 00:37:22,181
Help me get changed.

395
00:37:22,181 --> 00:37:23,841
Yes.

 Congratulations! 

406
00:38:23,841 --> 00:38:25,000
 Come on. 

407
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:26,860
 Put the gifts over here. 

408
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,540
 Be careful. 

409
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,201
I heard that these are from His Majesty.

410
00:38:37,201 --> 00:38:40,081
His Majesty really favors Lord Ding.

411
00:38:40,081 --> 00:38:43,280
Official Mu is the first female Tanhua of Southern Chen

412
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,581
and His Majesty's most trusted official.

413
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,921
It's the first case in the world where the newlyweds

414
00:38:49,921 --> 00:38:52,060
change their wedding clothes in the same residence.

415
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,760
- Yes. 
 - This is nothing.

416
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,940
Isn't it also the first time that a prince has become a woman's man out of wedlock?

417
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,840
But I've heard that this residence belongs to Official Mu.

418
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,510
Wouldn't it be a shame for Lord Ding

419
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,400
to get married here?

420
00:39:08,821 --> 00:39:10,559
Mind your words.

421
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,200
This is the end of Lord Ding's suffering.

422
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,780
Lord Ding has finally been given a legitimate title

423
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,161
and will no longer have to be a lover out of wedlock.

424
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,319
- Well said. Official Li is wise indeed.

Drink all you want.

481

♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫ 
     

492
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:32,005
♫  Looking at the green bamboo strips for writing, 
 thousands of scrolls for planning  ♫

493
00:45:32,005 --> 00:45:37,624
♫  The green silk carries dreams, 
 leisurely looking at  the world of mortals  ♫

494
00:45:37,625 --> 00:45:42,695
♫  How can one look back at the one named on the honor roll?  ♫

♫  A trek of a lifetime, a barren hill  ♫ 
    

496
00:45:47,904 --> 00:45:52,575
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

497
00:45:52,575 --> 00:45:58,635
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

498
00:45:58,635 --> 00:46:05,325
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

499
00:46:05,325 --> 00:46:10,554
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

500
00:46:10,554 --> 00:46:15,905
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

501
00:46:16,761 --> 00:46:19,719
Mu Zhuohua, step forward and receive your reward.

502
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,124
♫  This heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

503
00:46:21,125 --> 00:46:26,084
 The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

504
00:46:26,085 --> 00:46:31,154
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

505
00:46:31,154 --> 00:46:35,119
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫
