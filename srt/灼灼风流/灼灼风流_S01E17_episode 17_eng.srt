1
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:25,160


2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,459
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:35,080
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:47,779
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,779 --> 00:00:53,159
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,159
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:03,479
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,579
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,579
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:18,639
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

12
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:24,000
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,139
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:36,918
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,019
   

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,059
   

17
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:44,939
   

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,084
   

19
00:01:48,085 --> 00:01:52,530
   

20
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,385
Jinghong,

21
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:01,603
I've never been to Jiangnan.

22
00:02:01,603 --> 00:02:05,424
You must tell me more before we reach Jiangnan

23
00:02:05,465 --> 00:02:07,264
so that I can come up with tailored strategies.

24
00:02:07,265 --> 00:02:10,523
Rest assured, Your Highness. I'll tell you everything I know.

25
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,504
 Man'er, send a maid to take care of Zhuohua. 

26
00:02:15,505 --> 00:02:17,105
Yes, Your Highness.

27
00:02:27,825 --> 00:02:29,625
My Lord,

28
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:33,585
I haven't seen Miss Mu around lately.

29
00:02:35,304 --> 00:02:37,183
She's an official serving the imperial court.

30
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,504
Naturally, she has official duties to attend to.

31
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:43,305
Still, she's a lady.

32
00:02:43,305 --> 00:02:47,445
Previously, I thought she had developed some feelings for you.

33
00:02:47,445 --> 00:02:50,545
She spared no effort to pass the exam and become an official.

34
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:54,184
She didn't do this just to stay by my side.

35
00:03:06,105 --> 00:03:07,405
My Lord.

36
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:16,010
   

37
00:03:21,065 --> 00:03:22,465
Oh.

38
00:03:22,465 --> 00:03:25,483
My Lord, don't be so petty.

39
00:03:25,483 --> 00:03:31,025
Would Miss Mu's handwriting appear one stroke short when I look at it?

40
00:03:31,665 --> 00:03:34,724
By the looks of it, this young lady

41
00:03:34,724 --> 00:03:39,564
wrote your name when she was thinking of you.

42
00:03:40,945 --> 00:03:44,423
My Lord, since you're not responding to me, I'll go and ask Miss Mu.

43
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,124
Don't bother.

44
00:03:46,124 --> 00:03:49,125
The caravan to the south has already gone on its way.

45
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:52,865
She has already left the capital.

46
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,204
Gosh.

47
00:03:55,204 --> 00:03:57,865
What's the rush?

48
00:04:00,144 --> 00:04:03,385
Well, disaster relief is the priority as of now.

49
00:04:04,665 --> 00:04:08,444
Back in my old days, I experienced locust plague, too.

50
00:04:08,444 --> 00:04:13,445
Swarms of locusts loom dreadfully overhead as if they can cover the sky.

51
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:17,963
My Lord, humans can resort to many terrible things when they're starving.

52
00:04:17,963 --> 00:04:20,605
You should've stopped Miss Mu from going.

53
00:04:27,545 --> 00:04:29,324
She has her own ambition.

54
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:32,804
There's no way I can stop her.

55
00:04:32,804 --> 00:04:34,105
But...

56
00:04:40,935 --> 00:04:46,490
   

57
00:04:57,385 --> 00:05:00,660
   

58
00:05:01,944 --> 00:05:07,024
Do you call this a granary when there is no grain left?

59
00:05:09,545 --> 00:05:11,144
    
 It's my fault.

60
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:15,584
But all the grain in the government office has been dished out.

61
00:05:15,584 --> 00:05:18,863
New grain supplies from other prefectures are still on their way.

62
00:05:18,864 --> 00:05:22,204
My hands are tied.

63
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:25,445
I want the county magistrate here,

64
00:05:25,445 --> 00:05:27,984
not you, a mere assistant.

65
00:05:28,944 --> 00:05:31,604
Do you look down on me

66
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:33,584
and try to make a fool of me?

67
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,084
Answer me!

68
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,623
I would never have the guts to do this, Your Highness.

69
00:05:37,624 --> 00:05:41,383
- But the country magistrate... he... 
 - What's wrong with him?

70
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:43,504
He... He...

71
00:05:44,105 --> 00:05:48,245
He's exhausted from disaster relief.

72
00:05:48,245 --> 00:05:50,263
He's now recuperating at home.

73
00:05:50,264 --> 00:05:53,404
So, I'm acting on his behalf.

74
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:57,025
The county magistrate of Yongding is surnamed Zhuang. Right?

75
00:05:58,665 --> 00:05:59,704
Why?

76
00:05:59,705 --> 00:06:02,385
Do you know the county magistrate here, Official Mu?

77
00:06:03,824 --> 00:06:07,643
My relative once had a short stay here.

78
00:06:07,643 --> 00:06:11,065
They had heard something about this place.

79
00:06:15,585 --> 00:06:18,250
If it's County Magistrate Zhuang,

80
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,320
I wouldn't believe that he collapsed from the overexertion.

81
00:06:22,323 --> 00:06:25,158
How dare you deceive me?

82
00:06:25,158 --> 00:06:26,743
You claimed that you were running out of grain supplies.

83
00:06:26,744 --> 00:06:29,464
If so, how do all civil servants survive the famine?

84
00:06:29,465 --> 00:06:33,224
Government office runners out there are all well-fed and sturdy, though.

85
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:35,305
They don't seem like they're starved.

86
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,623
Bring me all the civil servants now.

87
00:06:40,624 --> 00:06:42,324
Yes, Your Highness.

88
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:53,024
Fortunately, Princess Roujia is on her way to retrieve stored grains from Jishan Hall.

89
00:06:53,024 --> 00:06:55,624
That'd help to alleviate the situation.

90
00:06:57,864 --> 00:06:59,964
That's a relief.

91
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:25,925
I was planning to put on a show to intimidate those officials here.

92
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:29,365
And yet, we only manage to obtain a paltry amount of grains.

93
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,004
It's better than having nothing.

94
00:07:32,004 --> 00:07:33,704
As the assistant of the county magistrate said,

95
00:07:33,705 --> 00:07:37,104
most grain supplies are controlled by local despots.

96
00:07:42,424 --> 00:07:46,423
Your Highness, how are you going to deal with this?

97
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,604
Will you distribute them directly to famine victims

98
00:07:48,604 --> 00:07:51,005
or send them to the charity congee stall?

99
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,721
Why not send them to Jishan Hall?

100
00:07:55,721 --> 00:07:58,323
Princess has been providing relief for the poor over the years.

101
00:07:58,323 --> 00:08:01,885
Handing the grains out should be easy for her.

102
00:08:05,345 --> 00:08:07,785
We shall do what Jinghong said.

103
00:08:07,785 --> 00:08:11,205
Transport the grain supplies to Jishan Hall.

104
00:08:11,205 --> 00:08:14,024
Miss Mu is more familiar with the situation here.

105
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:15,864
Stay and assist me.

106
00:08:16,905 --> 00:08:18,685
- Yes, Your Highness. 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

107
00:08:23,145 --> 00:08:28,124
Those merchants are like gluttons who hoard all grain supplies.

108
00:08:28,145 --> 00:08:30,544
I'm afraid it won't be easy...

109
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,744
to obtain grain supplies from them.

110
00:08:35,624 --> 00:08:42,005
Maybe we can rally them and advocate for donations in the name of the government.

111
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:45,225
My Lord.

112
00:08:46,384 --> 00:08:49,905
The Falcon Squad has searched through the entire capital,

113
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:52,824
but there are no signs of Xue Xiaotang.

114
00:08:55,504 --> 00:08:58,424
Please punish me for my incompetence, My Lord.

115
00:09:04,825 --> 00:09:06,325
Get up.

116
00:09:09,864 --> 00:09:14,185
Xue Xiaotang is a seasoned general in managing armies.

117
00:09:14,185 --> 00:09:18,985
He's more prudent and vigilant than you.

118
00:09:20,544 --> 00:09:23,845
Is Princess Roujia in Jiangnan?

119
00:09:23,845 --> 00:09:25,104
Yes.

120
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:28,085
Her Highness left together with First Prince.

121
00:09:28,105 --> 00:09:30,644
He must have gone to Jiangnan, too.

122
00:09:30,644 --> 00:09:33,143
Hurry and get ready. We'll head over there soon.

123
00:09:33,144 --> 00:09:34,344
Yes.

124
00:09:44,864 --> 00:09:48,125
The relief in Jiangnan is complicated.

125
00:09:49,624 --> 00:09:51,224
But you...

126
00:10:35,544 --> 00:10:36,944
Your Majesty.

127
00:10:40,624 --> 00:10:42,224
What?

128
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:50,564
Lord Ding went to Jiangnan to arrest Xue Xiaotang?

129
00:10:50,564 --> 00:10:54,785
Yes, according to the messenger sent by Official Zhou.

130
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:00,725
How could it be?

131
00:11:00,725 --> 00:11:04,685
Xue Xiaotang should be dead.

132
00:11:07,504 --> 00:11:11,404
Go ahead and tell them

133
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:17,204
to find Xue Xiaotang before Liu Yan...

134
00:11:18,065 --> 00:11:20,005
and silence him forever.

135
00:11:20,825 --> 00:11:22,325
Yes, Your Majesty.

136
00:11:30,105 --> 00:11:32,384
Are you kidding me?

137
00:11:33,105 --> 00:11:35,143
Donating one hu of rice grains each? 
  ("Hu" is a unit of measurement) 

138
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:36,824
Don't you feel ashamed of yourself?

139
00:11:36,825 --> 00:11:39,784
Calm down, Your Highness. I wouldn't dare to deceive you.

140
00:11:39,784 --> 00:11:44,184
I have some income, but I need to support my whole family.

141
00:11:44,185 --> 00:11:47,023
Now that the locust plague has caused a big loss to me.

142
00:11:47,024 --> 00:11:48,903
I'm in heavy debt now.

143
00:11:48,904 --> 00:11:51,025
 That's right. 

144
00:11:51,524 --> 00:11:54,605
You said you're in debt?

145
00:11:54,605 --> 00:11:56,085
Yes.

146
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,304
All of you are in debt, too?

147
00:11:59,305 --> 00:12:01,244
 Yes. 

148
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:04,984
Those famine victims out there are all skin and bones.

149
00:12:04,984 --> 00:12:09,064
But look at your plump faces.

150
00:12:09,065 --> 00:12:10,944
Obviously, you're overfed and have fattened up.

151
00:12:10,945 --> 00:12:12,845
Your Highness,

152
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:16,364
there's no need to press them anymore.

153
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,143
Get lost.

154
00:12:19,144 --> 00:12:20,584
Scram!

155
00:12:20,585 --> 00:12:22,185
 Yes, Your Highness. 

156
00:12:24,705 --> 00:12:29,423
Your Highness, these merchants were evading their responsibilities.

157
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:34,464
We might need some other ways to make them donate.

158
00:12:35,225 --> 00:12:36,864
Any ideas in your mind?

159
00:12:37,664 --> 00:12:42,125
I'm ashamed that I can't think of one now.

160
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:44,925
You don't have to.

161
00:12:45,825 --> 00:12:48,364
I don't have any ideas either.

162
00:12:51,345 --> 00:12:55,184
I wonder how things are going on with Brother Shen and Her Highness.

163
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:02,824
Don't be anxious, everyone!

164
00:13:03,504 --> 00:13:05,304
Calm down!

165
00:13:08,345 --> 00:13:11,543
We got these grains from the Jishan Halls in other places.

166
00:13:11,544 --> 00:13:14,444
They'll be cooked into congee, and that's enough for each of you.

167
00:13:14,444 --> 00:13:18,043
Thank you for your great grace, Your Highness.

168
00:13:18,043 --> 00:13:19,544
Let me do this.

169
00:13:50,544 --> 00:13:52,503
 Don't be anxious. You'll have your portion. 

170
00:13:52,504 --> 00:13:54,663
 Careful. No need to push. 

171
00:13:54,664 --> 00:13:55,663
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

172
00:13:55,664 --> 00:13:57,064
It's fine. Get back to your work.

173
00:13:57,065 --> 00:13:58,623
 Please stand in line. 

174
00:13:58,624 --> 00:14:00,885
This way. Stand in line.

175
00:14:00,885 --> 00:14:02,023
Here, please.

176
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:03,424
 Don't push. 

177
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,584
Be patient. You'll get your portion.

178
00:14:06,585 --> 00:14:09,644
 Don't push. You'll have your share. 

179
00:14:10,144 --> 00:14:11,744
 Be patient. 

180
00:14:16,945 --> 00:14:18,064
What did you add?

181
00:14:18,064 --> 00:14:19,903
- What was it? 
 - What did you put into the congee?

182
00:14:19,904 --> 00:14:21,903
- Wasn't that wheat and rice bran? 
 - Yes.

183
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:24,023
Why did you add that to the congee?

184
00:14:24,024 --> 00:14:26,464
I doubt if we can eat this congee.

185
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,784
That's right. Can we eat the congee after adding that?

186
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,683
- That's right. 
 - True. It's dirty.

187
00:14:30,683 --> 00:14:31,903
What are you talking about?

188
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:36,064
Wheat and rice bran are edible, too. Am I right, folks?

189
00:14:36,065 --> 00:14:39,424
Folks, as she said,

190
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:42,944
though wheat and rice bran have a rough texture,

191
00:14:42,945 --> 00:14:45,305
they fill our stomachs.

192
00:14:45,305 --> 00:14:47,623
We didn't mean to do this,

193
00:14:47,624 --> 00:14:51,044
but we want to take precautions against freeloaders who don't really need this.

194
00:14:52,264 --> 00:14:53,184
Who is the freeloader?

195
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:55,025
How could there be freeloaders?

196
00:14:55,025 --> 00:14:57,104
The two men at the front here.

197
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,244
They look well-fed.

198
00:14:59,244 --> 00:15:01,824
I guess you have abundant food at home.

199
00:15:01,825 --> 00:15:04,445
That's why you're nitpicking here.

200
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,324
Don't accuse me of that.

201
00:15:07,024 --> 00:15:08,424
Nonsense.

202
00:15:13,504 --> 00:15:14,984
You deserve your title of Master Scholar.

203
00:15:14,985 --> 00:15:17,345
Your idea is brilliant.

204
00:15:17,345 --> 00:15:20,144
Actually, it's not something new.

205
00:15:21,264 --> 00:15:25,244
You should've worked on something more important to perform your talent,

206
00:15:25,244 --> 00:15:27,184
instead of helping me here.

207
00:15:27,184 --> 00:15:28,543
Food is the primary need of the people.

208
00:15:28,544 --> 00:15:31,545
I think this is of equal significance.

209
00:15:33,864 --> 00:15:34,903
The congee is ready.

210
00:15:34,904 --> 00:15:36,263
 Give it to me first. Give it to me first. 

211
00:15:36,263 --> 00:15:38,343
 - I want some. 
 - I want congee. 

212
00:15:38,343 --> 00:15:39,785
 Here, here. 

213
00:15:40,945 --> 00:15:43,205
Official Shen, let me.

214
00:15:46,664 --> 00:15:48,364
Thank you, Your Highness.

215
00:15:49,024 --> 00:15:50,824
Your Highness.

216
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:51,964
Did you hurt yourself?

217
00:15:51,964 --> 00:15:54,545
- Your Highness, I'm sorry. 
 - Are you all right?

218
00:15:54,545 --> 00:15:56,644
Thank you so much.

219
00:15:56,644 --> 00:15:58,764
Thank you, Your Highness.

220
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,885
I don't deserve your appreciation.

221
00:16:01,885 --> 00:16:03,925
It's the world that is cruel to you.

222
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:06,824
No one is inferior to another.

223
00:16:10,664 --> 00:16:12,144
I'll take over here. You should take care of your wound.

224
00:16:12,144 --> 00:16:13,903
It's just trivial.

225
00:16:13,904 --> 00:16:15,324
It needs to be treated, even if it's minor.

226
00:16:15,324 --> 00:16:17,605
I'll take care of it once everything is settled.

227
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,685
Please be careful as well.

228
00:16:21,685 --> 00:16:23,284
I will.

229
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,510
Here.

230
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:28,640
   

231
00:16:53,185 --> 00:16:55,845
Your Highness, are you worried about First Prince and the others?

232
00:17:02,024 --> 00:17:06,065
 What would you do if you were in my shoes? 

233
00:17:13,225 --> 00:17:15,025
 Secure a food supply. 

234
00:17:19,484 --> 00:17:21,324
 I know we should secure a food supply. 

235
00:17:21,324 --> 00:17:23,484
 But how? 

236
00:17:27,784 --> 00:17:31,545
 The mightiest levee can be breached by a tiny ant hole. 

237
00:17:31,545 --> 00:17:35,884
 A tall building can be burned down by a wisp of smoke from a small gap. 

238
00:17:35,884 --> 00:17:41,704
 To secure the food supply, you need to start with one opening that can influence the whole. 

239
00:17:41,704 --> 00:17:46,503
 Otherwise, everything is but an impregnable wall that shields you off. 

240
00:17:50,544 --> 00:17:52,044
 I got it. 

241
00:17:52,064 --> 00:17:55,983
 Shoot the person first, then the horse; capture the thief first, then the king. 

242
00:18:03,544 --> 00:18:05,424
 Merchants are devious. 

243
00:18:05,425 --> 00:18:11,265
 Therefore,  you can give them a taste of their own medicine. 

244
00:18:13,465 --> 00:18:15,785
 Yes, that's right. 

245
00:18:15,785 --> 00:18:19,404
 You used to mock me that "Only women and villains are hard to tackle." 

246
00:18:19,404 --> 00:18:21,664
 Isn't that a suitable way to deal with this problem? 

247
00:18:21,664 --> 00:18:25,024
 Merchants are the villains, while I'm a woman. 

248
00:18:25,024 --> 00:18:29,543
 I might as well outfox them and be more shameless than them. 

249
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,464
   

250
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:39,965
Your Highness.

251
00:18:42,784 --> 00:18:44,644
You forgot to apply ointment.

252
00:18:45,744 --> 00:18:47,524
Thank you for reminding me.

253
00:18:52,985 --> 00:18:54,885
 It's him again. 

254
00:19:02,705 --> 00:19:03,904
I remember him.

255
00:19:03,905 --> 00:19:08,625
He was sneakily wandering around Jishan Hall yesterday.

256
00:19:30,824 --> 00:19:32,524
Xiaotang.

257
00:19:41,185 --> 00:19:42,685
Your Highness.

258
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:51,985
Were you calling General Xue just now?

259
00:20:00,404 --> 00:20:03,764
Do you think he's General Xue?

260
00:20:04,744 --> 00:20:06,344
Could it be a mistake?

261
00:20:06,344 --> 00:20:07,704
No.

262
00:20:07,704 --> 00:20:09,545
I wouldn't make such a mistake.

263
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,125
It turns out he's alive.

264
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,624
But why does he avoid me?

265
00:20:31,784 --> 00:20:33,384
Thank you.

266
00:20:33,425 --> 00:20:34,984
Remember this.

267
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:36,864
I want the best bird's nest and moose face meat.

268
00:20:36,865 --> 00:20:39,023
Never brush me off with inferior-quality ingredients.

269
00:20:39,024 --> 00:20:40,524
It's Butler Zhang.

270
00:20:40,544 --> 00:20:42,964
I can ask him what Zhimo's favorite food is.

271
00:20:42,964 --> 00:20:43,904
Thank you.

272
00:20:43,905 --> 00:20:45,505
Have a nice day.

273
00:20:51,344 --> 00:20:54,185
What a coincidence. Butler Zhang.

274
00:20:55,665 --> 00:20:59,565
Are you Miss Mu's maid?

275
00:20:59,565 --> 00:21:02,059
That was an intense hit.

276
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:04,324
My bones were almost dislodged.

277
00:21:04,324 --> 00:21:06,725
My apologies, Butler Zhang.

278
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:09,084
I lost control of my strength. I'll give you a massage.

279
00:21:09,084 --> 00:21:10,845
It's okay.

280
00:21:10,845 --> 00:21:14,084
Oh, right. Butler Zhang. Can I ask you something?

281
00:21:14,744 --> 00:21:16,704
Do you know what Zhimo likes to eat?

282
00:21:16,705 --> 00:21:18,023
Why are you asking this?

283
00:21:18,024 --> 00:21:20,004
I want to give him a treat.

284
00:21:20,004 --> 00:21:21,604
A treat?

285
00:21:21,604 --> 00:21:23,604
But he's not in the capital.

286
00:21:24,225 --> 00:21:25,964
He's not here?

287
00:21:31,744 --> 00:21:32,624
My Lord,

288
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:36,325
Princess Roujia headed to Yongding County, the disaster-stricken area in Huaizhou.

289
00:21:37,064 --> 00:21:39,004
Head to Yongding, then.

290
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,184
Everyone will get a share.

291
00:21:45,184 --> 00:21:46,784
- Take this. 
  - Carry everything to the yard. 

292
00:21:46,784 --> 00:21:47,944
Thank you, Your Highness.

293
00:21:47,945 --> 00:21:49,484
- It's for you. 
 - Thank you, Your Highness.

294
00:21:49,484 --> 00:21:50,823
- Thank you, Your Highness. 
 - Take this.

295
00:21:50,824 --> 00:21:52,605
Thank you, Your Highness.

296
00:21:53,304 --> 00:21:54,664
Thank you, Your Highness.

297
00:21:54,665 --> 00:21:55,743
I want some, too.

298
00:21:55,744 --> 00:21:57,604
Please have it. It's yours.

299
00:21:57,604 --> 00:21:58,625
Thank you, Your Highness.

300
00:21:58,626 --> 00:22:00,664
No need to rush. Everyone will have it.

301
00:22:00,665 --> 00:22:02,165
Thank you, Your Highness.

302
00:22:08,104 --> 00:22:10,703
Hold it properly. Don't drop it.

303
00:22:14,285 --> 00:22:18,635
   

304
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:22,685
All folks of Huaizhou,

305
00:22:22,685 --> 00:22:29,084
    
 First Prince led us to Huaizhou under the mission of disaster relief.

306
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:35,403
Unexpectedly, First Prince didn't anticipate the severity of the disaster here.

307
00:22:35,403 --> 00:22:38,964
Official relief alone won't be enough.

308
00:22:40,884 --> 00:22:47,484
Fortunately, our local merchants have chipped in generously

309
00:22:47,504 --> 00:22:52,903
and sent aid to the people to protect everyone throughout this disaster.

310
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:56,745
Our merchants of Huaizhou are indeed great philanthropists.

311
00:22:57,418 --> 00:23:02,524
Therefore, I'm going to display the list of merchants' contributions.

312
00:23:02,524 --> 00:23:05,704
On behalf of the First Prince, I express my gratitude for the generous donation.

313
00:23:05,705 --> 00:23:09,205
 Good. 

314
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:13,144
Look. The donations are small.

315
00:23:17,905 --> 00:23:21,804
How shameless these local despots are!

316
00:23:23,304 --> 00:23:26,303
How dare they act so audaciously when they coughed up such little grain to the government!

317
00:23:26,303 --> 00:23:28,645
This is out of line!

318
00:23:28,645 --> 00:23:30,984
They disrespect the imperial court!

319
00:23:30,985 --> 00:23:32,424
They deceive the people!

320
00:23:32,425 --> 00:23:34,224
Let's go and confront them!

321
00:23:34,225 --> 00:23:37,044
Let's go! Everyone!

322
00:23:37,044 --> 00:23:39,765
 Let's go! 

323
00:23:47,304 --> 00:23:48,704
Little boy,

324
00:23:48,704 --> 00:23:52,943
don't worry. The government won't let the people go hungry.

325
00:23:52,943 --> 00:23:55,083
Excuse me. Give me the flatbread.

326
00:23:55,985 --> 00:23:58,423
Here you go. Take this flatbread.

327
00:23:58,423 --> 00:23:59,543
Thank you.

328
00:23:59,544 --> 00:24:01,244
You should head home.

329
00:24:01,244 --> 00:24:02,804
Go ahead.

330
00:24:10,905 --> 00:24:12,405
Your Highness.

331
00:24:14,425 --> 00:24:16,705
They ask for trouble themselves.

332
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:20,784
I shall see how long they can hold on.

333
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:27,350
 [Mu Residence 

334
00:24:43,344 --> 00:24:45,184
Who was it? Who is this outrageous?

335
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:46,543
We're coming at you.

336
00:24:46,544 --> 00:24:49,203
The richest merchant in Jiangnan merely donated chicken feed.

337
00:24:49,203 --> 00:24:50,605
You have no conscience at all!

338
00:24:50,605 --> 00:24:53,063
 ♪ What do the rich eat when their meat is running out? ♪ 

339
00:24:53,064 --> 00:24:55,924
 - ♪ They eat the relief grain that belongs to the people ♪  
 - Beat this rat to a pulp!

340
00:24:55,924 --> 00:24:58,524
 Beat him! Beat him! 

341
00:24:58,524 --> 00:25:00,305
 Beat him! 

342
00:25:03,124 --> 00:25:04,924
Close the gates.

343
00:25:09,404 --> 00:25:10,543
What on earth is going on?

344
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:12,144
Old Master, bad news!

345
00:25:12,145 --> 00:25:15,485
First Prince displayed our donation details.

346
00:25:15,485 --> 00:25:17,725
And it has ignited the people's outrage.

347
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:19,543
We're not the only ones who offered little donations.

348
00:25:19,544 --> 00:25:21,103
Why are they blocking in front of my residence?

349
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:23,384
The people's rage is overwhelming.

350
00:25:23,385 --> 00:25:26,104
We're not the only household they're blocking.

351
00:25:31,824 --> 00:25:36,104
To think that First Prince and Mu Zhuohua would undermine those merchants.

352
00:25:36,104 --> 00:25:40,084
They actually exposed the names of those who offer paltry donations, giving them no quarter.

353
00:25:40,084 --> 00:25:42,405
It's a considerable growth.

354
00:25:43,504 --> 00:25:46,144
True, First Prince has changed a lot.

355
00:25:52,024 --> 00:25:53,524
Right, let's go.

356
00:25:53,524 --> 00:25:55,103
My Lord.

357
00:25:55,104 --> 00:25:57,764
Don't we have to inform First Prince about our arrival?

358
00:25:58,504 --> 00:26:00,004
No need.

359
00:26:00,004 --> 00:26:03,545
We came here in secret.

360
00:26:03,545 --> 00:26:06,824
No need to meddle in their action.

361
00:26:07,344 --> 00:26:10,405
Now, Roujia isn't at the relay station.

362
00:26:11,344 --> 00:26:13,304
What about Xue Xiaotang?

363
00:26:14,145 --> 00:26:16,665
He must be around Jishan Hall.

364
00:26:18,985 --> 00:26:22,585
Zhijian, I need you to do something for me.

365
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,635
   

366
00:26:38,824 --> 00:26:40,524
It's Lord Ding.

367
00:26:47,633 --> 00:26:49,533
 This can't be. 

368
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:51,724
 He wouldn't come to Jiangnan. 

369
00:26:51,724 --> 00:26:53,704
 It's an illusion. 

370
00:26:53,704 --> 00:26:55,023
 Forget it. 

371
00:26:55,024 --> 00:26:56,743
 I have something important to deal with tomorrow. 

372
00:26:56,744 --> 00:26:58,540
 Stop overthinking. 

373
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,700
   

374
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:02,783
Old Master,

375
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,904
as of now, our stores on Jinyang Street have been closed for days.

376
00:27:04,905 --> 00:27:06,743
This can't go on.

377
00:27:06,744 --> 00:27:08,263
We're facing the same problem.

378
00:27:08,264 --> 00:27:11,823
Plus, some kids are singing rhymes insulting the Mu family.

379
00:27:11,824 --> 00:27:16,625
Everyone points the finger at us when we go out, let alone run the business.

380
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:19,184
It'll become worse.

381
00:27:19,185 --> 00:27:22,764
- What should we do now? 
 - All you do is complain to me.

382
00:27:22,764 --> 00:27:25,705
Come up with a solution, will you?

383
00:27:25,705 --> 00:27:27,505
Expel them.

384
00:27:27,505 --> 00:27:29,764
Only if you want our business to close down.

385
00:27:29,764 --> 00:27:32,084
Then... Just ignore them?

386
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:34,384
We can't let this continue, after all.

387
00:27:35,104 --> 00:27:40,203
Our reputation will be tarnished in Yongding County and even the entire Huaizhou.

388
00:27:41,264 --> 00:27:42,664
Old Master.

389
00:27:42,665 --> 00:27:44,103
What again?

390
00:27:44,104 --> 00:27:46,303
Old Master, a scholar is outside.

391
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:49,846
He claims to have a solution to the Mu family's current difficulty.

392
00:27:57,264 --> 00:27:58,743
Invite him in now.

393
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:00,444
Open the gate.

394
00:28:00,444 --> 00:28:02,284
Please, sir.

395
00:28:06,104 --> 00:28:07,704
Please.

396
00:28:23,145 --> 00:28:25,524
I'm Mu Zhuohua from Yanzhou.

397
00:28:25,524 --> 00:28:27,964
I came from the same clan as you, Old Master Mu.

398
00:28:27,964 --> 00:28:33,325
I followed the First Prince and Princess Roujia here a few days ago.

399
00:28:34,584 --> 00:28:36,624
Mu Zhuohua.

400
00:28:36,624 --> 00:28:38,823
You have quite the nerve to bring up our clan.

401
00:28:38,824 --> 00:28:42,644
I wouldn't have gotten chewed out so badly if it weren't for you.

402
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:45,405
Old Master Mu,

403
00:28:45,425 --> 00:28:49,044
you made your donation, and we announced this to the public.

404
00:28:49,044 --> 00:28:54,625
I wonder what we've done wrong in this.

405
00:28:56,425 --> 00:28:58,823
Do you serve the imperial court now, Official Mu?

406
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:00,324
Yes, I do.

407
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:02,103
I'm the administrator of the Ministry of Rites.

408
00:29:02,104 --> 00:29:04,465
A primary sixth-rank official.

409
00:29:08,584 --> 00:29:11,144
Greetings, Official Mu.

410
00:29:21,985 --> 00:29:23,424
Old Master Mu,

411
00:29:23,425 --> 00:29:28,904
the reason why I didn't visit other merchants is because I'm aware

412
00:29:28,905 --> 00:29:33,064
that you're sensible and righteous.

413
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:39,025
Hence, I'm willing to come here along with my solution.

414
00:29:40,705 --> 00:29:42,985
Official Mu,

415
00:29:42,985 --> 00:29:45,125
may I know what your solution is?

416
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:49,644
Open your granary to the public.

417
00:29:56,744 --> 00:29:59,344
No way. I will never do that!

418
00:30:01,544 --> 00:30:02,904
Old Master Mu,

419
00:30:02,905 --> 00:30:06,225
Now is a pivotal moment.

420
00:30:06,225 --> 00:30:09,984
Do you want to remain as the wealthiest man in Jiangnan,

421
00:30:09,985 --> 00:30:13,050
who's exalted by the people,

422
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:17,000
or taking sides with other merchants

423
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,444
and getting tossed into infamy?

424
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:23,824
Merchants always go for the biggest interests.

425
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:26,224
Which path is the right one to go with?

426
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:29,725
Old Master Mu, can't you tell?

427
00:30:32,185 --> 00:30:33,664
But...

428
00:30:34,344 --> 00:30:35,900
But...

429
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:40,580
- Old Master... 
 - But it's imperative to be the first to act

430
00:30:40,584 --> 00:30:43,625
to obtain the best result ever.

431
00:30:46,385 --> 00:30:48,165
How so?

432
00:30:49,985 --> 00:30:54,503
If you're not willing to be the first one to act, sooner or later,

433
00:30:54,504 --> 00:30:57,643
someone will open their granary to the public as they can't stand the public outrage.

434
00:30:57,643 --> 00:31:02,943
By that time, everyone will sing praises of them for being the first welldoer,

435
00:31:02,943 --> 00:31:08,143
while the other merchants who act later will be pegged as following suit.

436
00:31:08,744 --> 00:31:09,984
Old Master Mu,

437
00:31:09,985 --> 00:31:14,063
I've analyzed the current situation very clearly to you.

438
00:31:14,064 --> 00:31:17,804
If you still refuse to open the granary,

439
00:31:17,804 --> 00:31:22,105
I will visit another merchant.

440
00:31:22,105 --> 00:31:24,064
Please stay, Official Mu.

441
00:31:26,225 --> 00:31:29,104
You have a good point, Official Mu.

442
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:32,930
There are so many merchants in Huaizhou,

443
00:31:33,744 --> 00:31:36,384
and not everyone can commit to the same goal.

444
00:31:36,385 --> 00:31:39,964
Thus, someone has to stand out.

445
00:31:42,824 --> 00:31:44,424
I'll do it.

446
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:47,164
Thank you, Old Master Mu.

447
00:31:47,164 --> 00:31:48,364
You're welcome.

448
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,185
I shall take my leave, then.

449
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:01,224
Darling,

450
00:32:01,225 --> 00:32:06,365
don't you think this Official Mu seems familiar?

451
00:32:11,225 --> 00:32:14,424
Why can't our family have a witty person like her?

452
00:32:14,425 --> 00:32:16,923
 You have so many concubines and children. 

453
00:32:16,923 --> 00:32:18,063
 But you never care about them. 

454
00:32:18,064 --> 00:32:20,183
- You're not blessed with such a gift. 
 - You!

455
00:32:20,183 --> 00:32:23,705
 In the end, you couldn't even recognize your own daughter. 

456
00:32:34,225 --> 00:32:36,464
We've resolved the most pressing problem.

457
00:32:36,465 --> 00:32:38,804
Her Highness must be glad.

458
00:32:39,905 --> 00:32:41,764
The Mu family takes the lead in distributing grain supplies.

459
00:32:41,764 --> 00:32:44,543
The other merchants can't get other excuses, then.

460
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,944
That's right.

461
00:32:56,744 --> 00:33:02,264
 Great! 

462
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:09,343
Jinghong,

463
00:33:09,344 --> 00:33:12,604
please deliver the provision to Sister Jiao in Jishan Hall.

464
00:33:12,604 --> 00:33:14,205
Yes, Your Highness.

465
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:21,851
   

466
00:33:27,871 --> 00:33:30,751
With one person standing up, others will follow suit.

467
00:33:30,751 --> 00:33:34,505
This is an expedient method.

468
00:33:34,985 --> 00:33:36,485
My Lord,

469
00:33:36,485 --> 00:33:38,165
are you worried about her?

470
00:33:38,985 --> 00:33:41,424
I'm just talking about the matter itself.

471
00:33:45,425 --> 00:33:46,704
All right. Next, please.

472
00:33:46,705 --> 00:33:49,725
Is Xue Xiaotang here?

473
00:33:50,425 --> 00:33:52,825
He'll show up as long as Roujia is here.

474
00:33:52,825 --> 00:33:55,543
Xue Xiaotang comes from Jingzhou.

475
00:33:55,544 --> 00:33:57,684
He's an orphan

476
00:33:57,684 --> 00:34:00,525
and has no friends or relatives in Southern Chen.

477
00:34:01,104 --> 00:34:03,704
He ascended from a commoner to the Grand General of the Nation.

478
00:34:03,705 --> 00:34:05,524
Surely, he has his own way.

479
00:34:05,524 --> 00:34:08,484
He's good at hiding and face disguise skills.

480
00:34:08,484 --> 00:34:11,844
It won't be easy to identify him in a crowd.

481
00:34:16,024 --> 00:34:18,785
General Xue, you're really good at hiding.

482
00:34:21,345 --> 00:34:23,325
I found you.

483
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,635
   

484
00:34:53,465 --> 00:34:55,365
Old geezer,

485
00:34:55,365 --> 00:35:00,604
you have quite a mood to fish here when you have one foot in the grave.

486
00:35:04,024 --> 00:35:09,704
If you drink the dirty water here, you'll go into the grave before me.

487
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:20,624
By any chance, are you Tutor Shang of the academy in the east of the town?

488
00:35:22,504 --> 00:35:26,385
It seems that I'm quite famous.

489
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:29,344
Previously, the water level declined,

490
00:35:29,344 --> 00:35:33,143
and the locusts laid eggs along the bank.

491
00:35:33,144 --> 00:35:35,185
If you were to drink the water here,

492
00:35:35,185 --> 00:35:39,023
I'm afraid your stomach will be filled with eggs tonight.

493
00:35:39,024 --> 00:35:42,825
You may suffer from vomiting and diarrhea till you're dead.

494
00:35:45,064 --> 00:35:47,624
Please help me, sir.

495
00:35:49,144 --> 00:35:50,623
All right.

496
00:35:50,624 --> 00:35:52,424
I tell you what.

497
00:35:53,144 --> 00:35:55,185
After you go back,

498
00:35:56,745 --> 00:36:02,744
filter the river water with fine sand to remove dirt.

499
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:07,304
Then boil the water with charcoal.

500
00:36:07,305 --> 00:36:09,205
It's safe to drink, then.

501
00:36:11,064 --> 00:36:14,004
Thank you for saving my life, Tutor Shang.

502
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:29,030
   

503
00:36:32,584 --> 00:36:33,864
Qi.

504
00:36:33,865 --> 00:36:36,465
It's been a long while, old geezer.

505
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:39,505
Have a taste.

506
00:36:49,825 --> 00:36:52,423
- How does it taste? 
 - Fine brew.

507
00:36:52,423 --> 00:36:53,425
Of course.

508
00:36:53,426 --> 00:36:57,143
I'd been searching throughout all liquor stores in Huaizhou

509
00:36:57,144 --> 00:37:00,265
and got this small jar of peach blossom brew.

510
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:04,123
I need more than this little jar.

511
00:37:04,123 --> 00:37:07,024
I can only wet my whistle with it.

512
00:37:11,224 --> 00:37:12,924
Sir.

513
00:37:13,923 --> 00:37:15,723
What are you doing?

514
00:37:17,865 --> 00:37:19,265
Please pardon me.

515
00:37:19,265 --> 00:37:21,884
I've been away for years.

516
00:37:21,884 --> 00:37:23,865
Fortunately, you're safe and healthy.

517
00:37:23,865 --> 00:37:25,925
Cut that out.

518
00:37:25,925 --> 00:37:30,997
I came here to apologize because I didn't visit you right after I came here.

519
00:37:30,997 --> 00:37:33,785
I was dealing with disaster relief.

520
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:37,663
Had you come straight to me, I would've thrown you out.

521
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,903
- Do you believe me? 
 - I do.

522
00:37:55,624 --> 00:37:57,744
That's nothing to look at.

523
00:37:57,744 --> 00:37:59,344
I forgot to throw them away.

524
00:37:59,345 --> 00:38:00,724
Sir,

525
00:38:00,724 --> 00:38:04,825
I didn't know you still kept my handwriting

526
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:09,445
and essays I wrote when I was little.

527
00:38:09,465 --> 00:38:12,304
I told you I forgot to get rid of them.

528
00:38:12,304 --> 00:38:14,144
Come on and sit.

529
00:38:15,905 --> 00:38:19,104
Right away. Later, I'll write some more for you

530
00:38:19,104 --> 00:38:22,380
so that you can have it as a keepsake.

531
00:38:23,524 --> 00:38:25,524
Come over and sit.

532
00:38:27,345 --> 00:38:31,085
You must have been tired since coming here.

533
00:38:33,064 --> 00:38:38,384
While I was away these years, why do you have so much gray hair?

534
00:38:38,385 --> 00:38:40,663
Don't make a fuss about it.

535
00:38:40,664 --> 00:38:41,984
I'm old now.

536
00:38:41,985 --> 00:38:43,485
Sit.

537
00:38:44,425 --> 00:38:46,125
Listen here.

538
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:50,404
You're old now, and the town is in chaos.

539
00:38:50,404 --> 00:38:54,043
Please stay at home and don't wander around. All right?

540
00:38:54,043 --> 00:38:57,244
You're talking to your teacher. Mind your language.

541
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,244
Well, listen.

542
00:39:01,064 --> 00:39:06,424
I know this place is comfy, but I can't find peace here.

543
00:39:07,104 --> 00:39:11,445
Instead, I feel peaceful in the chaos outside.

544
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:17,925
After all, it's because of my incompetence.

545
00:39:17,925 --> 00:39:19,183
Don't say that.

546
00:39:19,184 --> 00:39:21,645
You were doing a kind deed just now.

547
00:39:21,645 --> 00:39:25,457
That's all I can do.

548
00:39:25,985 --> 00:39:27,724
But you're different.

549
00:39:27,724 --> 00:39:32,024
This disaster relief effort might seem successful,

550
00:39:32,024 --> 00:39:34,483
and you managed to get the merchants to donate grain supplies.

551
00:39:34,483 --> 00:39:38,965
However, have you thought about where the official grains went?

552
00:39:39,664 --> 00:39:40,744
I did.

553
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:42,445
I did think about it.

554
00:39:42,445 --> 00:39:46,364
That's why I'm here to seek your enlightenment.

555
00:39:46,364 --> 00:39:50,758
I feel that there are some complexities behind this.

556
00:39:50,758 --> 00:39:53,585
I'll tell you this.

557
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:58,543
When the locusts showed up initially, they could've nipped the disaster in the bud.

558
00:39:58,543 --> 00:40:02,705
However, Zhuang Wenfeng led the people to pay homage to the God of Locusts,

559
00:40:02,705 --> 00:40:06,965
leaving the disaster unbridled to rampage the entire town.

560
00:40:06,965 --> 00:40:08,924
Zhuang Wenfeng?

561
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:45,000


562
00:40:47,694 --> 00:40:55,053
♫  I can't forget the love that is still is nipping at my ears and temples  ♫

563
00:40:55,053 --> 00:41:02,353
♫  Memories keep slamming into rocks and have nowhere to berth  ♫

564
00:41:02,353 --> 00:41:09,793
♫  Both sides gaze at each other in the drizzling rain, but one has turned into clouds and mist  ♫

565
00:41:09,793 --> 00:41:18,313
♫  Leaving the isolated heart's island, like waves without a shore  ♫

566
00:41:18,313 --> 00:41:21,953
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

567
00:41:21,953 --> 00:41:25,613
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

568
00:41:25,613 --> 00:41:29,633
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

569
00:41:29,633 --> 00:41:33,113
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

570
00:41:33,114 --> 00:41:36,733
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

571
00:41:36,733 --> 00:41:40,353
♫  Obviously willing to swear life and death 
 to be entangled for a lifetime  ♫

572
00:41:40,354 --> 00:41:44,653
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

573
00:41:44,653 --> 00:41:50,454
♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

574
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:11,553
♫  I can't forget the turmoil of love and hate, 
 even if the next day is far away  ♫

575
00:42:11,553 --> 00:42:20,113
♫  Two souls embrace in chaos, how can it be written off?  ♫

576
00:42:20,113 --> 00:42:23,793
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

577
00:42:23,793 --> 00:42:27,433
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

578
00:42:27,433 --> 00:42:31,313
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

579
00:42:31,314 --> 00:42:34,753
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

580
00:42:34,754 --> 00:42:38,553
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

581
00:42:38,553 --> 00:42:42,233
♫  Obviously can't be erased, and haunted by lingering dreams  ♫

582
00:42:42,234 --> 00:42:46,113
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

583
00:42:46,113 --> 00:42:53,594
♫  Want to have one more glimpse of you, 
 even just for a second more  ♫
