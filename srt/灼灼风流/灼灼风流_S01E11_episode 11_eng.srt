1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:25,260


2
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,459
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:35,100
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:47,879
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,159
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,259
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,479
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,579
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,579
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:18,739
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

12
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:24,100
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,139
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:36,918
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,319
   

16
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:43,059
   

17
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:45,239
   

18
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:48,139
   

19
00:01:48,139 --> 00:01:50,984
   

20
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,384
Everyone.

21
00:01:52,385 --> 00:01:55,605
 I think Miss Mu dare not come. 

22
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,165
 Yes. 

23
00:01:57,165 --> 00:02:00,084
 How would a mere woman have the guts to come here? 

24
00:02:00,084 --> 00:02:01,485
 Exactly. 

25
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:03,984
 She seemed to be so confident the other day. 

26
00:02:03,984 --> 00:02:06,444
 Turns out she's such a coward. 

27
00:02:08,464 --> 00:02:11,124
What if she comes here?

28
00:02:11,124 --> 00:02:13,405
Just as well.

29
00:02:13,405 --> 00:02:17,825
A female Tanhua visits a brothel.

30
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:21,145
Bravo.

31
00:02:22,505 --> 00:02:25,323
Though people come here to seek pleasure, some patrons are with literary prowess.

32
00:02:25,323 --> 00:02:27,285
Hence, this place turns out to be elegant.

33
00:02:28,225 --> 00:02:30,685
Precisely, Mr. Sun.

34
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:33,923
You're indeed the descendant of the Sun clan of Jiangzuo.

35
00:02:33,923 --> 00:02:35,384
You're upright.

36
00:02:35,385 --> 00:02:35,985
Rightfully so.

37
00:02:35,986 --> 00:02:38,104
- Rightfully so. 
 - We were just kidding.

38
00:02:38,304 --> 00:02:40,424
Yes, it was a joke.

39
00:02:40,424 --> 00:02:42,064
My apologies.

40
00:02:42,064 --> 00:02:43,725
I'm late.

41
00:02:45,345 --> 00:02:47,044
- Brother Sun.  
 - Miss Mu.

42
00:02:47,044 --> 00:02:48,505
 Come on. 

43
00:02:52,065 --> 00:02:54,645
- Let's have a drink. 
 - You're late, Mr. Shen.

44
00:02:54,645 --> 00:02:56,604
You must take three shots.

45
00:02:56,604 --> 00:02:58,245
- That's right. 
 - You're too late.

46
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:00,285
- Come on here. 
 - Take a seat.

47
00:03:01,545 --> 00:03:03,945
Miss Mu. Let's go.

48
00:03:03,945 --> 00:03:05,804
Sure.

49
00:03:05,804 --> 00:03:07,385
Take your seat.

50
00:03:10,184 --> 00:03:11,544
I'm sorry for being late.

51
00:03:11,545 --> 00:03:13,045
I'll take a shot first.

52
00:03:16,024 --> 00:03:17,424
Senior.

53
00:03:19,345 --> 00:03:21,623
Miss Mu caught a cold today.

54
00:03:21,624 --> 00:03:24,085
I'll drink this for her.

55
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:30,113
Mr. Shen, you cherish her so much.

56
00:03:30,113 --> 00:03:31,423
 That's right. 

57
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:32,444
 Yes. 

58
00:03:32,444 --> 00:03:34,085
 You sure do. 

59
00:03:34,085 --> 00:03:36,844
Well, let's have another shot.

60
00:03:36,844 --> 00:03:38,345
Sure.

61
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,585
- Fill the cup. 
 - Okay.

62
00:03:46,904 --> 00:03:47,863
Nice liquor.

63
00:03:47,864 --> 00:03:50,343
Everyone. Please have more, seniors.

64
00:03:50,343 --> 00:03:51,183
Here.

65
00:03:51,184 --> 00:03:53,345
- Sure. 
 - Please drink.

66
00:03:53,345 --> 00:03:54,924
Let's drink.

67
00:03:56,245 --> 00:03:59,545
- Everyone. 
 - Brother Shen, let's drink.

68
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:08,165
Brother Shen, drink together.

69
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,805
 Great! 

70
00:04:11,624 --> 00:04:14,704
- That's the way it should be. 
 - Fill it up, sir. Here.

71
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:16,145
Official Shen, please drink.

72
00:04:16,145 --> 00:04:17,944
- Everyone, please excuse me.  
 - Sure.

73
00:04:17,944 --> 00:04:19,405
Go ahead.

74
00:04:20,424 --> 00:04:21,964
- Let's drink. 
 - Please.

75
00:04:21,964 --> 00:04:23,963
Senior, here's to you.

76
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,684
- Senior. Brother Shen. Let's drink. 
 - Nice.

77
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:28,104
- Sure. 
 - Let's drink.

78
00:04:28,105 --> 00:04:30,265
- Fill the glass up. 
 - Let's drink.

79
00:04:33,785 --> 00:04:35,544
- Nice liquor. 
 - Exactly.

80
00:04:35,544 --> 00:04:37,044
- Nice liquor. 
 - Fill the cup.

81
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,805
Fill the cup.

82
00:04:38,805 --> 00:04:41,284
- Brother Shen. 
 - Sorry to interrupt.

83
00:04:43,744 --> 00:04:49,584
The owner just received a new poetry anthology and wanted to talk with Tanhua Mu.

84
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:52,104
So, please excuse us.

85
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:53,705
Let's go.

86
00:04:53,705 --> 00:04:54,964
Poetry anthology?

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,700
Brother Shen, let's go together. The owner got a poetry anthology.

88
00:04:57,705 --> 00:04:58,823
Hold on.

89
00:04:58,824 --> 00:05:02,144
We gathered here to celebrate you all.

90
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:04,985
But you're leaving now.

91
00:05:04,985 --> 00:05:07,464
What's the point of this gathering?

92
00:05:07,465 --> 00:05:08,404
He's right.

93
00:05:08,404 --> 00:05:10,123
- You can't go. 
 - No.

94
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:12,485
- We haven't had enough fun tonight. 
 - If so, I'll stay,

95
00:05:12,485 --> 00:05:14,423
and let's have a few more rounds. What do you say?

96
00:05:14,423 --> 00:05:17,284
- Good. 
 - Both of them must stay.

97
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:19,465
Good. That's right.

98
00:05:19,465 --> 00:05:21,185
We should go now.

99
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:25,684
- She... We haven't had enough fun. 
 - Why?

100
00:05:25,684 --> 00:05:26,943
Miss Mu has left.

101
00:05:26,943 --> 00:05:30,324
Are you not willing to drink with me?

102
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:41,267
Please have some tea, My Lord.

103
00:05:44,624 --> 00:05:46,063
Taste it.

104
00:05:46,064 --> 00:05:48,845
This is your favorite Junshan Silver Needle.

105
00:05:48,845 --> 00:05:51,063
I remember you didn't like this because it had a bitter taste.

106
00:05:51,064 --> 00:05:54,705
But your taste changed after joining the army.

107
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:14,404
It's my fault.

108
00:06:14,404 --> 00:06:16,844
I shouldn't have brought it up.

109
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,145
Your Majesty.

110
00:06:22,145 --> 00:06:27,045
Something has already happened even if you didn't bring it up.

111
00:06:27,064 --> 00:06:32,064
We only get to find the meaning of being alive by facing constant pain.

112
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:36,344
All right.

113
00:06:37,744 --> 00:06:40,864
I have something to tell you.

114
00:06:54,264 --> 00:06:56,404
After the war at Juma River,

115
00:06:56,404 --> 00:07:00,503
Northern Liang was angling for a chance through testing or provoking us

116
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,304
and harassing border dwellers.

117
00:07:02,304 --> 00:07:08,704
I'd like to lure Northern Liang out under the disguise of the peace negotiation with Eastern Xia.

118
00:07:08,704 --> 00:07:14,905
So that we can forge an alliance with them to alleviate the situation at the border.

119
00:07:15,944 --> 00:07:17,644
All right.

120
00:07:17,644 --> 00:07:19,424
I give you my permission.

121
00:07:20,164 --> 00:07:22,004
Thank you, Your Majesty.

122
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,304
Here.

123
00:07:30,304 --> 00:07:32,584
Zhuohua, have the soup.

124
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,285
Thank you, Miss Song.

125
00:07:40,005 --> 00:07:41,804
Are you not drunk?

126
00:07:43,184 --> 00:07:46,264
Not really. I'm just a bit giddy.

127
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:50,425
This is my first battle after becoming an official.

128
00:07:50,425 --> 00:07:52,405
I won't back off.

129
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,963
They look down on me.

130
00:07:53,963 --> 00:07:56,145
So, I must prove myself.

131
00:07:56,145 --> 00:07:59,684
These old geezers wanted to torment me.

132
00:07:59,684 --> 00:08:03,805
But I won't jump into their trap.

133
00:08:03,805 --> 00:08:07,304
Thank you for saving me in time.

134
00:08:07,304 --> 00:08:10,303
No need to say thank you to me.

135
00:08:10,304 --> 00:08:12,864
You're so kind, Miss Song.

136
00:08:19,824 --> 00:08:21,324
Zhuohua.

137
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,125
Do you have a crush on someone?

138
00:08:27,025 --> 00:08:28,725
Miss Song,

139
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:31,904
I want to be an official and I have many things to do.

140
00:08:31,905 --> 00:08:34,543
I dare not have a crush on anyone.

141
00:08:34,544 --> 00:08:36,104
Seriously?

142
00:08:36,105 --> 00:08:39,565
Young Master Shen is very attentive to you.

143
00:08:39,565 --> 00:08:44,424
He's a famous figure in the capital and pays much attention to you.

144
00:08:44,425 --> 00:08:47,524
Miss Song, there is nothing like that.

145
00:08:47,524 --> 00:08:49,743
I have to rely on myself on this road.

146
00:08:49,744 --> 00:08:50,923
I can't depend on others.

147
00:08:50,923 --> 00:08:54,805
If that's what you think, you'll surely succeed.

148
00:08:54,805 --> 00:08:56,723
- Thank you, Miss Song. 
 - Enjoy the soup.

149
00:08:56,723 --> 00:08:58,743
I need to go to the front.

150
00:08:58,744 --> 00:09:00,444
Go ahead.

151
00:09:19,465 --> 00:09:21,265
Brother Shen.

152
00:09:21,265 --> 00:09:22,464
Did you come here to avoid drinking, too?

153
00:09:22,465 --> 00:09:23,903
You are drunk. I'm worried about you.

154
00:09:23,904 --> 00:09:25,104
So, I came to look for you.

155
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:27,604
Thank you so much, Brother Shen. Let's leave.

156
00:09:28,744 --> 00:09:30,044
Wait.

157
00:09:36,624 --> 00:09:38,324
Young Master Shen.

158
00:09:41,044 --> 00:09:43,144
Miss Mu, you're here too.

159
00:09:44,425 --> 00:09:45,925
You...

160
00:09:52,985 --> 00:09:56,764
You two... Make it quick.

161
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:58,905
I'll cover for you.

162
00:10:03,945 --> 00:10:05,445
He...

163
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,523
Did he misunderstand something?

164
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,584
Just let him be.

165
00:10:09,585 --> 00:10:11,124
- It's fine. 
 - No, it can't be.

166
00:10:11,124 --> 00:10:14,545
Brother Shen, could you please explain it to him?

167
00:10:14,545 --> 00:10:17,024
You have too many admirers.

168
00:10:17,024 --> 00:10:19,043
I don't want to be cornered.

169
00:10:19,043 --> 00:10:20,544
All right.

170
00:10:25,465 --> 00:10:26,965
Official Song.

171
00:10:29,825 --> 00:10:30,923
Young Master Shen.

172
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:34,805
Just now, I ran into Miss Mu by accident.

173
00:10:34,805 --> 00:10:36,825
Please don't misunderstand us.

174
00:10:36,825 --> 00:10:38,404
I see.

175
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:42,425
Don't worry, Young Master Shen.

176
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:44,644
I won't tell anyone.

177
00:10:45,664 --> 00:10:50,464
Official Mu adores Official Shen.

178
00:10:50,464 --> 00:10:52,984
She did that to him in Xiaoqin Pleasure House, you know?

179
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,323
- What did she do? 
 - What happened?

180
00:10:56,504 --> 00:11:00,565
Ladies, I was told that Official Mu and Official Shen had a secret rendezvous.

181
00:11:00,565 --> 00:11:02,244
Really?

182
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,763
Have you heard that Official Mu and Official Shen met in secret?

183
00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:06,985
Yes, someone caught them dating.

184
00:11:10,264 --> 00:11:12,064
- Have you heard the news? 
 - What is it?

185
00:11:12,064 --> 00:11:15,045
Official Mu and Official Shen were secretly meeting in Xiaoqin Pleasure House.

186
00:11:15,045 --> 00:11:17,784
- Did you hear that? 
 - Seriously?

187
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:27,623
Your Highness, have you heard?

188
00:11:27,623 --> 00:11:31,684
Official Shen was secretly dating Mu Zhuohua in the Xiaoqin Pleasure House.

189
00:11:34,185 --> 00:11:36,503
Both of them have their own aspiration to stick to

190
00:11:36,504 --> 00:11:40,544
and they went to great lengths to be an official.

191
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:44,924
They won't let a love relationship get in their way to affect the future.

192
00:11:44,924 --> 00:11:46,905
Your Highness...

193
00:11:47,964 --> 00:11:53,085
The flower in the vase can't be as free as giant trees out there.

194
00:11:53,085 --> 00:11:56,284
Don't jump to conclusions without solid evidence.

195
00:11:58,964 --> 00:12:02,164
Have you heard the news, My Lord?

196
00:12:02,164 --> 00:12:03,944
What news?

197
00:12:03,944 --> 00:12:07,985
A rumor about a talented couple.

198
00:12:10,345 --> 00:12:13,904
A talented couple? How so?

199
00:12:15,285 --> 00:12:18,243
The rumor resolves around the Master Scholar and the Tanhua.

200
00:12:18,243 --> 00:12:20,625
That's why it's called a talented couple.

201
00:12:23,425 --> 00:12:27,225
My Lord, Mu Zhuohua is so dishonest.

202
00:12:27,225 --> 00:12:29,164
She just lied that she admired you,

203
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:32,505
and now she's tight with Shen Jinghong.

204
00:12:32,505 --> 00:12:34,964
She's fickle.

205
00:12:37,285 --> 00:12:40,265
According to the law of Southern Chen,

206
00:12:40,265 --> 00:12:43,524
women must stand down from their position after getting married.

207
00:12:43,524 --> 00:12:45,284
She insists on becoming an official,

208
00:12:45,284 --> 00:12:49,244
why would she fall in love with someone and ruin her career?

209
00:12:50,265 --> 00:12:55,705
I... I'm upset because it's unfair to you.

210
00:12:55,705 --> 00:13:00,125
If that's true,

211
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:05,045
it's good for her to get rid of the trouble too.

212
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:09,024
You're so considerate.

213
00:13:17,444 --> 00:13:20,704
By the way, spread the word

214
00:13:20,704 --> 00:13:25,125
that Eastern Xia and Southern Chen are going to negotiate for peace in the coming days.

215
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,805
Yes, My Lord.

216
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:30,023
My Lord, this is brilliant to lure the target out in this way.

217
00:13:30,024 --> 00:13:32,985
It's time to break the spiritof Northern Liang.

218
00:13:34,065 --> 00:13:35,665
You may go.

219
00:13:36,864 --> 00:13:38,464
Yes.

220
00:13:59,864 --> 00:14:01,824
According to the intelligence from the Falcon Squad,

221
00:14:01,825 --> 00:14:04,764
this hawk claw hook comes from Northern Liang.

222
00:14:04,764 --> 00:14:08,264
It seems that His Lordship wants to get to the bottom of the past truth.

223
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:11,704
If he's going to approach Eastern Xia for peace negotiations,

224
00:14:11,705 --> 00:14:14,904
Northern Liang will definitely meddle in this.

225
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:17,324
Hmm.

226
00:14:21,064 --> 00:14:25,344
His Lordship is suddenly interrupting the affairs of the Ministry of Rites,

227
00:14:25,344 --> 00:14:28,865
and this will no doubt disrupt the plan of the hidden mastermind.

228
00:14:28,865 --> 00:14:34,105
- Who do you think will act first, Northern Liang or the hidden mastermind? 
 - Hmm.

229
00:14:37,384 --> 00:14:38,984
Can you speak human?

230
00:14:38,985 --> 00:14:41,804
Say something useful other than just "hmm".

231
00:14:41,804 --> 00:14:43,164
Hmm.

232
00:14:44,504 --> 00:14:46,485
I don't care about you.

233
00:14:56,935 --> 00:14:59,863
   

234
00:14:59,864 --> 00:15:02,344
Interesting.

235
00:15:14,024 --> 00:15:16,543
Excuse me, may I have this meal?

236
00:15:16,544 --> 00:15:19,324
You're late. Nothing is left for you.

237
00:15:19,324 --> 00:15:21,743
But there's one more here.

238
00:15:21,743 --> 00:15:23,905
Not for you.

239
00:15:23,905 --> 00:15:26,085
Not for me?

240
00:15:26,085 --> 00:15:27,543
What's going on here?

241
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:31,743
Official Shen, you haven't eaten anything after returning from the mission. Right?

242
00:15:34,705 --> 00:15:36,205
Please have this.

243
00:15:36,205 --> 00:15:37,784
But...

244
00:15:39,065 --> 00:15:43,264
Let me take a look at what good food we have here.

245
00:15:49,744 --> 00:15:54,245
Our prodigious talent has extremely different dishes.

246
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:58,005
Brother Sun, why is our food so different?

247
00:16:00,605 --> 00:16:02,405
You can have it.

248
00:16:08,764 --> 00:16:09,885
Let me tell you this.

249
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,824
In the entire capital, all girls and women

250
00:16:12,825 --> 00:16:16,263
- ranging from eighteen to eighty admire our Brother Shen... 
 - Enough said.

251
00:16:16,264 --> 00:16:17,764
You're shy.

252
00:16:17,764 --> 00:16:21,023
However, you took the advantage to approach the ladies' choice first.

253
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:22,065
Isn't this infuriating?

254
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:25,064
Brother Sun, what do you mean by I took the advantage to approach him?

255
00:16:25,065 --> 00:16:26,844
Don't play dumb.

256
00:16:26,844 --> 00:16:28,863
Jinghong gave his food to you just now.

257
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:34,143
Besides, the lovey-dovey secret meeting between you and Jinghong

258
00:16:34,144 --> 00:16:35,224
has been written into a script.

259
00:16:35,225 --> 00:16:36,503
It's now making the rounds in the entire capital.

260
00:16:36,504 --> 00:16:39,544
To be honest, I bought one copy too.

261
00:16:41,465 --> 00:16:43,485
Here, let me show you this.

262
00:16:44,644 --> 00:16:47,424
"The Pretty Tanhua Meets the Master Scholar at Night."

263
00:16:47,425 --> 00:16:49,025
Exactly.

264
00:16:55,624 --> 00:17:00,344
Brother Sun, you know what? The story is so well written.

265
00:17:00,344 --> 00:17:03,245
Miss Mu, you sure have a big heart.

266
00:17:03,245 --> 00:17:05,583
Well, stop teasing us. We'll eat this together.

267
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,044
- Sure thing. 
 - Happy now? Give me a hand.

268
00:17:12,024 --> 00:17:15,485
 Does Lord Ding know about this, too? 

269
00:17:15,485 --> 00:17:17,543
 I just confessed to him the day before, 

270
00:17:17,544 --> 00:17:19,904
 and now this misunderstanding has happened. 

271
00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:22,104
 What should I do now? 

272
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,285
   

273
00:17:43,444 --> 00:17:45,784
 I shouldn't have this expectation. 

274
00:17:45,784 --> 00:17:48,565
 She never fell for me. 

275
00:17:48,565 --> 00:17:51,524
 She wouldn't care about those rumors. 

276
00:17:54,385 --> 00:17:57,665
Official Shen, are you here for Her Highness?

277
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:02,625
Your Highness.

278
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:05,924
Have you finished teaching the kids?

279
00:18:05,924 --> 00:18:07,924
Yes, I just finished.

280
00:18:07,924 --> 00:18:11,345
So I thought to bid you farewell when I saw you here.

281
00:18:17,236 --> 00:18:21,680
   

282
00:18:26,985 --> 00:18:29,905
 I must explain the rumor to Lord Ding today. 

283
00:18:31,425 --> 00:18:34,085
My Lord, Mu Zhuohua seeks your audience.

284
00:18:35,024 --> 00:18:36,844
What does she come here for?

285
00:18:37,945 --> 00:18:40,785
Perhaps she wants to explain why she seduced you...

286
00:18:43,985 --> 00:18:46,584
Why she seduced Shen Jinghong.

287
00:18:48,245 --> 00:18:50,244
I'm busy.

288
00:18:50,244 --> 00:18:52,924
I don't have time for trivial matters.

289
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,965
Tell her to leave.

290
00:18:54,965 --> 00:18:56,445
Yes.

291
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:07,224
Miss Mu, Lord Ding is preoccupied with work.

292
00:19:07,225 --> 00:19:09,164
He wants you to go back.

293
00:19:11,064 --> 00:19:12,764
Thank you.

294
00:19:26,525 --> 00:19:29,584
Miss Mu, why are you here again?

295
00:19:29,584 --> 00:19:34,164
I had some trouble when I was compiling the documents of Northern Liang.

296
00:19:34,164 --> 00:19:38,064
Hence, I want to seek guidance from Lord Ding.

297
00:19:38,064 --> 00:19:41,584
Too bad. His Lordship has left for some business.

298
00:19:41,584 --> 00:19:43,465
He left?

299
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:47,164
Thank you.

300
00:19:50,985 --> 00:19:52,485
He's not here again.

301
00:20:12,024 --> 00:20:13,424
Let's go.

302
00:20:16,285 --> 00:20:19,085
Young Lady, must we really do this?

303
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:20,263
Yes, Juli.

304
00:20:20,264 --> 00:20:22,664
Show your bird-catching skills from your childhood.

305
00:20:22,665 --> 00:20:24,543
One shot at it.

306
00:20:24,544 --> 00:20:26,044
I'll try.

307
00:20:28,344 --> 00:20:31,043
Here they are. Come on. You can do it.

308
00:20:36,185 --> 00:20:38,964
It didn't work. Let's try with a stone.

309
00:20:38,964 --> 00:20:40,364
All right.

310
00:20:43,045 --> 00:20:44,585
Here they are, Young Lady.

311
00:20:50,104 --> 00:20:51,804
It's a stone.

312
00:20:51,804 --> 00:20:53,465
Protect His Lordship.

313
00:20:53,465 --> 00:20:55,905
My Lord, the carriage is broken.

314
00:20:57,164 --> 00:20:59,944
Bull's eye, Young Lady.

315
00:21:03,404 --> 00:21:06,164
No, don't do this. It's a misunderstanding.

316
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:13,044
It can't be fixed.

317
00:21:18,145 --> 00:21:19,945
My Lord.

318
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,264
How fortuitous. You're here, too.

319
00:21:23,264 --> 00:21:26,823
This is the only way that leads from Lord Ding's Residence to the palace.

320
00:21:28,964 --> 00:21:32,164
Something's wrong with your carriage.

321
00:21:32,164 --> 00:21:34,325
Drop the act.

322
00:21:34,325 --> 00:21:37,584
My Lord, she did this.

323
00:21:37,584 --> 00:21:41,325
- How could it be? I... I didn't... My Lord, I...

324
00:21:41,325 --> 00:21:45,644
Miss Mu, do you have a lot of time on your hands?

325
00:21:45,644 --> 00:21:50,325
No. We have many tasks at Hanlin Academy.

326
00:21:51,665 --> 00:21:53,265
Zhijian,

327
00:21:53,265 --> 00:21:55,624
claim the repair fee from them.

328
00:21:55,624 --> 00:21:56,965
Yes.

329
00:21:59,024 --> 00:22:01,185
My Lord, wait.

330
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:04,283
- My Lord. 
 - Miss Mu.

331
00:22:04,284 --> 00:22:06,284
You keep coming to me and pestering me.

332
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:07,923
What exactly are you up to?

333
00:22:07,923 --> 00:22:12,143
My Lord, have you heard any rumors recently?

334
00:22:13,264 --> 00:22:17,964
I'm busy, and I don't have time to care about your rumors.

335
00:22:17,964 --> 00:22:20,904
Please don't be angry, My Lord.

336
00:22:20,905 --> 00:22:23,444
Someone fabricated that.

337
00:22:27,104 --> 00:22:29,425
Why should I be angry?

338
00:22:31,425 --> 00:22:36,425
My Lord, I must say, this is somehow related to you.

339
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:42,305
My Lord, please don't be angry and hear me out.

340
00:22:42,305 --> 00:22:46,944
A few days ago, I had a gathering with my fellows in Xiaoqin Pleasure House.

341
00:22:46,944 --> 00:22:50,664
At that time, I had a wound on my neck.

342
00:22:50,665 --> 00:22:54,445
So, I was thinking to cover it up with a robe.

343
00:22:54,445 --> 00:23:00,063
But I forgot about that and took the robe off after I had some drinks.

344
00:23:00,063 --> 00:23:02,664
Plus, I ran into Brother Shen when he left to avoid drinking.

345
00:23:02,665 --> 00:23:06,444
Unfortunately, our fellow at Hanlin Academy caught us being together.

346
00:23:07,104 --> 00:23:11,764
And worst, he saw the red mark on my neck.

347
00:23:11,764 --> 00:23:13,584
He thought...

348
00:23:14,465 --> 00:23:16,845
Shen and I...

349
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:19,985
And everyone misunderstood us.

350
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:26,624
But, in fact, the red mark on my neck was left by you.

351
00:23:26,624 --> 00:23:31,085
I didn't defend myself to maintain your reputation.

352
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,343
Yet you've been ignoring me.

353
00:23:33,344 --> 00:23:36,624
I feel very upset.

354
00:23:40,905 --> 00:23:43,945
All right, got it.

355
00:23:46,824 --> 00:23:48,524
Got it?

356
00:23:50,064 --> 00:23:51,464
I've explained so much.

357
00:23:51,465 --> 00:23:53,905
Does he really understand?

358
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,640
   

359
00:24:57,465 --> 00:24:58,864
His Lordship asks for you.

360
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:01,164
He actually wants to see me now.

361
00:25:07,145 --> 00:25:09,384
What a weird woman.

362
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:12,184
She has such a bare-faced cheek.

363
00:25:12,184 --> 00:25:14,044
Even a strong man is afraid of a clingy woman.

364
00:25:14,044 --> 00:25:15,645
Intriguing.

365
00:25:22,425 --> 00:25:25,565
We're so fated, My Lord.

366
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:29,605
Is the carriage fixed already?

367
00:25:29,605 --> 00:25:31,405
Yes.

368
00:25:36,264 --> 00:25:40,125
Did you do your work well today?

369
00:25:40,945 --> 00:25:43,904
I reviewed the border's trading records for the past three years.

370
00:25:43,905 --> 00:25:45,504
Have you finished them?

371
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:49,925
Yes, it was a tiring day and I didn't even have time to take a sip.

372
00:25:51,465 --> 00:25:57,384
Tell me the record on the 13th day of the 9th month in the 12th year of Zhaoming.

373
00:25:58,225 --> 00:26:02,924
The 13th day of the 9th month in the 12th year of Zhaoming.

374
00:26:03,465 --> 00:26:05,065
I got it.

375
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:08,325
On this day,

376
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,845
the import registered two hundred steel blades,

377
00:26:11,845 --> 00:26:16,004
fifty cattle, thirty horses,

378
00:26:16,004 --> 00:26:19,465
while the export registered five hundred dan of rice grains,

379
00:26:19,465 --> 00:26:22,445
three hundred bolts of fabrics,

380
00:26:22,445 --> 00:26:26,244
one hundred jin of tea leaves, and thirty jin of salt.

381
00:26:26,244 --> 00:26:27,883
You actually memorized it all?

382
00:26:27,883 --> 00:26:30,305
I remember everything I read.

383
00:26:30,305 --> 00:26:34,725
The thing is, can you remember that?

384
00:26:35,865 --> 00:26:40,285
You wouldn't know even if I made up the whole thing.

385
00:26:56,504 --> 00:26:57,424
My Lord,

386
00:26:57,425 --> 00:26:59,864
Yipin Bakery is on the corner right ahead.

387
00:26:59,865 --> 00:27:04,005
At this time, there happens to be fresh crispy pastry available.

388
00:27:04,005 --> 00:27:06,245
There is always a long line outside the store.

389
00:27:06,245 --> 00:27:10,184
But if your carriage were to go there, it'd be a great honor for them.

390
00:27:10,185 --> 00:27:12,585
Naturally, we won't have to wait in line.

391
00:27:15,784 --> 00:27:20,624
You know what, their crispy pastry is delicious.

392
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:24,144
They chose the finest fillet for chopping

393
00:27:24,145 --> 00:27:26,543
and marinating in their unique sauce.

394
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:28,664
Then, it's wrapped and deep-fried.

395
00:27:28,665 --> 00:27:32,144
The outer skin is made through special procedures.

396
00:27:32,145 --> 00:27:36,084
When you bite it, it unfolds into layers of crispy skins

397
00:27:36,084 --> 00:27:39,023
and savory juices ooze out.

398
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:42,444
A blend of fragrance and mild spiciness together with the savory taste.

399
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:50,103
Zhimo, His Lordship is hungry.

400
00:27:50,104 --> 00:27:52,104
Let's go and buy the crispy pastry.

401
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,804
My Lord.

402
00:27:54,804 --> 00:27:56,465
Go ahead.

403
00:28:01,844 --> 00:28:04,385
After you, My Lord.

404
00:28:20,425 --> 00:28:22,565
You took big bites.

405
00:28:22,565 --> 00:28:26,224
My Lord, you were born in a noble origin with many rules.

406
00:28:26,225 --> 00:28:30,244
But it's best to take big bites when we're eating this.

407
00:28:30,865 --> 00:28:34,945
Have you ever followed the rules when you're with me?

408
00:28:35,784 --> 00:28:38,103
Because you're generous to tolerate me, My Lord.

409
00:28:38,104 --> 00:28:41,504
That's why I act boldly, slightly.

410
00:28:46,465 --> 00:28:48,065
Tastes good?

411
00:29:03,665 --> 00:29:08,124
About Shen Jinghong and you, you don't have to explain this to me.

412
00:29:08,124 --> 00:29:12,105
But it's better not to stand out.

413
00:29:12,105 --> 00:29:13,403
That won't do, My Lord.

414
00:29:13,403 --> 00:29:15,384
I must explain this to you.

415
00:29:15,385 --> 00:29:18,885
Otherwise, you might think I'm a deceitful person.

416
00:29:25,404 --> 00:29:27,484
I don't see why not.

417
00:29:29,584 --> 00:29:33,784
But I know you did this because you admire me.

418
00:29:33,784 --> 00:29:37,565
It has nothing to do with the path you choose.

419
00:29:37,565 --> 00:29:41,904
Maybe you can get off and think it over.

420
00:29:42,684 --> 00:29:44,284
Get off?

421
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:48,244
He actually drove me out of the carriage.

422
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:58,385
   

423
00:30:11,244 --> 00:30:13,424
I, Mu Zhuohua, the editor of Hanlin Academy,

424
00:30:13,425 --> 00:30:15,665
offer my greetings, Your Highness.

425
00:30:38,544 --> 00:30:44,144
Today, we're going to learn geography.

426
00:30:44,145 --> 00:30:47,425
Miss Mu, don't you need a scroll during the lecture?

427
00:30:48,225 --> 00:30:52,225
The content is all in my brain, not on scrolls.

428
00:30:59,504 --> 00:31:01,524
 It's Uncle's jade pendant. 

429
00:31:02,765 --> 00:31:04,704
How great of you.

430
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,925
Giving a lecture without teaching aids.

431
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:10,825
You must be smarter than Editor Shen, are you not?

432
00:31:11,485 --> 00:31:13,324
Indeed.

433
00:31:13,965 --> 00:31:16,944
At first, you were on a power trip using the name of my uncle,

434
00:31:16,944 --> 00:31:18,944
then, you curried favor with Shen Jinghong

435
00:31:18,945 --> 00:31:21,145
and got rumors spread about you and him.

436
00:31:21,905 --> 00:31:23,744
Nurturing the border enemy?

437
00:31:23,744 --> 00:31:25,485
It's all nonsense.

438
00:31:26,185 --> 00:31:29,785
We fought our way out to claim lands.

439
00:31:29,785 --> 00:31:33,544
 He's cracking the whip on the first day of the lecture. 

440
00:31:33,544 --> 00:31:35,023
 It's going to be hard times ahead. 

441
00:31:35,024 --> 00:31:36,924
Eldest Brother,

442
00:31:36,924 --> 00:31:39,505
you should give Miss Mu a chance.

443
00:31:39,505 --> 00:31:44,464
Though she's young, I believe she boasts genuine talent

444
00:31:44,465 --> 00:31:46,704
to pass the exam as a Tanhua.

445
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:49,104
Eldest Brother has always been arrogant.

446
00:31:49,104 --> 00:31:53,465
Only talents like Young Master Shen can impress him.

447
00:31:55,584 --> 00:31:59,244
I appreciate true talents and treat them with respect.

448
00:32:00,304 --> 00:32:04,865
Today, I shall see what genuine talent you've got.

449
00:32:08,304 --> 00:32:10,824
A map?

450
00:32:11,865 --> 00:32:14,205
I drew this map.

451
00:32:14,205 --> 00:32:19,743
Your Highness, each of you will either rule the nation or station in a region.

452
00:32:19,743 --> 00:32:22,783
Therefore, you need to knowabout the regional geography.

453
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:26,844
As the old saying goes, "Knowing everything about the universe and the earth."

454
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:29,904
Geography is related to people's livelihood and politics.

455
00:32:29,904 --> 00:32:31,243
It's compulsory for you.

456
00:32:31,243 --> 00:32:34,441
Do you know the geography of Northern Liang and Eastern Xia, too?

457
00:32:34,441 --> 00:32:37,303
People think that both Northern Liang and Eastern Xia

458
00:32:37,304 --> 00:32:41,125
are located in the wilderness, desert, insect-infected wetlands, or swamps,

459
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,165
which have no value.

460
00:32:43,165 --> 00:32:46,263
However, they're clueless about the advantage of these locations.

461
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:50,724
If you're interested in knowing more, I can share it with you.

462
00:32:51,544 --> 00:32:53,984
Northern Liang is rich in iron ore mines.

463
00:32:53,985 --> 00:32:57,824
They forge sharp steel blades and gallant war steeds.

464
00:32:59,245 --> 00:33:02,644
Northern Liang is the fallen enemy of Southern Chen.

465
00:33:02,644 --> 00:33:04,465
They are neither sharp nor gallant.

466
00:33:05,945 --> 00:33:10,484
Throughout history, Southern Chen has waged wars against Northern Liang over a thousand times,

467
00:33:10,484 --> 00:33:13,705
but we've never brought them down.

468
00:33:13,705 --> 00:33:16,264
Superficially, they seem to be reckless.

469
00:33:16,264 --> 00:33:18,624
But, in fact, they are devious.

470
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:23,764
They spared no effort to win a battle to earn their right to negotiate for peace.

471
00:33:23,784 --> 00:33:26,004
You're right, Miss Mu.

472
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,224
Eldest Brother,

473
00:33:27,225 --> 00:33:30,044
back then, Northern Liang exploited

474
00:33:30,044 --> 00:33:35,784
your defeat in the war to haggle over terms in the peace negotiation.

475
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:43,125
What did you say just now?

476
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:45,583
You merely live a high life in the palace.

477
00:33:45,584 --> 00:33:48,184
Do you know anything about an actual war?

478
00:33:48,184 --> 00:33:50,845
If it weren't for the traitor in the army,

479
00:33:50,845 --> 00:33:53,583
Uncle and I would've razed Northern Liang into the ground.

480
00:33:53,584 --> 00:33:56,284
That matches what Miss Mu said, though.

481
00:33:56,304 --> 00:34:02,284
The Northern Liang are so cunning that they planted spies right under your nose,

482
00:34:02,284 --> 00:34:04,585
and blatantly blinded you and Uncle.

483
00:34:07,784 --> 00:34:10,304
Who are you to mock us?

484
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:13,024
All you do is hide in the palace.

485
00:34:13,024 --> 00:34:16,965
Only Uncle and I were fighting on the front line.

486
00:34:16,965 --> 00:34:18,503
I could've fought on the front line, too.

487
00:34:18,504 --> 00:34:20,384
But I didn't have a chance.

488
00:34:20,385 --> 00:34:22,385
Eldest Brother,

489
00:34:22,385 --> 00:34:26,665
speaking of martial skills, I doubt that you can defeat me.

490
00:34:34,184 --> 00:34:35,684
Fine.

491
00:34:37,104 --> 00:34:39,264
Let's have a spar today.

492
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:44,204
Whoever admits defeat first is a coward.

493
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,004
First Prince.

494
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:55,645
Second Prince, please stop them.

495
00:35:01,584 --> 00:35:04,303
Second Prince, maybe you should inform Lord Ding.

496
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:07,464
They listen to Lord Ding.

497
00:35:14,465 --> 00:35:15,865
First Prince!

498
00:35:16,305 --> 00:35:17,464
First Prince!

499
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:19,100
Third Prince, please stop.

500
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,660
   

501
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:22,283
Your Highnesses.

502
00:35:22,283 --> 00:35:25,304
It's a geography lecture today, not martial training.

503
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:29,344
His Majesty would be furious if he saw this.

504
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:35,483
Please stop, Your Highness.  Stop fighting!

505
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:41,264
Pretend that you went out to find Lord Ding.

506
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,664
Yes.

507
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,585
Stop fighting.

508
00:35:52,425 --> 00:35:54,183
Eldest Brother! Third Brother!

509
00:35:54,184 --> 00:35:55,424
Why are you fighting here?

510
00:35:55,425 --> 00:35:57,063
We're all brothers.

511
00:35:57,064 --> 00:35:58,824
Let's stop before hurting each other.

512
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:00,204
Second Brother, don't worry.

513
00:36:00,204 --> 00:36:01,943
I won't hurt Eldest Brother.

514
00:36:01,943 --> 00:36:04,124
Watch yourself around me instead.

515
00:36:06,704 --> 00:36:09,303
Your Highness, Lord Ding isn't at the Court of Territorial Affairs.

516
00:36:09,303 --> 00:36:10,464
I left them a note.

517
00:36:10,465 --> 00:36:13,344
They will relay the message to Lord Ding once he returns.

518
00:36:17,504 --> 00:36:20,083
Your Highness, stop fighting.

519
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:24,865
Third Prince.

520
00:36:28,724 --> 00:36:30,763
Third Brother, listen to me.

521
00:36:30,763 --> 00:36:33,103
Eldest Brother has fought in real wars.

522
00:36:33,104 --> 00:36:34,764
No need to feel ashamed if you lost to him.

523
00:36:34,764 --> 00:36:37,024
How could I lose?

524
00:36:37,024 --> 00:36:39,285
He just went for a few defeated wars.

525
00:36:39,285 --> 00:36:42,565
I'm going to beat you until you shut your mouth.

526
00:36:43,584 --> 00:36:44,784
Eldest Brother.

527
00:36:45,624 --> 00:36:46,683
Second Brother!

528
00:36:46,683 --> 00:36:47,885
Second Prince!

529
00:36:47,885 --> 00:36:49,605
I'm going all out.

530
00:37:06,064 --> 00:37:07,223
Your Highness, are you all right?

531
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:08,924
First Prince!

532
00:37:08,924 --> 00:37:10,524
- Get the imperial physician now! 
 - First Prince.

533
00:37:10,524 --> 00:37:12,545
Are you all right, Your Highness?

534
00:37:12,545 --> 00:37:13,944
- Are you all right? 
 - Please let me check on your wound.

535
00:37:13,945 --> 00:37:15,924
How dare you! Get away from him!

536
00:37:15,924 --> 00:37:18,444
Second Brother, I didn't mean to hurt him.

537
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,503
First Prince.

538
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:21,824
Your blood vessel is punctured.

539
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:23,624
It's urgent.

540
00:37:23,624 --> 00:37:24,864
I know some healing skills.

541
00:37:24,865 --> 00:37:26,904
Please allow me to perform acupuncture to stop the bleeding.

542
00:37:26,905 --> 00:37:29,083
No. What if you make a mistake?

543
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:30,405
Where's the imperial physician?

544
00:37:30,405 --> 00:37:32,743
- Why are you standing here? Go and bring the imperial physician over. 
 - Yes.

545
00:37:32,743 --> 00:37:35,603
First Prince, our wound needs to be handled right now.

546
00:37:35,603 --> 00:37:39,504
I swear with my life, I won't hurt you.

547
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:44,410
   

548
00:37:49,905 --> 00:37:52,023
Your Majesty, bad news!

549
00:37:52,024 --> 00:37:54,703
The First Prince and the Third Prince fought at Zhixing College.

550
00:37:54,704 --> 00:37:56,304
Peilan, get ready with the sedan chair.

551
00:37:56,305 --> 00:37:58,465
I'm going to Zhixing College now.

552
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:07,324
First Prince, please bear with it.

553
00:38:42,104 --> 00:38:44,484
The bleeding has stopped.

554
00:38:49,905 --> 00:38:52,624
I owe you a favor.

555
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:56,384
Carry His Highness back to his chamber now.

556
00:38:56,385 --> 00:38:57,885
Yes.

557
00:39:02,385 --> 00:39:05,084
Third Prince, please let me check your wound.

558
00:39:05,084 --> 00:39:07,664
No... No need. It's just skin trauma.

559
00:39:16,144 --> 00:39:17,544
Brother,

560
00:39:18,304 --> 00:39:20,385
I lost it.

561
00:39:20,385 --> 00:39:22,925
Luckily, she knows about healing skills.

562
00:39:22,925 --> 00:39:24,344
Yes.

563
00:39:24,345 --> 00:39:27,205
Unexpectedly, she's skilled.

564
00:39:27,224 --> 00:39:31,345
I guess Eldest Brother's leg has been saved.

565
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:34,264
Yes, it's saved.

566
00:39:34,264 --> 00:39:37,925
Here comes Her Highness the Empress Dowager.

567
00:39:47,165 --> 00:39:48,684
Greetings, Grandmother.

568
00:39:48,684 --> 00:39:49,904
Chen'er.

569
00:39:49,905 --> 00:39:51,384
Don't worry, Grandmother.

570
00:39:51,385 --> 00:39:53,284
I'm all right now.

571
00:39:53,945 --> 00:39:55,223
What are you waiting for?

572
00:39:55,224 --> 00:39:57,103
Go and check on him.

573
00:39:57,104 --> 00:39:58,504
Yes.

574
00:40:11,184 --> 00:40:12,503
Your Highness the Empress Dowager.

575
00:40:12,504 --> 00:40:14,103
His Highness has a punctured blood vessel.

576
00:40:14,104 --> 00:40:16,605
Fortunately, the bleeding has been stopped.

577
00:40:16,605 --> 00:40:18,503
Otherwise, he'd have been in critical condition.

578
00:40:18,504 --> 00:40:21,404
Bodhisattva bless me. Amitabha.

579
00:40:21,404 --> 00:40:25,205
To my surprise, you're the real deal.

580
00:40:31,385 --> 00:40:33,944
You're Mu Zhuohua?

581
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:38,143
I, Mu Zhuohua, the editor of Hanlin Academy, offer my greetings, Your Highness the Empress Dowager.

582
00:40:38,143 --> 00:40:39,765
Insolent!

583
00:40:41,444 --> 00:40:42,984
Grandmother.

584
00:40:42,985 --> 00:40:45,763
Chen'er, worry not and sit back.

585
00:40:45,763 --> 00:40:48,003
I'll handle this for you.

586
00:40:48,003 --> 00:40:51,364
Grandmother, it has nothing to do with Miss Mu.

587
00:40:51,364 --> 00:40:54,504
Liu Jin insulted me just now.

588
00:40:54,504 --> 00:40:57,985
I was too angry, so I fought him.

589
00:40:57,985 --> 00:40:59,663
No, I didn't, Grandmother.

590
00:40:59,664 --> 00:41:01,445
He provoked me first.

591
00:41:01,445 --> 00:41:03,424
You're injured, too?

592
00:41:03,424 --> 00:41:05,464
Go and check on Third Prince.

593
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:06,865
Yes.

594
00:41:16,964 --> 00:41:19,404
Your Highness the Empress Dowager, His Highness has skin trauma.

595
00:41:19,404 --> 00:41:20,965
He's all right.

596
00:41:20,965 --> 00:41:22,685
Mu Zhuohua.

597
00:41:23,785 --> 00:41:26,504
How dare you!

598
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:42,080


599
00:41:45,017 --> 00:41:52,376
♫  I can't forget the love that is still is nipping at my ears and temples  ♫

600
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:59,676
♫  Memories keep slamming into rocks and have nowhere to berth  ♫

601
00:41:59,676 --> 00:42:07,116
♫  Both sides gaze at each other in the drizzling rain, but one has turned into clouds and mist  ♫

602
00:42:07,116 --> 00:42:15,636
♫  Leaving the isolated heart's island, like waves without a shore  ♫

603

♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

605
00:42:22,936 --> 00:42:26,956
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

606
00:42:26,956 --> 00:42:30,436
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

 to be entangled for a lifetime  ♫

609
00:42:37,677 --> 00:42:41,976
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

610
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:47,777
♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

611
00:43:01,477 --> 00:43:08,876
♫  I can't forget the turmoil of love and hate,

612
00:43:08,876 --> 00:43:17,436
♫  Two souls embrace in chaos, how can it be written off?  ♫

613
