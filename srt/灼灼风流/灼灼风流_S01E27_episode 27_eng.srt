00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,459
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:35,080
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,099

♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11

♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,019
   

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,959
   

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,939
   

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
   

19
00:01:49,185 --> 00:01:50,985
In the span of five years,  
    

20
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:55,543
Jishan Hall slowly expanded throughout Southern Chen. 
    

21
00:01:57,085 --> 00:01:59,745
I saved more people

22
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,485
and gained more prestige.

23
00:02:03,864 --> 00:02:08,864
My information network had gradually grown as well.

24
00:02:08,864 --> 00:02:12,704
Jishan Hall also helped me collect information on Yun Xiangyue.

25
00:02:12,704 --> 00:02:17,505
Her father was Yuan Chengming of the war at Juma River.

26
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:19,704
   

27
00:02:19,705 --> 00:02:25,005
That's when I knew that it was time for me to return to the capital.

28
00:02:26,425 --> 00:02:29,565
I built an empty tomb for Yuan Chengming on purpose

29
00:02:29,565 --> 00:02:33,844
    
 and stated it was by Yun Xiangyue.

30
00:02:33,844 --> 00:02:39,424
The purpose was to make Uncle switch his target to Yun Xiangyue.

31
00:02:40,424 --> 00:02:43,625
Then I made Peilan

32
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:48,464
reveal the news to you that Uncle had found Yun Xiangyue.

33
00:02:49,624 --> 00:02:54,365
 Lord Ding has found out that Yun Xiangyue is the daughter of Yuan Chengming. 

34
00:02:54,365 --> 00:02:57,124
After all, you are the Dowager Empress who is superior,

35
00:02:57,124 --> 00:03:01,745
while I am just a princess without power.

36
00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:04,125
How can I possibly beat you?

37
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:12,263
That was why I had to make good use of Uncle, who is a powerful knife, 
    

38
00:03:12,264 --> 00:03:14,945
and reap the benefits.

39
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:20,324
I didn't expect Uncle to give up on the Revival Powder, which was a great clue.

40
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:25,864
He chose the hard way instead by finding the Northern Liang's hawk claw hook.

41
00:03:25,865 --> 00:03:28,424
I couldn't let him investigate any further.

42
00:03:28,424 --> 00:03:31,165
After all, Uncle is very capable.

43
00:03:31,165 --> 00:03:34,164
Soon, he would have found out

44
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:40,185
that I was the one who leaked information about Northern Liang's spy to Xue Xiaotang.

45
00:03:42,064 --> 00:03:46,465
 Sir, I'd like to make a toast to you as well. 

46
00:03:52,305 --> 00:03:54,964
 Who are you? 

47
00:04:02,465 --> 00:04:04,665
 It's you. 

48
00:04:04,665 --> 00:04:11,224
In order to divert Uncle's attention, I had to strike a deal with Yemu Jing

49
00:04:11,224 --> 00:04:16,665
and make him request a marriage alliance between me and Northern Liang.

50
00:04:18,365 --> 00:04:24,125
And you, Grandmother, would certainly abandon me to make sure Northern Liang wouldn't act rashly.

51
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:28,305
You would take the chance to talk me into forming the alliance.

52
00:04:28,305 --> 00:04:31,165
I obviously had to agree to it.

53
00:04:31,165 --> 00:04:38,144
This way I could divert Uncle's attention and gain a good reputation.

54
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,284
After all, in the eyes of the common folks,

55
00:04:40,284 --> 00:04:45,304
I was walking into the tiger's den by going to Northern Liang for Southern Chen.

56
00:04:45,304 --> 00:04:49,985
 How can a dispute between nations be resolved by a marriage alliance? 

57
00:04:49,985 --> 00:04:54,505
 As imperial subjects, if all you see is the comfort before you 

58
00:04:54,505 --> 00:04:59,505
 and you don't improve yourself, how can you stand tall in the imperial court? 

59
00:05:01,065 --> 00:05:04,825
I knew Uncle would never agree to such a preposterous thing.

60
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:12,705
But Father did not even say a word.

61
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:16,884
Just like the time my mother died.

62
00:05:17,764 --> 00:05:20,505
He didn't say a word either.

63
00:05:25,685 --> 00:05:28,685
As expected, you can never rely on kinship.

64
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:33,524
It doesn't matter when.

65
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:37,165
You can only rely on yourself.

66
00:05:41,205 --> 00:05:44,423
I had already thought of a way out for myself.

67
00:05:44,424 --> 00:05:45,704
 Your Highness. 

68
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:48,665
Zhuohua and I have always been close.

69
00:05:48,665 --> 00:05:52,924
Once she knew about the marriage alliance, she would certainly come to me.

70
00:05:53,664 --> 00:05:56,984
(When she saw the Northern Liang people packing up,

71
00:05:56,984 --> 00:06:00,264
she would tell Uncle about it.

72
00:06:01,544 --> 00:06:04,485
And once Uncle looked into it further,

73
00:06:04,485 --> 00:06:09,104
he would learn that the King of Northern Liang was seriously ill.

74
00:06:09,104 --> 00:06:16,105
Therefore, he would force Yemu Jing to reduce his terms for the peace talk.

75
00:06:16,105 --> 00:06:20,444
And the marriage alliance would eventually fall through.

76
00:06:25,505 --> 00:06:28,204
Luckily, Xue Xiaotang was fortunate.

77
00:06:28,204 --> 00:06:32,544
The moment I saw him, I knew it was him.

78
00:06:34,544 --> 00:06:37,184
I let him see the portrait on purpose.

79
00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:42,225
As expected, he remained faithful to me.

80
00:06:42,225 --> 00:06:47,524
But he was probably afraid to reveal himself due to feeling inferior.

81
00:06:47,524 --> 00:06:52,385
Besides, you and Uncle are influential in the capital.

82
00:06:52,385 --> 00:06:54,904
I doubt he would dare expose himself carelessly.

83
00:06:54,905 --> 00:06:57,384
But that won't do.

84
00:06:57,384 --> 00:07:00,165
He was my important witness.

85
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:10,624
Grandmother, you are my enemy,

86
00:07:10,644 --> 00:07:14,364
but also a good assistant to my revenge.

87
00:07:14,385 --> 00:07:17,845
Once you learned that Xue Xiaotang wasn't dead,

88
00:07:17,845 --> 00:07:21,725
you sent people from the Zhou family to Jiangnan to kill him.

89
00:07:21,725 --> 00:07:27,165
I went along with the plan and used myself to lure Xue Xiaotang out.

90
00:07:27,184 --> 00:07:33,605
Unfortunately, he was pushed off the cliff by your men.

91
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:39,224
Luckily, he did not die.

92
00:07:41,265 --> 00:07:43,605
He was saved by Uncle.

93
00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:48,184
When Zhuohua asked me for the Snow Dust Pill,

94
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:53,244
saying it was to save a friend and that it would be a pleasant surprise,

95
00:07:53,244 --> 00:07:57,344
I figured out that it was Xue Xiaotang.

96
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:59,784
So I gave her the Snow Dust Pill.

97
00:08:01,165 --> 00:08:03,844
Once Xue Xiaotang woke up,

98
00:08:03,844 --> 00:08:09,504
Uncle would bring him to the palace to confront you.

99
00:08:09,504 --> 00:08:12,424
Xue Xiaotang was so in love with me,

100
00:08:13,485 --> 00:08:18,904
so he would certainly expose your crimes and help me get my revenge.

101
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:24,145
When the time comes, I would lure Father over.

102
00:08:24,145 --> 00:08:28,324
And this matter would turn into a big deal.

103
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,745
The only thing I did not expect...

104
00:08:37,845 --> 00:08:43,345
was that Father would return to the palace late at night just to ease the tension between you and Uncle

105
00:08:43,345 --> 00:08:47,705
and suddenly died.

106
00:08:50,105 --> 00:08:52,985
You caused Father to die.

107
00:09:00,084 --> 00:09:03,824
 Guards! Summon the imperial physician! 
   

108
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,880
   

109
00:09:24,824 --> 00:09:26,484
Young Lady is skilled in medicine.

110
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:29,104
I'm sure His Lordship will be all right.

111
00:09:41,804 --> 00:09:44,904
My Lord, you have come to.

112
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,645
Here. Drink this medicine first.

113
00:10:19,184 --> 00:10:20,583
My Lord,

114
00:10:20,584 --> 00:10:22,724
how are you feeling?

115
00:10:24,245 --> 00:10:26,445
I feel much better now.

116
00:10:34,325 --> 00:10:36,764
I know you are blaming yourself.

117
00:10:38,064 --> 00:10:40,605
But who would've known...

118
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:48,145
that His Majesty would use such a drastic way to stop your dispute with Dowager Empress Zhou.

119
00:10:49,985 --> 00:10:52,585
Still...

120
00:10:55,184 --> 00:10:57,624
His Majesty...

121
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:02,825
By the way, My Lord,

122
00:11:03,684 --> 00:11:09,625
previously, Zhijian and the Falcon Squad had been watching Xue Xiaotang.

123
00:11:10,225 --> 00:11:12,365
But in the end...

124
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:18,404
They ended up finding his body in the moat.

125
00:11:18,404 --> 00:11:22,264
It was a fatal stab in the heart.

126
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:27,325
Zhijian and the rest think that Xue Xiaotang attempted to escape

127
00:11:27,325 --> 00:11:30,205
but got killed by Dowager Empress Zhou's men.

128
00:11:39,385 --> 00:11:41,285
Don't worry.

129
00:11:43,424 --> 00:11:45,544
I will be all right.

130
00:11:47,225 --> 00:11:52,124
There are more important things to do.

131
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:56,624
I'm not going to crumble now.

132
00:11:57,865 --> 00:11:59,465
My Lord,

133
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:02,765
I will always be by your side.

134
00:12:28,505 --> 00:12:32,805
Congratulations on avenging your mother, Your Highness.

135
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,285
Thanks for your help.

136
00:12:38,285 --> 00:12:42,925
Without you, I wouldn't be who I am today.

137
00:12:49,824 --> 00:12:54,264
 Isn't this the gifted Scholar Shen from our academy who was the top scorer? 

138
00:12:54,264 --> 00:12:58,245
 Why have you ended up being more miserable than a beggar? 

139
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,425
 Why are you so eager to leave? 

140
00:13:04,425 --> 00:13:06,604
 If you get on your knees and kowtow to me, 

141
00:13:06,604 --> 00:13:09,183
 I'll cover your greeting gift for the teacher in the future. 

142
00:13:09,183 --> 00:13:10,484
 Move aside. 

143
00:13:10,484 --> 00:13:12,085
 Beat him! 

144
00:13:12,745 --> 00:13:13,984
 Get him! 

145
00:13:13,985 --> 00:13:14,984
 Beat him. 

146
00:13:14,985 --> 00:13:16,985
 Give him a good beating. 

147
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,825
 Learn your lesson. 

148
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:21,365
 Let's go. 

149
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:37,045
 Do you... want revenge? 

150
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:49,105
 These days, aristocratic families are unbridled and oppressive. 

151
00:13:49,105 --> 00:13:52,605
 They climb the ladder thanks to the foundation laid by their ancestors. 

152
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:57,484
 But when it comes to real competence, they have got none. 

153
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,644
 You are absolutely right. 

154
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:05,065
 Those from noble families are used to gaining without toil. 

155
00:14:05,065 --> 00:14:07,425
 So they become a blight in the imperial court. 

156
00:14:07,425 --> 00:14:12,183
 If you don't get rid of them, they will eventually ruin the court's foundation. 

157
00:14:12,183 --> 00:14:14,625
 You are absolutely right. 

158
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:18,344
 Are you willing to set the direction right for the people and create a disciplined 

159
00:14:18,344 --> 00:14:21,144
 and orderly era with me? 

160
00:14:24,704 --> 00:14:26,504
 Yes, Your Highness. 

161
00:14:26,504 --> 00:14:28,505
 That's great. 

162
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:30,583
 Then you must study hard. 

163
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:34,485
 To those from common families, the imperial exam is the only chance. 

164
00:14:34,485 --> 00:14:37,124
 You don't know how powerful these noble families can be. 

165
00:14:37,124 --> 00:14:41,984
 If you want to compete with them, you have to rise to a higher position. 

166
00:14:49,985 --> 00:14:51,264
 You've been studying day and night. 

167
00:14:51,264 --> 00:14:53,265
 Are you still not done? 

168
00:14:53,265 --> 00:14:55,184
 No. Not yet. 

169
00:14:56,184 --> 00:14:59,324
 This guy doesn't care about what's going on outside. 

170
00:14:59,324 --> 00:15:02,325
 I bet he doesn't know about the big news in the capital. 

171
00:15:02,325 --> 00:15:06,204
 Do you mean the marriage that His Majesty arranged for Princess Roujia? 

172
00:15:06,204 --> 00:15:07,764
 That's right. 

173
00:15:14,225 --> 00:15:15,444
 What did you just say? 

174
00:15:15,444 --> 00:15:21,265
 His Majesty arranged a marriage for the Princess. 

175
00:15:21,265 --> 00:15:22,943
 What's the matter with him? 

176
00:15:22,943 --> 00:15:24,744
 Who knows? 

177
00:15:25,905 --> 00:15:27,204
 Tell me. 

178
00:15:27,204 --> 00:15:30,984
 Who is this lucky and talented man who gets to marry a goddess like the Princess? 

179
00:15:30,984 --> 00:15:32,745
 Let me think. 

180
00:15:32,745 --> 00:15:35,423
 I heard it was a general named Xue Xiaotang. 

181
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,124
 General Xue? 

182
00:15:38,823 --> 00:15:40,703
 Xue Xiaotang wasn't blessed with a long life. 

183
00:15:40,703 --> 00:15:41,904
 He died in battle. 

184
00:15:41,904 --> 00:15:43,063
 Exactly. 

185
00:15:43,063 --> 00:15:44,743
 I pity our princess. 

186
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:48,025
 It's the prime of her life, but she's widowed. 

187
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:51,663
 That's right. I feel so bad for Her Highness. 

188
00:15:51,663 --> 00:15:55,520
♫  A dream of a goose and a phoenix crossing together  ♫

189
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,589
♫  Tenderness is like parting and complaints  ♫

190
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:05,189
♫  Going around for a lifetime, constantly cut and scattered, 
 the world is day and night  ♫

191
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:08,083
 Your Highness, I am heading to the capital for the exam. 

192
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,024
 I will get to see you soon. 

193
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:19,169
♫  In that moment of confusion, 
 I want to know what your answer will be  ♫

194
00:16:19,169 --> 00:16:23,105
 Your Highness, I finally have the chance to help you now. 

195
00:16:23,105 --> 00:16:25,209
♫  Again, someone on the precipice of fate  ♫

196
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:28,970
♫  Leaves tear stains behind while bidding farewell  ♫

197
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:36,310
♫  The heartache is caused by the painful loneliness  ♫

198
00:16:41,765 --> 00:16:43,465
Let's go.

199
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,300
   

200
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,345
Thank you, Your Highness.

201
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:26,924
To rope in Xue Xiaotang back then,

202
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,864
Dowager Empress offered me to him as leverage.

203
00:17:31,825 --> 00:17:35,144
I have never loved Xue Xiaotang.

204
00:17:35,144 --> 00:17:38,205
But I didn't have much power at the time.

205
00:17:38,205 --> 00:17:41,065
I had no choice but to gladly accept it.

206
00:17:41,704 --> 00:17:46,020
Otherwise, she would use that as an excuse to punish me.

207
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,384
From an early age, I knew

208
00:17:49,384 --> 00:17:54,525
that you cannot pin your hopes on anyone in this world.

209
00:17:54,525 --> 00:17:56,825
You can only rely on yourself.

210
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,265
You can trust me, Your Highness.

211
00:18:01,545 --> 00:18:05,144
I will be yours in every life.

212
00:18:05,144 --> 00:18:09,240
No. You cannot be mine.

213
00:18:12,865 --> 00:18:15,124
Chen'er is the eldest son of the empress.

214
00:18:15,124 --> 00:18:19,045
He also has support from Dowager Empress and Lord Ding.

215
00:18:19,045 --> 00:18:24,103
Taking the throne from him isn't something that can be done overnight.

216
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,564
We must plan it out.

217
00:18:27,445 --> 00:18:29,465
He is determined in his pursuits.

218
00:18:29,465 --> 00:18:33,704
He likes enthusiastic and like-minded people who are outstanding.

219
00:18:35,145 --> 00:18:40,204
Before this, you had become well-known across the capital and gained his trust.

220
00:18:41,065 --> 00:18:47,165
I want you to stay by his side and work with me.

221
00:18:51,744 --> 00:18:53,784
Once we have succeeded,

222
00:18:53,784 --> 00:18:58,445
you will become the Prime Minister who answers to no one but me.

223
00:18:58,445 --> 00:19:00,904
I promise you.

224
00:19:01,685 --> 00:19:03,585
But, Your Highness,

225
00:19:04,424 --> 00:19:09,185
Liu Chen can give me this first-rank position as well.

226
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:14,845
Are you planning to betray me?

227
00:19:14,845 --> 00:19:16,304
No.

228
00:19:16,984 --> 00:19:22,084
I, Shen Jinghong, will never betray you.

229
00:19:23,385 --> 00:19:25,805
It's just that what I desire...

230
00:19:27,744 --> 00:19:30,205
is not to have that high position.

231
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,544
Then, what is it that you want?

232
00:19:36,105 --> 00:19:41,005
What I want... is your heart.

233
00:19:49,324 --> 00:19:51,424
Shen Jinghong.

234
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,725
I don't have a heart.

235
00:19:55,905 --> 00:19:57,905
You will.

236
00:20:03,604 --> 00:20:05,925
If you don't have feelings,

237
00:20:07,284 --> 00:20:09,585
you won't be tormented by them.

238
00:20:17,585 --> 00:20:20,264
Speaking of which,

239
00:20:20,264 --> 00:20:25,804
it is time for my younger brothers to return from the temporary imperial residence.

240
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:37,125
 You have been imitating the late emperor's handwriting. 

241
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,724
 It has come in handy now. 

242
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,664
   

243
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:13,583
- Greetings, Your Highness. 
 - What are you doing?

244
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,045
I can't afford to accept your bow.

245
00:21:16,045 --> 00:21:18,084
Not at all, Your Highness.

246
00:21:18,084 --> 00:21:21,805
Not only am I from the same hometown as your mother,

247
00:21:21,805 --> 00:21:24,503
but she also saved my life.

248
00:21:24,503 --> 00:21:26,545
So I should bow to you.

249
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,803
Rest assured, Your Highness.

250
00:21:28,803 --> 00:21:33,545
You can consider it done.

251
00:21:34,885 --> 00:21:37,184
Thank you, sir.

252
00:22:23,905 --> 00:22:26,023
The former emperor has passed.

253
00:22:26,023 --> 00:22:28,824
News has spread throughout the capital.

254
00:22:28,824 --> 00:22:33,324
Even the three princes have returned from the temporary imperial residence.

255
00:22:33,324 --> 00:22:37,703
But why is Lord Ding still not here?

256
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:39,404
Exactly.

257
00:22:39,404 --> 00:22:45,585
Is His Lordship having other ideas since the three princes are still young?

258
00:22:46,205 --> 00:22:49,764
Lord Ding is loyal to the emperor and the nation.

259
00:22:49,764 --> 00:22:52,703
How can you make such speculations about His Lordship?

260
00:22:52,703 --> 00:22:59,305
Official Wei, are we announcing the testamentary edict or not?

261
00:22:59,305 --> 00:23:01,045
Exactly.

262
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:04,083
Official Wei, if Lord Ding doesn't show up,

263
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:08,344
are we supposed to keep waiting?

264
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:12,204
The late emperor's testamentary edict concerns the successor of the throne.

265
00:23:12,204 --> 00:23:16,099
    
 Lord Ding is the only lord of Southern Chen.

266
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:22,324
So the edict can only be announced when he is here.

267
00:23:29,545 --> 00:23:32,405
Lord Ding has arrived!

268
00:23:44,004 --> 00:23:47,524
 Greetings, Your Lordship. 

269
00:23:56,065 --> 00:24:00,025
Announcement of the testamentary edict.

270
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:15,424
The late emperor's testamentary edict.

271
00:24:23,264 --> 00:24:28,185
"I humbly inherited the throne.

272
00:24:28,185 --> 00:24:32,445
Offered the jade tablet to the nine Imperial Temples.

273
00:24:32,445 --> 00:24:36,185
Faced the nation as the new emperor.

274
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:38,964
Second Prince, Liu Yu, is upright, talented, and intelligent.

275
00:24:38,964 --> 00:24:43,704
is upright, talented, and intelligent.

276
00:24:43,704 --> 00:24:49,664
I believe he will do well upon inheriting the line of work of the Liu family.

277
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:55,845
Prepare the ceremony and succeed the throne before my coffin."

278
00:24:55,845 --> 00:24:58,845
I shall obey.

279
00:25:12,445 --> 00:25:14,445
How can that be?

280
00:25:14,445 --> 00:25:17,244
This isn't right. It must be a forged edict.

281
00:25:17,244 --> 00:25:18,643
Official Zhou,

282
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:21,493
the edict was taken out from the memorial tablet at the Imperial Ancestral Temple.

283
00:25:21,493 --> 00:25:23,444
It was revealed in front of everyone

284
00:25:23,444 --> 00:25:27,325
after being checked by all the officials and the six ministers.

285
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:32,265
Even if you want to lie through your teeth,

286
00:25:32,265 --> 00:25:36,385
at least make up a better excuse.

287
00:25:36,385 --> 00:25:40,124
It was no secret where the testamentary edict was stored.

288
00:25:40,124 --> 00:25:43,383
It is not unlikely that someone could have secretly replaced it!

289
00:25:43,383 --> 00:25:45,765
You are being unreasonable!

290
00:25:45,765 --> 00:25:51,764
It is clearly stated in the testamentary edict that Second Prince will inherit the throne.

291
00:25:53,924 --> 00:25:58,585
When the late emperor wrote the edict, I was present.

292
00:26:00,065 --> 00:26:03,304
The content of this edict is different.

293
00:26:03,304 --> 00:26:07,904
I suspect that it has been tampered with.

294
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:20,724
Lord Ding,

295
00:26:20,724 --> 00:26:25,205
this testamentary edict has no traces of forgery.

296
00:26:26,865 --> 00:26:30,685
The late emperor wrote two testamentary edicts.

297
00:26:30,685 --> 00:26:33,904
The other copy was personally kept by him.

298
00:26:33,904 --> 00:26:39,584
You may compare and verify the two edicts.

299
00:26:39,584 --> 00:26:43,325
But the late emperor suddenly passed away.

300
00:26:43,325 --> 00:26:47,664
Who knows where the testamentary edict is?

301
00:26:48,764 --> 00:26:51,105
I know where it is.

302
00:26:57,145 --> 00:27:01,645
 I'm sure you know that I prefer Chen'er. 

303
00:27:01,645 --> 00:27:06,143
 But he hasn't faced enough difficulties, so I am still worried about him. 

304
00:27:06,165 --> 00:27:09,104
 I always think that I can still hang on for a few more years. 

305
00:27:09,104 --> 00:27:15,244
 When he is more mature, I will hand the nation to him. 

306
00:27:15,244 --> 00:27:17,584
 But I also fear there's not enough time. 

307
00:27:18,825 --> 00:27:20,625
 Brother. 

308
00:27:26,984 --> 00:27:28,684
 Brother Yan, 

309
00:27:29,485 --> 00:27:34,404
 please look after my three sons in the future. 

310
00:27:38,385 --> 00:27:40,624
 Yes, Your Majesty. 

311
00:27:41,405 --> 00:27:43,123
 There are two testamentary edicts. 

312
00:27:43,123 --> 00:27:46,344
 One copy is behind the memorial tablet at the Imperial Ancestral Temple. 

313
00:27:46,344 --> 00:27:51,645
 The other copy is kept in the secret compartment in my chambers. 

314
00:27:57,785 --> 00:28:00,617
   

315
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:18,404
Official Wei.

316
00:28:19,345 --> 00:28:20,703
If you may.

317
00:28:20,703 --> 00:28:26,205
"I humbly inherited the grand responsibility of my ancestors.

318
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:31,985
Day and night, I acted with caution, fearing that I would fail the late emperor.

319
00:28:31,985 --> 00:28:34,223
Life and death are the normal cycles of nature.

320
00:28:34,224 --> 00:28:36,864
No one has ever escaped from it.

321
00:28:36,864 --> 00:28:42,184
Fortunately, I have a successor whom the people of the nation can depend on.

322
00:28:42,184 --> 00:28:44,445
I have no regrets.

323
00:28:44,445 --> 00:28:50,424
First Prince, Liu Chen, is firm, intelligent, and familiar with national affairs.

324
00:28:50,424 --> 00:28:52,843
I believe he is able to protect the throne,

325
00:28:52,843 --> 00:28:56,584
be in favor of the people, and keep the nation safe and in order.

326
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:59,244
May the officials in charge prepare the ceremony.

327
00:28:59,244 --> 00:29:04,424
The throne shall be succeeded before my coffin."

328
00:29:07,005 --> 00:29:08,263
That can't be.

329
00:29:08,263 --> 00:29:11,384
No, this can't be true!

330
00:29:14,265 --> 00:29:15,523
Liu Yu.

331
00:29:15,523 --> 00:29:19,185
How dare you swap the testamentary edict!

332
00:29:19,185 --> 00:29:21,683
No! I didn't do that!

333
00:29:21,683 --> 00:29:23,123
This is slandering!

334
00:29:23,123 --> 00:29:26,585
Brother Yu would never commit such a treacherous act.

335
00:29:26,585 --> 00:29:29,104
Throughout history,

336
00:29:29,104 --> 00:29:33,925
many people have used unscrupulous means to get the throne.

337
00:29:38,504 --> 00:29:40,204
Lord Ding,

338
00:29:40,204 --> 00:29:42,419
you claim that this testamentary edict is the real one.

339
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:47,840
But the edict taken from the Imperial Ancestral Temple indeed contains the handwriting of the late emperor.

340
00:29:47,845 --> 00:29:54,024
That is why I think that this testamentary edict might be the fake one here.

341
00:30:00,664 --> 00:30:02,264
That's enough.

342
00:30:02,264 --> 00:30:04,505
Enough with the commotion.

343
00:30:04,505 --> 00:30:06,104
What an embarrassing sight.

344
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:09,885
Are you eager to see the capital fall into chaos?

345
00:30:11,345 --> 00:30:14,203
Uncle, I disagree.

346
00:30:14,203 --> 00:30:16,164
It concerns the Southern Chen's heir.

347
00:30:16,164 --> 00:30:20,185
Failing to get an explanation for this will lead to the capital falling into chaos.

348
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,585
What is there to explain?

349
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,644
Do you think Uncle would lie?

350
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,845
Uncle has always favored you.

351
00:30:30,845 --> 00:30:33,924
- Who knows if he would... 
 - Shut it!

352
00:30:33,924 --> 00:30:36,464
Don't you slander Uncle.

353
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:44,084
If I could forge this copy of the testamentary edict,

354
00:30:44,084 --> 00:30:48,304
then I would have forged the one at the Imperial Ancestral Temple as well.

355
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:53,504
Are you trying to say that Second Prince secretly forged and swapped the edict?

356
00:30:53,504 --> 00:30:57,924
If you accuse His Highness without proof,

357
00:30:57,924 --> 00:31:00,763
don't you fear getting criticized by the people?

358
00:31:00,763 --> 00:31:06,064
I never said that it was Second Prince's doing.

359
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:09,884
Uncle, his name was written on the forged edict.

360
00:31:09,884 --> 00:31:12,324
Who else could it be if not him?

361
00:31:12,324 --> 00:31:14,905
It is the spy of Northern Liang.

362
00:31:14,905 --> 00:31:18,724
This person only swapped one copy of the edict on purpose,

363
00:31:18,724 --> 00:31:23,091
causing two contradicting edicts.

364
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:26,665
The goal was to cause internal conflicts in Southern Chen.

365
00:31:26,665 --> 00:31:28,724
Who will benefit the most...

366
00:31:30,024 --> 00:31:32,245
from such a situation?

367
00:31:32,245 --> 00:31:35,325
That would clearly be Northern Liang.

368
00:31:35,325 --> 00:31:40,184
Today, all you officials were quarreling over this.

369
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,045
That's absolutely pedantic!

370
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:46,965
This is exactly what they wanted.

371
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:53,244
I was appointed as Lord Ding by the late emperor.

372
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:56,304
It is my duty to stabilize the nation.

373
00:31:56,304 --> 00:32:01,164
This morning, I sent orders to the barracks of the capital region.

374
00:32:01,164 --> 00:32:05,865
If any spies of Northern Liang are discovered, they will be killed on the spot.

375
00:32:06,984 --> 00:32:12,545
As for Second Prince, I trust your character.

376
00:32:13,385 --> 00:32:18,785
This was definitely the Northern Liang people's doing.

377
00:32:18,785 --> 00:32:24,365
However, until this matter is ascertained,

378
00:32:25,224 --> 00:32:29,324
it must not be leaked.

379
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:35,325
Therefore, Second Prince and Third Prince will have to stay at my residence for a few days.

380
00:32:35,325 --> 00:32:38,564
I will protect you myself.

381
00:32:38,564 --> 00:32:40,905
- But, Uncle... 
 - That's enough.

382
00:32:41,924 --> 00:32:43,843
The nation cannot be without a ruler.

383
00:32:43,843 --> 00:32:50,085
I need the Ministry of Rites to start preparing for the enthronement of the new emperor at once.

384
00:32:50,744 --> 00:32:54,644
As for the forged edict,

385
00:32:54,644 --> 00:32:58,060
I will personally investigate it.

386
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,590
   

387
00:33:07,805 --> 00:33:11,404
If it weren't for Lord Ding today,

388
00:33:11,404 --> 00:33:13,725
judging by First Prince's character,

389
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:18,544
he would have gotten into a huge fight at the imperial court with Second Prince.

390
00:33:19,785 --> 00:33:21,785
It's all right.

391
00:33:21,785 --> 00:33:25,385
I expected Uncle to be able to turn things around.

392
00:33:25,424 --> 00:33:30,925
It's just that I initially thought that once Chen'er ascended the throne, he would get rid of this brother.

393
00:33:30,944 --> 00:33:34,765
When the time comes, he would be blamed for killing his own brother.

394
00:33:35,944 --> 00:33:42,304
I didn't expect Uncle to pass the buck and put the blame on Northern Liang.

395
00:33:43,065 --> 00:33:48,845
Looks like he is trying to protect Yu'er and Jin'er.

396
00:33:48,845 --> 00:33:52,045
I'm afraid this plan won't work for us anymore.

397
00:33:53,024 --> 00:33:55,544
First Prince just ascended the throne.

398
00:33:56,184 --> 00:33:59,345
Rattling his seat won't be difficult.

399
00:33:59,345 --> 00:34:01,744
The difficult one is the person around him.

400
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:10,345
Uncle is indeed that shining star beside Chen'er.

401
00:34:12,064 --> 00:34:14,185
If we can get rid of it,

402
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:18,285
then this land of the ruler will be ours.

403
00:34:27,984 --> 00:34:31,484
 What does Ms. Mu usually like? 

404
00:34:32,185 --> 00:34:33,685
 Money. 

405
00:35:03,104 --> 00:35:05,425
 A storm is coming. 

406
00:35:05,425 --> 00:35:08,384
 Now isn't the time to ponder over this. 

407
00:36:23,494 --> 00:36:28,674
   

408
00:36:36,544 --> 00:36:38,924
Greet the Emperor!

409
00:36:53,024 --> 00:36:58,405
 Long live, Your Majesty! 

410
00:37:04,225 --> 00:37:05,824
You may rise.

411
00:37:05,825 --> 00:37:08,484
 Thank you, Your Majesty. 

412
00:37:10,307 --> 00:37:13,689
   

413
00:37:27,385 --> 00:37:29,964
I, Liu Yan, have come to greet Your Majesty.

414
00:37:29,964 --> 00:37:32,105
Uncle, no need to stand on ceremony.

415
00:37:35,144 --> 00:37:36,844
Your Majesty,

416
00:37:36,844 --> 00:37:40,344
you are now the ruler of Southern Chen.

417
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:42,724
Some rites cannot be exempted.

418
00:37:42,724 --> 00:37:44,004
Uncle,

419
00:37:44,004 --> 00:37:46,344
are you drawing a line with me now?

420
00:37:48,504 --> 00:37:50,004
Chen'er.

421
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:54,784
You have to learn how to be an emperor.

422
00:37:59,385 --> 00:38:01,285
Uncle,

423
00:38:01,285 --> 00:38:03,005
I understand.

424
00:38:03,785 --> 00:38:07,085
But in private, you are still my uncle.

425
00:38:07,825 --> 00:38:10,805
Uncle, come and sit.

426
00:38:23,504 --> 00:38:27,985
The Court of Judicial Review has investigated the forged edict for days.

427
00:38:27,985 --> 00:38:31,404
They haven't found anything.

428
00:38:31,404 --> 00:38:33,083
There's nothing to investigate.

429
00:38:33,083 --> 00:38:35,665
I'm sure it was Liu Yu's doing.

430
00:38:36,825 --> 00:38:38,904
The nerve of him!

431
00:38:38,905 --> 00:38:40,825
You mustn't let him off the hook.

432
00:38:40,825 --> 00:38:45,765
The late emperor valued kinship the most.

433
00:38:45,765 --> 00:38:49,185
He hoped that you and your brothers could be on good terms.

434
00:38:49,185 --> 00:38:51,984
Don't make him turn in his grave.

435
00:38:55,024 --> 00:38:59,124
Uncle, how should we punish them?

436
00:39:07,305 --> 00:39:09,445
We'll wait until the time is right.

437
00:39:09,445 --> 00:39:12,324
Then send them to their fiefs, away from the capital.

438
00:39:12,324 --> 00:39:16,725
In case those with ill intentions haven't given up on harming the nation.

439
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:33,990
