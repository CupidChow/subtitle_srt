♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,080
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,159
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,259
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,479
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,579
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,679
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

13
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,139

14
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:36,818
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,818 --> 00:01:39,019
   

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,059
   

17
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:44,939
   

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
   

19
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,560
Greetings, Your Lordship.

20
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,259
Greetings, Your Highness.

21
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:03,518
Mu Zhuohua, it seems like the remedy I sent you has worked wonderfully on you.

22
00:02:03,518 --> 00:02:06,739
You recovered faster than I did.

23
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,279
It's all thanks to you, Lord Ding.

24
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:15,139
Mu Zhuohua, I don't like you.

25
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,220
You should know that.

26
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,640
My duty called.

27
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,379
Others' preferences are not my concern.

28
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:28,258
No one knows you are a physician.

29
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:31,879
Even if you did not intervene, no one would blame you for that.

30
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:38,519
If you put it that way, allow me to tell you some facts, then.

31
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:42,698
If something happened to two princes in my class,

32
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:45,579
I would be held accountable.

33
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:47,959
Therefore, I had to do everything I could to save you.

34
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,900
That's just one of the reasons.

35
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,899
Besides, as a physician, I couldn't stand idly by

36
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,679
and watch you suffer.

37
00:02:56,679 --> 00:03:01,500
You forgot to say that since you saved me, I owe you a favor now.

38
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,899
Which means I have no choice but to be nice to you.

39
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,460
That, I dare not covet.

40
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:19,879
Mu Zhuohua.

41
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,240
Why did you come here?

42
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:28,060
Your Lordship, I came to bid you farewell.

43
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,040
I have nearly recovered now, so I shall not overstay my welcome.

44
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,519
All right.

45
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,540
Once you're home, do rest well.

46
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,319
Thank you, Your Lordship. I will.

47
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,479
I don't like to owe anyone.

48
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,199
You saved me, Mu Zhuohua.

49
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,179
I can grant you a wish.

50
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:56,220
Tell me what you want.

51
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,760
Your Highness, I merely did what I was supposed to do.

52
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,879
That's all there is to it.

53
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,900
You really don't know what's good or bad.

54
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,640
Mu Zhuohua, I still need to discuss something with the First Prince.

55
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:16,859
You may leave now.

56
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:18,480
Yes, My Lord.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,680
She's acting all sanctimonious again.

58
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:37,059
Uncle, she saved my life.

59
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:40,179
She could have obtained everything she wanted.

60
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:43,179
Is she truly selfless, or is she pretending?

61
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,680
Oh, Uncle. Did you give your jade pendant to Mu Zhuohua?

62
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:56,799
Yes. Why?

63
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:58,739
Why did you give it to her?

64
00:04:58,739 --> 00:05:01,058
I asked for it several times, but you never gave it to me.

65
00:05:01,058 --> 00:05:03,699
How can she have it? What gives?

66
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,539
You asked for many things from me.

67
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,479
I lost count.

68
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,939
How about this?

69
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,859
You fancy that Mingguang Armor, don't you?

70
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,680
I'll have my servants pack it up.

71
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,979
You can take it from my storeroom.

72
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,938
Thanks, Uncle. You're the best.

73
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:44,539
Brother Shen went to the Ministry of Revenue.

74
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,880
Brother Sun went to the Ministry of Works.

75
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,100
I'm the only hot potato left.

76
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,180
If Lord Ding won't take me in,

77
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,358
I can only return to the Hanlin Academy and do a light-duty job there.

78
00:05:55,358 --> 00:05:56,739
Hot potato?

79
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,660
Isn't that delicious?

80
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,739
Oh, naive girl.

81
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,818
A hot potato is delicious.

82
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:06,340
But it isn't pleasant to hold it.

83
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,839
No, I will not waste food.

84
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,639
You...

85
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:16,859
Lord Ding only gave me 20 days.

86
00:06:16,859 --> 00:06:20,959
He wants me to choose my battles and not get too involved with him.

87
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,859
And I'm not quitting.

88
00:06:22,859 --> 00:06:24,920
I will pass the assessment.

89
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,619
Young Lady, don't you want to be an official?

90
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,460
Why didn't you tell the First Prince that just now when you saw him?

91
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,539
You fool.

92
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,199
His Highness doesn't like me.

93
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,625
If I ask for a lofty position, he will say yes.

94
00:06:41,626 --> 00:06:45,818
But he will hold grudges and find a reason to demote me.

95
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:47,219
True.

96
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,378
Oh, Young Lady. Do you think you can still be an official?

97
00:06:50,378 --> 00:06:51,679
Of course.

98
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:55,698
However, I can't rely on Lord Ding forever.

99
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:58,839
I should strive for what I want.

100
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:03,838
I will become a competent female official to reduce Lord Ding's burden.

101
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,099
She said that?

102
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,600
Yes.

103
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:10,639
You may leave.

104
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,760
Uncle,

105
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:24,360
Mu Zhuohua isn't as bad as I thought.

106
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,260
Her mind... is quite exquisite.

107
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,220
Here, Young Lady.

108
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,378
Juli, being home is the best, isn't it?

109
00:07:51,378 --> 00:07:54,359
But, Young Lady, you were at ease too at Lord Ding's Residence.

110
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:56,360
I was not.

111
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,939
Look, Young Lady.

112
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:11,479
Someone from the Princess's Residence sent you an invitation.

113
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,259
Princess Roujia invited me to a tea party tomorrow.

114
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,759
Young Lady, the snacks are ready.

115
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,218
The hairpin Princess gave you is so pretty.

116
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:42,899
It goes well with your attire.

117
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,899
Is that so?

118
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,660
I figure I should dress up before I go.

119
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,959
Here.

120
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:49,859
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

121
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:57,540
Her Highness awaits you, Official Mu.

122
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,960
Thank you for ushering me, Miss Man.

123
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,838
Your Highness, Official Mu is here.

124
00:09:04,838 --> 00:09:06,419
Greetings to Your Highness.

125
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,279
The apricot blossom hairpin looks good on you.

126
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,900
It's thanks to your exquisite taste.

127
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,620
Take a seat.

128
00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:23,779
It's a private party. Don't stand on ceremony.

129
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:27,439
You know that I'm usually with my subjects.

130
00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:29,738
I do not stick to the formalities in the palace.

131
00:09:29,739 --> 00:09:33,139
Therefore, forgo those formalities before me.

132
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,960
Yes, Your Highness.

133
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,118
Oh, Your Highness.

134
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:40,219
Thank you for putting in a good word for me before the Dowager Empress.

135
00:09:40,219 --> 00:09:44,419
I bought some snacks for you, and I hope that they are to your liking.

136
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:46,560
You are too courteous.

137
00:09:57,219 --> 00:09:59,820
With these delicious snacks,

138
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,959
I shall not stash away my delicious wine.

139
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,699
Man'er, bring me the collection Father gave me.

140
00:10:06,699 --> 00:10:08,239
Noted.

141
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:14,579
I wanted to visit you several days ago.

142
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:17,499
However, you were at my uncle's residence.

143
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:22,060
If I may talk to you about the incident...

144
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,480
About their injuries?

145
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,959
The Dowager Empress holds my brothers dearly.

146
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:32,319
They're old enough to seek a spouse now,

147
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,539
and the Dowager Empress already has a few candidates in mind.

148
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:39,339
She heard that the First Prince and the Third Prince quarreled during your class.

149
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:42,679
She thought they were vying for you, so she punished you.

150
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,938
Please believe me that this wasn't what happened at all.

151
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,238
I know you have a good moral character.

152
00:10:50,238 --> 00:10:51,978
But the Dowager Empress doesn't.

153
00:10:51,979 --> 00:10:54,059
And she doesn't care if she accuses the wrong person.

154
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,279
She wants her plan to go smoothly,

155
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,539
and you are the unfortunate sacrificial piece.

156
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:06,740
I don't feel that unfortunate anymore now that I have your understanding, Your Highness.

157
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,660
Thank you.

158
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:24,579
Your Highness, allow me to make a toast to you.

159
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:43,819
In fact, you are not from Yanzhou, are you?

160
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,619
You are from Huaizhou.

161
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,419
During the Imperial Birthday, I asked if you came from Huaizhou.

162
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,019
You answered Yanzhou.

163
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:06,160
However, your reaction betrayed your deception.

164
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:12,179
Your Highness, I...

165
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:16,220
I am indeed from Huaizhou.

166
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,760
So you already knew the truth so long ago.

167
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,320
And you didn't expose me.

168
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,038
I am ashamed of myself.

169
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:28,780
I know you have a reason to lie.

170
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,719
It's not easy for a woman to become an official.

171
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:36,020
You are where you are thanks to your own skills and knowledge.

172
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:41,120
With that level of integrity, why would I nitpick?

173
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:49,420
Your Highness, you're too kind.

174
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,459
Another toast to you.

175
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:18,900
We all have our own challenges to face.

176
00:13:21,979 --> 00:13:27,799
I might be a princess, but I get bullied too.

177
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:33,640
When I was three, a child bit me.

178
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:39,379
Oh, the scar... It must have been a nasty bite.

179
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:45,019
Who dares to bully a princess?

180
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,180
Zhuohua.

181
00:13:52,219 --> 00:13:54,879
Can I call you that?

182
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:57,200
My pleasure, Your Highness.

183
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,779
Zhuohua, you're my friend, so I will be frank.

184
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,259
When I was young, I wasn't a princess.

185
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,679
My father hadn't acceded to the throne.

186
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:12,319
And my mother was just an attendant in the residence.

187
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:14,571
I wasn't born noble.

188
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:20,151
This bite... It's been a long time,

189
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:24,399
so I don't remember who bit me.

190
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,978
Perhaps I was a naughty child, and I was bullied when I was playing with other kids.

191
00:14:29,978 --> 00:14:36,340
I see. So you had it rough before you became a princess.

192
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:40,939
Despite your humble background,

193
00:14:40,939 --> 00:14:44,120
you fought your way here.

194
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,000
I envy you, truth be told.

195
00:14:47,859 --> 00:14:51,880
You can do what you want based on your ability.

196
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,660
Unlike me, caged by my identity.

197
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,580
I can't do much.

198
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,260
You are making me ashamed of myself.

199
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,059
You toil for your subjects. You are our role model.

200
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:14,939
Enough about the past.

201
00:15:14,939 --> 00:15:17,920
Being a female official is an uphill battle.

202
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,679
But I know you have the tenacity for it.

203
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:27,880
With this cup of wine, I'll give you my blessings.

204
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,839
May you forge on fearlessly and relentlessly.

205
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,639
Thank you, Your Highness.

206
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,880
 The Dowager Empress presides! 

207
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:48,119
- Greetings, Mother. 
 - Greetings, Your Highness the Empress Dowager.

208
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:52,139
Did I interrupt you?

209
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:55,880
Not at all. It's getting warm now.

210
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,539
Do make sure you take care of yourself, Mother.

211
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:01,019
Forgive me.

212
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,820
I should have gone to Ciming Hall to pay you a visit.

213
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,500
I am doing just fine.

214
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,339
But, Yan'er, you don't look that good.

215
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:13,679
Is there a lot of work in the Ministry of Rites?

216
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,419
Thank you for your concern, Your Highness.

217
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,580
I can manage.

218
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,060
You always act tough.

219
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,840
Peilan.

220
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:32,400
Your Lordship, Her Highness made these clothes for you personally.

221
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:45,599
Oh, to have bothered you so, Your Highness,

222
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:48,419
I am ashamed of myself.

223
00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:53,000
It's just a robe.

224
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:56,419
Not a huge project.

225
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,840
But you, you shouldn't overwork.

226
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:11,979
About the rumor, Roujia has told me the whole thing.

227
00:17:11,979 --> 00:17:14,899
Mu Zhuohua is innocent.

228
00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:17,539
Alas, men and women should keep some distance.

229
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,459
As a female official, it's inadequate for her...

230
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,980
to teach the princes.

231
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:32,359
Why don't we send her to tutor the daughters of noble families?

232
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:36,520
That will stop the rumor.

233
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,060
What do you think, Yan'er?

234
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:45,319
I appreciate your proposition, Your Highness.

235
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:51,160
Unfortunately, I have enlisted Mu Zhuohua

236
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,180
as the ambassador to receive the Northern Liang diplomatic corps.

237
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,460
They are arriving soon,

238
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,259
so a sudden change of staff might...

239
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:09,359
An ambassador represents our national image, and it shall not be taken lightly.

240
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:16,059
Yan'er, just because she is the first female Tanhua

241
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,980
doesn't mean you should make an exception for her.

242
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:26,459
Your Highness, I will not jeopardize our national pride.

243
00:18:26,459 --> 00:18:32,780
I nominated her because she has proven to be quite capable.

244
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,400
I'm just worried about you.

245
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,039
You're in charge of the diplomatic reception.

246
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,098
Mu Zhuohua is inexperienced, after all.

247
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:49,439
If something goes awry, you will be held liable too.

248
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,600
I understand.

249
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,260
My uncle traded his military feats...

250
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,540
so that women could be allowed to partake in the examination again.

251
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:10,700
You worked tirelessly and became the Tanhua.

252
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:15,180
Yet everything went down the drain because of this farce.

253
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:20,420
If it weren't for Lord Ding, I wouldn't have had the chance to take the examination.

254
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,099
I am already full of appreciation

255
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:28,500
that he was willing to look past the gender difference.

256
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,019
If I can no longer be a teacher, so be it.

257
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:37,159
I will do my best to pass the Ministry of Rites examination and serve our nation.

258
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:39,960
How wonderful.

259
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,679
I believe he is taking over the Ministry of Rites for the moment due to Northern Liang.

260
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,858
He's a staunch supporter of female empowerment,

261
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:48,859
so he won't let the ministers give you a hard time.

262
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,959
It's a pity that I don't have any sisters.

263
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:57,399
How I wish to have a younger sister like you.

264
00:19:57,399 --> 00:20:00,319
If you don't mind, you can view me as your younger sister.

265
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:02,739
I shall look up to you as my elder sister.

266
00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:05,779
No, even better than a biological sister.

267
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:10,519
My other sisters don't like me anyway.

268
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:12,699
Then call me Jiao.

269
00:20:12,699 --> 00:20:15,858
I dare not. If the Dowager Empress overheard that,

270
00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:18,739
she would think that I was currying favor with you.

271
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:27,259
The Dowager Empress won't acknowledge anyone without a noble title.

272
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,020
Your Highness.

273
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,619
Her Highness is getting inebriated. It's getting late now.

274
00:20:39,619 --> 00:20:43,119
Should I have the coachmen send you back?

275
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:46,900
No need, Miss Man'er. The coachman I hired is right outside.

276
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,960
I should ask someone to escort you.

277
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,480
Thank you.

278
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,178
Are you all right, Young Lady? Young Lady.

279
00:20:54,178 --> 00:20:55,539
Isn't this supposed to be a tea party?

280
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,979
Why did you drink liquor?

281
00:20:57,979 --> 00:20:59,779
You won't understand.

282
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:03,440
Tea makes you sober.

283
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,219
But liquor makes you real.

284
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:11,880
Liquor pulls us closer.

285
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,480
Young Lady.

286
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,359
His Lordship? Your Lordship.

287
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,640
The indolence.

288
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,960
Your Lordship.

289
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,160
How did you drink so much?

290
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,719
I had a nice talk with Princess Roujia, so I had a few too many.

291
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:36,559
So you drank your senses away while His Lordship stuck his neck out for you.

292
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:44,839
Your Lordship, I know that you do look after me.

293
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,658
Let me treat you to a meal as a thank-you.

294
00:21:47,659 --> 00:21:50,500
Your Lordship, give me a chance.

295
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,259
Come on, Your Lordship.

296
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:57,159
Juli, prepare a feast. And good wine, too.

297
00:21:57,159 --> 00:21:59,379
Come on, Your Lordship.

298
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,979
Here, a toast to you, Your Lordship.

299
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,079
Thank you for what you've done for me.

300
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:31,619
Your Lordship, why the long face?

301
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,538
Make sure the reception of the Northern Liang diplomatic corps goes smoothly.

302
00:22:37,538 --> 00:22:41,419
Don't make any mistake, lest anyone make a fuss about it.

303
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:43,979
Worry not, Your Lordship.

304
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:46,259
I told you that I would share your burden.

305
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,319
You have my word.

306
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:54,440
I have read Northern Liang's literature and studied their language.

307
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,160
Writing is still a challenge,

308
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,920
but I can read.

309
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:04,779
No need to go to Hanlin Academy tomorrow.

310
00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:08,019
Come to my place. I shall tutor you in person.

311
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:14,499
You will work as a political observer in the Ministry of Rites.

312
00:23:14,499 --> 00:23:17,680
If the reception is a resounding success,

313
00:23:18,379 --> 00:23:22,559
you will be promoted to Primary Sixth-Rank Administrator.

314
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:36,280
Your Lordship, you're the best minister there is.

315
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,599
It is such an honor to work under you.

316
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:42,400
Here, a toast.

317
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:49,660
Just how much did you drink today?

318
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:53,979
Your Lordship,

319
00:23:53,979 --> 00:23:59,219
I know you could have had an easier life.

320
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:03,939
But to give those 30,000 soldiers the truth they were withheld,

321
00:24:03,939 --> 00:24:06,900
you work day and night.

322
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,539
Personally, I don't have that level of courage.

323
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,620
That's why I admire you.

324
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,840
I want to help the people, too.

325
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,659
I guess you could say that we share the same goal.

326
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,440
Is this you speaking your mind after a few drinks?

327
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:35,720
Your Lordship, I have always been honest with you.

328
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,939
No matter how rocky your path is,

329
00:24:39,939 --> 00:24:43,480
I will be there to walk it with you.

330
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,659
Here, Your Lordship.

331
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:56,860
You're still carrying the jade pendant.

332
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,879
It looks nice.

333
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:06,540
Just like...

334
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:10,760
its former owner.

335
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:23,620
Your Lordship, there are scratches on the pendant.

336
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:27,979
Did it... Did it go to war with you?

337
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,060
Not only that.

338
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,359
It took an arrow for me once.

339
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,659
The scratches are the proof.

340
00:25:37,659 --> 00:25:40,920
What a precious keepsake.

341
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,480
I will safeguard it.

342
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,700
Carry it with you.

343
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,879
It shall be your protective charm.

344
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,340
Okay.

345
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:08,759
Young Lady.

346
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:10,359
Here.

347
00:26:18,139 --> 00:26:19,639
Your Lordship.

348
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,200
You made this?

349
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:30,179
In this difficult life, we all need a little trick to sweeten it.

350
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:34,459
Your Lordship, unbeknownst to you, Juli likes snacks.

351
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,340
Back in my home, she wouldn't have enough to eat.

352
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:43,300
So we would smuggle some ingredients and cook in our chamber.

353
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:49,098
I fancy myself as someone competitive.

354
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:53,819
So, of course, my cooking skill is above average.

355
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:55,659
Here, Your Lordship.

356
00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:57,319
Try it.

357
00:27:17,859 --> 00:27:19,779
Afraid that it might be poisoned?

358
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:21,720
I'll eat it first, then.

359
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,119
Yummy.

360
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,138
So yummy.

361
00:27:30,139 --> 00:27:32,939
Look, Your Lordship. No poison.

362
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,340
I'll help myself.

363
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:38,779
Here you go.

364
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:47,179
Do you like it?

365
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:49,660
It's just as good as those from Yipin Bakery. Right?

366
00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:56,920
Juli told me that if I ever wanted to quit my position,

367
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,539
we could move to a rustic town and open my own bakery.

368
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,939
I can feed myself with that.

369
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:08,680
Did you study all these years just to become a baker?

370
00:28:10,139 --> 00:28:14,579
When you returned, you were holding a box.

371
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:18,020
I suppose you brought snacks to see Roujia.

372
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,559
She loved them.

373
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:26,418
Her Highness and I wish we had met sooner.

374
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:28,680
We get along so well.

375
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:33,319
Your Lordship, let's drink.

376
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,740
Are you this casual too in front of Princess Roujia?

377
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:52,699
Your Lordship, Her Highness is so down-to-earth.

378
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,920
Yet I respect her...

379
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,658
a lot.

380
00:28:57,659 --> 00:28:59,480
I will not be frivolous.

381
00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:03,459
Maybe I am a touch frivolous

382
00:29:03,459 --> 00:29:07,600
when I'm with you.

383
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,540
Just a touch.

384
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:17,679
That means you don't respect me at all?

385
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,178
No, not at all.

386
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:21,418
No.

387
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:23,019
It's...

388
00:29:23,859 --> 00:29:25,599
It's just...

389
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:29,300
friendly bantering.

390
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:34,120
Your Lordship, if I ever behave something rude in front of you,

391
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:39,220
that's because you spoil me.

392
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,780
You're so nice.

393
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,620
Your Lordship,

394
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:55,319
you protect me, spoil me, and give me money.

395
00:29:55,899 --> 00:29:58,139
You're so nice to me.

396
00:29:58,139 --> 00:30:00,760
You're even better than my father!

397
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,399
I wouldn't want to have you as my daughter.

398
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,500
You want a daughter?

399
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,378
I can help you with that.

400
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:16,459
I can give you a daughter.

401
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,810
♫  The flowing water bends and reflects the round moon  ♫

402
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:30,660
♫  Gently sprinkling your eyebrows and eyes  ♫

403
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:37,660
♫  The galaxy is like the sea, 
 the eyes are like the eaves covered with snow  ♫

404
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,980
How?

405
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,980
♫  The night rain hitting the sycamore tree disturbs a sparrow  ♫

406
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:45,760
♫  The young maiden become acquainted with 
 the green robes in that moment  ♫

407
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:53,840
I will do my best to help you.

408
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,910
♫  ...stretching while unbroken my time and drifting away  ♫

409
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:00,160
You are drunk.

410
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,998
Yet you remember to say the words I like to hear.

411
00:31:03,998 --> 00:31:05,818
I don't just say it.

412
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:09,338
My Lord, I mean it.

413
00:31:09,339 --> 00:31:11,619
It's not a lie.

414
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:16,840
What if I weren't a lord but a commoner?

415
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,280
Would you still treat me the same?

416
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:24,939
When I first saw you, I thought you were...

417
00:31:26,479 --> 00:31:31,240
a male prostitute in Xiaoqin Pleasure House.

418
00:31:32,139 --> 00:31:35,460
I still saved you,

419
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,221
didn't I?

420
00:31:37,221 --> 00:31:39,618
♫  ...after thousands of sails have passed  ♫

421
00:31:39,619 --> 00:31:41,719
That's right.

422
00:31:41,719 --> 00:31:44,900
You never look down on people with inferior status.

423
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:50,000
Even toward the aging entertainers in Xiaoqin Pleasure House, you treat them with kindness.

424
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:53,319
If I weren't Lord Ding,

425
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:00,900
would you take off your mask... and show me your true self?

426
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,360
♫  ...stretching while unbroken my time and drifting away  ♫

427
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,299
Yes.

428
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:11,009
♫  Thousands of words are not enough 
 to accompany the long journey  ♫

429
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:19,260
♫  You are like the flowers and moon, 
 more graceful than a palace in the sky  ♫

430
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:26,009
♫  Accompanying you, calmly waiting 
 for the clouds to fade away  ♫

431
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:27,699
♫  The flowers and the moon are boundless  ♫

432
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,920
Your Lordship...

433
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:32,930
♫  Having to drift desperately in exchange 
 for a long-cherished wish  ♫

434
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:35,320
Don't get drunk before others again.

435
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:41,010
♫  The road is long, can the years be fulfilled?  ♫

436
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:48,190
♫  The flowers and the full moon in the sky, 
 a touching poem that has reached the world  ♫

437
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,890
   

438
00:33:01,835 --> 00:33:04,510

440
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,959
 Jiao, 
   

441
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:21,260
 I will bring you to Jiangnan. 

442
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:24,300
 It is a beautiful place. 

443
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,059
 You'll have more fun there than in the capital. 

444
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:30,060
 I will always stay by your side, Your Highness. 

445
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,499
Your Highness.

446
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,720
Your Highness, are you all right?

447
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:47,059
Nothing.

448
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,039
It's just a dream.

449
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:16,119
Young Lady, you're awake.

450
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:19,979
Juli, I was drunk yesterday.

451
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,520
Did I do something outrageous?

452
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,719
No, I guess.

453
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:26,919
Lord Ding was very happy when he left.

454
00:34:29,019 --> 00:34:32,139
 Make sure the reception of the Northern Liang diplomatic corps goes smoothly. 

455
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:36,380
 Don't make any mistake, lest anyone makes a fuss about it. 

456
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:40,638
 No need to go to Hanlin Academy tomorrow. 

457
00:34:40,638 --> 00:34:43,678
 Come to my place. I shall tutor you in person. 

458
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:48,158
Right. I recall that His Lordship told me to come to him

459
00:34:48,158 --> 00:34:49,959
because he would teach me the Northern Liang language today.

460
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:51,339
- Bring me my robe. 
 - Okay.

461
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,960
I'm running late.

462
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:05,239
Your Lordship, pardon my tardiness. I drank too much.

463
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:07,340
Please punish me.

464
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:11,240
That's not the only thing you've committed.

465
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:19,819
Did I lose my temper after drinking?

466
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,160
Do you remember nothing?

467
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:31,638
I can only remember that you said you would teach me the Northern Liang language in person.

468
00:35:31,638 --> 00:35:33,360
I'll be studious.

469
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,260
I won't let you down.

470
00:35:40,299 --> 00:35:41,618
Don't be late again.

471
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:43,019
Noted.

472
00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:48,899
Your Lordship, what are we studying today?

473
00:35:49,469 --> 00:35:53,639
You will stay in my study to learn common words in Northern Liang.

474
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,600
You are to memorize 100 words this morning.

475
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,900
There will be a test this afternoon.

476
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,759
Yes, Your Lordship. I will work hard.

477
00:36:09,699 --> 00:36:11,779
See you, Your Lordship.

478
00:36:15,179 --> 00:36:19,019
Zhimo, you don't have to follow His Lordship today?

479
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:20,779
Zhijian is on duty today.

480
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,060
Where is the study?

481
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,799
Come with me.

482
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,840
I'll ask Juli to send us some good food this noon.

483
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,019
Young Lady, have this.

484
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,698
Here.

485
00:36:56,699 --> 00:36:59,519
Zhimo, have some more. This one is delicious.

486
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:00,578
- I'm full. 
 - All right.

487
00:37:00,578 --> 00:37:03,279
Enjoy your meal. I'll head back to the study.

488
00:37:12,435 --> 00:37:15,685
   

489
00:37:21,085 --> 00:37:25,210
   

490
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,638
   

491
00:37:28,638 --> 00:37:30,019
Greetings, Your Highness.

492
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,699
I was looking for you.

493
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:33,698
The Northern Liang diplomatic corps will arrive soon.

494
00:37:33,699 --> 00:37:35,539
The Ministry of Revenue should send out a representative.

495
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,040
I nominated you.

496
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,218
Thank you, Your Highness.

497
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:41,019
No need to thank me.

498
00:37:41,019 --> 00:37:43,738
The management of accommodation falls under our ministry.

499
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:46,419
Keep an eye on those Northern Liang people.

500
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,218
Don't let them pull dirty tricks.

501
00:37:48,219 --> 00:37:50,019
Yes, Your Highness.

502
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,079
You are my most trusted man.

503
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:55,380
So I have great expectations of you.

504
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:59,139
Thank you, Your Highness.

505
00:37:59,139 --> 00:38:02,760
Your faith in me will not be misplaced.

506
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:17,520
The language of Northern Liang has a different orthography from ours.

507
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:20,939
Here.

508
00:38:22,999 --> 00:38:24,840
Our characters...

509
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:31,220
are tidy and organized.

510
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,498
But in Northern Liang...

511
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,659
their characters are cursive.

512
00:38:38,735 --> 00:38:46,535
♫  The galaxy is like the sea, 
 the eyes are like the eaves covered with snow  ♫

513
00:38:46,535 --> 00:38:50,385
♫  The night rain hitting the sycamore tree disturbs a sparrow  ♫

514
00:38:50,385 --> 00:38:54,620
♫  The young maiden becomes acquainted with 
 the green robes in that moment  ♫

515
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:58,078
 His Lordship's agarwood perfume is mesmerizing. 

516
00:39:00,219 --> 00:39:01,934
What are you thinking?

517
00:39:03,959 --> 00:39:05,919
Nothing, Your Lordship.

518
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,679
Focus.

519
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,027
Here.

520
00:39:11,027 --> 00:39:15,785
♫  Thousands of words are not enough 
 to accompany the long journey  ♫

521
00:39:15,785 --> 00:39:21,185
♫  You are like the flowers and moon, 
 more graceful than a palace in the sky  ♫

522
00:39:21,185 --> 00:39:24,005
Like this, Your Lordship?

523
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,261
Look.

524
00:39:30,731 --> 00:39:39,102
♫  The flowers and the moon are boundless, having to drift desperately in exchange for a long-cherished wish  ♫

525
00:39:39,102 --> 00:39:45,761
♫  The road is long, can the years be fulfilled?  ♫

526
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:54,082
♫  The flowers and the full moon in the sky, 
 a touching poem that has reached the world  ♫

527
00:39:54,082 --> 00:40:01,624
♫  The flowering period is not too late, to guard my little wish  ♫

528
00:40:01,624 --> 00:40:09,908
♫  There are flowers in the morning, a moon in the evening, 
 and still water throughout the year  ♫

529
00:40:16,299 --> 00:40:18,639
Let me give it a try, Your Lordship.

530
00:40:23,259 --> 00:40:28,220
Zhimo told me that you didn't eat much today.

531
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:33,140
I wanted to memorize the vocabulary, so I didn't have any appetite.

532
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,899
Come and eat with me.

533
00:40:37,899 --> 00:40:41,620
I don't want you to complain that I starve you.

534
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,459
Sure.

535
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:46,300
What an honor to dine with you, Your Lordship.

536
00:40:52,970 --> 00:41:02,930
