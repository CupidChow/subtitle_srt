1
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:25,160


2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,359
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,080
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:47,879
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,159
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,259
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,579
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,539
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,579
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

11
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,679
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

12
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:18,739
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

13
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:24,100
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

14
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,239
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

15
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:36,818
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

16
00:01:36,818 --> 00:01:39,019
   

17
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,959
   

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,939
   

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
   

20
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:54,329
Lord Ding's flute playing was once renowned in the capital.

21
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,288
How about performing a duet with Yunyun?

22
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:02,610
It would be marvelous.

23
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:09,588
If Your Lordship didn't bring your flute, I can offer this Lingxi flute as a gift.

24
00:02:16,044 --> 00:02:18,059
As they say, a treasured sword for a hero.

25
00:02:18,059 --> 00:02:22,879
This Lingxi flute will not be a waste if it's in your hands.

26
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,809
Today is the Tongxin Festival.

27
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,990
Miss Sun has been infatuated with Lord Ding for many years.

28
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,588
For her to give him this flute at this moment, I'm afraid she's trying to establish a connection.

29
00:02:32,588 --> 00:02:35,330
Miss Sun is the daughter of the wealthiest family in the capital.

30
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,768
She almost became the Consort Ding in the past.

31
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:41,130
You could say they're rekindling their relationship.

32
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,228
Miss Sun unexpectedly has genuine feelings for Lord Ding.

33
00:02:44,228 --> 00:02:45,869
Their social statuses are also compatible.

34
00:02:45,869 --> 00:02:48,530
You're right. I believe they will get married soon.

35
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,289
They're both gifted and attractive, it's bound to work.

36
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:53,530
They're a match made in Heaven.

37
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:13,829
Zhijian, fetch my flute.

38
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,060
   

39
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,290
Everything relies on fate.

40
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,529
As for this Lingxi flute, I'm not meant to own it.

41
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,689
I only love the one in my hand.

42
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:45,729
No amount of wealth can compare to what my heart desires.

43
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,535
   

44
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,030
 Sitting alone languidly in the bamboo groove, 

45
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:23,730
 plucking the strings while singing. 

46
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:06,430
Your Majesty, I couldn't help but play atune when I saw this flute.

47
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:09,189
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

48
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:11,390
It's all right.

49
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:15,590
Your skill has become even more refined.

50
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:39,209
Your Majesty,

51
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:45,789
while in Jiangzuo, I heard this year's Tanhua, Mu Zhuohua, is an exceptionally talented lady

52
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:48,969
and she's good at writing poetry.

53
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:53,968
I wonder if we're fortunate enough to appreciate one of Tanhua Mu's great works today.

54
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:07,568
What could Miss Sun's intention be?

55
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:08,988
Don't worry.

56
00:06:08,988 --> 00:06:13,789
Since Miss Mu is a Tanhua, her skills in poetry and literature must be remarkable.

57
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:15,248
Makes sense.

58
00:06:15,248 --> 00:06:20,649
Uncle, could Miss Sun have been deceived?

59
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:24,250
Mu Zhuohua may excel in various areas of learning.

60
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:29,489
But only her poetry is truly unbearable.

61
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,169
Deceived?

62
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,070
That's unlikely.

63
00:06:37,869 --> 00:06:44,369
Grandmother, I invited Official Mu as a distinguished guest.

64
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:48,449
She has been busy with state affairs lately and hardly has any leisure.

65
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,649
Coincidentally, you wanted to celebrate Tongxin Festival with a feast.

66
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:56,050
So I intended to use this as an excuse for her to come here for some leisure.

67
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,930
How could we burden her with scholarly matters?

68
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:02,530
It's not as serious as you've put it.

69
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,509
It's only putting a poem together.

70
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:07,249
How is this a scholarly matter?

71
00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:12,370
His Majesty often praises her talents in front of me.

72
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:17,808
Writing a poem quickly and effortlessly must be a piece of cake for her.

73
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:23,390
What do you think, Official Mu?

74
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,409
I...

75
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:44,589
Since Your Majesty has requested, how could I dare to decline?

76
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:56,189
Currently, the lotus flowers are in full bloom.

77
00:07:56,189 --> 00:08:00,549
I'll use the lotus as the theme then.

78
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:13,030
"Standing in the clear lotus pond,

79
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,449
grace that surpasses all.

80
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:22,829
If you ask what possessions I have,

81
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:26,270
they are the lotus seeds and lotus roots."

82
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:41,390
Is this the poem of the current Tanhua?

83
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,749
Am I too lacking to understand it?

84
00:08:44,749 --> 00:08:48,008
Is this some kind of new school of thought?

85
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:49,188
Do you understand it?

86
00:08:49,188 --> 00:08:51,130
No, I don't.

87
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,609
 That poem sounds odd. 

88
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:55,469
Forgive me for my lack of talent.

89
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:58,709
My poems have always been like this.

90
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:01,109
 It's different from what I had expected. 

91
00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:06,529
Accessible and easy to understand.

92
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:08,670
Common yet elegant.

93
00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:14,630
It's very close to daily life.

94
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,490
Uncle, you're right.

95
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,430
A poem with only four lines.

96
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:28,350
Official Mu, you're truly quick-witted.

97
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,549
So that's how it's interpreted.

98
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:33,490
It's actually not bad.

99
00:09:55,609 --> 00:09:58,700
Does His Lordship enjoy sloppy poetry?

100
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,110
   

101
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,410
Zhuohua, I'm truly sorry about that.

102
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,788
I invited you so you could relax.

103
00:10:09,788 --> 00:10:12,210
But I ended up causing you trouble.

104
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,828
Your Highness, please don't say that.

105
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:16,888
My skill in composing poetry is really lacking.

106
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:18,970
What's there to hide?

107
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,869
No one is perfect. Right?

108
00:10:20,869 --> 00:10:25,010
It's precisely because of this missing piece that makes me human.

109
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,349
Your way of thinking is quite unique.

110
00:10:28,349 --> 00:10:30,390
Yet, it makes sense.

111
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,828
Even the full moon has its waxing and waning phases.

112
00:10:33,828 --> 00:10:36,049
That's what keeps it interesting.

113
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:38,070
Your Highness, watch the steps.

114
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,430
Miss Sun.

115
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,810
How long do you plan on following me around?

116
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:52,369
My Lord, forgive me for bothering you.

117
00:10:52,369 --> 00:10:54,170
It's just...

118
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,068
It's just that I've admired you for seven years.

119
00:10:57,068 --> 00:11:00,390
- I couldn't help my feelings... 
 - Miss Sun.

120
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:06,410
Not all seeds can sprout and not all flowering plants bear fruit.

121
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:17,330
Miss Sun from the Sun family is indeed elegant and talented.

122
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:20,369
She and Uncle are also well-matched in terms of their backgrounds.

123
00:11:20,369 --> 00:11:25,470
What's rare is her sincere devotion to Uncle.

124
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,390
   

125
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,150
Young Master Shen, I heard during the Tongxin Festival

126
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,768
that young men and women from Southern Chen exchange gifts.

127
00:11:37,768 --> 00:11:42,089
So did you come to Princess's residence today to give me a gift?

128
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:45,369
Princess Jing'an, I have already made it clear.

129
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,710
I came today to seek an audience with Princess Roujia.

130
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:51,249
You really don't know how to take a joke.

131
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,569
But it's all right. Giving you one is the same.

132
00:11:56,689 --> 00:11:58,229
Your Highness, you might have misunderstood.

133
00:11:58,229 --> 00:12:01,609
In Southern Chen, I am not allowed to accept gifts.

134
00:12:01,609 --> 00:12:04,770
Not allowed to accept gifts? Not even during the Tongxin Festival?

135
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:07,630
You're quite dull, aren't you?

136
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,830
Your Highness, would you like some snacks?

137
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,190
Greetings, Your Highness.

138
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,548
I've prepared a gift for you today.

139
00:12:24,548 --> 00:12:26,449
I hope you can accept it.

140
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:32,629
It's all right.

141
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:47,389
Princess Jing'an, Princess Roujia and Official Shen have important matters to discuss.

142
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:50,523
Shall I have someone send you back?

143
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:07,630
This gift holds special significance for you.

144
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:10,470
Don't you want to open it and take a look?

145
00:13:32,349 --> 00:13:35,189
I can't believe you actually...

146
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,449
As long as Your Highness likes it.

147
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,070
Well, I shall take my leave.

148
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:48,289
Official Shen.

149
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,740
   

150
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:57,850
It's been a while since we last played chess together.

151
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,870
Perhaps we could play one round?

152
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:05,189
Sure.

153
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,708
Look. What do you think?

154
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,249
I've chosen a good gift, haven't I?

155
00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:12,769
It's a signature dish from Yipin Bakery.

156
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,550
I waited in line for a long time to get it.

157
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,290
Let me see yours.

158
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:24,929
Did you spy on what I bought?

159
00:14:34,869 --> 00:14:37,548
His Lordship gave you a day off to celebrate the festival.

160
00:14:37,548 --> 00:14:39,289
Yet, you came here...

161
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,469
to give her a pork knuckle as a gift.

162
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,350
You two are even eating together.

163
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:51,389
Young Lady said food is the people's top priority.

164
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:52,588
What's wrong with eating?

165
00:14:52,588 --> 00:14:55,030
I think it's good.

166
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,790
All right, then.

167
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:04,370
In any case, lovers' festivals aren't my cup of tea.

168
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,769
It doesn't matter what you eat.

169
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:07,289
Your happiness is all that matters.

170
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:09,789
You can keep on eating. I'll just watch.

171
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,370
Go on.

172
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,870
Eat up.

173
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,130
Great.

174
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:34,529
Today has been quite fruitful.

175
00:15:38,849 --> 00:15:42,509
When have I ever not given you money?

176
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:43,708
Not at all.

177
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,990
My Lord, my livelihood depends on you.

178
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:57,050
My Lord, we found him.

179
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,250
Come with me.

180
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,670
My Lord.

181
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,389
Today is Imperial Physician Zhao's rest day.

182
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:14,590
This is Imperial Physician Lu.

183
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,034
Official Mu.

184
00:16:16,035 --> 00:16:17,608
   

185
00:16:17,608 --> 00:16:20,209
    
 General Xue fell off a cliff.

186
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:23,970
His meridians are all damaged and his blood circulation is blocked.

187
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,330
That's why he remains unconscious.

188
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,629
Imperial Physician Lu, do you have a way to save him?

189
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:36,070
To bring him back from near-death, only the Snow Dust Pill can make that happen.

190
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,769
But there's no more Snow Dust Pill.

191
00:16:43,789 --> 00:16:49,049
I heard you also possess exceptional acupuncture skills.

192
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,050
It's only for something minor.

193
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,450
I just administered acupuncture a moment ago

194
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,930
and managed to hold onto General Xue's last breath.

195
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:02,469
For the current plan,

196
00:17:02,469 --> 00:17:08,610
Official Mu and I will take turns applying acupuncture to get rid of blood stasis.

197
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,690
At least it will have some effect.

198
00:17:13,389 --> 00:17:16,429
Then I'll leave it to both of you.

199
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:18,070
All right.

200
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,780
   

201
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:26,850
What?

202
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:30,889
You're saying Miss Sun went to the printing house to buy my selected poems?

203
00:17:30,889 --> 00:17:33,310
What's so appealing about my selected poems?

204
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,669
I don't know.

205
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:37,090
Mr. Xu, the bookstore owner, said the same thing.

206
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,649
He said that, too?

207
00:17:38,649 --> 00:17:40,770
How could he insult me like this?

208
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:44,389
But, Young Lady, isn't that the truth?

209
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,089
Well, that's true.

210
00:17:47,089 --> 00:17:49,329
Then what did Miss Sun say?

211
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:53,968
She said she just wants to buy your selected poems to study them.

212
00:17:53,968 --> 00:17:55,248
Study?

213
00:17:55,248 --> 00:17:59,570
Young Lady, is there something wrong with Miss Sun's judgment?

214
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,189
How about this?

215
00:18:04,189 --> 00:18:07,650
Juli, as for the money, we definitely can't let others profit from it.

216
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,288
Go back and tell Mr. Xu this.

217
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:12,588
Tell him that I will personally compile the selected poems

218
00:18:12,588 --> 00:18:14,830
and not get any help.

219
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:19,629
We'll then freely earn the money from him and Miss Sun.

220
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:22,110
   

221
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:33,809
Yunyun,

222
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,930
when did you become so studious?

223
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,248
You sure are improving yourself.

224
00:18:38,248 --> 00:18:40,448
Yunqian, come here.

225
00:18:40,449 --> 00:18:43,229
Help me understand the meaning of these poetry lines.

226
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,290
Sure.

227
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:54,610
Wasn't this written by Miss Mu?

228
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:59,189
Miss Mu's handwriting is quite nice.

229
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,308
It's good for making it a calligraphy model.

230
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,029
I'm not copying her handwriting.

231
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:07,990
I want to learn something from her poetry.

232
00:19:08,729 --> 00:19:12,029
You want to learn her style of writing?

233
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:13,949
Help me take a look.

234
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:17,609
All right.

235
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,609
"Pairs of magpies and turtledoves, I am in Xizhou.

236
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:25,289
Where is the elegance and charm? It's all like a dream."

237
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:32,629
This playful poetry by Miss Mu is becoming more interesting.

238
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,229
Look at this.

239
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:39,670
"None of my business." 
  (An acrostic) 

240
00:19:41,585 --> 00:19:43,610
   

241
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:53,569
She'll give you a hard time for teasing her like this.

242
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,769
I'm an official of the Ministry of Revenue who works from dawn till dusk.

243
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:01,830
I have no dealings with a noble lady like her.

244
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,229
She won't have a chance to mess with me.

245
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:11,869
Mother, I met His Lordship first.

246
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:38,989
 Don't worry. 

247
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:40,768
 I've dealt with those who kidnapped you. 

248
00:20:40,768 --> 00:20:43,449
 I'll have someone send you home. 

249
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:53,650
My daughter traveled all this way so she could become Consort Ding, not to be mistreated.

250
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,688
    
 So what if Mu Zhuohua is the Ministry of Revenue's director?

251
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,810
She's still a country bumpkin.

252
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:03,689
I'll enter the palace to meet with Dowager Empress and request her intervention.

253
00:21:03,689 --> 00:21:07,669
Mother, Dowager Empress has done a lot for me.

254
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:11,729
How could I possibly burden her further?

255
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,970
So you mean...

256
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:18,550
Mother, this is between Mu Zhuohua and me.

257
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,290
I've received education from esteemed teachers since young.

258
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,688
Regarding intellectual skills, I won't be inferior to her.

259
00:21:23,688 --> 00:21:26,489
I intend to compete with her head-on.

260
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,510
   

261
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,129
Official Li.

262
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,630
Thank you.

263
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:40,710
Greetings, Lord Ding.

264
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,750
Official Mu, you're also here.

265
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,429
That's not her.

266
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:00,189
I'm Yunyun from the Sun family of Jiangzuo.

267
00:22:00,189 --> 00:22:01,788
In the future, I'll be observing affairs at the Ministry of Revenue.

268
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:04,208
I respectfully seek advice on matters of the court,

269
00:22:04,209 --> 00:22:07,269
and I hope you won't hesitate to offer guidance.

270
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,510
Sun family of Jiangzuo?

271
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:14,569
I wonder what your connection to Minister Sun is.

272
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:16,410
He's my father.

273
00:22:18,069 --> 00:22:21,689
So you're Minister Sun's daughter?

274
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:37,670
So this is the one who has admired Lord Ding for years?

275
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,669
She has fulfilled her wish then?

276
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:42,949
Truly elegant and dignified as rumored.

277
00:22:42,949 --> 00:22:44,750
Indeed.

278
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,889
A perfect match for Lord Ding.

279
00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:49,828
Exactly.

280
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:51,729
Here, have some tea.

281
00:22:52,589 --> 00:22:54,389
Official Li.

282
00:22:54,389 --> 00:22:55,949
Good morning, gentlemen.

283
00:22:55,949 --> 00:22:58,968
- Good morning, Official Mu.  
 - Official Mu, good morning.

284
00:22:58,968 --> 00:23:04,929
Official Mu, that's Observer Sun, who just joined the Ministry of Revenue.

285
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,830
Let's continue enjoying our tea.

286
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:19,130
Sun Yunyun, why are you here?

287
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:24,549
Sister Mu, you've finally come. I've been waiting for you.

288
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:26,930
I suppose you arrived earlier.

289
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:31,809
It's because I had the fortune to be traveling alongside Lord Ding.

290
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,690
Sister Mu, have you had breakfast?

291
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:41,109
If not, I have some here.

292
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:45,710
It's the pastries His Lordship offered earlier.

293
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:50,849
No, thanks. Observer Sun, you can enjoy them.

294
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,809
 My Lord, I personally made these pastries. 

295
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,590
 Would you like to try them? 

296
00:24:24,349 --> 00:24:26,089
Why are you laughing?

297
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,350
Did I say something wrong?

298
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:33,670
As a newcomer, you can point it out to me.

299
00:24:34,449 --> 00:24:35,470
It's nothing.

300
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:39,710
Something amusing came to mind, that's all.

301
00:24:42,729 --> 00:24:44,849
Do you find me foolish?

302
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,130
And you're unwilling to enlighten me?

303
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:49,649
Observer Sun, you're not foolish.

304
00:24:49,649 --> 00:24:54,430
But too clever for your own good.

305
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:57,049
Why do you say so?

306
00:24:57,049 --> 00:24:58,709
I don't understand.

307
00:24:58,709 --> 00:25:02,288
It's nothing. You'll understand in due time.

308
00:25:02,288 --> 00:25:03,970
Please excuse me.

309
00:25:08,689 --> 00:25:11,868
Is Official Mu not happy about this?

310
00:25:11,868 --> 00:25:14,709
After all, she has been the only female official here.

311
00:25:14,709 --> 00:25:17,669
Now, there's another noble lady here.

312
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:19,369
That's impossible.

313
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,849
Official Mu is someone who looks at the big picture.

314
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:25,109
She's not that narrow-minded.

315
00:25:28,969 --> 00:25:32,509
I guess the family you're born into plays a crucial role in life.

316
00:25:32,509 --> 00:25:33,868
I agree with you.

317
00:25:33,868 --> 00:25:36,469
That's the Sun family of Jiangzuo.

318
00:25:36,469 --> 00:25:37,989
Haven't you heard?

319
00:25:37,989 --> 00:25:43,109
When the Zhous of the north and the Suns of the south are no longer in their place, the world might even change.

320
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,650
This poem...

321
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:54,149
This poem is truly marvelous!

322
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:58,210
It's unique and self-contained.

323
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:02,029
Observer Sun, who are you praising so highly?

324
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:04,329
This is Sister Mu's poem.

325
00:26:05,209 --> 00:26:09,170
Every word and phrase is original and not overused.

326
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:13,209
Unlike me, with limited knowledge, I can only follow the rhyme

327
00:26:13,209 --> 00:26:16,988
and use a few allusions to write some verses about what happens in the ladies' chambers.

328
00:26:16,988 --> 00:26:21,769
Unlike Sister Mu, who is incredibly talented and even has a collection of poems.

329
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,149
Observer Sun, your taste is...

330
00:26:28,309 --> 00:26:30,109
It's certainly unconventional.

331
00:26:33,489 --> 00:26:38,129
Ordinary people can't appreciate Official Mu's poetry.

332
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:47,189
I wondered why that eunuch was so persistent in pestering me.

333
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:51,409
He claimed an admirer was willing to pay a high price for poems.

334
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:56,009
It turns out it was you who secretly admired my talent.

335
00:26:58,489 --> 00:27:01,929
Observer Sun, you could've just come directly to me.

336
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:05,230
Why let someone else profit from the increase in price?

337
00:27:07,449 --> 00:27:11,809
I originally planned to seek guidance from Sister Mu.

338
00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:14,968
But you're busy with official duties.

339
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:17,390
You were also rushing even during lunch hour.

340
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:20,409
How can you find time to fulfill my small wish?

341
00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:22,310
You're right.

342
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:31,789
But since you're humbly seeking guidance, I can't disappoint you.

343
00:27:40,209 --> 00:27:44,709
Observer Sun, do you understand the chapter

344
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:46,450
I just explained?

345
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,689
Yes, I do.

346
00:27:48,689 --> 00:27:52,430
Good. Then explain it to me.

347
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:55,750
What about explaining the second chapter?

348
00:27:59,649 --> 00:28:02,509
"Admiring myself in the water's reflection,

349
00:28:02,509 --> 00:28:04,588
yet wondering who will receive these plucked flowers.

350
00:28:04,588 --> 00:28:06,289
Spring..."

351
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:22,790
Observer Sun, have you memorized the second chapter?

352
00:28:29,529 --> 00:28:31,569
Did you remember it?

353
00:28:40,489 --> 00:28:43,949
Sister Mu, you see, it's getting late.

354
00:28:43,949 --> 00:28:46,849
How about we call it a day?

355
00:28:47,389 --> 00:28:50,808
Very well. We'll continue tomorrow.

356
00:28:52,209 --> 00:28:56,549
Sister Mu, I heard that, during the Floral Poetry Gathering,

357
00:28:56,549 --> 00:29:02,269
your peony poem was led by a wide margin, displaying remarkable elegance.

358
00:29:02,269 --> 00:29:05,049
Many even thought it was composed by Lord Ding.

359
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,650
Is that true?

360
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:09,270
Yes.

361
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:12,348
Not only did Lord Ding not blame me,

362
00:29:12,348 --> 00:29:17,469
but he also praised my poetic talent and my excellent poem.

363
00:29:17,469 --> 00:29:21,329
Afterward, he had a long conversation with me through the night

364
00:29:21,329 --> 00:29:25,089
and even offered to finance my poetry collection.

365
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:27,030
Absolute nonsense!

366
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:46,510
Observer Sun, everyone has left.

367
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:50,189
Aren't you tired of pretending?

368
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,429
Sister Mu, you've misunderstood.

369
00:29:54,429 --> 00:29:57,929
I heard that His Lordship greatly appreciates your talent.

370
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:01,009
That's why I'm eager to learn from you.

371
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:04,369
I may be His Lordship's childhood sweetheart,

372
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:06,409
but we were separated for many years.

373
00:30:06,409 --> 00:30:09,650
I don't know if his preferences have changed.

374
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:13,429
But Lord Ding is known for his deep emotional commitment.

375
00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:17,369
Whether it's people or objects, he likes to keep them close.

376
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:22,088
Like his Mingguang Armor, the one he wore on his first war expedition.

377
00:30:22,088 --> 00:30:27,168
Even though His Majesty rewarded him with a new one, he still wears that old one.

378
00:30:27,168 --> 00:30:31,830
Have you seen him dressed in armor, leading the troops into battle?

379
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,949
I haven't seen him in armor.

380
00:30:40,949 --> 00:30:44,670
But I've seen him without clothes.

381
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:47,490
 Come on, let me administer the acupuncture. 

382
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,550
You're ridiculous!

383
00:31:02,689 --> 00:31:05,830
Mu Zhuohua surely says whatever she pleases.

384
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:09,090
She'll tarnish Your Lordship's reputation sooner or later.

385
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,289
This lady sure is troublesome.

386
00:31:19,869 --> 00:31:22,850
Young Lady, you're back.

387
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,549
Young Lady, what's the matter?

388
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:32,750
Was it a tiring day?

389
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:36,248
Not at all. That moneybag came.

390
00:31:36,248 --> 00:31:40,970
The way she tries to make others jealous is hardly impressive.

391
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:45,769
I'm curious to see what tricks she'll pull tomorrow.

392
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:02,810
 I haven't seen him dressed in armor, 

393
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:06,469
 but I've seen him without clothes. 

394
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:30,610
Mu Zhuohua, you've crossed the line.

395
00:32:32,153 --> 00:32:35,096
   

396
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:49,968
Official Mu, your document regarding Jiangnan is duetoday.

397
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,068
Minister Xu has been asking for it for a while now.

398
00:32:52,068 --> 00:32:54,989
All right. I'll definitely submit it today.

399
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:11,389
Fifty-five dan of grains.

400
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:14,389
Fifty...

401
00:33:20,449 --> 00:33:23,310
Official Mu, let's have lunch together.

402
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,949
Sure. I love the food from the Ministry of Revenue.

403
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:29,788
- Let's go. 
 - This way, please.

404
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:08,248
   
 Who messed with my document? 

405
00:34:08,249 --> 00:34:10,810
- What's the matter, Official Mu? 
 - Official Li, look at this.

406
00:34:13,069 --> 00:34:15,629
- How did this happen? 
 - What do we do?

407
00:34:15,629 --> 00:34:18,710
Minister Xu is about to arrive.

408
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,829
I don't know who could have done this. I...

409
00:34:20,829 --> 00:34:22,710
Official Mu.

410
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:26,835
The document regarding the Ministry of Revenue's allocation for Jiangnan's grains and funds.

411
00:34:26,835 --> 00:34:28,389
Have you finished sorting it out? 
    

412
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:29,689
I need it now.

413
00:34:29,689 --> 00:34:32,428
Those from Wende Hall are asking for it.

414
00:34:32,428 --> 00:34:36,849
Minister Xu, I... I had gotten it all ready.

415
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:40,650
But I don't know why it suddenly turned out like this.

416
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:42,690
Show it to me.

417
00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:50,869
How could you modify the document meant for His Majesty in such a manner?

418
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:53,989
You... I... Official Mu, you...

419
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:55,630
Minister Xu,

420
00:34:57,249 --> 00:34:59,829
I also prepared a copy of this document.

421
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:02,590
Please take a look and see if it can be used.

422
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:14,209
This...

423
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:18,689
This...

424
00:35:22,569 --> 00:35:27,169
Observer Sun, how did you manage to do this?

425
00:35:27,169 --> 00:35:29,410
When all of you were busy,

426
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:33,640
it was only natural for me to work hard to keep up with your pace.

427
00:35:36,289 --> 00:35:39,088
Are you upset that I'm being meddlesome, Official Mu?

428
00:35:39,088 --> 00:35:42,229
But I only wanted to help.

429
00:35:43,069 --> 00:35:47,889
Observer Sun, do you know why Minister Xu assigned me the task

430
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:50,890
of organizing Jiangnan's relief funds and supplies?

431
00:35:52,629 --> 00:35:54,129
Why?

432
00:35:55,749 --> 00:35:58,869
Because I was there during the disaster relief in Jiangnan.

433
00:35:58,869 --> 00:36:02,168
In the entire Ministry of Revenue, only I know this matter best.

434
00:36:02,168 --> 00:36:05,149
Others wouldn't be able to draft such documents.

435
00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:12,110
She's from the Sun family.

436
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,510
That's enough.

437
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:19,389
Since we have a complete document,

438
00:36:19,389 --> 00:36:24,089
I can go to the palace to answer His Majesty.

439
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,090
Yes, of course.

440
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:37,389
We must thank Observer Sun for her hard work in assisting me.

441
00:36:37,389 --> 00:36:39,930
I'll continue to do my best.

442
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,568
However, I also come from Jiangnan.

443
00:36:41,568 --> 00:36:44,369
I do know something about the situation there.

444
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:45,870
Is that so?

445
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,789
If so, do you know how much farmland crops were lost

446
00:36:49,789 --> 00:36:52,890
in the counties affected by the disaster in Jiangnan?

447
00:36:59,489 --> 00:37:00,889
I...

448
00:37:01,609 --> 00:37:05,830
I only recently arrived here.

449
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,430
How strange.

450
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:28,429
I clearly placed the household registration documents here.

451
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,890
Official Mu!

452
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:51,029
Official Mu, where are you?

453
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:59,349
Official Mu, I can't find you anywhere.

454
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:05,248
You see. Official Li has something to discuss with you.

455
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,049
 Just stay inside for the night. 

456
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:16,828
 No one will be able to hear you no matter what you do. 

457
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:19,710
 This is what you get from trying to compete with me. 

458
00:38:26,729 --> 00:38:28,448
How did you get out?

459
00:38:28,448 --> 00:38:30,148
How did I get out?

460
00:38:30,148 --> 00:38:31,949
Through the window, of course.

461
00:38:31,949 --> 00:38:38,329
Don't you know all the buildings in the Six Ministries have doors and windows?

462
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:40,942
Do you think it's your family's woodshed?

463
00:38:42,149 --> 00:38:44,110
You little mischief-maker.

464
00:38:51,849 --> 00:38:54,710
Why didn't I think of that? How foolish of me.

465
00:39:03,269 --> 00:39:06,189
 To get her out of His Lordship's sight, 

466
00:39:06,189 --> 00:39:08,389
 I need to put in more effort.) 

467
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:13,729
 I should let her know that her existence is meaningless with me around. 

468
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:29,650
Observer Sun, what are you up to this time?

469
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:34,230
Official Mu, I'm here to apologize.

470
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,268
Observer Sun, please don't joke around.

471
00:39:37,268 --> 00:39:38,869
Please put it down.

472
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:42,948
Offical Mu, after you drink this cup of tea, we'll stop quarreling from now on.

473
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:44,610
Is that all right?

474
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,050
Let me drink this first.

475
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:06,769
Observer Sun, can you pour another cup for Official Mu?

476
00:40:06,769 --> 00:40:09,129
- No need. 
 - Thank you very much.

477
00:40:21,729 --> 00:40:23,389
- Observer Fang. 
 - Yes, Official Mu.

478
00:40:23,389 --> 00:40:25,329
Have you seen Official Li?

479
00:40:25,329 --> 00:40:26,548
He's in the toilet.

480
00:40:26,548 --> 00:40:29,948
I wonder if Official Li ate something unclean.

481
00:40:29,948 --> 00:40:33,110
He's gone to the outhouse three times in an hour.

482
00:40:34,369 --> 00:40:35,869
I see.

483
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,630
Official Li.

484
00:41:01,229 --> 00:41:04,529
Official Li, could you take a look at my document?

485
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:06,048
Just do it as you suggested.

486
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:08,250
As you suggested, Official Mu.

487
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:12,969
Hold on.

488
00:41:12,969 --> 00:41:16,030
Maybe our superiors...

489
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:19,069
Are you all right?

490
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:05,550
Observer Sun, come with me.

491
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:19,950


492
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:29,916
♫  I can't forget the love that is still is nipping at my ears and temples  ♫

493
00:42:29,916 --> 00:42:37,116
♫  Memories keep slamming into rocks and have nowhere to berth  ♫

494
00:42:37,116 --> 00:42:44,556
♫  Both sides gaze at each other in the drizzling rain, but one has turned into clouds and mist  ♫

495
00:42:44,556 --> 00:42:53,076
♫  Leaving the isolated heart's island, like waves without a shore  ♫

496
00:42:53,076 --> 00:42:56,816
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

497
00:42:56,816 --> 00:43:00,476
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

498
00:43:00,476 --> 00:43:04,496
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

499
00:43:04,496 --> 00:43:07,876
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

500
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:11,396
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

501
00:43:11,397 --> 00:43:15,116
♫  Obviously willing to swear life and death 
 to be entangled for a lifetime  ♫

502
00:43:15,117 --> 00:43:19,416
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

503
00:43:19,416 --> 00:43:25,317
♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

504
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:46,316
♫  I can't forget the turmoil of love and hate, 
 even if the next day is far away  ♫

505
00:43:46,316 --> 00:43:54,676
♫  Two souls embrace in chaos, how can it be written off?  ♫

506
00:43:54,676 --> 00:43:58,556
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

507
00:43:58,556 --> 00:44:02,296
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

508
00:44:02,296 --> 00:44:06,076
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

509
00:44:06,077 --> 00:44:09,617
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

510
00:44:09,617 --> 00:44:13,316
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

511
00:44:13,316 --> 00:44:16,996
♫  Obviously can't be erased, and haunted by lingering dreams  ♫

512
00:44:16,997 --> 00:44:20,976
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

513
00:44:20,976 --> 00:44:28,257
♫  Want to have one more glimpse of you, 
 even just for a second more  ♫
