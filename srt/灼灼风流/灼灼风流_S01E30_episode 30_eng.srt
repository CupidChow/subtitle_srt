1
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:25,160


2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,459
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:35,080
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:47,879
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,159
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,159
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:03,479
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,579
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,679
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:18,639
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

12
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:24,100
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,139
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:36,918
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,019
   

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,959
   

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,939
   

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
   

19
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,609
The Southern Sun from Northern Zhou.

20
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,250
A century-old dynasty and a millennium-old noble family.

21
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,589
What about the imperial family of Southern Chen?

22
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:06,488
For them, a dying dynasty is just the rise of another dynasty.

23
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:09,229
They don't care about loyalty to the emperor or patriotism.

24
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,229
And they care less about the people of the nation.

25
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:16,228
Everything they do is for the continuation of their family.

26
00:02:16,228 --> 00:02:17,929
That's right.

27
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,008
They've been wanting to send their women into your imperial harem. Right?

28
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:25,310
In truth, they just want to build

29
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:31,490
a huge network that will benefitthem through marriage alliances.

30
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,069
Those scoundrels.

31
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:36,629
Do they think that I'm just a bargaining chip?

32
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:39,809
But a marriage alliance

33
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:44,208
is just a harmless trick compared to the other deceits from noble families.

34
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:50,709
Do you know what is the real abuse that noble families have towards Southern Chen?

35
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:54,309
- Tell me. 
 - 1. To monopolize access to education.

36
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:58,950
It's easy for the members of the noble families to gain access to education.

37
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,750
But for commoners, it's almost impossible.

38
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,169
They can't get protection under the Protected Appointments System.

39
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:09,509
They can never get out of this vicious cycle

40
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:11,989
and their future generations will face the same fate.

41
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:14,629
What about the second one?

42
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:17,309
2. To monopolize the lands.

43
00:03:17,309 --> 00:03:19,688
The noble families own many of the fertile lands,

44
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:21,509
and they rent them out to the farmers.

45
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:23,408
And the rent is at least 50% of their total profit.

46
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:27,309
Even after working hard for a year, the farmers can barely keep themselves fed.

47
00:03:27,309 --> 00:03:32,549
If there's a natural disaster, they'll be forced to sell their children and become beggars.

48
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:36,209
3. To take control of the government.

49
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,490
I'm sure I don't need to explain that to you.

50
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,908
But how many high-ranking officials in the Six Ministries are from noble families?

51
00:03:45,908 --> 00:03:48,650
I'm sure you know that better than me.

52
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:52,949
You can think that I'm just raising a false alarm.

53
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:54,810
If this continues,

54
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:00,469
even the foundation of Southern Chen may be shaken by the noble families.

55
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:03,609
If I don't eliminate the noble families,

56
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:06,629
there'll be future trouble.

57
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:17,410
When we first met at Xiaoqin Pleasure House, you were such a reserved person.

58
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,288
You even scolded me when I asked you to take off your clothes.

59
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:22,630
It's different now.

60
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,170
Now, you can take off my clothes however you want.

61
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:29,729
I'll do as you say.

62
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,608
Get into the water now.

63
00:05:28,609 --> 00:05:30,849
Be careful not to catch a cold.

64
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:55,649
Looks like you've risked your life more than once.

65
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:04,509
It's in the past now.

66
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:23,010
This place has a great view.

67
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,309
I've already made up my mind.

68
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:29,308
When I retire and can return to my homeland, I'll plant some vegetables here.

69
00:06:29,308 --> 00:06:31,709
Then, I'll raise some poultry.

70
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,369
You want to raise some poultry?

71
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,169
It'll smell so bad.

72
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:46,010
If it smells bad, of course, you'll be the one to clean it up.

73
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,289
We better let Zhijian and Zhimo do it then.

74
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:58,529
Zhimo. We can't let Zhimo do it.

75
00:06:58,529 --> 00:06:59,629
Why?

76
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:01,590
Juli is so clean-conscious.

77
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:06,069
If the odor sticks to Zhimo, Juli will be unhappy.

78
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,870
We can't let him do that.

79
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:14,230
Then, we'll have to depend on Zhijian.

80
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,130
That's right.

81
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,449
I forgot. I've left the porridge cooking in the kitchen.

82
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,750
I need to check on it.

83
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:37,008
 My Lord, the porridge is burned. Let's eat out. 

84
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:43,229
Here. Have another one of these.

85
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,488
I have so much food.

86
00:07:44,489 --> 00:07:46,689
I don't want you to go hungry.

87
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,150
This is delicious.

88
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,410
Here. Eat more.

89
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,749
The lotus root is tasty.

90
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,389
Both of you are so deeply in love.

91
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:12,110
I'm sure both of you are newlyweds. Right?

92
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:20,168
Madam, my husband's health is a bit delicate.

93
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:22,490
Please give him another bowl of wontons.

94
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,008
- Okay. 
 - Thank you.

95
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:28,349
What is it? Did I say something wrong?

96
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:35,329
I'm just happy that I've upgraded from a lover into a husband.

97
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,008
It's a lovely surprise.

98
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:40,009
Eat more.

99
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:44,910
Ladies and gentlemen, let's continue with our previous story.

100
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:51,968
The only one who's qualified to be the God of War of Southern Chen is Lord Ding.

101
00:08:51,968 --> 00:08:57,848
Back then, he volunteered to take down Northern Liang.

102
00:08:57,849 --> 00:09:06,170
He managed to stir up a storm and defeat 100,000 cavalrymen.

103
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:12,190
His Lordship is a peerless and valiant warrior.

104
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,488
 Nice! Nice! 

105
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:16,090
 Nice one! 

106
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:23,050
My Lord, everyone said that you took down Northern Liang all by yourself.

107
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,870
Tell me how you did it.

108
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,909
Actually, it was nothing.

109
00:09:29,909 --> 00:09:33,249
Back then, I managed to capture Hu Er'ta.

110
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:35,490
I treated him like an important guest.

111
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:40,050
To create the illusion that he had defected.

112
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,608
The king of Northern Liang was wary of him due to his achievements.

113
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:47,529
So, I purposely sent Hu Er'ta back to Northern Liang.

114
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,608
You made it seem like he had defected

115
00:09:50,609 --> 00:09:54,250
and gave the King of Northern Liang an excuse to eliminate the thorn in his side.

116
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,330
That's right.

117
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:00,729
In the end, the King of Northern Liang killed Hu Er'ta.

118
00:10:00,729 --> 00:10:03,368
But his action enraged Hu Er'ta's subordinates.

119
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:07,008
So, you took the opportunity to attack Northern Liang while they were divided

120
00:10:07,008 --> 00:10:10,210
and conquered Northern Liang.

121
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,209
You are a smart student.

122
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:18,529
You are indeed the God of War of Southern Chen who's an expert in the art of war.

123
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:26,130
By the way, will you use your knowledge against me?

124
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,549
I'm frail and can't take care of myself.

125
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:36,509
I wouldn't do that to you.

126
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:39,830
Eat more. Then, you won't be frail anymore.

127
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,270
Zhimo.

128
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:56,389
Why did you ask me to come here?

129
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,150
Juli.

130
00:10:59,489 --> 00:11:01,189
What is it?

131
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,528
He's useless.

132
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,529
He's too useless.

133
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:08,029
Don't tell others that you are my brother.

134
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:10,609
Here you go.

135
00:11:23,609 --> 00:11:25,849
Is this made from papaya?

136
00:11:25,849 --> 00:11:32,950
They say that you should always repay someone who has done you a favor.

137
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:36,789
This is quite sweet.

138
00:11:36,789 --> 00:11:38,888
What's wrong with Guo Juli?

139
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:40,770
She's such a glutton.

140
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,949
I've never seen someone as unromantic as her.

141
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,510
 They are dead because of you. 

142
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,908
 I received your military deployment map. 

143
00:11:58,908 --> 00:12:00,609
 I thought that I couldn't send it out. 

144
00:12:00,609 --> 00:12:03,770
 But God was on my side. 

145
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:08,269
 Xue Xiaotang managed to capture a spy from Northern Liang 

146
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:13,370
 and Northern Liang had your military deployment map. 

147
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:18,250
 Don't you think this was meant to be? 

148
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,210
Why are you sweating so much?

149
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,890
Are you okay?

150
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:40,649
I had a dream about that uprising again.

151
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:48,429
What's wrong?

152
00:12:49,609 --> 00:12:53,009
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

153
00:12:54,855 --> 00:12:59,255
But on the day of the uprising, I was both sorrowful and furious.

154
00:12:59,255 --> 00:13:01,410
I couldn't think.

155
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,590
When I thought about it just now,

156
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:09,629
I realized that something was wrong.

157
00:13:10,609 --> 00:13:12,629
What was wrong?

158
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,540
The Grand Dowager Empress said

159
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,890
that after she received the military deployment map, she couldn't send it out.

160
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:29,749
But then, Xue Xiaotang managed to capture a spy from Northern Liang.

161
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:34,630
But Xue Xiaotang was always in the military camp.

162
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,609
How did he find out about the spy?

163
00:13:39,609 --> 00:13:44,629
He must have someone helping him in the dark.

164
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:49,929
So, the Grand Dowager Empress is not the only culprit

165
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,809
behind your defeat at Juma River.

166
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,450
This is not just about my defeat at Juma River.

167
00:13:54,450 --> 00:14:00,969
Someone must have switched out the testamentary edict in secret, too.

168
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:04,848
But someone who can get their hands on the testamentary edict

169
00:14:04,849 --> 00:14:07,949
must be a trusted person of Emperor Emeritus.

170
00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:12,409
If we take that into consideration, there aren't many of them.

171
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:17,709
The Chief Eunuch who had accompanied my brother for more than 20 years

172
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:21,749
killed himself after my brother's death.

173
00:14:21,749 --> 00:14:23,930
What do you mean?

174
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:28,989
At first, I thought that he was just being loyal.

175
00:14:28,989 --> 00:14:33,490
But now, looks like everything is not as simple as it seems.

176
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:37,609
I have to find someone to investigate this matter.

177
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:39,549
If I could,

178
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:46,090
I really wanted to live in seclusion together with you here until we were old and gray.

179
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:51,730
Sounds like you are ready to go back to the capital.

180
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,790
Don't be a fool.

181
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:00,569
How could I let you accompany me here forever?

182
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:08,770
Moreover, someone is stirring up trouble in the imperial court right now.

183
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,830
I can't just sit back and do nothing.

184
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,690
Okay.

185
00:15:15,369 --> 00:15:19,390
Let's go back together then.

186
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:25,489
I believe that one day, we'll return again together.

187
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:39,889
Your Majesty, this is a report from Minister Sun of the Minister of Works.

188
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,485
   

189
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:02,870
This was not written by you.

190
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,710
I really have a group of great ministers working for me.

191
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:09,109
They are eager to share my burdens with me

192
00:16:09,109 --> 00:16:13,230
and even want to govern the nation on my behalf.

193
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,570
Your Majesty.

194
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:21,009
The Protected Appointments System comes from the grace of the imperial court.

195
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:23,329
But as time passes by,

196
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:27,829
they will think that this grace is their due.

197
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:30,310
Just like a fox accustomed to authority,

198
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:34,249
it forgets who exactly it relies on for its power.

199
00:16:34,249 --> 00:16:39,130
These vermin have taken over half of the imperial court's nation.

200
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,190
If I don't do anything,

201
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,730
I'm afraid that Southern Chen...

202
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,749
will just become an empty husk.

203
00:16:46,749 --> 00:16:48,128
   

204
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:50,229
I've asked someone to list out all the officials

205
00:16:50,229 --> 00:16:53,409
under the Protected Appointments System who have no official duties.

206
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:56,770
I'll send that list to the Ministry of Personnel.

207
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:00,534
We'll then start laying them off officially in the next few days.

208
00:17:01,609 --> 00:17:03,209
Your Majesty,

209
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:07,308
the Protected Appointments System is an honor bestowed by the founding emperor.

210
00:17:07,308 --> 00:17:12,930
It's against the rules of etiquette and the teachings of all the previous emperors.

211
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:16,288
I'm afraid that people will judge you

212
00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:20,288
for going against your ancestors and forgetting your roots.

213
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,248
Don't go to extremes, Official Zhou.

214
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,450
His Majesty just wants to lay off those without official duties.

215
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:29,315
But why do you want to lay off all the officials under the Protected Appointments System?

216
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,630
You have no right to talk here.

217
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:36,489
If Shen Jinghong has no right to talk here, what about me?

218
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:41,029
You must be joking, Your Majesty.

219
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:43,089
Let me be frank, then.

220
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:50,409
The imperial court has no extra money to pay those who haven't done a stroke of work.

221
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:58,309
We'll follow your edict and replace those useless officials

222
00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:04,929
with some useful ones so that we don't affect the normal operation of each department.

223
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:09,229
Are you saying that without those people,

224
00:18:09,229 --> 00:18:12,349
Southern Chen will be ruined?

225
00:18:12,349 --> 00:18:15,209
Why did you say that?

226
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,810
That was not what I meant.

227
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:21,628
Your Majesty, I'm doing this for the nation.

228
00:18:21,628 --> 00:18:23,550
Not for myself.

229
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,490
I've already made up my mind.

230
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,148
This is the end of the discussion.

231
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:30,469
 Please reconsider, Your Majesty. 

232
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:34,830
 Please reconsider, Your Majesty. 

233
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:42,489
Are you asking His Majesty to reconsider for his own sake,

234
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:48,630
for Southern Chen's sake, or your own sake?

235
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,789
Uncle, you are back.

236
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:55,248
Greetings, Your Majesty.

237
00:18:55,249 --> 00:18:57,049
Be at ease, Uncle.

238
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,488
Uncle, how have you been?

239
00:19:01,489 --> 00:19:03,450
Thank you for asking.

240
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,609
I'm doing well.

241
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,410
What about you?

242
00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:12,189
Not that great.

243
00:19:12,189 --> 00:19:14,650
What's wrong?

244
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:23,750
Someone wants to take control over me.

245
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:29,950
And it leaves me with a bad appetite and insomnia.

246
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,350
How can I be well like that?

247
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,930
Who is so bold to do that?

248
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:39,029
Are they trying to commit treason?

249
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:42,210
 Please don't be mad, Your Majesty. 

250
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,490
Forget it.

251
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,569
Your Majesty,

252
00:19:47,569 --> 00:19:49,989
when I was standing outside,

253
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:55,310
I heard something about laying off the officials under the Protected Appointments System.

254
00:19:55,310 --> 00:20:00,048
Yes. I want to lay off those under the system who have no official duties.

255
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,929
Your Majesty, taking action against the system is a serious issue.

256
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:05,728
You can't be reckless about it.

257
00:20:05,729 --> 00:20:11,210
So please reconsider, Your Majesty.

258
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,950
Official Sun,

259
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:16,070
if you like to flaunt your seniority,

260
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:21,188
you can just kill yourself in this hall so that your blood will spray everywhere.

261
00:20:21,188 --> 00:20:25,570
I'll ask the historian to come here at once and record it

262
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:28,148
so that your name will go down in history.

263
00:20:28,148 --> 00:20:29,849
What do you think?

264
00:20:33,729 --> 00:20:37,088
Official Zhou, you are not young anymore.

265
00:20:37,089 --> 00:20:40,089
If I remember correctly,

266
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:43,528
you are going to retire in two years.

267
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:46,929
However, you are not doing as well as Official Sun.

268
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:52,369
At least Official Sun has a son who got Bangyan in the imperial examination. 
  (Candidate who came second in the Hanlim examination) 

269
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,370
But what about you?

270
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:59,090
You don't have any capable descendants at all.

271
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:02,288
You know that you'll lose your privilege once you retire.

272
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:07,329
That's why you can't let His Majesty abolish the Protected Appointments System.

273
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,689
Am I right?

274
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:14,909
Since the two of you are so against laying off those with no official duties,

275
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:20,549
now that the national treasury doesn't have sufficient funds to pay them,

276
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:24,450
the two of you can pay your salaries instead.

277
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:28,649
Or we can lay off everyone who's in your family

278
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,630
and those who work for your family.

279
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:34,849
Then, we can use the money that we saved to pay those without official duties.

280
00:21:34,849 --> 00:21:37,229
These are your two options. Make your choice.

281
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,270
Lord Ding,

282
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:44,469
you... you are so...

283
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,909
What are you trying to say about me?

284
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:51,728
Am I shameless or am I a scoundrel?

285
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:55,270
You said that yourself.

286
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:00,210
Your Majesty, after much consideration,

287
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:05,770
keeping those with no official duties will do more harm than good.

288
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:10,490
Your Majesty, I agree with your decision.

289
00:22:12,529 --> 00:22:14,668
You sound so righteous,

290
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:19,130
but in the end, you were just worried about yourselves.

291
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:23,270
You are indeed my good officials.

292
00:22:24,786 --> 00:22:27,229
Those without official duties are not the only problems we have.

293
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:29,868
The real culprit behind the depletion of our national treasury

294
00:22:29,868 --> 00:22:32,349
is the Protected Appointments System.

295
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:51,329
Forget this.

296
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:55,029
The Protected Appointments System is a grave matter.

297
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:57,349
We can't be reckless about it.

298
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,630
That's it for today.

299
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,810
We'll discuss this issue next time.

300
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:08,160
 Yes, Your Majesty. 

301
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:11,810
If there's nothing else, you are dismissed.

302
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,910
Why did you stop me just now?

303
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,269
We finally managed to subdue them.

304
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:22,028
Why didn't you let me strike while the iron is hot and subjugate them once and for all?

305
00:23:22,028 --> 00:23:26,869
Even if I couldn't take them down, I could still make an example out of some of them.

306
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,849
Your Majesty, you have just ascended to the throne.

307
00:23:30,849 --> 00:23:33,148
You need to secure your place at the imperial court first.

308
00:23:33,148 --> 00:23:37,449
You can't be impatient when it comes to weakening the power of the noble families.

309
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:40,728
After all, they have a great influence which is deeply rooted in this nation.

310
00:23:40,728 --> 00:23:43,969
If we take action against them without holding back,

311
00:23:43,969 --> 00:23:47,670
they'll fight back even more.

312
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:50,809
It'll be bad for both the imperial court and society.

313
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,840
Although that's true, we have to eliminate the noble families.

314
00:23:57,409 --> 00:23:59,669
Shen Jinghong is right.

315
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:03,609
The noble families are like maggots.

316
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:09,130
I can't completely control the imperial court as long as they remain.

317
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:16,189
Did Shen Jinghong say that to you?

318
00:24:16,189 --> 00:24:21,070
That's right. I think Shen Jinghong is really talented.

319
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:24,809
And he knows the noble families well.

320
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:28,229
By the way, Mu Zhuohua came to me before this

321
00:24:28,229 --> 00:24:30,930
and told me that you owed her something.

322
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:33,009
What was it?

323
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:37,509
She just thought that my illness was rare

324
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:40,389
and wanted to help me with my treatment.

325
00:24:40,389 --> 00:24:42,489
I couldn't stop her.

326
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:47,610
   

327
00:24:52,009 --> 00:24:53,509
You are back, Uncle.

328
00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:55,469
How have you been lately?

329
00:24:55,469 --> 00:24:58,769
I've been worried about you.

330
00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:00,389
I'm feeling way better now.

331
00:25:00,389 --> 00:25:02,730
You don't have to worry about me.

332
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:06,929
Your health is the most important thing.

333
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:10,589
Grandmother is not feeling that well now.

334
00:25:10,589 --> 00:25:14,789
I'm sure Father would want you and her to take care of yourselves.

335
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:19,209
You must be tired from taking care of the Grand Dowager Empress.

336
00:25:19,209 --> 00:25:23,109
Rest well. Don't exhaust yourself.

337
00:25:23,109 --> 00:25:24,129
Yes.

338
00:25:24,129 --> 00:25:28,769
I won't delay you further from visiting her.

339
00:25:53,949 --> 00:25:56,149
Grand Dowager Empress.

340
00:25:56,149 --> 00:26:00,030
I know that you are not the only culprit behind the war of Juma River.

341
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:04,120
But who's the other culprit?

342
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,130
Please tell me about it.

343
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,669
Please give me an answer.

344
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:34,829
You... can't talk anymore?

345
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:49,189
If you can't talk,

346
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:52,270
please write it down for me.

347
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,170
Have you lost your mind, too?

348
00:27:21,829 --> 00:27:24,529
Your Highness, Lord Ding is leaving.

349
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,989
Since he's leaving,

350
00:27:32,989 --> 00:27:37,760
it's time for me to take good care of Grandmother.

351
00:27:38,749 --> 00:27:43,889
My Lord, based on your description, the Grand Dowager Empress is showing the symptoms of a stroke.

352
00:27:43,908 --> 00:27:47,669
She can't talk and she can't move.

353
00:27:49,009 --> 00:27:51,148
She's always been a proud person.

354
00:27:51,148 --> 00:27:56,440
I never thought that she would end up like that.

355
00:27:56,949 --> 00:28:00,128
This is karma and appropriate retribution.

356
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:05,560
It's just that you can't get any other clues from her anymore.

357
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:08,209
Let's not talk about that first.

358
00:28:08,209 --> 00:28:10,950
My Lord, let me read your pulse for you.

359
00:28:16,889 --> 00:28:19,470
Who bit you?

360
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:22,129
I was bitten by the Grand Dowager Empress.

361
00:28:22,129 --> 00:28:25,669
She is of unsound mind.

362
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:35,029
 Look. Although I'm a princess, I have been bullied, too. 

363
00:28:36,509 --> 00:28:40,930
 This bite mark is from the time I was bitten by a child 

364
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:44,049
 when I was three. 

365
00:28:44,049 --> 00:28:48,788
My Lord, the Grand Dowager Empress was trying to tell you who the culprit was.

366
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,450
Are you saying that...

367
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:55,330
Princess Roujia has a bite mark on her forearm, too.

368
00:28:58,709 --> 00:29:00,209
Are you sure?

369
00:29:00,209 --> 00:29:03,090
Yes. I saw it myself.

370
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,970
The only one who could cause

371
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:12,800
the demise of the Cangwu Army was Xue Xiaotang.

372
00:29:13,369 --> 00:29:18,829
But who was the one who could tell him about the spy from Northern Liang?

373
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:25,169
Xue Xiaotang took that secret to his grave.

374
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,269
He had been protecting that person.

375
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:30,929
Yes.

376
00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:33,529
He was protecting her.

377
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:39,189
The only person whom Xue Xiaotang will protect with his life

378
00:29:39,189 --> 00:29:43,250
is nobody but Roujia.

379
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,470
Xue Xiaotang could only be killed by Princess Roujia.

380
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:55,829
I always thought that she was sincere towards Xue Xiaotang.

381
00:29:55,829 --> 00:29:58,049
I never thought that...

382
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:01,529
Come in.

383
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,309
My Lord. Official Mu.

384
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:06,748
He Xin, what have you found from your investigation?

385
00:30:06,748 --> 00:30:09,330
The name of the Chief Eunuch was Li Ruisheng.

386
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,209
His parents passed away when he was young.

387
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,409
He became an eunuch and entered the palace when he was just a young man

388
00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:15,610
and was sent to the Eastern Palace.

389
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:19,189
After that, he served Emperor Emeritus until his death.

390
00:30:19,189 --> 00:30:21,329
He was single most of his life.

391
00:30:21,329 --> 00:30:23,030
But there was an exception.

392
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,629
He was with a palace maid named Xing.

393
00:30:25,629 --> 00:30:29,449
They were from the same homeland, and they both worked in the Eastern Palace.

394
00:30:29,449 --> 00:30:33,709
They supported each other, and they were very close.

395
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:37,869
So, Princess Roujia and Xing...

396
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:42,990
Xing is Princess Roujia's biological mother.

397
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:51,349
I never thought that Princess Roujia would be related to the Chief Eunuch like that.

398
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,410
No wonder she could even switch out the testamentary edict.

399
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:59,689
Other members of the Falcon Squad are spying on those around Princess Roujia.

400
00:30:59,689 --> 00:31:05,669
They found out that her personal maid, Man'er, went to worship a deceased teacher.

401
00:31:07,089 --> 00:31:11,309
The person who engraved the tombstone of Yuan Chengming.

402
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,249
Okay. I know everything now.

403
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:19,528
You've worked hard, He Xin. You can rest now.

404
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:30,090
Looks like she was the one behind the empty tomb of Yuan Chengming

405
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:32,569
and the death of Yun Xiangyue.

406
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:38,209
And her goal was to start the fight between me and the Grand Dowager Empress.

407
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:43,680
I suddenly remembered that Shen Jinghong loves her a lot, too.

408
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,610
Will he be used by her as well?

409
00:31:47,629 --> 00:31:53,229
How would you know if Shen Jinghong is a willing participant or not?

410
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:59,748
There was nothing wrong with him pointing out the evil of the noble families to His Majesty.

411
00:31:59,748 --> 00:32:03,909
But his words in the imperial court were too aggressive.

412
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:06,590
I suspect that he was trying to start a provocation.

413
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:10,649
For a new emperor who has not secured his throne yet,

414
00:32:10,649 --> 00:32:15,000
being so reckless will not do him any good.

415
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:20,170
I hope that he won't end up like Xue Xiaotang.

416
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:25,535
   

417
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:51,080
   

418
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:12,369
"The moonrise is so bright

419
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:15,130
but not brighter than her beauty."

420
00:33:20,329 --> 00:33:22,948
What do I owe the pleasure of this sudden visit, Your Highness?

421
00:33:22,948 --> 00:33:25,470
Looks like I've disturbed you.

422
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:31,529
It's fine. I'm just doing this to pass the time.

423
00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:33,008
I can just throw it away.

424
00:33:33,009 --> 00:33:35,429
It'll be such a pity to throw it away.

425
00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:39,428
Continue with your poem. Let me fix this.

426
00:33:56,485 --> 00:34:03,974
♫  The love that opened my eyes  ♫

427
00:34:03,974 --> 00:34:11,325
♫  Moonlight illuminates the path once traveled  ♫

428
00:34:11,325 --> 00:34:15,095
♫  A dream of a goose and a phoenix crossing together  ♫

429
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:18,329
♫  Tenderness is like parting and complaints  ♫

430
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:19,209
Don't just stand there.

431
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,528
♫  Going around for a lifetime, constantly cut and scattered  ♫

432
00:34:20,529 --> 00:34:21,489
Finish the poem.

433
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:22,609
♫  The world is day and night  ♫

434
00:34:22,609 --> 00:34:24,310
Okay.

435
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:33,324
♫  The fireworks of the world are like quicksand 
 of the world after all  ♫

436
00:34:33,324 --> 00:34:40,844
♫  In that moment of confusion, 
 I want to know what your answer will be  ♫

437
00:34:40,844 --> 00:34:44,784
♫  Again, someone on the precipice of fate  ♫

438
00:34:44,784 --> 00:34:48,545
♫  Leaves tear stains behind while bidding farewell  ♫

439
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:56,072
♫  The heartache is caused by the painful loneliness  ♫

440
00:34:56,072 --> 00:35:03,579
♫  The fireworks of the world are like quicksand 
 of the world after all  ♫

441
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:11,200
♫  I cared about you with all my heart, 
 but how are you going to accept it?  ♫

442
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,007
♫  The sound of the wind is like 
 the desperate cries from the jackdaw  ♫

443
00:35:15,007 --> 00:35:18,794
♫  This regret sprouts from the joys and sorrows  ♫

444
00:35:18,794 --> 00:35:21,748
♫  The city in my heart collapsed from the loneliness and pain  ♫

445
00:35:21,748 --> 00:35:26,590
"Her graceful body has me longing for her desperately."

446
00:35:29,049 --> 00:35:33,789
Looks like you've been greatly disturbed, Mr. Shen.

447
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:37,890
I used to feel like that.

448
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:40,109
But I no longer feel that way.

449
00:35:48,529 --> 00:35:51,008
I heard about what happened in the court this morning.

450
00:35:51,008 --> 00:35:56,829
It's a great start for you to convince His Majesty to lay off those with no official duties.

451
00:35:56,829 --> 00:35:59,609
But if Lord Ding hadn't stopped him,

452
00:35:59,609 --> 00:36:04,300
we would've been able to abolish the Protected Appointments System sooner.

453
00:36:05,449 --> 00:36:08,990
He has returned so suddenly.

454
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:12,830
I'm sure he harbors ill intentions.

455
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,309
 Brother Yan, 

456
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:27,410
 I'll entrust Southern Chen and my children to you. 

457
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:30,400
 Forgive our mother. 

458
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:35,490
 You have to stay alive and live well. 

459
00:36:57,129 --> 00:37:02,660
My brother entrusted his children to me before he died.

460
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:07,550
But not long after he passed away,

461
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:12,509
Chen'er and Yu'er almost became enemies.

462
00:37:12,509 --> 00:37:18,050
And the culprit behind it was his only daughter.

463
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,930
Looks like I'm destined...

464
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:26,749
to disappoint him.

465
00:37:37,049 --> 00:37:40,068
Everything is just a guess right now.

466
00:37:40,068 --> 00:37:41,989
His Majesty is new to the throne.

467
00:37:41,989 --> 00:37:45,989
And Princess Roujia is loved by the people of this nation.

468
00:37:45,989 --> 00:37:51,470
If we act recklessly, it'll rip apart the imperial court.

469
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:55,709
And it'll be hard to appease the people of this nation.

470
00:37:57,529 --> 00:38:02,960
We can't... let Chen'er find out about this.

471
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,170
He is reckless.

472
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:12,650
If he finds out that his own sister caused the death of 30,000 soldiers

473
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:15,289
and harmed so many people,

474
00:38:15,289 --> 00:38:17,969
he'll confront Roujia about it.

475
00:38:17,969 --> 00:38:23,789
We don't know if she's doing this for revenge or if she has another ulterior motive.

476
00:38:23,789 --> 00:38:27,529
Everything is just speculation right now.

477
00:38:27,529 --> 00:38:30,270
We don't have any hard evidence against her.

478
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:35,690
The only thing we can do now is to play it by ear.

479
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:39,369
Let's see what Roujia will do next.

480
00:38:42,881 --> 00:38:46,349
   

481
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,530
Let's go.

482
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:13,829
Let them go.

483
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,720
I'm too useless for having failed to capture them.

484
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,410
It's fine.

485
00:39:23,049 --> 00:39:24,850
Someone can't sit still anymore.

486
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:27,209
It's good for us.

487
00:39:27,209 --> 00:39:28,709
 Official Mu! 

488
00:39:28,709 --> 00:39:30,949
 Official Mu, help! 

489
00:39:30,949 --> 00:39:33,528
 - Official Mu! 
 - Coming. 

490
00:39:34,489 --> 00:39:37,589
 Hurry up! Hurry up. 

491
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:40,049
Zhimo. Zhimo.

492
00:39:40,049 --> 00:39:40,929
Official Mu!

493
00:39:40,929 --> 00:39:41,889
- What's wrong? 
 - Official Mu!

494
00:39:41,889 --> 00:39:43,548
- What's going on? 
 - This is just a minor wound.

495
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:44,449
- Zhimo. 
 - I'm fine.

496
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:45,449
Come. Hurry up.

497
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:47,149
Take him to the room. Slowly.

498
00:39:47,149 --> 00:39:50,489
Official Mu, you have to save him!

499
00:39:56,389 --> 00:39:59,389
My Lord, I was too reckless.

500
00:39:59,389 --> 00:40:01,088
Zhimo got hurt because of me.

501
00:40:01,088 --> 00:40:03,250
Please punish me.

502
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,510
Hang on.

503
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:24,049
I've stopped the bleeding.

504
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:26,469
Juli, take good care of him.

505
00:40:26,469 --> 00:40:28,589
Come to me if something happens.

506
00:40:28,589 --> 00:40:30,989
Yes, Young Lady.

507
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:40,708
- Zhimo. 
 - Don't worry. I'll deal with this.

508
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,250
Get up.

509
00:41:01,849 --> 00:41:04,629
You acted so recklessly.

510
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:07,230
Didn't you think about the consequences?

511
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:16,569
Maybe you think that the worst thing that can happen is your death.

512
00:41:16,569 --> 00:41:20,990
But have you never thought that by doing so,

513
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:24,450
Zhimo may lose his only family member?

514
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:36,930


515
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:48,947
♫  I can't forget the love that is still is nipping at my ears and temples  ♫

516
00:41:48,947 --> 00:41:56,347
♫  Memories keep slamming into rocks and have nowhere to berth  ♫

517
00:41:56,347 --> 00:42:03,687
♫  Both sides gaze at each other in the drizzling rain, but one has turned into clouds and mist  ♫

518
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:12,307
♫  Leaving the isolated heart's island, like waves without a shore  ♫

519
00:42:12,307 --> 00:42:15,947
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

520
00:42:15,947 --> 00:42:19,707
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

521
00:42:19,707 --> 00:42:23,627
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

522
00:42:23,627 --> 00:42:27,107
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

523
00:42:27,107 --> 00:42:30,627
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

524
00:42:30,627 --> 00:42:34,347
♫  Obviously willing to swear life and death 
 to be entangled for a lifetime  ♫

525
00:42:34,347 --> 00:42:38,647
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

526
00:42:38,647 --> 00:42:44,748
♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

527
00:42:58,148 --> 00:43:05,547
♫  I can't forget the turmoil of love and hate, 
 even if the next day is far away  ♫

528
00:43:05,547 --> 00:43:14,007
♫  Two souls embrace in chaos, how can it be written off?  ♫

529
00:43:14,007 --> 00:43:17,787
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

530
00:43:17,787 --> 00:43:21,427
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

531
00:43:21,427 --> 00:43:25,407
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

532
00:43:25,407 --> 00:43:28,747
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

533
00:43:28,747 --> 00:43:32,447
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

534
00:43:32,447 --> 00:43:36,127
♫  Obviously can't be erased, and haunted by lingering dreams  ♫

535
00:43:36,127 --> 00:43:40,107
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

536
00:43:40,107 --> 00:43:47,788
♫  Want to have one more glimpse of you, 
 even just for a second more  ♫
