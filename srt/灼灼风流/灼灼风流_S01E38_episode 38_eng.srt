1
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:25,060


2
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:30,459
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:35,080
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:47,879
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,159
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,259
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,479
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,579
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,679
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:18,539
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

12
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:24,000
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,239
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:36,918
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,019
   

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,959
   

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,939
   

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
   

19
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,949
It looks like you aren't doing well, Uncle.

20
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:19,090
What are you doing?

21
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:23,590
Revealing your true colors?

22
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:27,269
Uncle, you're wrong.

23
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:30,649
It's not me who revealed my true colors to you.

24
00:02:30,649 --> 00:02:32,790
It's your nephew.

25
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,310
I'm willing to send you off, though.

26
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,230
Do you want a glass of liquor to warm yourself up?

27
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,390
What's the rush?

28
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,450
Let's talk first.

29
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,170
Right.

30
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:09,310
I know you'll have a lot of questions for me.

31
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,130
During the war at Juma River,

32
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:22,869
did you intentionally tell Xue Xiaotang about the spy from Northern Liang?

33
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:25,809
Yes, that was me.

34
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,729
The Grand Dowager Empress was a vicious woman. In her pursuit to end your life,

35
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:33,590
she disregarded the lives of 30,000 soldiers

36
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:37,829
and sold your military deployment map to Northern Liang.

37
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:40,389
I merely moved things along

38
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:44,089
and provided her with a way to impart intelligence.

39
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:51,429
However, it's too hard to kill you.

40
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:59,350
But I'm pleased you're still alive.

41
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:05,349
Without you, I wouldn't be able to successfully take down that vicious woman.

42
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:10,929
As the Southern Chen Princess,

43
00:04:10,929 --> 00:04:13,789
you naturally possess a noble status

44
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:16,869
and get to lead a luxurious life.

45
00:04:17,809 --> 00:04:20,589
Why did you betray your country?

46
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:23,350
You truly embody dignity and righteousness, Uncle.

47
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,349
I wonder if you've ever heard of this saying.

48
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:32,990
"Not having undergone other people's hardships, don't advise other people to be virtuous."

49
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:42,229
Back then, the vicious woman killed my mother.

50
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:46,469
Father was forced to send me out of the capital.

51
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:49,929
I might have been born into the royal family,

52
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:54,750
but I live in constant fear and anxiety, unable to find peace in my daily life.

53
00:04:55,589 --> 00:05:00,789
Every night, I will jolt awake from disturbing nightmares.

54
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:10,149
Do you know what I've been through?

55
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:16,269
My mother was killed by the Grand Dowager Empress as well.

56
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,250
While I may have grown up in the palace,

57
00:05:20,049 --> 00:05:26,430
since young, I lived amidst her hatred and murderous intentions.

58
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,970
I escaped death many times.

59
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,630
I'm no better than you.

60
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:48,110
Rouja, that is just an excuse you came up with

61
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,870
to justify your greed and actions.

62
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:55,489
Yes.

63
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:00,689
I planted the false testamentary edict.

64
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,170
I also instigated the conflict between noble families and Liu Chen.

65
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,310
Revenge isn't the only thing I want.

66
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,850
I want power.

67
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,249
I want to be the most powerful person in Southern Chen.

68
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,450
Finally, you confessed.

69
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:44,909
Uncle, are you done with your final words?

70
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,809
Is there anything you want to tell Zhuohua?

71
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,229
Next time I see her,

72
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:53,930
I'll pass your message on to her.

73
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,850
   
 Official Mu, we've diverted the guards. 

74
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,410
 Hurry, go and find the Border Defender Princess. 

75
00:07:02,809 --> 00:07:07,309
Your Highness. Your Highness.

76
00:07:07,309 --> 00:07:09,329
Your Highness.

77
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:17,550
Your Highness, Lord Ding has been falsely accused and incarcerated.

78
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,329
The Evil-erasing Sword is his only chance of survival.

79
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:23,669
We need your help, Your Highness.

80
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:44,010
Are you saying that Evil-erasing Sword is in the staff?

81
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,149
Go save Yan now.

82
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:48,170
Thank you, Your Highness.

83
00:07:52,735 --> 00:07:54,385
   

84
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:00,970
If you mention her name again,

85
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,730
I'll break your neck.

86
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:15,129
Uncle, it's time for you to drink the liquor.

87
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:37,510
Why? Are you going to resist the decree?

88
00:08:41,435 --> 00:08:44,035
   

89
00:08:53,935 --> 00:08:55,135
   

90
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:57,340
   

91
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:42,029
♫  I can't forget the love that is still is nipping at my ears and temples  ♫

92
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:49,200
♫  Memories keep slamming into rocks and have nowhere to berth  ♫

93
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:56,639
♫  Both sides gaze at each other in the drizzling rain, but one has turned into clouds and mist  ♫

94
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,889
My Lord!

95
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,149
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

96
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,950

♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

98
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,600
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,969

♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

♫  Memories keep slamming into rocks and have nowhere to berth  ♫

106
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,550
So what if you have the Evil-erasing Sword?

107
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,360
Liu Yan is dead.

108
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:13,080
I'm the final victor.

109
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,340
♫  Two souls embrace in chaos, how can it be written off?  ♫

110
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,030
Do you know why he died?

111
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:25,480
Until now, do you still think you chose the right path?

112
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,170
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

119
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:29,059
Your Highness, we just received news from Jishan Hall.

120
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,469
Official Mu and her men took the Border Defender Princess away.

121
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,530
I know.

122
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,389
Should we go to Official Mu's house to bring the Border Defender Princess...

123
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,619
No need.

124
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:41,520
I don't think Grandaunt wants to return to the Princess Residence anymore.

125
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,779
The Evil-erasing Sword has been unsheathed. It won't serve any use anymore.

126
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:49,120
Deliver the Evil-erasing Sword to Grandaunt.

127
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,890
My Lord.

128
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,779
My Lord.

129
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:02,380
- Young Lady. 
 - My Lord.

130
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,469
 Chen'er. 

131
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,770
 Uncle. 

132
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,310
 This is your birthday present. 

133
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,040
 Strong and sharp. 

134
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,539
 Thank you, Uncle. 

135
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,440
 I'm glad you like it. 

136
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,579
 Uncle, where did you get this sword from? 

137
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,631
 Following our victory against the Northern Liang Army, 

138
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:53,130
 I seized several swords crafted from meteoric iron. 

139
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,869
 I instructed my men to melt them down and forge this new sword. 

140
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,850
 So you seized this from the Northern Liang Army. 

141
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,410
 If so, I like it even more. 

142
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,179
 Uncle, bring me along on your next expedition. 

143
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,280
 I want to kill the enemies on the battlefield, too. 

144
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,180
 I'll wait for you. 

145
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,850
Your Majesty.

146
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,349
Your Majesty.

147
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,059
The guilty official, Liu Yan, has been executed.

148
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,040
However, his body is still within the Court of Judicial Review.

149
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,780
What about...

150
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,650
He's just a guilty official...

151
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,170
and doesn't deserve a funeral.

152
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,580
Just bury him.

153
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:37,330
If only I could wed him, I would be contented.

154
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,190
Even if he were to forsake me,

155
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,600
I would have no regrets whatsoever.

156
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,120
Where is my fan?

157
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,870
Where is my fan?

158
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,050
Well...

159
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,810
What are you doing?

160
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,939
My Lord.

161
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,170
Who is this crazy woman?

162
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:31,150
I'll be waiting for you to marry me.

163
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,850
Young Lady. Young Lady.

164
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,359
Young Lady, you're finally awake.

165
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:48,800
You gave me a fright.

166
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,840
How long have I been unconscious?

167
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,579
Three days.

168
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,400
Imperial Physician Zhao said if you continued to be unconscious,

169
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,910
you might not be able to wake up, ever.

170
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,460
What about His Lordship?

171
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,780
Three days ago,

172
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,289
His Lordship's body was buried in the cemetery at the foot of Fuyun Mountain.

173
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:24,980
That person said, that as His Lordship was a guilty official,

174
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,690
we weren't allowed to hold a funeral for him.

175
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,930
He was buried in a simple manner.

176
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,680
His Lordship met an unjust demise.

177
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,950
I must avenge him.

178
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,180
   

179
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,900
Let's stop here today.

180
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,830
If there's nothing else, you may leave now.

181
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,330
Official Mu, anything else?

182
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:40,880
Your Majesty, I...

183
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,990
would like to ask for a few days off.

184
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:12,179
♫  I can't forget the love that is still is nipping at my ears and temples  ♫

185
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:19,650
♫  Memories keep slamming into rocks and have nowhere to berth  ♫

186

Young Lady.

208
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:22,959
♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

209
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:27,160
Young Lady, everything is settled.

210
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,450
I'll go cook now.

211
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,770
Go ahead.

212
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:43,509
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

213

♫  Obviously can't be erased, and haunted by lingering dreams  ♫

218
00:22:01,899 --> 00:22:05,949
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

219
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:13,880
♫  Want to have one more glimpse of you, 
 even just for a second more  ♫

220
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,520
 My Lord. 

221
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,970
 My Lord, 

222
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,140
 don't... don't leave. 

223
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,420
 You can't leave me alone. 

224
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,630
 Silly girl. 

225
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:53,540
 Weren't you once fearless of everything? 

226
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,650
 In the past, you told me 

227
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,410
 that even without me, 

228
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,000
 you were strong enough to survive on your own. 

229
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,750
 No, My Lord. 

230
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,320
 I... I was wrong. 

231
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,850
 I overestimated myself. 

232
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,130
 I can't live without you. 

233
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:17,000
 Don't leave me alone, please. 

234
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,760
 My Lord. 

235
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,329
Juli! Juli!

236
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,370
Young Lady.

237
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,539
Young Lady, you're awake.

238
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,410
Juli, pack up.

239
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,370
We're heading back to the capital.

240
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,229
   

241
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,050
Isn't that Official Mu ahead there?

242
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:35,360
I heard that she fell severely ill because of the death of the Prince Regent.

243
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,810
What are you talking about?

244
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,839
His Majesty issued an imperial decree, forbidding the holding of a funeral.

245
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,029
He could only be buried as an ordinary citizen. Did you forget about that?

246
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,890
Let's go.

247
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,190
Come on.

248
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,470
   

249
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,150
This is the list of the officials who contacted the people of the Princess's Residence in recent days.

250
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,110
   

251
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:00,179
     
 I'm not sure

252
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:02,741
    
 whether they have already chosen to align with Princess Roujia.

253
00:26:02,741 --> 00:26:04,170
Nevertheless, if 70% of them choose to support her,

254
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:07,310
the influence of the Princess's Residence will be significant.

255
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:11,340
I must admit, Princess Roujia is smart.

256
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:16,049
The list includes officials from noble families and officials from modest backgrounds.

257
00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:19,680
Despite their opposing views,

258
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,750
she successfully united them and garnered their support.

259
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:28,930
I used to think she

260
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:32,240
was the kindest and purest person in the world.

261
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:37,540
Now, it seems like I never truly knew her.

262
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,509
Princess Roujia can act well.

263
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:42,590
Both you and His Lordship got...

264
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:52,959
Previously, I read the memorial written by the Court of Judicial Review framing His Lordship.

265
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:56,030
I realized the evidence was vulnerable.

266
00:26:56,030 --> 00:27:00,140
It seems that wasn't Princess Roujia's style.

267
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,380
Official Mu, are you saying Princess Roujia did that on purpose?

268
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,679
I'm afraid framing His Lordship was the first step in Roujia's plan.

269
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:17,550
Next, she would use this to redress his unjust case.

270
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,420
How is that possible?

271
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,369
Princess Roujia was the one who framed His Lordship.

272
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:24,520
Why would she redress his case?

273
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:29,169
To the public, it was His Majesty who had put His Lordship to death.

274
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:34,070
Only His Majesty possesses the authority to execute the powerful Prince Regent.

275
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,440
As long as she exposes the discrepancies

276
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,410
and insists that His Lordship had been framed,

277
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:42,440
she could establish that His Majesty wrongly accused a loyal official.

278
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:48,330
Following that, she could isolate and pressure His Majesty, shaking his foundation.

279
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,730
She wants to usurp the throne.

280
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:54,490
Her final goal is His Majesty.

281
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:57,030
I won't let her plan succeed.

282
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,320
Why?

283
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,230
Even if this is Princess Roujia's conspiracy,

284
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:04,370
it was that person who gave the decree to take His Lordship's life.

285
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:06,850
Official Mu, why are you still helping him?

286
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,280
Because this is what His Lordship wanted.

287
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:16,650
I must fulfill His Lordship's wish no matter what.

288
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:28,069
Your Highness, I've heard that Mu Zhuohua has been acting unusual recently.

289
00:28:28,069 --> 00:28:31,230
It seems like she's investigating you in secret, Your Highness.

290
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,470
That's natural.

291
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,190
She and Uncle were close.

292
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:41,080
If she remains indifferent after his death,

293
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,330
I'd be worried.

294
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,160
Everything has been set in stone.

295
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,550
Mu Zhuohua is too minor a figure to affect anything.

296
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:02,490
I just think Mu Zhuohua and Your Highness are already at odds.

297
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:07,300
If this persists, she might end up being our biggest obstacle.

298
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,780
We used to be friends.

299
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,580
Since she wants to redress Uncle's case,

300
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,400
I'll make her wish come true.

301
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,040
 Stalks are burned to cook beans. 

302
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,930
 In the pot, the beans weep. 

303
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:29,750
 A treasured sword buries its grievances in the prison. 

304
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:33,180
 - The nobles struggle to be close.  
 - What are they reciting?

305
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,480
I heard that His Majesty put the Prince Regent to death.

306
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,240
The Prince Regent tried to usurp the throne.

307
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,110
He deserved to get executed.

308
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,000
You don't get it.

309
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,814
The Prince Regent has military power and has achieved great success in warfare.

310
00:29:44,814 --> 00:29:47,259
If he wanted to usurp the throne, he would've done that when the Emperor Emeritus passed away.

311
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:49,100
Why would he wait until now?

312
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,190
That makes sense.

313
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,849
But the Prince Regent is His Majesty's uncle.

314
00:29:55,849 --> 00:29:58,250
His Majesty wouldn't have accused him wrongly, would he?

315
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,510
Who knows?

316
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,139
His Majesty's mind is unpredictable.

317
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,910
Back then, the Northern Liang went south with great momentum.

318
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:09,940
Everywhere they went, blood was spilled.

319
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,949
All generals in the court were afraid.

320
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:17,630
The Prince Regent willingly assumed leadership and received orders to go north.

321
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:21,229
He managed to stop 100,000 soldiers from Northern Liang.

322
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,329
 Yes, you're right. 

323
00:30:23,329 --> 00:30:28,820
That battle was frightening and made the skies turn dark.

324
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,930
The Prince Regent gained renown after winning the battle.

325
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,320
With his sword,

326
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,050
he safeguarded the lands of Southern Chen.

327
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,410
 Yes, the Prince Regent is innocent. 

328
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,160
 - Great! 
 - The Prince Regent was innocent. 

329
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,530
Well said!

330
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:46,050
The new emperor framed his uncle and persecuted a loyal man.

331
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:49,130
He is ignorant and doesn't deserve to be the emperor!

332
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,610
 How ignorant. 

333
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,819
 The new emperor is a tyrant! 

334
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,810
 Ignorant and tyrannical! 

335
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:57,780
Huaizhou suffered huge losses in the disaster.

336
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,189
The people can barely feed themselves.

337
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:04,930
I am decreeing a three-year tax exemption for Huaizhou.

338
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,790
Is there any objection to this?

339
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,819
Your Majesty, you might not be aware

340
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:15,189
that the prolonged wars during the time of the Emperor Emeritus

341
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:19,710
nearly depleted the national treasury.

342
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,859
If you grant tax exemptions to Huaizhou,

343
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,350
will you also do the same to Qingzhou and Huangzhou

344
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:29,550
if they face disasters?

345
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,619
If this continues, the national treasury will be depleted.

346
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:38,179
How will we cover the expenses for disaster relief and military needs?

347
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:41,070
I agree with Official Zhou.

348
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:45,050
The national treasury is depleted, so taxes cannot be exempted.

349
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,600
I second that.

350
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,630
 We second that. 

351
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:07,550
Your Majesty, I believe that reducing or exempting taxes is possible.

352
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,469
The disaster at Huaizhou wasn't the people's fault.

353
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:14,770
Reducing or exempting taxes would allow the people time to recuperate

354
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,819
and display the imperial court's benevolence.

355
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:20,460
It is nothing but beneficial.

356
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,730
Official Mu, you made it sound easy.

357
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,780
It is easy to reduce or exempt taxes,

358
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,860
but what about the depletion of the national treasury?

359
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:33,560
Or are you capable of making money appear magically?

360
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,720
If Northern Liang causes trouble again,

361
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,810
the military will need several hundreds of thousands of taels.

362
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:40,050
Who is going to fork that?

363
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:44,370
As far as I'm aware, the people of Huaizhou have recently suffered from a disaster.

364
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:47,840
Even if they aren't completely destitute, they are in a state of poverty.

365
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,140
Official Zhou, even if you dig deep, you won't find a lot of money.

366
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,310
Your family's wealth far surpasses theirs.

367
00:32:55,310 --> 00:33:01,270
Even a small amount that escapes your grasp is sufficient to sustain the people of Huaizhou.

368
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:09,350
Official Zhou, if you are so concerned about the national treasury's depletion,

369
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:13,720
why don't you contribute your own funds to fill the gap?

370
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,620
How dare you?

371
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:21,569
Besides, you are concerned that Northern Liang might initiate a conflict.

372
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:26,970
Back when Lord Ding was imprisoned, you insisted on having him executed.

373
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:29,469
Why didn't that cross your mind back then?

374
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,870
You...

375
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:40,479
Lord Ding's execution was His Majesty's decree.

376
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:45,070
Official Mu, are you questioning His Majesty's decision?

377
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,999
 I might hold authority as the emperor, 

378
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:54,619
 but I find myself having to heed the counsel of others. 

379
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,930
 What kind of Emperor am I? 

380
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,370
Your Majesty.

381
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,160
Your Majesty.

382
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,650
Official Shen.

383
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,860
It's late.

384
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,210
Why are you here to see me?

385
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:48,519
I am here to deliver the assessment results of the Ministry of Personnel for the new year.

386
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,630
Leave it there.

387
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,810
Yes.

388
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:02,240
   

389
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,670
You may leave now.

390
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,070
Zhimo. 
    

391
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,360
Help me deliver this letter to Shen Jinghong.

392
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:25,950
Tell him I'd like to invite him to Xiaoqin Pleasure House.

393
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:38,150
Zhuohua,

394
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:40,910
it has been a while since your last visit.

395
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:44,630
Miss Song, I've been busy lately.

396
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,140
I have invited Official Shen to meet here today,

397
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,539
but it seems he isn't here yet.

398
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,619
It's fine.

399
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:54,490
As you wait for him, you can have some snacks.

400
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:56,260
Eat up, Miss Song.

401
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,930
   

402
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:09,230
Well, you've waited for over two hours.

403
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,619
Why isn't Official Shen here yet?

404
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,460
Perhaps something came up and caused a delay.

405
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,810
Shen Jinghong is hopeless.

406
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:23,960
Since he's ungrateful,

407
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,870
then don't hold me responsible for disregarding our friendship.

408
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:44,660
Your Highness, Official Shen never showed up.

409
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,130
What about Mu Zhuohua?

410
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:52,370
She waited for over two hours before leaving angrily.

411
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:58,060
Recently, he has been avoiding me.

412
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,850
Clearly, he still feels reserved.

413
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,050
Forget it.

414
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,480
Let me straighten him out.

415
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:37,080
♫  The love that opened my eyes  ♫

416
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:44,430
♫  Moonlight illuminates the path once traveled  ♫

417
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:48,240
♫  A dream of a goose and a phoenix crossing together  ♫

418
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,310
♫  Tenderness is like parting and complaints  ♫

419
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:58,709
♫  Going around for a lifetime, constantly cut and scattered, 
 the world is day and night  ♫

420
00:39:58,709 --> 00:40:06,569
♫  The fireworks of the world are like quicksand 
 of the world after all  ♫

421
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,889
Does it hurt?

422
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,339
Are you still mad at me?

423
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:18,870
No.

424
00:40:18,871 --> 00:40:21,219
♫  Again, someone on the precipice of fate  ♫

425
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,510
Why do you avoid me, then?

426
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,799
I've been thinking lately.

427
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,789
How is it going?

428
00:40:35,939 --> 00:40:38,020
I've thought it through.

429
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,889
Liu Yan is dead.

430
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:47,029
Liu Chen is overambitious and unrealistic.

431
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:47,870
♫  The sound of the wind is like 
 the desperate cries from the jackdaw  ♫

432
00:40:47,871 --> 00:40:48,949
He doesn't deserve to be the emperor.

433
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,640
You are the only one...

434
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:59,610
who truly deserves to be the ruler of Southern Chen.

435
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:02,409
♫  In the years of deep love, I am willing to shield you from the wind and sand  ♫

436
00:41:02,409 --> 00:41:04,229
That's all?

437
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:13,879
♫  Watch as the scars scab and turn into yesterday's flowers  ♫

438
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,960
I admit defeat.

439
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,430
I'll give you a gift.

440
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:29,360
♫  The world of mortals ends in loneliness and pain  ♫

441
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:11,099
Your Highness, our informant has reported

442
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,790
that there's a growing divide between His Majesty and Mu Zhuohua.

443
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,010
Liu Chen is overambitious but incompetent.

444
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:22,270
After killing Liu Yan,

445
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:25,590
he fell out with Mu Zhuohua.

446
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:28,930
Shen Jinghong, whom he believes to be his henchman,

447
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:31,560
has consistently supported my cause.

448
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:35,430
The noble families oppose him,

449
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:38,530
and the common people won't rally behind him.

450
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,540
He might not be fitting as the emperor,

451
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:47,090
but indeed, he's alone.

452
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:54,210
   

453
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:19,289
 The moon will rise, and the sun will fall. 

454
00:43:19,289 --> 00:43:24,409
 Yuanguang's reincarnation will turn the tables. 

455
00:43:24,409 --> 00:43:27,849
 The moon will rise, and the sun will fall. 

456
00:43:27,849 --> 00:43:32,889
 Yuanguang's reincarnation will turn the tables. 

457
00:43:32,889 --> 00:43:36,700
 The moon will rise, and the sun will fall. 

458
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:40,350
"The moon will rise, and the sun will fall."

459
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:42,389
This coincides with a woman's name.

460
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:44,210
She really has thick skin.

461
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:45,369
That's right.

462
00:43:45,369 --> 00:43:47,369
The reincarnation of Empress Yuanguang?

463
00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:50,170
I can't believe she's blowing her own trumpet.

464
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:53,469
"The moon is shining brightly."

465
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:57,370
It implies His Majesty is the setting sun.

466
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:01,249
She carefully planned step by step.

467
00:44:01,249 --> 00:44:05,111
As a result, His Majesty has been labeled a fatuous emperor.

468
00:44:05,111 --> 00:44:08,220
Now that the children's folk rhyme has been spread,

469
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:12,390
I believe she's gearing up to accede to the throne.

470
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:15,759
 The moon will rise, and the moon will fall. 

471
00:44:15,759 --> 00:44:21,970
 Yuanguang's reincarnation will turn the tables. 

472
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:26,220
Are you satisfied with the gift?

473
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:53,230
Your Highness, this move may appear to complicate the chess game.

474
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:57,430
However, in reality, it shatters a longstanding stalemate.

475
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:59,300
What a brilliant move.

476
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,830
Think of it as a thank-you gift.

477
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:10,710
Your Highness, the people have always praised you.

478
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:13,900
Now that His Majesty is perceived as foolish and inept,

479
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:18,440
it will contrast with your favor among the general public.

480
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,759
However, acquiring a favorable reputation alone won't suffice to enable her to ascend the throne.

481
00:45:24,759 --> 00:45:30,099
She requires something more substantial to instill confidence in her reception of the heavenly mandate.

482
00:45:30,099 --> 00:45:33,030
Liu Chen is the Emperor Emeritus' son

483
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:36,070
and the rightful heir to the throne.

484
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:38,560
For his fate to be sealed,

485
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:43,270
Heaven must be angered by his deeds.

486
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:49,670
That way, I can ascend to the throne rightfully.

487
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:55,690
Hence, we need...

488
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:57,630
The Imperial Seal.

489
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:00,870
She has set her sights on the Imperial Seal?

490
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:03,659
If she gets her hand on the Imperial Seal,

491
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:08,290
both reputation and heavenly mandate are on her side.

492
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:12,559
As a result, she can officially force the emperor to abdicate the throne.

493
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,300
That isn't enough.

494
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,769
If she wants to force the emperor to abdicate the throne, she must secure and control the Imperial City.

495
00:46:19,769 --> 00:46:23,960
The Zhou family who is in charge of the imperial guards can help her.

496
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,649
However, the imperial guards can't leave the Imperial City,

497
00:46:26,649 --> 00:46:30,660
and the Capital Region Army may send over help anytime.

498
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:34,619
She doesn't have enough military power to force the emperor to abdicate his throne.

499
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:37,610
But there are no other troops around.

500
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:39,479
She can't deploy troops from the border, can she?

501
00:46:39,479 --> 00:46:41,680
She doesn't have the authority to do so.

502
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:45,999
That's right.

503
00:46:45,999 --> 00:46:49,340
Yemu Zhen has been staying at the Princess's Residence.

504
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:53,180
Yemu Zhen will be her best go-between.

505
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:55,630
The seal isn't enough.

506
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:57,970
I've struck a deal with Yemu Jing.

507
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:03,830
He will send his troops to stop the Capital Region Army from providing help.

508
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:06,250
After I ascend the throne,

509
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:10,250
I will permit cross-border trade, display benevolence,

510
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:12,600
and lower border taxes.

511
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:26,070
Are you angry?

512
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:36,300
Yemu Jing is wildly ambitious and greedy.

513
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,570
You... don't worry.

514
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:40,810
I got this.

515
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:43,170
I won't let him take advantage of me.

516
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:46,610
Princess Roujia is asking the tiger for its fur.

517
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:49,890
If she isn't careful enough, it might backfire on her.

518
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:53,940
Colluding with Northern Liang is something she's familiar with.

519
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:56,250
After all, it isn't her first time doing so.

520
00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:00,910
Following this, we must devise a plan to deal with the situation.

521
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:14,990


522
00:48:18,068 --> 00:48:25,527
♫  I can't forget the love that is still is nipping at my ears and temples  ♫

523
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:32,827
♫  Memories keep slamming into rocks and have nowhere to berth  ♫

524
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:40,267
♫  Both sides gaze at each other in the drizzling rain, but one has turned into clouds and mist  ♫

525
00:48:40,267 --> 00:48:48,787
♫  Leaving the isolated heart's island, like waves without a shore  ♫

526
00:48:48,787 --> 00:48:52,527
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

527
00:48:52,527 --> 00:48:56,087
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

528
00:48:56,087 --> 00:49:00,207
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

529
00:49:00,207 --> 00:49:03,587
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

530
00:49:03,588 --> 00:49:07,107
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

531
00:49:07,108 --> 00:49:10,827
♫  Obviously willing to swear life and death 
 to be entangled for a lifetime  ♫

532
00:49:10,828 --> 00:49:15,127
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

533
00:49:15,127 --> 00:49:21,528
♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

534
00:49:34,428 --> 00:49:42,027
♫  I can't forget the turmoil of love and hate, 
 even if the next day is far away  ♫

535
00:49:42,027 --> 00:49:50,487
♫  Two souls embrace in chaos, how can it be written off?  ♫

536
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:54,367
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

537
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:57,908
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

538
00:49:57,908 --> 00:50:01,887
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

539
00:50:01,887 --> 00:50:05,327
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

540
00:50:05,327 --> 00:50:09,027
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

541
00:50:09,027 --> 00:50:12,707
♫  Obviously can't be erased, and haunted by lingering dreams  ♫

542
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:16,587
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

543
00:50:16,587 --> 00:50:24,368
♫  Want to have one more glimpse of you, 
 even just for a second more  ♫
