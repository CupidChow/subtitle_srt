- I'd like to have one. 
 - Thank you.

26
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,720
I will have one, too.

   ]Three days to go] 

44
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,240
Young Lady.

45
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,930
Young Lady.

46
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,760
Young Lady, we should go now. Come on.

47
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,330
- Where are we going? 
 - Fuyun Temple.

48
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,550
- No, I don't want to. 
 - Hurry up.

49
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,940
We're running late. Come on.

50
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,730
- Why are we late? 
 - You'll know it later. Come on.

51
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,210
   

52
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:33,700
"Long tresses draped by her face lazily, the moon shines upon the pear blossoms.

53
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,850
Moaning for her loved one dearly,

54
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,660
when will you be back, my love?"

55
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,590
I can't believe Shen Jinghong actually composed such an amorous poem.

56
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,690
And yet people revered him as Young Master Jinghong.

57
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,660
My, my. This is disgraceful.

58
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,150
Young Lady, but you were reading his poem with such zeal.

59
00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:01,620
Because I'm not a demure lady like others.

60
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,030
You keep mentioning how much you appreciate Young Master Jinghong, too.

61
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,300
Well, because Young Master Jinghong
is our cash cow.

62
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,760
Naturally, I admire him.

63
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,710
There's no way I'm mistreating my cash cow.

64
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,040
Why did you bring me here to Fuyun Temple this early morning?

65
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,050
It's said that prayers made here will be answered.

66
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,680
Today's Buddha's birthday.

67
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,320
All of the disciples come here to offer incense and pray for their success in the examination.

68
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,890
Everyone comes seeking blessings from Bodhisattva, but only limited qualification spots exist.

69
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,520
Which one should Bodhisattva give her blessing to?

70
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,220
You have given Bodhisattva a hard time, you know?

71
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,730
Needless to say, the most sincere believer will be blessed.

72
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,971
By the way, Young Lady, you must watch your words when we pray before Bodhisattva.

73
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:44,280
People know that fame is nothing but immaterial.

74
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,460
Still, everyone yearns for it.

75
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,260
The more, the better.

76
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,710
Praying for nothing at Fuyun Temple. 
  ("Nothing" and "Fuyun" are homophones.) 

77
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,790
What a unique turn of mind.

78
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:12,690
Young Lady, kneel at the center so that Bodhisattva can see you right away.

79
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,930
Merciful Bodhisattva, please bless Young Lady with the top place in the examination.

80
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,040
If not, the second place is good too.

81
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,540
Also, please bless her witha healthy, safe, and long life.

82
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,330
May she lead a happy life.

83
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,540
Isn't that too much to ask with your paltry offering?

84
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,270
It's greedy, though.

85
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,320
Merciful Bodhisattva, I don't have much money.

86
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,200
But as long as you can bless Young Lady, I can do anything for you.

87
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:57,330
Young Lady, what wish did you make to Bodhisattva?

88
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,420
Everyone here seeks blessings from Bodhisattva.

89
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,110
And she has to respond to each of them.

90
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,690
I wish Bodhisattva to be happy every day.

91
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:17,180
Young Lady, Madam Lu told me there will be a Fuyun Poetry Gathering at Liuyun Pavilion later.

92
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,760
Perhaps we'll get to witness Young Master Jinghong with his marvelous poems here.

93
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,760
So I'm bringing you there.

94
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,640
You can memorize all his poems and transcribe them into another collection for sale.

95
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,730
Juli, I'll leave this task to you.

96
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,650
My stomach hurts. I got a stomach ache.

97
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,860
- You have to handle this now. 
 - Young Lady, wait.

98
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,560
Young Lady!

99
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,960
Greetings, My Lord.

100
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,080
Why are you here?

101
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,270
Did you hint to me to come to the back mountain

102
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:14,540
when you showed the back of your head to me just now?

103
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,710
Did I guess wrong?

104
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,640
Your explanation is unconvincing.

105
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,900
Well, then.

106
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,170
Because I think everywhere else is crowded, except for the back mountain.

107
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,800
Maybe you wouldn't want to speak with me in a crowded place.

108
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,070
That's why I came here to try my luck.

109
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:37,450
And I'm truly lucky.

110
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,450
Do you even believe in luck?

111
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:46,780
You didn't show any sign of sincerity before Bodhisattva just now.

112
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:51,930
People seek blessings from Bodhisattva, but I wish her a happy life.

113
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,000
In that case, aren't I the one who treats Bodhisattva the best?

114
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,120
Why didn't you seek blessings like others did?

115
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,560
I'd rather seek blessings from you than from Bodhisattva.

116
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,080
The examiner is right in front of me.

117
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,300
I mustn't waste the chance that's nearest to me.

118
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,500
- Please, Wen. 
 - Thank you.

119
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,570
My Lord.

120
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:55,900
Why did you want to see me?

121
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,260
Where did you learn about the Revival Powder?

122
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:04,330
My mother told me when I was little.

123
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:08,980
However, she only knew a few ingredients like the Immortal Fruit.

124
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,790
She had no ideaabout the complete prescription.

125
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,270
I've sent men to ask all famous physicians in the capital about it,

126
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,530
but no one has heard about the Revival Powder.

127
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,850
Not even the Imperial Academy of Medicine?

128
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,990
Why are you so sure that it's from the Imperial Academy of Medicine?

129
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,470
Ingredients of the Revival Powder are precious,

130
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,850
especially the Immortal Fruit, which is outrageously hefty.

131
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,660
I couldn't think of anyone else except for the Imperial Academy of Medicine to afford such precious herbs.

132
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:44,340
Besides, I haven't heard about this prescription from the commoners.

133
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:48,600
I've already looked into the Imperial Academy of Medicine, but nothing has been found.

134
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:54,330
Did your mother make a mistake on this?

135
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,630
My Lord, let me tell you this.

136
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:01,230
My mother didn't remember much about her childhood times.

137
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:06,550
However, she had deep impressions on particular memories she had, especially the Immortal Fruit.

138
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,230
Oh, right.

139
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,130
The Immortal Fruit.

140
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:16,351
My Lord, you should look into its origin and consumption

141
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:19,000
if you found nothing about the prescription.

142
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,350
Immortal Fruit is a precious ingredient.

143
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:24,750
I suppose only the royal families of various nations have them.

144
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,760
In that case,

145
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,880
how did you identify the smell on Yun Xiangyue's garment as the Immortal Fruit?

146
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,510
Well...

147
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:43,160
My father heard that the Immortal Fruit could help...

148
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,700
It could help to boost a man's vigor.

149
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,800
So he spent a fortune to obtain one before and recruited a famous physician to study it.

150
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,480
I've seen it before in my family's medical room.

151
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,760
It seems that you got to witness all kinds of exotic treasures

152
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,160
because of the affluent Mu family in Jiangnan.

153
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,030
You flatter me.

154
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,230
My Lord,

155
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:14,710
you might find some clues by looking into the origin and consumption

156
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,460
of the Immortal Fruit.

157
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,500
This is a useful lead.

158
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,730
I will look into it.

159
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,510
However...

160
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,500
You are still suspicious.

161
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:39,590
 It's bound to happen, anyway. 

162
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,500
 Bravo! 

163
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,820
 The affair of Jishan Hall has been keeping me busy lately. 

164
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,270
 I will come if I have time. 

165
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,460
 Well played. 

166
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,660
 It's been some time since I played this. 

167
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,160
 Brother Shen. 

168
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:34,120
 Is Brother Shen going to make a performance, too? 

169
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,740
 Maybe. 

170
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,940
I don't know much about the guqin.

171
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:56,010
However, the melody gave me a sense of carefreeness and boundlessness.

172
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,280
- Greetings, Your Highness. 
  - Greetings, Your Highness. 

173
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:05,410
You flatter me, Your Highness.

174
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:09,880
No need to feel constrained.

175
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,730
Please continue. Be relaxed.

176
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,180
I came here to learn something, too.

177
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,080
My Lord, if the Revival Powder is a unique prescription,

178
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,170
why would I dig my own grave by revealing it to you?

179
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,720
Only you and your mother know about this.

180
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,730
By any chance, did your mother create this?

181
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
My Lord,

182
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,260
it seems that you've run a thorough background check on me.

183
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,170
I came from the Mu family in Jiangnan.

184
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:54,170
My mother was sold into a house of ill repute because of the family's downfall in her early years.

185
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:57,770
She couldn't remember her parents' names,

186
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:01,390
so she gave herself a name.

187
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:06,550
Afterward, my father gave her a new name, Gu Yixiao.

188
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,560
 Mother, I read a poem today. 

189
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,980
 "Reminiscing my earlier time when I departed. When I departed, the willow was drifting along with the breeze." 

190
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:19,920
 Mother, can you tell me where you are from? 

191
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,760
 Like the fallen petals from an unknown tree... 

192
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,170
 outside the window, I don't know where I came from. 

193
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:46,090
The metropolitan examination isn't your only goal to come to the capital. Right?

194
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,690
You seem to know everything.

195
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,850
Why bother asking me?

196
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,600
That's your personal affair. I won't pry.

197
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:05,110
But you should know what I want.

198
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:10,900
My Lord, I know about Revival Powder because of my mother.

199
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:16,050
But as for how she came to know about it,

200
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:20,110
I'm finding it bizarre too.

201
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,830
Since I was little, she taught me how to read and write.

202
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:28,540
She taught me medical skills and life principles.

203
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:32,250
However, I'm clueless

204
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,840
about how she knew so much knowledge.

205
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,640
As of now, she's buried six feet underground.

206
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,860
Where she came from remains mysterious to me.

207
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:54,660
I'd be grateful to you if you can find the answer for me.

208
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,640
I already know.

209
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,580
My Lord, do I have your trust now?

210
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,540
No.

211
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,970
But I trust...

212
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,260
the sincere love of the children for their parents.

213
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,370
So, do you believe me or not?

214
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:32,560
"Like a homeless wayfarer,

215
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,840
I have nowhere to make port.

216
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,360
Eager to earn myself a great name,

217
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,820
yet times have failed me."

218
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,890
 Well done! 

219
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:51,480
This poem is good and artistic.

220
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:58,260
However, a hesitant man wouldn't achieve something big.

221
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,800
Your Highness...

222
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,550
Come.

223
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,380
I heard that you're renowned for your poetry talent in the capital, Young Master Jinghong.

224
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:14,210
Why don't you grace us with your new poems today?

225
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:17,740
Brother Shizong, I believe the First Prince came here

226
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,430
to help Shen Jinghong garner more attention.

227
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,790
No need to be mad. Here.

228
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,670
I guess he's going to secure his place on the top rank this year.

229
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,200
"My aspirations never once swayed despite meritorious achievements."

230
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:46,840
"Thousand years of history have been left in oblivion.

231
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,780
I shall stand down as the nation nestles in peace.

232
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:55,690
Triumphing above all names of this era."

233
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:59,780
 What a marvelous one! 

234
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,300
"Upon withered grass and frosty sand,

235
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,610
warriors are rapturous in bloodshed.

236
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:14,010
Yet Yin Mountain is shielded from the clamor of war,

237
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:17,550
surrounded by clover meadows with a serene moon on high."

238
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:21,310
 Well said! Nice poem! 

239
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:24,450
"Drunk in a dream, losing direction,

240
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,380
sunset is cut short as Chinese francolins cry.

241
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,540
Gentle spring showers fall onto the river,

242
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,890
I bid farewell to my friends as red maple leaves pile up high."

243
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,260
 Great poem! 

244
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,060
 Excellent! 

245
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,540
"Low clouds urge the sun to set...

246
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,820
and strong gusts curl the flags up.

247
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,780
- Wailing of swan geese at boundary halt, 
 - It's Young Master Jinghong.

248
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,180
I savor tea in the southern garden peacefully.

249
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,970
A calm plume of smoke around the amber sky,

250
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,920
- garrison stays guard at the frontier. 
 - Come with me.

251
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,260
And the expanse of the horizon

252
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,790
- appears serene and harmonious. 
 - Come on.

253
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,530
The lonely cloud astonishes the moon from afar.

254
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:12,550
The old heroes now have grizzled hair."

255
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:16,310
His Lordship still wants to meet Miss Mu, which means they're still helpful to us.

256
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,540
Go with her and see what she wants to say.

257
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:21,960
- "Never has he forgotten the great vow, 
 - Go.

258
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,700
- Shall not return until peace is secured." 
 - Are you good at making mental notes?

259
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,310
Do you remember everything Young Master Jinghong said just now?

260
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,230
Can you transcribe them for me?

261
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,230
I need them.

262
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:40,490
But my handwriting is ugly.

263
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,230
It's fine, as long as you can record everything.

264
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,980
Please. Please help me.

265
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,680
 One more, Brother Shen. 

266
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,990
 That's right. One more, Shen. 

267
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,010
"Three thousand iron-armored knights,

268
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:57,380
a million war-flagged armies,

269
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:04,210
and sturdy soldiers are ready to depart as the drum sounds.

270
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:09,710
An imposing valiance held within

271
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,450
and boasted with brilliant strategies.

272
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,550
Righteous loyalists stand tall...

273
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:24,500
even though they are not young anymore."

274
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,780
"Gunpowder rampages cities and walls collapse.

275
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:36,480
Embers reflect on war-hardened armor, lonely in the dead of night."

276
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:42,960
"White bones repose underneath the sand along the homeward road.

277
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,210
The sound of the war bell and temple drum heralds news of victory."

278
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,900
Did I write anything wrong?

279
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,360
No.

280
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,080
Did I miss out on something?

281
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,520
No.

282
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,260
But it hurts my eyes to read your handwriting.

283
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:09,710
   

284
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,160
I'm impressed by your "Righteous loyalists stand tall even though they are not young anymore."

285
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,720
I have indeed chosen the right person.

286
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,560
It was a reckless and poor performance, Your Highness.

287
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:36,600
I prefer recklessness over those feeble and pretentious complaints.

288
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:41,020
Composing poetry is just a trivial skill for entertainment.

289
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,140
You're right.

290
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:48,880
I can tell you're ambitious and patriotic.

291
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,820
You must be the pillar of the nation in the future.

292
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,120
The metropolitan examination is around the corner.

293
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,320
I shall look forward to your performance.

294
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,560
Much obliged, Your Highness.

295
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,060
I didn't expect the First Prince to be here.

296
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:30,440
I heard that His Highness is interested in poetry, especially borderland poems.

297
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,040
Besides, he likes martial arts and is intrepid.

298
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,020
That's why he's close to you.

299
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,960
Everyone knows that you treat the three princes equally.

300
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:49,380
My Lord, but Shen Jinghong has had a flawed reputation recently.

301
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,380
Why did you bring him up all of a sudden?

302
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,640
Shen Jinghong does make a name for himself in the capital,

303
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,160
but he has made the scholars mortified.

304
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,520
He isn't well-regarded in the circle.

305
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,200
If His Highness intends to help him develop his potential,

306
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,980
it's best if he can help him restore his reputation first.

307
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,440
How?

308
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,180
Even though Shen Jinghong's literary talent is known to the entire capital,

309
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:20,040
he lacks a good lofty reputation.

310
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,740
Not only that, many of his poems only circulated among theaters.

311
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,640
But given his ambitious poems about the borderland today,

312
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,160
he managed to ignite passion and a sense of admiration in those listeners.

313
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,100
What do all these have to do with me?

314
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,700
My Lord,

315
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,660
His Highness cares about his man.

316
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:52,040
Could you please be nice to me, too?

317
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,380
Who sent you here?

318
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,360
Well, I am always on your side, My Lord.

319
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,060
What do you want me to do?

320
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,560
My Lord,

321
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:21,500
there's been a price hike in the capital recently, especially for writing supplies.

322
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:26,120
Though I come from the Mu family, I'm just an undesirable daughter of a concubine.

323
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,080
I didn't bring much money...

324
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,480
when I came to the capital.

325
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:40,980
Well, I've been helping you a little these days. Right?

326
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:46,980
Truth be told, even ladies in Xiaoqin Pleasure House paid me two sycees for my treatment.

327
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,500
That day...

328
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,280
During the literary gathering in Wenzheng Parlor, I sat beside your table.

329
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,260
Do you remember what you said?

330
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,740
Did you hear everything?

331
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,140
I did.

332
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,980
I know I've spoken my heart out about my admiration for you.

333
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,380
Why do you ask since you already heard it?

334
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,280
I feel shy.

335
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,840
Did you really speak your heart out?

336
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,040
Certainly.

337
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,340
My admiration and loyalty to you are genuine.

338
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:37,120
The whole world can bear witness to it.

339
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,780
Do you admire me because I'm reckless and I took undeserved credit?

340
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,020
Well...

341
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,540
I thought you were planning to lure the enemy with yourself.

342
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:58,280
As the old saying goes, the distinguished ones shouldn't expose themselves in a vulnerable place.

343
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,660
I was worried about you.

344
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,660
Thank you, My Lord!

345
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,960
This is great!

346
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,180
Zhimo, you're so kind.

347
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,200
Zhimo!

348
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,700
Why...

349
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,740
I'm sorry.

350
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,100
I lost control of myself.

351
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,020
Does it hurt?

352
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,460
I didn't mean to sprain your arm.

353
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,640
I must send you to see a physician now.

354
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,280
Did you reattach your arm?

355
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,660
Zhimo, how brilliant of you!

356
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,060
My Lord.

357
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,200
Weirdly, Mu Zhuohua shows up here at this time.

358
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,740
Besides, she knows the secret about the Revival Powder.

359
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,800
She's suspicious.

360
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,580
This matter concerns the lives of 30,000 soldiers.

361
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,420
We need to test her again.

362
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,860
Understood.

363
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,880
Tonight, go and fetch Mu Zhuohua.

364
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,300
We're taking her to Tiantong Mountain.

365
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,120
Are you suspecting that she has something to do with the mastermind behind it?

366
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,440
I'd like to find out if this person...

367
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,500
matches my suspicions.

368
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,440
I see, you're luring her into the trap to kill two birds with one stone.

369
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,160
This is wise, My Lord.

370
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,670
   

371
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,920
Greetings, Your Highness.

372
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,620
I heard that you composed great poems at the Fuyun Poetry Gathering.

373
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,980
Your poetic talent has greatly pleased my brother.

374
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:33,320
It's a pity that you weren't there, Your Highness.

375
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:38,280
I was occupied with the affairs of Jishan Hall, and I couldn't make it this morning.

376
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,800
You must be tired, Your Highness.

377
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,680
Chen'er has a discerning eye for talents.

378
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,480
It's not a bad thing being noticed by him.

379
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,280
I should congratulate you.

380
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:00,340
After today's Fuyun Poetry Gathering, you'll likely make a name for yourself.

381
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,000
It's because of your advice, Your Highness.

382
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,920
Young Master Shen, you're a man of great talent.

383
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,140
I have plenty of collections in my study.

384
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,680
You can read them if you want.

385
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,780
Hopefully, you can triumph in the examination and represent scholars from humble roots.

386
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,100
I appreciate that, Your Highness.

387
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,220
But concerning the current situation,

388
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:29,220
the tide of humble scholars can't be turned by my effort alone.

389
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,540
But surely that's all the more reason you should stand up first.

390
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:37,580
Someone has to take the first step to inspire others to follow in their footsteps.

391
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,500
I agree with you.

392
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,600
Your Highness,

393
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,600
were you playing the Immortal Seeking game?

394
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,320
Do you know this?

395
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,660
Not much.

396
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,360
Would you like to have a round with me?

397
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,920
I will, as long as you wish.

398
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,120
   

399
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,760
Be honest with me. Why did Lord Ding give you so much money?

400
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,040
Did you curry favor with him?

401
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,560
I don't have the guts.

402
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:19,060
I just tricked him a little.

403
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:25,580
You see, Lord Ding is a dangerous character who doesn't trust others easily.

404
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:30,900
But the problem is, we have to meet him because of the Revival Powder.

405
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,340
Tell me. What more can I do, then?

406
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,960
You must gain his trust.

407
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,640
I realized that although he's known as a nefarious demon,

408
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,060
not only is he not bloodthirsty, but also a little bit easy to talk with.

409
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:48,880
So, I employed a bit of my wit today.

410
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,000
You managed to earn 500 taels today.

411
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,280
It's not merely wit. It's wisdom.

412
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,680
Dealing with a dangerous and strong opponent,

413
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:03,500
not only should I show my strengths but also some weaknesses.

414
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,900
A capable but greedy subordinate is more manageable.

415
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,540
If so, does Lord Ding trust you now?

416
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,080
How is that possible?

417
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,860
People who have experienced death on the battlefield like him won't place trust in others easily.

418
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:28,280
Therefore, doing business with him is the best way to deal with him.

419
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:34,100
However, the Revival Powder really bugs me a lot.

420
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,800
You assist him and he pays you money.

421
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,840
Why are you troubled?

422
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,640
I guess he's investigating three leads now.

423
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,440
First, the record of the Immortal Fruit.

424
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,160
Second, my mother's origin.

425
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,960
Third, the body of Deputy General Yuan.

426
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,840
Juli, you know what?

427
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,400
My mother told me that my grandfather used to serve at the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

428
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,380
The record of the Revival Powder, which even Lord Ding couldn't trace,

429
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:10,860
appeared in the medical book left by my grandfather.

430
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,020
Could it be that this Revival Powder was created by him?

431
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,680
That's quite possible.

432
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,240
Perhaps this is a secret prescription.

433
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,560
Oh no, this is bad.

434
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:27,420
What if Lord Ding gets revenge on me once he discovers this?

435
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,080
This can't be.

436
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,880
Get revenge on you?

437
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,120
What should you do? Why must he blame you for past grievances?

438
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,400
You said Lord Ding has a coital difficulty.

439
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,660
You can treat his problem, so he can...

440
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,480
You must bite your tongue.

441
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:48,140
Last time, Lord Ding was sitting beside us at Wenzheng Parlor.

442
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,100
- Well... Can't we even talk here? 
 - No

443
00:33:52,121 --> 00:33:54,560
We must watch our words even when we're at home.

444
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:58,260
Who knows if someone's eavesdropping on us now?

445
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,460
There is really someone outside.

446
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,660
Young Lady, don't be afraid.

447
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,460
- I'll check it out. 
 - Go now.

448
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,360
We... We didn't badmouth Lord Ding!

449
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,540
Take the broom away.

450
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,800
Are you going to kill us with your sword again?

451
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,580
Even if I do so, the broom won't help much.

452
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,780
True, though.

453
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,440
What do you come here for?

454
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,200
You want my Young Lady to treat His Lordship again?

455
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,080
Why?

456
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,960
Does Lord Ding not deserve this?

457
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,080
Of course, Lord Ding deserves it.

458
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,360
Of course, he does.

459
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,100
Juli, stay at home. I'll go with him.

460
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,260
No. I must tag along.

461
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,840
The horse is ready.

462
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,080
Do I have to ride a horse?

463
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,680
You can't ride a horse, so stay.

464
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,700
I can hold onto you.

465
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,900
The latest poetry collection by Shen Jinghong will be printed soon.

466
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,500
Someone from the printing house will send them over at any time.

467
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,520
You can't leave at this moment.

468
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,840
It'll be bad if Young Master Shen loses his popularity and his poetry collection becomes unmarketable.

469
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,820
Will Young Master Jinghong lose his popularity in such a short time?

470
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:03,220
After I top the examination, he'll lose his popularity by then.

471
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,420
You're right, Young Lady.

472
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,620
You must be careful.

473
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,380
Come home early. The examination is approaching.

474
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,080
Take care of our home.

475
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,980
Coming.

476
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,160
You must be very careful, Young Lady.

477
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,180
Take care of our house.

478
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,680
Let's go.

479
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,360
Slow down!

480
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,620
My Lord, here she is.

481
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:42,360
I didn't tell you to bring her here in this way.

482
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,461
Isn't she great? I bet she can ride a horse.

483
00:35:44,461 --> 00:35:45,560
Just drop the act.

484
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,680
I can't ride a horse.

485
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,380
I really can't.

486
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,540
Forget it.

487
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,480
Pass your medicine chest to Zhimo. You'll ride with me.

488
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,220
What?

489
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,640
Pass me the medicine chest.

490
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,140
All right.

491
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,660
Come on.

492
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,260
What... What?

493
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,340
Come on.

494
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:25,880
I... My Lord. My legs... My legs are numb.

495
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,080
I'm having a cramp.

496
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,200
My Lord.

497
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,400
Where are we going?

498
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,140
I need you to check on a dead body.

499
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,100
I'll double the reward.

500
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,040
My Lord, must I really go there?

501
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,040
The metropolitan examination is around the corner.

502
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,200
I planned to study at home these days.

503
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,520
Besides, I'm not a coroner.

504
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:09,300
Well, this is beyond my knowledge...

505
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:17,900
Because I think there is something on the body that ordinary coroners can't identify.

506
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,600
You know something about the Revival Powder, after all.

507
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,560
My Lord,

508
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,200
I'm afraid I might waste time traveling back and forth,

509
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,680
and it may affect my performance in the metropolitan examination.

510
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,300
We will get there in a day if we ride faster.

511
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,880
In a day?

512
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,060
Why?

513
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,840
But... if you're really that anxious, we should depart now.

514
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,600
No, My Lord.

515
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,440
Can we discuss this again?

516
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,140
Discuss—

517
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,580
I mean we must ride faster. Even faster.

518
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,720
Mu Zhuohua seems so unreliable.

519
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,380
It's His Lordship's order.

520
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,220
I know.

521
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,200
I doubt if she can help His Lordship.

522
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,760
She's so timid.

523
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,900
I bet she'll be trembling in her boots when she sees the body, let alone examine the body.

524
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,900
I think she's capable of that.

525
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,200
What if she's not?

526
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,620
She hides her skill.

527
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,800
You seem to believe her, though.

528
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,180
We should go now.

529
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,020
Greetings, My Lord.

530
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,100
Where's the body?

531
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,820
It's inside.

532
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,420
Show me the way.

533
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,340
- Only skeletons are left. 
 - My Lord.

534
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,700
We found a badge beside him...

535
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,640
and it verifies the identity of Deputy General Yuan.

536
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,840
 My father... 

537
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,320
 was loyal and brave all his life. 

538
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,580
 He would never betray his country. 

539
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,200
 Someone used my mother's and my life to threaten him. 

540
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,080
Come here.

541
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,520
This person has been dead for more than five years.

542
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,400
There are a total of thirteen injuries on the remains, five of which are fractures.

543
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,720
They were caused by a fall from a height.

544
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,280
Besides, there are eight scratches

545
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,260
that are deep into the bones and contracted inwardly.

546
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:01,200
Possibly, it was caused by an iron weapon resembling a hawk's claw.

547
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,160
Did you find anything?

548
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,080
My Lord,

549
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:34,560
most of the wounds and scars aren't fatal.

550
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,080
Are you saying that you've found the fatal wound?

551
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,280
Look at it here, My Lord.

552
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,660
A needle mark.

553
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,840
I just saw this now.

554
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,000
You're thorough.

555
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,200
I'm ashamed of my mistake.

556
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,200
Please don't say that, sir.

557
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,240
It's likely to have been overlooked since there are so many injuries.

558
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,600
I learned acupuncture techniques before.

559
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,640
Thus, I pay particular attention to needle marks.

560
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:15,460
Please look over here, My Lord. Another needle mark here.

561
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,540
It pierced from the frontal bone to the occipital bone.

562
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,340
This is fatal.

563
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:27,480
Therefore, this man was initially injured by a hawk-claw-like weapon

564
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,140
and then pierced by a needle.

565
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,420
He fell off the cliff

566
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:35,020
and died after suffering severe injuries.

567
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,560
The murderer had chased him tightly and determined to kill him.

568
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:47,040
My Lord, I dare to ask, who this Deputy General Yuan is?

569
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,840
Five years ago, he sent me fake intelligence...

570
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,420
during the war at Juma River.

571
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,300
Thereafter, his whereabouts were unknown.

572
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:06,500
A few days ago, I tracked his daughter down.

573
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:12,400
I was told that someone coerced him with the kidnapping of his wife and daughter.

574
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,560
And he was forced to send out fake intelligence.

575
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,820
Yun Xiangyue was his daughter.

576
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,080
Yun Xiangyue?

577
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:40,980
