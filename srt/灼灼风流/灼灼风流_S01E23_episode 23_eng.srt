1
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:25,160


2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,459
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:34,980
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:47,879
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,159
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,259
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,479
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,579
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,579
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:18,539
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

12
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:24,000
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,239
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:36,918
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,019
   

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,059
   

17
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:44,939
   

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,040
   

19
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,100
Here we have the noblest lady of Jiangzuo.

20
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,440
What would others think of you if they were to figure out

21
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,759
the cheap ploys you've resorted to?

22
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,159
I did nothing.

23
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,180
It has nothing to do with me.

24
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:12,420
Miss Sun, I need to tell you that I know the tea tasted strange.

25
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,218
I didn't expose you because I found it pointless.

26
00:02:16,218 --> 00:02:20,600
However, you're getting under my skin by doing so several times.

27
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,998
Lord Ding and I go way back to our childhood.

28
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:31,880
But when I finally returned to the capital, everything changed totally.

29
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,580
You're in my way!

30
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,619
Miss Sun, let me repeat this to you.

31
00:02:38,619 --> 00:02:41,100
Before this, I didn't hold you accountable

32
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,560
because I'd taken your jealousy lightly as it wouldn't affect to much.

33
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,558
But you keep making mischief

34
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:49,958
and have affected the operation of the Ministry of Revenue.

35
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,500
Don't blame me for turning against you!

36
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,439
All right, Official Mu.

37
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,320
I promise it won't happen again.

38
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:04,059
You're here, Your Majesty.

39
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,839
- Greetings, Your Majesty. 
 - Greetings, Your Majesty.

40
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:18,959
I suppose Miss Sun might be having some difficulties after arriving here.

41
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,458
Besides, she has to do her duty at the Ministry of Revenue.

42
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:25,539
So, I came to check on her.

43
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:31,239
And now I run into you here, who's bullying a newcomer.

44
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:35,399
Official Mu,

45
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:39,240
do you admit your fault?

46
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,918
 They're really meant to be in one family. Sheesh. 

47
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,660
I do.

48
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:54,619
I lost control of myself and snapped at Observer Sun just now.

49
00:04:00,499 --> 00:04:03,120
My Lord, bad news.

50
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,859
While the Dowager Empress was on her way to visit Observer Sun,

51
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:07,539
she caught Official Mu and Observer Sun having a spat.

52
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,320
Hence, Official Mu was punished by kneeling for two hours.

53
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,939
- How long has it been? 
 - More than an hour.

54
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:18,158
- Bring along the anti-swelling ointment. 
 - Yes.

55
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,238
Sir, you can send this letter to your family.

56
00:04:29,238 --> 00:04:31,519
I've written everything you wanted me to write.

57
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,499
All right. Thank you, Young Master.

58
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:37,459
Thank you so much.

59
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,119
Man'er told me you came to Jishan Hall as soon as you got off work.

60
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,740
You've skipped dinner, too.

61
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:01,239
What's this?

62
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,720
Man'er said you like sweet desserts.

63
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,579
Have a seat.

64
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,899
Princess Roujia, you're here too.

65
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,379
Jishan Hall belongs to Her Highness.

66
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:49,700
Naturally, she's here.

67
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:52,558
Well. Anyway, I'm here for you.

68
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:54,459
Me?

69
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:57,458
You... You want to talk to Official Shen?

70
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,878
Yes, I do.

71
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:01,458
Shen Jinghong promised to teach me poems of the Central Plains.

72
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,078
But he's too busy.

73
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:05,219
So I came here myself.

74
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:09,160
Great effort, Official Shen.

75
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,979
I don't mind lending the place to you.

76
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:20,820
Men from the Central Plains stick to promises, don't they?

77
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:25,619
It's time for you to fulfill your promise.

78
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:47,679
The Dowager Empress wants you to kneel for two full hours, not a second less.

79
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:56,039
Official Mu,

80
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:59,580
my family is the most prestigious clan in Jiangzuo,

81
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,659
while I'm the legitimate eldest daughter of the Sun clan.

82
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:08,720
Behind me, it's the Dowager Empress and Consort Shu.

83
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,579
If I marry Lord Ding, we're a fated couple for his promising future.

84
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:16,040
While you,

85
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:18,819
no way.

86
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:20,699
Stop your pipe dream.

87
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,639
Frankly, it's unnecessary to corner me like this

88
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:35,259
and spend so much time and effort on me.

89
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,479
He doesn't like you.

90
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,520
It's not that I don't like you.

91
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,279
But you keep showing up before me every day.

92
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,659
I almost started to believe that you admired me instead.

93
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:53,659
Is it worth the effort?

94
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:59,320
If you leave, at least...

95
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,779
At least he'll be conscious of me.

96
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,540
Miss Sun, let me repeat this to you.

97
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,719
He is himself, and I am myself.

98
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:13,680
Whomever he chooses to marry has nothing to do with me.

99
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,380
His Lordship said not to reveal his name.

100
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,798
- Understood. 
 - Thank you.

101
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,799
Thank you.

102
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:03,659
Official Li.

103
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,980
I heard that you were punished by the Dowager Empress.

104
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,999
Oh, dear.

105
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:20,459
You shouldn't have acted impulsively.

106
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,259
Miss Sun is from a noble family.

107
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:25,739
There's no way you can get the upper hand when you confront her.

108
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,420
Apply the ointment now.

109
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,120
It helps to get the swelling down.

110
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,959
I always use this. It's effective.

111
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:42,820
Thank you for sharing this ointment with me.

112
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,778
I'll just use a little bit and return the rest to you.

113
00:09:45,778 --> 00:09:48,319
No. Keep it.

114
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:49,879
I have a lot more.

115
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:52,980
If so, thank you so much.

116
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,160
Don't mention it.

117
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,579
Which one do you think has hurt him?

118
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:29,599
"Whomever he chooses to marry has nothing to do with me."

119
00:10:30,819 --> 00:10:32,660
Oh, that hurts.

120
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,798
My Lord.

121
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:45,159
Why did you ask for me?

122
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,320
From now on, send someone else to deliver the documents.

123
00:10:57,785 --> 00:10:59,139
   

124
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:00,840
 Are you all busy? 

125
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:06,400
It's an urgent document.

126
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,020
I'll deliver this, Official Li.

127
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,560
We shall give Observer Sun a chance.

128
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:40,958
Official Li.

129
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,239
- Me again? 
 - Yes.

130
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,158
Yes.

131
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,159
Go ahead.

132
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,240
What's going on?

133
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,760
It used to be me, though.

134
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,319
Official Li.

135
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,020
Do you need me to deliver an urgent document?

136
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,339
You've been helping a lot, Observer Sun.

137
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:17,160
Not at all.

138
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,320
My Lord.

139
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,939
It's scorching. Let me hold an umbrella for you.

140
00:12:32,939 --> 00:12:34,640
My Lord.

141
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,938
Are you all right?

142
00:12:46,938 --> 00:12:48,439
Thank you.

143
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:54,260
Greetings, My Lord.

144
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,240
My Lord.

145
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,880
Do not get heatstroke.

146
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,740
Thank you.

147
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,040
   

148
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,458
Young Lady. Young Lady.

149
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:34,299
Young Lady, what happened?

150
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,678
Nothing. I think I got tired from walking.

151
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,479
Young Lady, look at this.

152
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,858
- Spider. 
 - It's an auspicious spider.

153
00:13:52,858 --> 00:13:54,979
Young Lady, the Qiqiao Festival is around the corner.

154
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:56,680
Do you remember that?

155
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:58,878
No.

156
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,718
It's fine. I've saved the date.

157
00:14:01,718 --> 00:14:05,038
Put this in a new chest tomorrow and check it the next morning.

158
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:07,679
The denser the spider web, the higher your chances of standing out.

159
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,939
Oh, right.

160
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:17,499
Look at this.

161
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,420
This is Qiaoguo. 
  (Sweet and crispy pastry) 

162
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:24,499
I can't see why I should celebrate this.

163
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:26,939
I don't want to celebrate the Qiqiao Festival.

164
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,400
What has happened? Why not?

165
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,400
We can have yummy food and lots of fun during the Qiqiao Festival.

166
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:38,040
Juli, let me ask you this.

167
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:43,020
Zhimo has been giving you grapes and pastries.

168
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:48,780
But if he suddenly gives them to another person one day, would you be upset?

169
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,660
I won't if he gives them to Zhijian.

170
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,299
 I used to think that I wouldn't feel hurt when he dated any women. 

171
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,240
 But it seems that it's not the case. 

172
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:06,920
 Do not get heatstroke. 

173
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,560
 Thank you. 

174
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:22,099
Young Lady, are you feeling unwell?

175
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:27,279
I'm fine.

176
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:34,339
Something came up, Official Mu.

177
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:35,940
Next door. Hurry.

178
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,950
All right.

179
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,880
   

180
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,440
My Lord.

181
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,539
- My Lord. 
 - Official Mu.  
 - Imperial Physician Lu.

182
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:48,378
His condition is bad. We need your help.

183
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:52,820
Why did he relapse all of a sudden?

184
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:58,279
The acupuncture therapy can only extend his life.

185
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:02,179
If his sickness were to recurrently relapse, even if he didn't die,

186
00:16:02,179 --> 00:16:05,759
he'd become foolish after waking up.

187
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,219
Acupuncture therapy won't help much without the Snow Dust Pill.

188
00:16:12,219 --> 00:16:14,180
What should we do now?

189
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,379
Let's try again, Official Mu.

190
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:17,680
All right.

191
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,660
Thank you, Official Mu.

192
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:26,479
It's my duty.

193
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:42,179
Your Highness, the lecture is over.

194
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:46,759
Official Mu.

195
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:48,379
Yes, Your Highness.

196
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:52,359
As the adage goes, "Develop a counterattack plan before riots erupt;

197
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,259
Stabilize the nation before crises emerge."

198
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:58,078
But what should we do if someone conceals the truth from both superiors and subordinates?

199
00:16:58,078 --> 00:16:59,439
Second Brother.

200
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,759
Have you heard the news?

201
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,400
Today, Grandmother arranged a marriage between Lord Ding and Yunyun.

202
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,398
Yunyun has loved Uncle for seven years

203
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:11,179
and refuses to get engaged to any men at her marriageable age.

204
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:16,120
Maybe Grandmother grants her wish concerning her deep affection.

205
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,739
Regarding your question about the adage,

206
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:25,759
I'll explain it to you precisely in the next lecture.

207
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,778
Sure.

208
00:17:26,778 --> 00:17:28,479
I shall take my leave.

209
00:17:30,885 --> 00:17:33,319
   

210
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,620
 Your Highness. 

211
00:17:35,439 --> 00:17:38,799
You called me here on short notice. Is it something urgent?

212
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:43,180
Jinghong, take a seat.

213
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,779
Jinghong,

214
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:06,900
you're close to Official Mu, aren't you?

215
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:09,559
Yes.

216
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:13,160
Do you know what her hobby is?

217
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,399
Your Highness, why don't you ask her in person?

218
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,780
Here's the thing.

219
00:18:29,879 --> 00:18:35,779
Previously, I offended her, and I feel terrible about that.

220
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:39,600
I'm waiting for a chance to apologize to her.

221
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:42,959
So, what's her hobby?

222
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:49,179
Well, Official Mu...

223
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,660
Money.

224
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,758
Anything else besides money?

225
00:19:01,758 --> 00:19:04,920
Apart from money, there is none.

226
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,558
Forget it. I'll figure this out myself.

227
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:27,020
 Have you heard the news? 

228
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,859
 Today, Grandmother arranged a marriage between Lord Ding and Yunyun. 

229
00:19:36,199 --> 00:19:37,799
 Do you want one? 

230
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,700
Young Lady, you're back.

231
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,559
Juli, why are you so well dressed today?

232
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,058
Oh, Young Lady.

233
00:19:51,058 --> 00:19:54,079
Did you forget that? Today is the Qiqiao Festival.

234
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,520
I see.

235
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,619
No wonder the streets have been decorated.

236
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:01,979
I received a bag of Qiaoguo during lunch.

237
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:04,159
Young Lady, you should dress up, too.

238
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,979
We're hanging out later.

239
00:20:05,979 --> 00:20:07,560
- Come on. 
 - Juli, I'm not going.

240
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,579
I'm not in the mood for that.

241
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,739
No, please. Young Lady.

242
00:20:12,739 --> 00:20:14,478
It's only held once a year.

243
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,238
You should enjoy yourself.

244
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:18,938
Come on. Go and get ready.

245
00:20:18,938 --> 00:20:20,259
No, Juli.

246
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:22,599
Hurry up, Young Lady.

247
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,239
There are so many sky lanterns.

248
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,819
It's crowded here.

249
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:30,199
Juli, look over there.

250
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:32,060
And there.

251
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:50,539
Look.

252
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,638
This is amazing.

253
00:21:00,638 --> 00:21:02,939
- How did he manage that?  
 -  I have no idea.

254
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,239
Come on, let's go over there.

255
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:36,479
Out of my way.

256
00:21:37,199 --> 00:21:40,259
Uncle, look at this lantern. It's cool, isn't it?

257
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:42,260
I solved the riddles and won it.

258
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:56,719
Juli, go and meet up with Zhimo.

259
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:58,479
I need to go somewhere.

260
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:01,320
Let's meet up later, Young Lady.

261
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,278
It's pretty good.

262
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:12,720
Oh, right. Someone did a magic trick for me and Young Lady.

263
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,819
He made a dove appear.

264
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:16,979
Oh, this is yummy.

265
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:18,620
Try it.

266
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,580
Nice?

267
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,919
Yes.

268
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:24,818
You never like sweet food.

269
00:22:24,818 --> 00:22:28,160
And yet you lie to please the girl.

270
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:30,238
Zhijian.

271
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:32,079
Do you want to join us for the festival?

272
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,958
I don't celebrate the Qiqiao Festival.

273
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:35,799
What festival do you celebrate?

274
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:37,799
I celebrate the Ghost Festival.

275
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:40,499
Ignore him.

276
00:22:40,499 --> 00:22:42,478
Wait for me, Official Shen!

277
00:22:42,478 --> 00:22:44,079
You...

278
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:45,359
Princess Jing'an.

279
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,680
What is it again?

280
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,779
I was told that people in the Central Plains celebrate the Qiqiao Festival today.

281
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,440
Many couples celebrate this.

282
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,999
Oh, I remember something. I have some tasks to attend to now.

283
00:22:57,999 --> 00:22:59,079
How about this?

284
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,638
There will be many beautiful lanterns since it's a festival today.

285
00:23:01,639 --> 00:23:02,778
You should go and take a look around.

286
00:23:02,778 --> 00:23:05,359
- I shall take my leave. 
 - Let's... Let's go together...

287
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,659
Wait for me!

288
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:10,820
   

289
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:19,600
Since I've made up my mind,

290
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:22,700
I shouldn't regret it.

291
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,119
This lantern...

292
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,039
will be the proof...

293
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,239
of my past liking for Lord Ding.

294
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,960
"Heaven never ages; love never dies."

295
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:47,159
Since love does exist,

296
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,800
why did you give in?

297
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:56,419
My Lord.

298
00:23:57,379 --> 00:23:59,360
You heard everything.

299
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,079
I won't deny it, then.

300
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,980
Yes.

301
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,580
My Lord.

302
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,260
I do have feelings for you.

303
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:18,279
But...

304
00:24:18,879 --> 00:24:22,000
But after Miss Sun came,

305
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,720
I realized...

306
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,020
that my liking...

307
00:24:28,579 --> 00:24:30,720
won't do you any good.

308
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:37,139
Instead, Miss Sun comes from a noble origin.

309
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:43,660
The two of you are meant for each other.

310
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:48,239
By the way, I forgot to congratulate you.

311
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:54,440
You're expecting a wedding with Miss Sun.

312
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,120
Take your blessing back.

313
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,360
I don't need it.

314
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,599
As you've seen,

315
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:09,460
the Dowager Empress has been trying to set me up with Sun Yunyun.

316
00:25:10,339 --> 00:25:12,279
But I don't want to.

317
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:18,059
No one can force me to do something I don't want.

318
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:25,100
Likewise, no one can stop me from something I want.

319
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:29,939
Are you saying...

320
00:25:31,779 --> 00:25:33,899
that you don't want to marry her?

321
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,739
Of course, I don't.

322
00:25:36,739 --> 00:25:40,440
 Your Majesty, I know you attach great importance to my marriage. 

323
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,360
 However, I hope to decide on my own marriage. 

324
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:52,819
 Miss Sun is a good choice, but she's in a prestigious yet complicated position. 

325
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:57,859
 I know I'm a lord, and I have no freedom to decide on my marriage. 

326
00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:01,579
 In that case, I'd rather not have it. 

327
00:26:01,579 --> 00:26:07,700
 Do you mean you're not marrying anyone in this life? 

328
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,779
 Please grant my wish, Your Majesty. 

329
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:15,380
 Miss Sun, 

330
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:21,859
 I think you've visited the market you want. 

331
00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:26,539
 As for the rest, I have already made myself clear. 

332
00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:30,080
 I have no patience for women. 

333
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,179
 You should know what I mean. 

334
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:36,119
 Don't bring yourself disgrace before the public. 

335
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,720
 My Lord. 

336
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:45,800
 I spare no effort to walk towards you and be seen by you. 

337
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,700
I've liked you for seven years.

338
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,799
 But love can't be measured by time. 

339
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:16,559
My Lord.

340
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,640
Thank you for doing all this for me.

341
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:28,139
However, I'm selfish.

342
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,179
When I escaped to the capital,

343
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:36,480
all I wanted was to make money and become an official.

344
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,720
I planned to use my salary to support Juli and myself until we grow old.

345
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:50,600
I've made up my mind that I didn't want...

346
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,259
to be confined to the identity of a wife

347
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:58,899
or trapped by love.

348
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,860
My Lord,

349
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:07,700
I have my concerns.

350
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:10,519
You know that well.

351
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:13,659
Therefore...

352
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,100
I'm so sorry.

353
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,020
I can't respond to you.

354
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:34,999
I'd thought of these...

355
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,279
when I was in Jiangnan.

356
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,140
At that time, I made a decision.

357
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:52,060
But I was clueless about what your plan was.

358
00:28:52,819 --> 00:28:54,219
So,

359
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:57,779
I daren't make any move.

360
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,060
Before I met you,

361
00:29:09,579 --> 00:29:14,059
my life was like a withered branch dipped in the mire.

362
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,840
I merely lived by the will

363
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,880
to find the truth.

364
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:27,919
I wish I could witness a peaceful and prosperous nation before I die.

365
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,599
I'd never expected that I would meet someone

366
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:36,180
I'd want to spend my life with.

367
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:42,100
I'd once promised that I wouldn't fall in love with someone

368
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,200
or marry a woman and have children with her...

369
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:49,159
before the Emperor and the Dowager Empress.

370
00:29:54,139 --> 00:29:55,739
But it seems...

371
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,840
I've broken the first promise.

372
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,580
My Lord.

373
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,480
How am I deserving of that?

374
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,579
If my love for you...

375
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:20,700
will force you to give up on things you like,

376
00:30:22,099 --> 00:30:24,539
then the love isn't genuine.

377
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:30,459
Zhuohua, if you have feelings for me too,

378
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,839
please allow me to accompany you.

379
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:38,099
You don't marry anyone.

380
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:40,060
And I won't marry anyone either.

381
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,960
Let's do this for the rest of our lives.

382
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,620
All right?

383
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:57,659
We'll do this for the rest of our lives?

384
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:05,119
Yes. Allow me to accompany you when you're pursuing your passion.

385
00:31:08,959 --> 00:31:10,999
Not all companionship...

386
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:14,920
must be in the name of marriage.

387
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:18,020
What do you think, Zhuohua?

388
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,720
My Lord.

389
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:23,359
Are you...

390
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:26,920
Are you sure?

391
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,800
Certainly.

392
00:31:28,801 --> 00:31:36,210
♫  I can't forget the love that is still is nipping at my ears and temples  ♫

393
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:43,562
♫  Memories keep slamming into rocks and have nowhere to berth  ♫

394
00:31:43,562 --> 00:31:50,901
♫  I can't forget the turmoil of love and hate, 
 even if the next day is far away  ♫

395
00:31:50,901 --> 00:31:59,560
♫  Two souls embrace in chaos, how can it be written off?  ♫

396
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,145
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

397
00:32:03,145 --> 00:32:06,868
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

398
00:32:06,869 --> 00:32:10,733
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

399
00:32:10,733 --> 00:32:14,145
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

400
00:32:14,145 --> 00:32:17,837
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

401
00:32:17,837 --> 00:32:21,529
♫  Obviously willing to swear life and death 
 to be entangled for a lifetime  ♫

402
00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:25,798
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

403
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:33,499
♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

404
00:32:38,065 --> 00:32:41,704
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

405
00:32:41,704 --> 00:32:45,300
♫  Obviously willing to swear life and death 
 to be entangled for a lifetime  ♫

406
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:49,392
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

407
00:32:49,392 --> 00:32:56,019
♫  Want to have one more glimpse of you, 
 even just for a second more  ♫

408
00:32:56,019 --> 00:32:57,620
 Bravo! 

409
00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:05,279
Official Mu.

410
00:33:09,139 --> 00:33:10,739
Busted, thief!

411
00:33:13,639 --> 00:33:16,280
I'm so sorry.

412
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,019
You're a girl, but you have great strength.

413
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,060
Where's Official Mu?

414
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,220
Young Lady?

415
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,900
She's not with me.

416
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,039
I don't know where she is.

417
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,639
It's for you.

418
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:49,979
What happened?

419
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,799
I accidentally hurt First Prince's arm just now.

420
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:55,980
Will he hold me accountable?

421
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,858
Don't worry. His Lordship will help you.

422
00:33:57,858 --> 00:33:59,359
I'll tell him about this.

423
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:00,920
Really?

424
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,960
It's sweet.

425
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,100
Isn't this the broken jade pendant?

426
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,039
This is your gift for the Tongxin Festival.

427
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:26,699
Half for you, and the other half for me.

428
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:30,680
Frankly, I prepared this long ago.

429
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:34,260
I didn't get a suitable chance to give it to you.

430
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:40,659
All I ask for is a soulmate despite not marrying each other.

431
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,300
I'll take that as a yes.

432
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,570
   

433
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,059
Young Lady, your congee.

434
00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:15,339
Come on.

435
00:35:15,339 --> 00:35:16,959
Here.

436
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:26,358
Young Lady, isn't this the jade pendant Lord Ding gave you?

437
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:37,579
Young Lady.

438
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:40,219
Is anything bothering you?

439
00:35:40,219 --> 00:35:43,119
No, nothing is bothering me.

440
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,380
Money issues?

441
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,300
You want to trade this jade pendant for money and pay for the rental?

442
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:56,638
I know the rental in the capital is getting higher.

443
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:00,239
Years of rent is enough to buy a house.

444
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:03,740
Young Lady, we should consider buying our own house.

445
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:05,618
Juli,

446
00:36:05,618 --> 00:36:07,219
look at this.

447
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,399
These are the house and land deeds of this place.

448
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:17,619
Wait... But we rent this house, don't we?

449
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:21,618
Lord Ding gave me these deeds last night.

450
00:36:21,618 --> 00:36:24,379
He said it was a gift for me.

451
00:36:24,379 --> 00:36:25,999
Last night?

452
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,518
Didn't you say that you wouldn't care about Lord Ding anymore?

453
00:36:28,518 --> 00:36:30,219
Did you make up?

454
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:34,200
Well, it's more than that.

455
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,678
Whoa! Lord Ding is so generous.

456
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,819
Young Lady,

457
00:36:41,819 --> 00:36:44,798
do you think Lord Ding will hide you here like Old Master did?

458
00:36:44,799 --> 00:36:46,580
That's impossible.

459
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,958
Why not?

460
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:49,459
His Lordship treats you very well.

461
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:52,280
I can see that even if I'm dense.

462
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,599
Young Lady, you said that you wouldn't marry anyone before.

463
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,339
But I didn't expect you would accept to be his secret lover.

464
00:36:58,339 --> 00:37:01,379
Silly, I'm not his secret lover.

465
00:37:01,379 --> 00:37:04,359
He's my secret lover instead.

466
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:07,459
Are you saying the mighty Lord Ding is your secret lover?

467
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,239
He said he agreed not to marry me,

468
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:14,419
and he would not marry one in this life for my sake.

469
00:37:14,419 --> 00:37:19,560
He wants to stay by my side without marriage.

470
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,399
Obviously, he's my secret lover.

471
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:25,478
I have to stop here. There's a grand assembly today.

472
00:37:25,478 --> 00:37:27,479
I need to leave now.

473
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,700
- Put the deeds away. 
 - All right.

474
00:37:29,759 --> 00:37:30,759
I'm off.

475
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,860
Why do you sulk, sweetheart?

476
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,060
Here.

477
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:59,538
Have some honey water.

478
00:37:59,538 --> 00:38:03,259
You can come to my room to check out the new jewelry.

479
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:10,379
He doesn't care about me or look at me.

480
00:38:10,379 --> 00:38:14,239
What's the point of wearing delicate jewelry?

481
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,679
My daughter is the most brilliant gem in the entire capital.

482
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:21,819
How could he not care about you?

483
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,619
In his eyes, Mu Zhuohua is the gem.

484
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:31,959
It makes sense.

485
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,759
She became a Tanhua at such a young age

486
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:37,620
and stands out amongst all the ladies.

487
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:40,719
I can only be inferior to her.

488
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,680
Lord Ding is blind!

489
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,560
How could a mere merchant's daughter compare to my daughter?

490
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:53,912
A merchant's daughter?

491
00:38:53,912 --> 00:38:56,793
Do you mean Official Mu?

492
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,179
Your father wanted me to keep this secret.

493
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:07,359
But it's no harm in telling you this.

494
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:11,879
A few days ago, he received a letter from Huaizhou, Jiangnan.

495
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,859
It mentions Mu Zhuohua.

496
00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:18,999
Her real name is Mu Qi, and she was born in Huaizhou.

497
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,981
She's the daughter of the wealthiest merchant in Jiangnan.

498
00:39:21,981 --> 00:39:25,260
Isn't she from Yanzhou?

499
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,320
She must've used some dirty ways to change her birthplace.

500
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,719
How could she do that?

501
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:38,138
Are you sure, Mother?

502
00:39:38,138 --> 00:39:40,119
Could that be a mistake?

503
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,339
I wouldn't lie to you.

504
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:51,639
I saw that when I was talking to your father in the study.

505
00:39:54,539 --> 00:39:55,839
Here.

506
00:39:58,199 --> 00:39:59,899
Finish the water.

507
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,600
Greetings, Your Majesty.

508
00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:22,879
Last night, you promised me you would take Miss Sun to the city tower

509
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,058
to see the view of the capital.

510
00:40:25,058 --> 00:40:31,100
Why did you walk away and leave her alone there?

511
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:41,420
Your Majesty, the three princes were with her last night.

512
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:46,239
I don't think I needed to stay there the whole time.

513
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:49,340
I'm afraid you left for someone else.

514
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,919
You wouldn't care to spend time on me.

515
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:58,319
But I heard this person is uncouth and now has become an official.

516
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,940
Now, this person is involved with Lord Ding.

517
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:06,619
An uncouth official is harmful.

518
00:41:06,619 --> 00:41:09,499
This is a serious problem.

519
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:14,120
Does His Majesty know about this?

520
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:17,538
If His Majesty were to know that she's a problematic person,

521
00:41:17,538 --> 00:41:20,539
I'm afraid she'd be removed.

522
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:25,080
Lord Ding, what are your thoughts on this?

523
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:37,010


524
00:41:39,434 --> 00:41:46,993
♫  I can't forget the love that is still is nipping at my ears and temples  ♫

525
00:41:46,993 --> 00:41:54,193
♫  Memories keep slamming into rocks and have nowhere to berth  ♫

526
00:41:54,193 --> 00:42:01,633
♫  Both sides gaze at each other in the drizzling rain, but one has turned into clouds and mist  ♫

527
00:42:01,633 --> 00:42:10,153
♫  Leaving the isolated heart's island, like waves without a shore  ♫

528
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:13,893
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

529
00:42:13,893 --> 00:42:17,553
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

530
00:42:17,553 --> 00:42:21,473
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

531
00:42:21,473 --> 00:42:24,953
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

532
00:42:24,954 --> 00:42:28,473
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

533
00:42:28,474 --> 00:42:32,193
♫  Obviously willing to swear life and death 
 to be entangled for a lifetime  ♫

534
00:42:32,194 --> 00:42:36,493
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

535
00:42:36,493 --> 00:42:42,394
♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

536
00:42:55,994 --> 00:43:03,393
♫  I can't forget the turmoil of love and hate, 
 even if the next day is far away  ♫

537
00:43:03,393 --> 00:43:11,953
♫  Two souls embrace in chaos, how can it be written off?  ♫

538
00:43:11,953 --> 00:43:15,633
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

539
00:43:15,633 --> 00:43:19,273
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

540
00:43:19,273 --> 00:43:23,153
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

541
00:43:23,154 --> 00:43:26,693
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

542
00:43:26,693 --> 00:43:30,293
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

543
00:43:30,293 --> 00:43:33,973
♫  Obviously can't be erased, and haunted by lingering dreams  ♫

544
00:43:33,973 --> 00:43:37,953
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

545
00:43:37,953 --> 00:43:45,334
♫  Want to have one more glimpse of you, 
 even just for a second more  ♫
