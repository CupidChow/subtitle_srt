20
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,809
Why did I end up here?

21
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:10,269
My Lord.

22
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:12,929
What-What brings you here?

23
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,950
Are you digging up flowers?

24
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,489
No, I am repotting them.

25
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:23,870
Why?

26
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,869
Look at this, My Lord.

27
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:30,268
The flower pot Her Highness gifted me is too valuable.

28
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:33,090
I have to put it away properly.

29
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,148
Do you know?

30
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:37,349
This pot could fetch hundreds of taels.

31
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:38,868
But it is a very meaningful gift.

32
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:43,148
I dare not sell it, let alone casually leave it in the yard.

33
00:03:43,149 --> 00:03:44,988
What if someone steals it?

34
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:47,309
So, I had an idea.

35
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,828
I will move the peony into my earthenware pot

36
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:55,569
and store the pot Her Highness gave me in a safe place.

37
00:03:58,869 --> 00:04:03,069
My Lord, is there a reason

38
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:06,690
you came here so late at night?

39
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:10,150
I have questions for you.

40
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,069
You played tricks at the Floral Poetry Gathering today.

41
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:16,929
Shouldn't you give me an explanation?

42
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,289
My Lord.

43
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,990
I was just about to thank you.

44
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,009
Elaborate.

45
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:29,129
Take it easy, My Lord.

46
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:34,810
Be careful, My Lord.

47
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:46,889
I admit that I deliberately misled them into thinking

48
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:49,070
that you wrote the poem.

49
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,189
But I didn't think you'd be so cooperative.

50
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:55,869
You even spilled the cup of tea on purpose to get their attention,

51
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,709
and that's how I ended up getting the top prize.

52
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,749
Are you saying I shouldn't have been so cooperative?

53
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:09,549
My Lord, you always say you won't help me.

54
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,549
However, your words are harsh, but your heart is soft.

55
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,790
You are kind and handsome.

56
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,129
I am most grateful to you.

57
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:20,489
I chose the right master.

58
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:25,289
I did not help you for free.

59
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:27,949
I spilled that cup of tea and soiled my clothes.

60
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,990
The clothes I wore cost over a hundred taels.

61
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,570
- A hundred… 
 - Why don't you

62
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:39,210
give me this pot as compensation?

63
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:45,149
Your Lordship, why don't I give you this flower instead?

64
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,269
A peony of this species will sell for at least hundreds of taels per blossom.

65
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:53,588
Such a prestigious flower is most suitable

66
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:57,770
for a noble figure such as Your Lordship.

67
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,550
Please accept the flower, Your Lordship.

68
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:10,029
Furthermore, I owe more than half of the credit to Your Lordship for today's win.

69
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:13,810
After all, you helped me.

70
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,809
So splitting the reward would be most fortunate.

71
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:22,509
The palace examination takes place two days later.

72
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,949
Yet, you still have the time and mood to tend to flowers.

73
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,630
Her Highness's pot.

74
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,388
Your Lordship's jade pendant.

75
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:33,570
Both of them will be mine.

76
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:38,529
I am confident I can do well in the palace examination.

77
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,100
   

78
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:57,329
My Lord.

79
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:02,829
Did you buy this flower?

80
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,010
It was a gift.

81
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:07,629
What?

82
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,609
Someone actually gifted you flowers?

83
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,930
My Lord.

84
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,508
Dowager Empress investigated the Mu family but found nothing suspicious.

85
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:32,028
Thankfully, Your Lordship was wise and had foresight.

86
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:34,309
You sent the Falcon Squad to Jiangnan ahead of time

87
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,630
and erased all traces of Mu Zhuohua's change of birthplace.

88
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,869
Juli. Juli.

89
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,949
The exam basket.

90
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,930
Let's check the exam basket again.

91
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:04,508
Young Lady, you are not allowed to bring anything into the exam hall of the palace exam.

92
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:06,388
Right.

93
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:08,869
I can't bring anything into the exam hall of the palace exam.

94
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,849
What about my clothes? The clothes I'm supposed to wear tomorrow.

95
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:12,288
Check them again.

96
00:08:12,288 --> 00:08:13,989
I've checked them…

97
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:19,289
Five times.

98
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:21,549
- Young Lady. 
 - You've checked them.

99
00:08:21,549 --> 00:08:23,529
Are you nervous?

100
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,588
What?

101
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,189
Are you nervous?

102
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:30,990
Yes. I… I am a little nervous.

103
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:34,909
Young Lady, come.

104
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,830
Follow me.

105
00:08:45,989 --> 00:08:47,970
Third Madam,

106
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,670
Young Lady has done what you said.

107
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,429
Every day, she studies diligently until late every day.

108
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,429
She works very hard.

109
00:08:56,429 --> 00:08:59,748
Third Madam, please watch over and bless Young Lady

110
00:08:59,749 --> 00:09:01,628
for her success in tomorrow's palace examination.

111
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:03,490
May she achieve top honors.

112
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,828
Mother,

113
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:10,439
    
 I have ingrained your teachings in my heart.

114
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:14,029
For over a decade, I have studied diligently.

115
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:15,750
I am most fortunate.

116
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,289
Females are finally allowed to attend the imperial exam.

117
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:22,669
Tomorrow, I will be taking the palace examination.

118
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:27,390
I am sure you must be proud of me.

119
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:31,950
Rest assured, Mother.

120
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,870
I am sure I will pass the exam.

121
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:38,129
Please await good news.

122
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:52,309
 The palace examination begins now. 

123
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:55,710
    
 The candidates will now enter the palace.

124
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:08,780
   

125
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:23,270
   

126
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:27,880
   

127
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:45,290
This year's examination topic is "Govern by Inaction."

128
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:49,270
"Govern by Inaction."

129
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:53,168
 This topic assesses both the candidate's talent and ability 

130
00:10:53,168 --> 00:10:56,509
 to comprehend His Majesty's intentions. 

131
00:10:56,509 --> 00:10:58,248
 It has been 24 years since His Majesty succeeded the throne. 

132
00:10:58,248 --> 00:11:00,909
 His Majesty has adopted many benevolent policies, allowing the state to rest and flourish. 

133
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:04,729
 From this perspective, many will focus on "inaction". 

134
00:11:04,729 --> 00:11:06,390
 Inaction. 

135
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:10,250
 Inaction itself is a form of action. 

136
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,310
 Half a piece of paper left. 

137
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,628
 Half an hour. 

138
00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:44,409
 What can I write? 

139
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,969
She is unlucky.

140
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:54,029
It looks like she will come in last.

141
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,870
She probably saw Father, panicked,

142
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,809
and spilled the ink.

143
00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:02,269
Father is merciful.

144
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,530
I'm sure he won't hold her responsible.

145
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,429
 That's not true. 

146
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,588
 The inkstone fell over by itself. 

147
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:12,610
 I didn't touch it. 

148
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,029
 Who did this? 

149
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,890
 Who did I offend this time? 

150
00:12:30,869 --> 00:12:34,009
 What should I do? 

151
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,790
   

152
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,728
   
 Is she still studying? 

153
00:12:46,728 --> 00:12:49,610
 Mu Qi always has her nose in those books. 

154
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,890
 Wait for me! 

155
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,269
 What's the matter? 

156
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,230
 Still upset about what happened during the day? 

157
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,429
 Don't mind what they say. 

158
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,228
 But, Mother, they were insulting me. 

159
00:13:10,229 --> 00:13:11,990
 What do they know? 

160
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,868
 Remember this, my child. 

161
00:13:14,869 --> 00:13:19,629
 Women, too, must study and seek their own pursuits. 

162
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:22,670
 Even if she is locked within her chambers, 

163
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:27,129
 she cannot let herself become a canary at the mercy of others. 

164
00:13:28,469 --> 00:13:31,109
 You must remember my words. 

165
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:35,010
 Don't entrust your fate to others. 

166
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,870
 Do you remember, my child? 

167
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:39,609
 Read. 

168
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:44,728
 My sisters always fought over clothes, fabric, cosmetics, and jewelry. 

169
00:13:44,728 --> 00:13:46,530
 I didn't want any of those. 

170
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:50,069
 All I wanted were endless books, peace, and quiet. 

171
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:54,248
 If possible, a lamp that never goes out 

172
00:13:54,248 --> 00:13:57,530
 so I could read in the dark. 

173
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,309
 I still have half a piece of paper left. 

174
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:18,249
 Things were tougher, but I never thought about giving up. 

175
00:14:18,249 --> 00:14:21,749
 Not to mention I've come this far. 

176
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:26,829
Why is she still writing?

177
00:14:28,349 --> 00:14:30,709
She might as well just give up.

178
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:32,669
She only has half a piece of paper left.

179
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,630
There's not much she can write.

180
00:14:36,469 --> 00:14:38,529
A futile struggle.

181
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:04,190
She was the only one who behaved improperly in the entire exam hall.

182
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,749
With such demeanor, it must've been a stroke of luck that she got 17th place

183
00:15:07,749 --> 00:15:10,230
in the metropolitan examination.

184
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,669
You're right.

185
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:16,569
If she drops out of 17th place, that means we'll move up in the rankings.

186
00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:18,789
It's a good thing for us.

187
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,390
Right.

188
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,830
Did you continue to answer afterward?

189
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,750
Don't worry.

190
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,029
You had an accident, but if you put your heart into your answers,

191
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,729
I'm sure His Majesty will not blame you.

192
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,090
I think I did well.

193
00:15:40,229 --> 00:15:43,830
You're still this positive in the face of such an accident.

194
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,510
As expected of you.

195
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:01,509
We proceed to the second round of the palace examination.

196
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:03,348
All the candidates will wait outside the hall

197
00:16:03,349 --> 00:16:06,630
while His Majesty summons and questions the candidates.

198
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,890
Shen Jinghong has been summoned.

199
00:16:37,469 --> 00:16:42,009
Mu Zhuohua has been summoned.

200
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:05,570
I, Mu Zhuohua, greet Your Majesty.

201
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,270
At ease.

202
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:14,548
Not bad. You are young, yet your composure is extraordinary.

203
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:17,349
I thought you would have burst into tears on the spot.

204
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:21,308
Never give up until you're at the end of your rope.

205
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:25,468
Even when you're at your wit's end, face life and death with a smile.

206
00:17:25,469 --> 00:17:26,869
Oh?

207
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,988
Is this what you meant with your answer?

208
00:17:28,989 --> 00:17:31,890
"Do one's best and leave the rest to Heaven's will"?

209
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,750
Your Majesty is wise.

210
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,310
In a few words,

211
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:41,548
you've described both the ways of humanity and the truths of Heaven.

212
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:43,149
Good.

213
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,708
You are young, yet you have achieved a deep understanding of life.

214
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:51,109
This is impressive.

215
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,189
Thank you, Your Majesty.

216
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,149
But you tainted your exam paper during the palace examination today.

217
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,429
That is a serious offense.

218
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,468
You managed to submit these few lines in the end,

219
00:17:58,469 --> 00:18:00,629
but it is difficult to convince everyone.

220
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,709
So I will give you another chance.

221
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:08,208
Use the notion of "Govern by Inaction" to expound on a strategy for border defense.

222
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,349
Yes, Your Majesty.

223
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:17,409
Do nothing to accomplish everything.

224
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:20,829
Rule with peace, and the land prospers.

225
00:18:20,829 --> 00:18:23,589
Alleviating concerns at the borders by adapting to the circumstances.

226
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:27,929
Following the desires of the people ensures success in all endeavors,

227
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:31,028
benefiting the populace and spreading blessings to all.

228
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:32,909
In this way, the people remain loyal.

229
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,568
By promoting education widely and aligning the hearts of the people,

230
00:18:35,568 --> 00:18:37,669
the nation attains clarity in all matters.

231
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,829
When officials act righteously, the people remain loyal,

232
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,729
and the country will be united.

233
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:48,075
That is what I think.

234
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,070
Good.

235
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:58,648
So, are you implying that we can unite the country without waging war?

236
00:19:00,229 --> 00:19:02,269
Wars are still inevitable.

237
00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:04,949
Education builds a strong and prosperous nation.

238
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,669
A strong nation is one that wins wars.

239
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,450
The purpose of educating them is to prevent war.

240
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,630
War is to make them listen to reason.

241
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,629
Oh, you.

242
00:19:16,629 --> 00:19:19,009
You've said everything.

243
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:23,349
 She passed this test beautifully. 

244
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:29,249
Your Majesty, will you summon the next candidate?

245
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,750
That won't be necessary.

246
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,369
I have decided.

247
00:19:35,469 --> 00:19:36,969
Brother Yan.

248
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,228
Your Majesty.

249
00:19:43,229 --> 00:19:44,990
What do you think?

250
00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:46,949
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

251
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,610
Southern Chen is blessed with many outstanding talents.

252
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,629
 I finally made it over that hurdle. 

253
00:19:58,629 --> 00:20:00,589
 But that was hard. 

254
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,190
 Really hard. 

255
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,340
   

256
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:31,750
The palace examination of the 24th year of Zhaoming.

257
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,710
First place in the first rank.

258
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,508
Shen Jinghong.

259
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:39,649
Conferred the title of Jinshi. 
  (Jinshi: Successful candidate in the highest imperial civil service examination; palace graduate) 

260
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:57,869
Second place in the first rank.

261
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,470
Sun Yunqian.

262
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:02,669
Conferred the title of Jinshi. 
  (Jinshi: Successful candidate in the highest imperial civil service examination; palace graduate) 

263
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,830
Third place in the first rank.

264
00:21:20,229 --> 00:21:22,169
Mu Zhuohua.

265
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:26,709
Conferred the title of Jinshi. 
  (Jinshi: Successful candidate in the highest imperial civil service examination; palace graduate) 

266
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,928
Me?

267
00:21:31,928 --> 00:21:33,729
Mu Zhuohua.

268
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,990
Aren't you going to thank His Majesty?

269
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:48,268
 Third place… I got Tanhua. 
 (Candidate who came third in the Hanlin examination) 

270
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:52,189
His Majesty has declared a banquet to be held at Xuanzheng Palace.

271
00:21:52,189 --> 00:21:55,630
Congratulations to all the successful candidates in the imperial examination.

272
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:06,569
 Long live His Majesty, for ten thousand years and beyond. 

273
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:10,110
   

274
00:22:12,469 --> 00:22:15,669
All of you are the future pillars of Southern Chen.

275
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:21,409
In the days to come, you must always put the state and the people first.

276
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:26,390
 We will heed Your Majesty's teachings. 

277
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:33,908
Everyone, I drink to all of you.

278
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,650
Father.

279
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:40,729
The imperial physician has advised you against drinking.

280
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,829
Let me drink on your behalf.

281
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,230
Very well.

282
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:08,988
 Thank you, Your Majesty. 

283
00:23:08,989 --> 00:23:12,268
 May Your Majesty be blessed with eternal happiness and longevity. 

284
00:23:12,268 --> 00:23:16,350
 May Southern Chen be forever prosperous and peaceful. 

285
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,930
Official Shen.

286
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,208
Your Majesty.

287
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:42,530
You are not yet married, correct?

288
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:47,068
My daughter, Princess Roujia, is beautiful, compassionate, and virtuous.

289
00:23:47,069 --> 00:23:49,028
She is always helping the less fortunate.

290
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:55,069
It is solely to honor her deceased betrothed, Xue Xiaotang, that she has remained unmarried until now.

291
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:56,929
Master Scholar, look.

292
00:23:56,929 --> 00:23:59,009
Is she worthy of you?

293
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,190
Father,

294
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,748
putting aside the fact that he is a few years younger than me,

295
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:22,830
he has already declared that he will not marry until he becomes a first-rank official.

296
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:28,529
With such ambition, how could he willingly become a powerless consort to a princess?

297
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,230
Shen Jinghong,

298
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:35,149
refusing to marry until you become a first-rank official,

299
00:24:35,149 --> 00:24:39,710
does that apply to a princess as well?

300
00:24:52,469 --> 00:24:54,369
Your Majesty.

301
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:57,349
Marriage is simply an embellishment of achievements.

302
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:00,229
With Your Majesty's gracious favor, I became a Master Scholar in the imperial examination.

303
00:25:00,229 --> 00:25:03,309
I shall wholeheartedly devote myself to serving Your Majesty

304
00:25:03,309 --> 00:25:07,049
and the people of Southern Chen to the best of my abilities.

305
00:25:11,069 --> 00:25:12,669
So be it.

306
00:25:12,669 --> 00:25:16,210
I suppose this was not a favorable match.

307
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:22,028
Roujia, if you meet a man you favor, let me know.

308
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:25,709
I will see to it that your wedding is grand and splendid.

309
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,350
Brother Shen,

310
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:08,169
do you have feelings for Princess Roujia?

311
00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:11,990
Her Highness is benevolent and kind.

312
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:15,190
It is only natural for us to admire her.

313
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:20,629
But admiration and marriage are two separate matters.

314
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,950
Do you not admire Her Highness?

315
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,070
Admire?

316
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:32,049
You're right, Brother Shen. I admire Her Highness, too.

317
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:54,749
Brother Shen, I have a question and want to discuss it with you.

318
00:26:54,749 --> 00:26:56,370
Ask away.

319
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:02,789
If someone doesn't seek trouble, but trouble comes to them,

320
00:27:03,749 --> 00:27:05,610
how should they deal with it?

321
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,629
Confront it and resolve it.

322
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,130
Understood.

323
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:29,169
 There can be no wind in the hall. 

324
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:31,871
 The inkstone couldn't possibly have knocked itself over. 

325
00:27:38,069 --> 00:27:40,950
 Only someone close to me could have done it. 

326
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:22,769
Tanhua Mu.

327
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:26,409
Lord Ding.

328
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,149
The banquet has just ended.

329
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,150
Are you leaving the palace already?

330
00:28:41,069 --> 00:28:42,508
Yes.

331
00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:43,748
It's late at night.

332
00:28:43,749 --> 00:28:46,570
I'm afraid I'll get lost if I return too late.

333
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:50,309
I am returning to my residence as well.

334
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,790
Come with me.

335
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,170
Oh?

336
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,990
All right.

337
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:05,110
I haven't had a chance to congratulate you yet.

338
00:29:07,469 --> 00:29:10,069
I should congratulate Your Lordship, too.

339
00:29:10,069 --> 00:29:11,929
Why?

340
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:17,990
To gain a capable assistant such as myself.

341
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:22,829
When did you become my assistant?

342
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:29,570
However, what happened today could have put you in danger.

343
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,349
But you were able to turn it into an opportunity.

344
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:35,230
Your courage is commendable.

345
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:43,649
I'm sure First Prince would've been over the moon if I hadn't been ranked.

346
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:47,569
Chen'er is not that kind of person.

347
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:55,330
Then… what about Second Prince and Third Prince?

348
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,249
They don't know you well.

349
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:02,589
Naturally, it matters not to them whether you are ranked or not.

350
00:30:08,356 --> 00:30:09,856
In that case…

351
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:19,168
Your Lordship was the one who knocked over my inkstone during the palace examination.

352
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,030
Yes.

353
00:30:32,509 --> 00:30:34,830
Your Lordship won't look at me.

354
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:37,310
Is that because you are feeling guilty?

355
00:30:39,889 --> 00:30:43,929
If I had been any less composed or resolute during the palace examination today,

356
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:46,389
never mind attending the banquet inside the imperial palace,

357
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:49,569
I would've committed a serious crime of impropriety

358
00:30:49,569 --> 00:30:51,770
and be banned from taking the examination for life.

359
00:30:53,469 --> 00:30:55,949
One must be able to navigate the treacherous waters of the court.

360
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,949
It is especially difficult for women to hold official positions.

361
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:03,230
I deliberately knocked over your inkstone to test your character.

362
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:06,090
If you can't overcome even this small obstacle…

363
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:08,220
Small obstacle?

364
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:11,349
This matter is as light as a feather to Your Lordship,

365
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:14,509
but it is as heavy as a mountain to me.

366
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:18,349
As a woman, I know how difficult it is for a woman to take the imperial examination.

367
00:31:18,349 --> 00:31:22,968
I endured and faced all the challenges and difficulties on this path only to seek freedom.

368
00:31:22,968 --> 00:31:26,089
Beyond the realm of books lies the vast blue sky, where the sky is high, and birds are free to fly.

369
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:28,950
This is the path that I seek.

370
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:34,469
You forcibly put me through an additional test simply because I am a woman.

371
00:31:34,469 --> 00:31:40,708
Is this the fairness you spoke of when you proposed to allow females to attend the imperial exam?

372
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:33,049
I…

373
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,270
Your Lordship,

374
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:39,490
I just feel aggrieved.

375
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,830
You don't have to do this.

376
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,369
I was wrong.

377
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,550
Your Lordship,

378
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:19,030
are you saying that my future will be like this lantern,

379
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,430
bright and clear?

380
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:24,330
On the contrary.

381
00:33:25,569 --> 00:33:29,790
The path ahead of you will not be easy.

382
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:37,350
What I seek has already put me in a great deal of danger.

383
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:40,210
When I first saw you, I thought you were suspicious.

384
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,550
That was why I tested you again and again.

385
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:47,290
I didn't expect to involve you in past matters.

386
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:58,100
I have had my men remove all traces of you changing your birthplace for the imperial exam.

387
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,689
You need not worry about it anymore.

388
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:07,130
From now on, you can stay away from me, the whirlpool of controversy.

389
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,710
As long as you speak and act with caution and uphold your integrity,

390
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:16,190
your career as an official should be stable and secure.

391
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:24,590
If you still wish to work for me,

392
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:27,670
I will certainly do my utmost to make sure you're safe.

393
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:33,029
However, you should also be aware...

394
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:37,649
that this path will not be a ladder to success...

395
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:41,410
but rather a steep and challenging precipice.

396
00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:58,010
I give you this jade pendant as a gift for your achievements in the imperial examination.

397
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:00,489
Think of it as an amulet.

398
00:35:01,069 --> 00:35:03,549
May it keep you safe.

399
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:21,649
Did this jade pendant go to war with Your Lordship?

400
00:35:21,649 --> 00:35:23,069
Yes.

401
00:35:24,629 --> 00:35:26,770
This is too valuable.

402
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:29,750
No matter what path you take,

403
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,070
with a heart like yours,

404
00:35:32,729 --> 00:35:38,510
you'll be able to swim against the currents and see the mountains from the peak.

405
00:35:42,509 --> 00:35:45,049
I will remember your teachings, Your Lordship.

406
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,430
We will both serve in court as officials henceforth.

407
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:52,750
You need not speak so humbly anymore.

408
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,870
Thank you.

409
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:04,735
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

410
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:10,784
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

411
00:36:10,784 --> 00:36:15,810
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

412
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:21,059
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

413
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:26,185
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

414
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:34,590
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

415
00:36:47,469 --> 00:36:49,769
Juli! I'm back, Juli.

416
00:36:49,769 --> 00:36:51,309
Young Lady!

417
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:53,529
You're finally back, Young Lady.

418
00:36:53,529 --> 00:36:55,889
Did His Majesty appoint you as an official?

419
00:36:57,629 --> 00:37:01,649
Juli, there's something I want to tell you.

420
00:37:01,649 --> 00:37:06,549
I scolded Lord Ding today.

421
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,450
You scolded Lord Ding?

422
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:12,630
Then… How did you come back in one piece?

423
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:16,249
You… Did you come to see me one last time?

424
00:37:16,249 --> 00:37:18,709
Oh, no… Don't worry, Young Lady!

425
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,610
If something happens to you, I'll never live alone!

426
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,949
Zhijian and Zhimo are outside.

427
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,850
I'll get them, and I'll fight them until the end!

428
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,349
Calm down. I was messing with you.

429
00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:30,830
Do you really think I would be able to make it back if Lord Ding was upset at me?

430
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,249
Put away the lantern.

431
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:51,869
Young Lady, you're telling me His Lordship admitted he was wrong for knocking over your inkstone,

432
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,468
and he apologized to you?

433
00:37:53,469 --> 00:37:54,549
Yes.

434
00:37:54,549 --> 00:37:57,910
I was stunned when he apologized.

435
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:03,270
A person of his noble status actually bowed and apologized to me.

436
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,550
That is hard to imagine.

437
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:09,668
Not only did he apologize, but he also gave you this jade pendant to congratulate you.

438
00:38:09,668 --> 00:38:12,709
Then again, Young Lady, I don't think this jade pendant is worth much.

439
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:14,390
His Lordship is too stingy.

440
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:19,168
Juli, this is proof of His Lordship's courtesy and kindness towards the lower-ranked.

441
00:38:19,168 --> 00:38:21,449
This is priceless.

442
00:38:27,129 --> 00:38:32,149
He helped me settle the matter of changing my birthplace before I even asked.

443
00:38:32,149 --> 00:38:33,950
He is so nice.

444
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:37,350
He is not like the other rich and powerful at all.

445
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:42,628
That's true, but His Lordship has a lot of enemies.

446
00:38:42,629 --> 00:38:45,029
It's dangerous to stay by his side.

447
00:38:45,029 --> 00:38:49,109
Young Lady, are you sure you want to keep relying on His Lordship?

448
00:38:52,149 --> 00:38:54,749
Back then, I didn't have a choice.

449
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,850
Now, he has given me a choice.

450
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:01,269
I can choose to stay away from him or join him.

451
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:05,970
But… I don't know what I should choose now.

452
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,429
Is it really that difficult to make a choice?

453
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,628
You joined him to stay safe.

454
00:39:09,629 --> 00:39:12,310
Of course, your safety is your priority.

455
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,628
You're right.

456
00:39:13,629 --> 00:39:15,589
It's more important to stay alive.

457
00:39:16,509 --> 00:39:19,348
That reminds me. How's the search for a residence on the north side of the city?

458
00:39:19,348 --> 00:39:23,489
I found a place. Madam Lu said we could rent the residence next to Zhuque Street.

459
00:39:23,489 --> 00:39:27,170
Lots of elder imperial physicians live around that area.

460
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:30,609
But the residence is too big. The rent is a little high.

461
00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:31,988
How much?

462
00:39:31,989 --> 00:39:34,189
Fifteen guan a month.

463
00:39:34,189 --> 00:39:37,050
It's daylight robbery.

464
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:40,109
That is quite expensive…

465
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,850
But we have to rent it.

466
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:47,749
The residence in my mother's memories must be around the north of the city.

467
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:51,189
Juli, money is not a concern.

468
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:53,689
I want to find my mother's origin.

469
00:39:53,689 --> 00:39:57,130
I can't let her stay like a rootless water weed.

470
00:39:57,669 --> 00:39:59,269
Yes.

471
00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:00,649
Money is not a problem.

472
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:02,489
I'll figure something out.

473
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:17,030
 Mu Zhuohua, a Yanzhou native, 

474
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:19,989
 achieved third place in the first rank in the 24th year of Zhaoming. 

475
00:40:19,989 --> 00:40:23,069
This is to certify that she has been appointed

476
00:40:23,069 --> 00:40:26,930
to the position of Seven-Rank Editor in the Hanlin Academy.

477
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,810
I thank His Majesty.

478
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:33,049
Congratulations, Editor Mu.

479
00:40:33,049 --> 00:40:35,830
Here is a full set of your official garments.

480
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:40,450
Please report for duty at the Hanlin Academy in your uniform in two days to begin work.

481
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:45,950
Thank you. Please accept this.

482
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,650
Well…

483
00:40:49,069 --> 00:40:52,550
I have other matters to attend to. I shall take my leave.

484
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:00,089
Juli.

00:41:26,834 --> 00:41:34,034
♫  Memories keep slamming into rocks and have nowhere to berth  ♫

488
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:41,474
♫  Both sides gaze at each other in the drizzling rain, but one has turned into clouds and mist  ♫

489
00:41:41,474 --> 00:41:49,994
♫  Leaving the isolated heart's island, like waves without a shore  ♫

490
00:41:49,994 --> 00:41:53,734
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

491
00:41:53,734 --> 00:41:57,394
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

492
00:41:57,394 --> 00:42:01,314
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

493
00:42:01,314 --> 00:42:04,793
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

494
00:42:04,794 --> 00:42:08,414
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

495
00:42:08,414 --> 00:42:12,134
♫  Obviously willing to swear life and death 
 to be entangled for a lifetime  ♫

496
00:42:12,134 --> 00:42:16,334
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

497
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:22,734
♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

498
00:42:35,934 --> 00:42:43,134
♫  I can't forget the turmoil of love and hate, 
 even if the next day is far away  ♫

499
00:42:43,134 --> 00:42:51,794
♫  Two souls embrace in chaos, how can it be written off?  ♫

500
00:42:51,794 --> 00:42:55,474
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

501
00:42:55,474 --> 00:42:59,214
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

502
00:42:59,214 --> 00:43:03,194
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

503
00:43:03,194 --> 00:43:06,534
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

504
00:43:06,534 --> 00:43:10,134
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

505
00:43:10,134 --> 00:43:13,913
♫  Obviously can't be erased, and haunted by lingering dreams  ♫

506
00:43:13,914 --> 00:43:17,894
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

507
00:43:17,894 --> 00:43:25,174
♫  Want to have one more glimpse of you, 
 even just for a second more  ♫
