00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:35,080
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,779 --> 00:00:53,159
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,159
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:03,479
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,579
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,679
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:18,639
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

♫  The road ahead is long,

♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:36,918
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,019
   

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,959
   

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,939
   

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
   

19
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,360
The new emperor just ascended the throne.

20
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,179
There are many affairs to attend to.

21
00:02:19,179 --> 00:02:21,039
What are you doing here?

22
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,200
What about you?

23
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,259
What are you doing here?

24
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:28,519
Haven't I made myself clear in the letter?

25
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,200
I am sick and tired of a romantic relationship.

26
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,679
I don't want to waste any more time.

27
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:39,220
You are in your prime.

28
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,739
You have a bright future.

29
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:46,920
You can still rise to the top without my help.

30
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:50,379
We have come this far.

31
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:55,599
Why are you suddenly saying these mean words to me?

32
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,540
I am tired.

33
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:12,869
♫  It's you who stripped me of my armor  ♫

34
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:20,169
♫  Melting into your gaze like snowflakes  ♫

35
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:24,859
♫  Walking through the flying sand raised by the years  ♫

36
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:28,119
Young Lady, why didn't you wait for me?

37
00:03:28,119 --> 00:03:31,140
♫  Allowing each other's wounds to scab over  ♫

38
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,380
What happened between you and Lord Ding?

39
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,200
Why did he leave you out here all alone?

40
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,769
♫  Love is the concern that's burning in the heart  ♫

41
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:45,699
♫  Like ice and snow looking forward to midsummer  ♫

42
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:47,339
 Lord Ding! 

43
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:50,159
 Lord Ding, you are in there, aren't you? 

44
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,920
 Could you open the door? 

45
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,740
Do you know how long Young Lady was out looking for you?

46
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,759
How could you have the heart to leave her alone out here?

47
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:04,040
Lord Ding, could you please open the door?

48
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,500
Don't make Young Lady wait outside.

49
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,820
- Juli. 
 - Zhimo. Zhijian.

50
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:13,558
How could you two do this?

51
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:16,040
Not only did you not persuade Lord Ding to stay,

52
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,260
you didn't even tell Young Lady and made her so upset.

53
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,619
Come on.

54
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:28,639
Young Lady.

55
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:31,420
I will wait with you.

56
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:38,039
♫  Helping you to accomplish your goals doesn't require an answer  ♫

57
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:44,009
♫  My shoulder will be your eave  ♫

58
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:51,349
♫  Conquering the impermanence of fate  ♫

59
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:57,829
♫  Only for you, a picturesque smile  ♫

60
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:05,592
♫   It's burning within my heart and nourishing it for a lifetime  ♫

61
00:05:05,592 --> 00:05:17,476
♫  The flowers of two trees that grow together as one 
 and embrace each other will never decay  ♫

62
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:21,080
Young Lady, it is about to rain.

63
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,160
Let's go. Young Lady.

64
00:05:53,224 --> 00:05:59,238
♫  I can't forget the love that is still is nipping at my ears and temples  ♫

65
00:05:59,238 --> 00:06:02,419
Zhimo, take Juli away.

66
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:05,039
I'm not leaving! I'm staying with you!

67
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,199
Young Lady, I'll wait with you.

68
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:15,481
♫  Both sides gaze at each other in the drizzling rain, but one has turned into clouds and mist  ♫

69
00:06:15,481 --> 00:06:24,029
♫  Leaving the isolated heart's island, like waves without a shore  ♫

70
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:27,779
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

71
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:30,400
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

72
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,652
My Lord.

73
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:35,445
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

74
00:06:35,445 --> 00:06:38,799
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

75
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:43,820
My Lord, at this rate, Official Mu will fall sick.

76
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,379
Let her in to take shelter.

77
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:48,501
She can leave.

78
00:06:50,464 --> 00:06:57,079
♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

79
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,120
You may leave.

80
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,299
I want to take a nap.

81
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:17,359
Yes, My Lord.

82
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:24,652
♫  Memories keep slamming into rocks and have nowhere to berth  ♫

83
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:31,980
♫  I can't forget the turmoil of love and hate, 
 even if the next day is far away  ♫

84
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:40,539
♫  Two souls embrace in chaos, how can it be written off?  ♫

85
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:44,253
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

86
00:07:44,253 --> 00:07:48,019
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

87
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:51,932
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

88
00:07:51,932 --> 00:07:55,352
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

89
00:07:55,352 --> 00:07:58,984
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

90
00:07:58,984 --> 00:08:02,669
♫  Obviously willing to swear life and death 
 to be entangled for a lifetime  ♫

91
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:06,955
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

92
00:08:06,955 --> 00:08:15,317
♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

93
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:17,919
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

94
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,333
My Lord.

95
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:22,863
♫  Obviously love is locked and entangled in our hearts  ♫

96
00:08:22,863 --> 00:08:26,886
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

97
00:08:26,886 --> 00:08:30,143
♫  Repeating the same mistakes endlessly  ♫

98
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:33,834
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

99
00:08:33,834 --> 00:08:37,517
♫  Obviously can't be erased, and haunted by lingering dreams  ♫

100
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:41,564
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

101
00:08:41,565 --> 00:08:49,565
♫  Want to have one more glimpse of you, 
 even just for a second more  ♫

102
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,779
Official Mu is all right now.

103
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:47,919
I will go prepare the medicine.

104
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:19,440
Why must you torture yourself?

105
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:25,425
When I'm gone,

106
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:28,940
you'll only feel even more pain.

107
00:10:38,148 --> 00:10:42,839
   

108
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:44,739
Forgive me, Mother.

109
00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:48,419
It's been a long time since I came to see you.

110
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,739
I don't know why Liu Yan left the capital,

111
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,359
but this is a rare opportunity for me.

112
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,600
I finally have the time to come and visit you.

113
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,360
   

114
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,360
Don't worry.

115
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,899
I will not miss this opportunity.

116
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:21,159
Neither will I let anyone get in my way.

117
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,750
   

118
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,960
Man'er.

119
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:51,259
I had a meeting with Her Highness around 5:00, but she didn't show up.

120
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:53,640
I got a little worried, so I came to check.

121
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,920
Her Highness did spend more time at the grave today.

122
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,299
Perhaps something came up,

123
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:01,600
or it could be...

124
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:11,019
Your Highness.

125
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,980
Your Highness.

126
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,870
Put me down. I can go by myself.

127
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:30,539
If you insist on walking, it will worsen your injury.

128
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,919
This medicine aids blood circulation.

129
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,820
Your ankle is pretty swollen.

130
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,279
You'd better apply this now.

131
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,840
Why do you carry medicine with you?

132
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,079
My father was a hunter.

133
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,179
I got influenced and it became a habit.

134
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,519
I had almost forgotten about that.

135
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:14,339
I hope you don't mind.

136
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:27,360
It might hurt a little.

137
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,260
Bear with it.

138
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,360
Come to think of it, Liu Yan left the capital.

139
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,260
Zhuohua took a leave of absence.

140
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,890
Official Shen, you mustn't miss this chance.

141
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,240
Understood.

142
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,921
It is perfect for the reform of the Protected Appointments System.

143
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,230
You can first present Liu Chen

144
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:26,360
the flaws of the Protected Appointments System to draw his attention.

145
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:32,330
On top of that, we need him at the front to resist pressure from noble families.

146
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:36,670
Then we can intensify the conflict between them.

147
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,160
I almost forgot.

148
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,210
Liu Chen thinks so highly of you.

149
00:14:56,659 --> 00:14:59,240
If you dedicate yourself to him,

150
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:05,500
perhaps the people will see you as a subject to a wise emperor.

151
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,459
Your Highness,

152
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,540
I will only be your subject.

153
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:18,540
The people only like me when I am looking talented and glorious.

154
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,080
But only one person reached out to me

155
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,480
when I was mired down.

156
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:34,759
The power of the noble families...

157
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,350
has taken up half the imperial court.

158
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,840
They are now the cancer of Southern Chen.

159
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:49,920
Abolishing the Protected Appointments System is the only way to bring peace to Southern Chen again.

160
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:56,979
I will give you a list of names who are our people.

161
00:15:56,979 --> 00:16:03,179
Find a way to assign them to suitable positions one by one.

162
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:08,439
Only by doing so can we be strong enough

163
00:16:08,439 --> 00:16:11,179
to fight the noble families in the imperial court.

164
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,520
Understood.

165
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,260
No destruction, no establishment.

166
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,160
The noble families are a cancer.

167
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,360
It's time to get rid of them.

168
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:29,090
Come.

169
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,930
It's fine.

170
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:36,119
It's getting late.

171
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:38,479
Don't you want to go back?

172
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,359
I do.

173
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,560
It was you.

174
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,879
You have been taking care of me.

175
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,099
It wasn't me.

176
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,280
It was Juli.

177
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,319
You're lying.

178
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,040
What are you holding, then?

179
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,299
Isn't it for me?

180
00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:38,679
Juli cooked this porridge for you.

181
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:41,239
Quickly have it while it's still warm.

182
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,480
After that, return to the capital.

183
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,460
Are you chasing me out?

184
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,640
Do you expect me to let you neglect your duties without permission by staying here?

185
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,680
Do you really hate

186
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,990
seeing me that much?

187
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,879
Isn't it obvious?

188
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:22,380
If you really hate seeing me,

189
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,000
why did you bring me inside?

190
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,539
Even if it was just a stray animal,

191
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:37,659
I wouldn't be able to bear seeing them in the rain.

192
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,120
So to you,

193
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:52,199
I am no different from stray animals.

194
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:10,160
Were you nice to me just because you were teasing me

195
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,879
like a pet that made you happy?

196
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,320
It's no use saying more.

197
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:21,819
Go back to the capital.

198
00:20:21,819 --> 00:20:28,255
♫  It's you who stripped me of my armor  ♫

199
00:20:29,805 --> 00:20:35,755
♫  Melting into your gaze like snowflakes  ♫

200
00:20:35,755 --> 00:20:42,975
♫  Walking through the flying sand raised by the years  ♫

201
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:49,315
♫  Allowing each other's wounds to scab over  ♫

202
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:54,299
 My Lord. Official Mu has left. 

203
00:20:56,355 --> 00:21:03,255
♫  Like ice and snow looking forward to midsummer  ♫

204
00:21:03,255 --> 00:21:10,755
♫   It's burning within my heart and nourishing it for a lifetime  ♫

205
00:21:10,755 --> 00:21:19,021
♫  Love is silent, no matter how far away it is, 
 it is measured by fate  ♫

206
00:21:19,021 --> 00:21:26,345
♫  This untainted heart imprints your image  ♫

207
00:21:26,345 --> 00:21:32,684
♫  Like a shadow, it accompanies me around the world  ♫

208
00:21:32,684 --> 00:21:39,803
♫  This untainted love, makes two complete double rainbows  ♫

209
00:21:39,804 --> 00:21:46,017
♫  Longing is a home to love  ♫

210
00:21:46,017 --> 00:21:52,868
♫  Love is the concern that's burning in the heart  ♫

211
00:21:52,868 --> 00:21:59,817
♫  Like dead wood longing for floating flowers in the air  ♫

212
00:21:59,817 --> 00:22:07,333
♫   It's burning within my heart and nourishing it for a lifetime  ♫

213
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:19,337
♫  The flowers of two trees that grow together as one 
 and embrace each other will never decay  ♫

214
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,560
So it turns out Your Lordship gets anxious, too.

215
00:22:46,387 --> 00:22:53,737
♫  I can't forget the love that is still is nipping at my ears and temples  ♫

216
00:22:53,737 --> 00:23:01,107
♫  Memories keep slamming into rocks and have nowhere to berth  ♫

217
00:23:01,107 --> 00:23:08,546
♫  Both sides gaze at each other in the drizzling rain, but one has turned into clouds and mist  ♫

218
00:23:08,546 --> 00:23:15,487
♫  Leaving the isolated heart's island, like waves without a shore  ♫

219
00:23:15,487 --> 00:23:19,900
Since you left, why did you come back?

220
00:23:20,737 --> 00:23:24,507
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

221
00:23:24,507 --> 00:23:28,407
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

222
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,299
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

223
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,199
 Wait. 

224
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,359
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

225
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,760
 Something isn't right. 

226
00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:41,360
 The scent of medicine on him was so strong that the aloeswood was no use. 

227
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,476
 His illness... 

228
00:23:43,476 --> 00:23:47,338
♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

229
00:23:47,338 --> 00:23:51,820
You always shoulder everything and walk on your own.

230
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:58,000
But I think that we can walk together now.

231
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:01,619
You are well aware...

232
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,160
that I don't have much time left.

233
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,260
Still, you shouldn't be making choices for me.

234
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,006
Zhuohua,

235
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:17,760
don't spend your time and energy on a dying man like me.

236
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,646
♫  I can't forget the turmoil of love and hate, 
 even if the next day is far away  ♫

237
00:24:23,646 --> 00:24:24,999
It's not worth it.

238
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:28,419
I decide if that is worth it or not.

239
00:24:28,419 --> 00:24:33,293
Even if you are second only to the emperor, I cannot comply with your orders.

240
00:24:33,297 --> 00:24:37,317
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

241
00:24:37,317 --> 00:24:41,077
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

242
00:24:41,077 --> 00:24:44,897
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

243
00:24:44,897 --> 00:24:48,117
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

244
00:24:48,117 --> 00:24:50,090
In the past,

245
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,918
you often looked out for me.

246
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:55,759
♫  Obviously willing to swear life and death 
 to be entangled for a lifetime  ♫

247
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,147
From now on...

248
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,859
I want to protect you, too.

249
00:25:21,413 --> 00:25:25,085
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

250
00:25:25,085 --> 00:25:28,725
♫  Obviously love is locked and entangled in our hearts  ♫

251
00:25:28,725 --> 00:25:32,645
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

252
00:25:32,646 --> 00:25:36,105
♫  Repeating the same mistakes endlessly  ♫

253
00:25:36,105 --> 00:25:39,795
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

254
00:25:39,795 --> 00:25:43,475
♫  Obviously can't be erased, and haunted by lingering dreams  ♫

255
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:47,425
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

256
00:25:47,425 --> 00:25:55,526
♫  Want to have one more glimpse of you, 
 even just for a second more  ♫

257
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,520
Let me check your pulse.

258
00:27:00,439 --> 00:27:02,139
Don't bother.

259
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,739
Imperial Physician Zhao has been checking my pulse.

260
00:27:06,739 --> 00:27:08,578
Imperial Physician Zhao is already so old.

261
00:27:08,578 --> 00:27:11,618
Yet he has to leave his hometown and travel far with you.

262
00:27:11,618 --> 00:27:14,139
Can't you let him rest?

263
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,820
Your pulse is very disorderly.

264
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:28,679
I am beyond a cure.

265
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:34,419
No matter how much medicine I take, I am merely lingering on my last breath.

266
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:39,199
If medicine won't work, we can try acupuncture.

267
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,060
Don't waste your effort.

268
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,120
It will only leave you more disappointed.

269
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,720
What's the point?

270
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,339
I insist on trying.

271
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:29,799
Less water.

272
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:31,440
All right.

273
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,540
My Lord, this is a medicine I developed from studying medical books.

274
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,340
Try it.

275
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,699
Even if it's not effective, it won't cause any side effects.

276
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,720
Take it while it's warm.

277
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,700
Drink it.

278
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,100
Thank you.

279
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,560
Young Lady, try it on my arm instead.

280
00:29:46,379 --> 00:29:50,038
I'm a bit hungry. Why don't you make me something to eat?

281
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,520
I won't prick my arm. Don't worry.

282
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,580
Leave it here.

283
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,360
I'll get it.

284
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:44,980
Essentials of acupuncture.

285
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:04,020
My Lord. My Lord.

286
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,438
Zhimo! Zhijian!

287
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:15,618
 Zhimo! Zhijian! Get Imperial Physician Zhao! 

288
00:31:15,618 --> 00:31:17,419
Hurry, bring me there.

289
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:19,839
Careful.

290
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,019
- What's wrong with His Lordship? 
 - Quickly take a look.

291
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:25,679
My Lord. My Lord.

292
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,020
His illness has worsened too severely.

293
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,780
Does that mean...

294
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:39,378
I checked his pulse just now.

295
00:31:39,378 --> 00:31:41,300
We mustn't wait any longer.

296
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:46,219
In that case, have you mastered the Midnight-Noon Ebb-Flow Acupuncture?

297
00:31:46,219 --> 00:31:50,639
Right now, I am only a beginner at it.

298
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:53,200
But for the slim chance of a cure,

299
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,300
I don't have a choice.

300
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:26,299
- My Lord! 
 - My Lord.

301
00:32:26,299 --> 00:32:28,239
My Lord.

302
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:30,339
- My Lord. 
 - My Lord.

303
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,218
Why? How can it be?

304
00:32:36,218 --> 00:32:38,626
I made no mistakes.

305
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,639
There is no guaranteed cure in medicine.

306
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:48,264
Official Mu, you have done everything you could.

307
00:32:48,264 --> 00:32:50,239
But I...

308
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,740
Did you know?

309
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:43,240
To me, your presence...

310
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,360
is like the moon in the sky.

311
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,880
I can only look at it from afar.

312
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,060
I never thought...

313
00:33:56,579 --> 00:33:58,979
that one day,

314
00:33:58,979 --> 00:34:03,479
the bright moon would shine on me...

315
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,940
and my heart.

316
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,560
But, Liu Yan, if...

317
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:23,559
you die just like that,

318
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:29,819
perhaps in my old age someday in the future,

319
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:32,219
I will remember you.

320
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:36,020
But at that time,

321
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:44,219
you will just become an illusion...

322
00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:47,259
like a reflection of the moon.

323
00:34:47,259 --> 00:34:52,920
No matter how happy we were, you will just be a passer-by in my life.

324
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,920
Can you really accept that?

325
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:15,540
Isn't it funny?

326
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,440
Actually, the one who can't accept it...

327
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,720
is me.

328
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:32,520
So, please.

329
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,820
You must be all right.

330
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:38,259
Don't leave me behind.

331
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,900
My Lord.

332
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,360
You're awake.

333
00:36:45,999 --> 00:36:47,899
I'm sorry.

334
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:54,280
I thought you wouldn't feel so sad if I did that.

335
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,020
But...

336
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,959
when I was standing at the gates of Hell,

337
00:37:03,959 --> 00:37:08,300
I realized that all of this

338
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,700
only made things worse.

339
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:15,219
It only made you suffer even more.

340
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:21,559
And I couldn't accept it either.

341
00:37:43,259 --> 00:37:45,900
While I was half-awake,

342
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:50,080
I kept thinking.

343
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,280
Even if I die,

344
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:59,780
I mustn't die with this reluctance and regret.

345
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:03,199
Can you stop saying that word in front of me?

346
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,720
All right.

347
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,440
But...

348
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,580
Don't go. All right?

349
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,999
You even chased me out.

350
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:28,739
You were really annoying.

351
00:38:29,419 --> 00:38:31,659
Yes, I'm the most annoying guy.

352
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:38,819
I am the most annoying guy in the world.

353
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,980
Imperial Physician Zhao.

354
00:38:51,219 --> 00:38:54,419
It's cured. It's cured.

355
00:38:54,419 --> 00:38:58,438
The poisons of the Revival Powder and the Yuanluo Flower

356
00:38:58,438 --> 00:39:01,539
have all been eliminated.

357
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,139
Understood.

358
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,458
I'm going to see His Lordship.

359
00:39:05,458 --> 00:39:08,219
Sure. Go ahead now.

360
00:39:08,219 --> 00:39:09,820
This is great.

361
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,999
My Lord, you have been cured.

362
00:39:17,999 --> 00:39:19,819
You are all right now.

363
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:37,100
