1
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:25,160


2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,359
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,080
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:47,779
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,779 --> 00:00:53,159
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,259
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,479
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,579
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,679
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:18,739
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

12
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:24,000
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,239
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:36,918
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,019
   

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,059
   

17
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:44,939
   

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,429
   

19
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,010
So, you've been avoiding me...

20
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,730
because you have fallen for me?

21
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,730
I...

22
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,750
Not...

23
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,730
Not yet.

24
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,950
But... But you're an outstanding man.

25
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,750
I do worry...

26
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,310
worry that one day... I might...

27
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,290
I might fall for you.

28
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,930
Why are you blushing?

29
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,589
Please get some good rest.

30
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,790
I need to leave now.

31
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,550
Little liar.

32
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,190
You're back.

33
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,310
Did you find the ledger?

34
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,090
We couldn't find Zhuang Wenfeng's ledger.

35
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,869
   

36
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,789
I see. Please stay here to take care of His Lordship, then.

37
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,090
I'll go and get you some food.

38
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,389
Hold on.

39
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,069
The First Prince has a message for you.

40
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,469
What is it?

41
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,749
He said only part of the food relief was found.

42
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,170
But he'll take care of the rest and never let the people starve

43
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,970
or corrupt officials get away with it.

44
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,610
His Highness has grown up a lot.

45
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,350
Well, wait for me here.

46
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:54,630
That's all for pleasantries and vitriol here.

47
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,610
Let's call it a day.

48
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,510
You're all dismissed now.

49
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,370
Well...

50
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,310
Everyone seems to be in good health today.

51
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,550
Neither are you having a headache or fever,

52
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,990
nor are you saying you want to get rest early.

53
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:25,569
By the way, there's someone in our residence who is not in good health.

54
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,370
I heard that Miss Seventh even asked Old Master for the Qinghe sprig for his sake.

55
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,970
A man?

56
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,770
Miss Seventh brought him back?

57
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,709
Besides, she has brought back more than one man.

58
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,830
There are two.

59
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,850
Isn't it three?

60
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,660
I saw them with my own eyes.

61
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,590
No, there are four of them.

62
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,850
She's blessed with such a generous heart just like her father.

63
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,770
Why?

64
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,330
Only men are allowed to take in concubines one after one,

65
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,390
but women have to stick to a man till the end?

66
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,830
Now that Qi has made something for herself,

67
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:10,450
she has earned her own right to choose a husband.

68
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,910
We're envious of her.

69
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,470
Everyone here is envious of her, am I right?

70
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,150
Get lost!

71
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,490
Yes.

72
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,269
Hurry up, ladies.

73
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,669
 Coming. 

74
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,250
Be quick.

75
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,269
Who are you?

76
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,850
Who are you?

77
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,779
We're the lady folks of the Mu family.

78
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,800
We were told that we have an unwell guest here. So, we came here to visit him.

79
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:57,359
- Are you the concubines? 
  - Yes, we are. 

80
00:05:57,359 --> 00:06:00,459
Are you the eighteen concubines of Mu Rong?

81
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:03,760
There are nineteen of us now.

82
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,739
Miss Seventh has quite bad taste, though.

83
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:06,899
Look at them.

84
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,139
Average looks and slim builds.

85
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:10,699
Young age is the only thing they have.

86
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:12,140
That's good enough.

87
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,059
They're pretty decent to me.

88
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,499
Their physique isn't sturdy enough, but they have a delicate look.

89
00:06:18,499 --> 00:06:20,119
They are handsome.

90
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:21,579
What nonsense are you saying?

91
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:22,939
Please allow us in, young men.

92
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,099
- We want to visit the unwell guest. 
 - You're not going inside.

93
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:26,699
Why are you so fierce?

94
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:28,839
That's right. We have to see the other two.

95
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,859
 The other two? 

96
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,159
 - The one inside here must be the legitimate one. 
 - That's right. 

97
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,499
 I got a sneak peek of him just now. The one inside is mature and composed. 

98
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:35,879
 He's a better choice for Miss Seventh. 

99
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,059
Really?

100
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:38,499
How blessed of her.

101
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:40,100
Get lost!

102
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,819
Don't shout at us. You scared me.

103
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,459
That's right. You're so fierce.

104
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:46,560
No one has shouted at me before.

105
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,480
Let's leave.

106
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,580
Those concubines are so idle and spend their time talking nonsense.

107
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,040
I think what they said makes sense.

108
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,319
Are you serious?

109
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,420
It's all just gibberish.

110
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,619
Here, My Lord.

111
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,159
The medicine is getting cold. Take it now.

112
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:09,900
Let me help you.

113
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,979
- Do you mean... 
 - Slowly.

114
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:16,960
By gibberish, you mean good fortune...

115
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,180
or...

116
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,879
My Lord.

117
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,160
Are you all right, My Lord?

118
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,640
Did you hurt yourself, My Lord?

119
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,800
I didn't mean it.

120
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,540
Do you feel pain, My Lord?

121
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,180
My Lord.

122
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,220
My Lord.

123
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,900
I'm fine.

124
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,900
My Lord!

125
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,559
You scared me. How could you lie to me?

126
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:01,220
I wasn't lying.

127
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,859
You were toying with Zhuang Wenfeng,

128
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:08,279
making him believe that he has taken control of the situation but he was actually the prey.

129
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,739
It's all thanks to you, My Lord.

130
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:13,380
I saw Zhijian the other day.

131
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,660
Zhijian seems tobe losing his touch.

132
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,879
You could actually find his trail.

133
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:24,879
That day, after I left Tutor Shang's place,

134
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,680
I noticed someone was tailing me.

135
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,500
I wanted to lure this person out, which turned out to be Zhijian.

136
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:37,340
And that was why I decided to use the honey trap.

137
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,800
Honey trap?

138
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,120
Yes.

139
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,900
What's wrong?

140
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,880
Do you doubt me?

141
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,900
Do I look ugly to you?

142
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,020
You said this yourself.

143
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,360
I just don't want you...

144
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,140
to put your life at risk.

145
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,200
All right.

146
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,360
♫  Standing on heights looking clearly into the horizon with a shared aspiration  ♫

147
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,040
♫  It is much farther than just two consensual hearts  ♫

148
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:40,660
♫  Look at this world again after thousands of sails have passed  ♫

00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,500
♫  Toiling away long hours together with the candle's light  ♫

150
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,060
♫  Not caring about the high mountains, deep waters, and long roads  ♫

151
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:54,740
♫  Fortunately, you are here, not afraid of the repeated trips 
 and hanging around with me  ♫

152
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:01,240
♫  You are like the flowers and moon, stretching while not breaking my time, and drifting away  ♫

153
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,579
My Lord, I didn't know you could make a kite.

154
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,069
The drawing on it is excellent.

155
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,160
The lady on the kite is just...

156
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,099
as pretty as me.

157
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:29,790
♫  The flowers and the moon are boundless, having to drift desperately in exchange for a long-cherished wish  ♫

158
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,220
Well,

159
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,879
don't flatter yourself.

160
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,260
I'm flying away.

161
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:48,090
♫  The road is long, can the years be fulfilled?  ♫

162

♫  The flowering period is not too late, to guard my little wish  ♫

163
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,940

♫  ...and still water throughout the year  ♫

00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:07,100
My Lord, you must hold on to me tightly.

166
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,200
What if one day I achieve great success?

167
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,860
 You can then take in more husbands. 

168
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,379
Qi.

169
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,360
I've been looking around for you for a long time.

170
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,620
So, here you are.

171
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,559
Why did you retrieve my kite?

172
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:29,460
That's right.

173
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,379
I got the kite back for you.

174
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,259
- Come on, you can continue. 
 - I released this kite to ward off rotten luck.

175
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:37,000
How could you retrieve it?

176
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,040
Ward off rotten luck?

177
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,219
Qi, listen to me.

178
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,760
You can't pamper men too much.

179
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,200
Of course, apart from me.

180
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,220
I don't want to be mean.

181
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,539
But since Qi has chosen you, you should do your best to assist her.

182
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:09,199
How could you get her sidetracked and influence her to play with kites?

183
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,220
My Qi has a position and status.

184
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,179
Therefore, you should be domestic and obedient.

185
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,479
You mustn't throw your weight around in the name of Qi.

186
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:25,380
Do you hear me?

187
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,780
Furthermore, as a man, don't be petty.

188
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,260
You have to take care of the household for Qi.

189
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,600
Always avoid jealousy, getting emotional, or being sensitive.

190
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,460
Well, back then, that Gu... I can't remember her name.

191
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,159
That woman was always so gloomy. What a spoilsport.

192
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:52,060
Enough said.

193
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,060
Please watch your words.

194
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,260
I... I...

195
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,840
How dare a kept man like you talk to me like that?

196
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,340
Just you wait.

197
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,080
Are you thinking of your mother?

198
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,600
I feel so upset for her.

199
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,220
Old Master Mu is indeed cruel and heartless.

200
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,980
All of his concubines

201
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:01,820
suffer from jealousy because of him.

202
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,100
But in his eyes,

203
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,740
he sees their feelings as ominous.

204
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,380
Let bygones be bygones.

205
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,320
Your mother suffered because of love,

206
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,280
but deep inside, she loved you the most.

207
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,939
Now that you've matured into an exceptional individual,

208
00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:30,180
she must be glad and can rest in peace.

209
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,740
My Lord, since you're out and about,

210
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,840
let's leave tomorrow.

211
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:51,180
But before we do, I have something important to do.

212
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,980
What did you just say?

213
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,539
Qi, please change your request.

214
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,600
I'll make it happen for you.

215
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,160
Your mother belongs to the Mu family.

216
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,940
You can't simply move her ashes elsewhere.

217
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,999
But you've never pegged her as part of the Mu family.

218
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:20,959
Didn't you claim that my mother didn't deserve to be buried in the ancestral tomb

219
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,819
due to her humble status?

220
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,980
You were so furious that you wanted to burn her remains.

221
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,040
Thanks to the benevolent First Madam,

222
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,300
I managed to move my mother's ashes into the residence shrine.

223
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,019
So what?

224
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:38,300
I provided her with the best life.

225
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,659
She had already enjoyed a life of comfort while she was alive,

226
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,079
so there's no need to have a grand funeral after death.

227
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,139
What's the use of having a grand funeral?

228
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:49,540
What my mother asked for is nothing but your true heart.

229
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,899
If you didn't love her, you shouldn't have made the promise to her

230
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:54,900
and deceived her into marrying you.

231
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,619
Deceived her?

232
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,539
That sounds offensive.

233
00:15:58,539 --> 00:16:00,340
I didn't deceive her.

234
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,199
She was merely a courtesan.

235
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:04,460
If not for me,

236
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,680
she would still be stuck in the mire.

237
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,059
That's enough.

238
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,199
Whatever you say, she belongs to the Mu family, alive or dead.

239
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,300
She can never leave here.

240
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:18,060
You're afraid of being humiliated once this gets out. Am I right, Old Master Mu?

241
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,980
You...

242
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,600
My Lord.

243
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,599
It hurts!

244
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,900
- My Lord. 
 - Let go!

245
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,940
Why are you here?

246
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,280
I was worried about you, so I came here.

247
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,200
I suppose I showed up just in time.

248
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,059
Are you all right, My Lord?

249
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:48,500
Here, let me check on you.

250
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,780
I've told you not to initiate your inner strength.

251
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,740
Don't worry.

252
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,480
I'm fine.

253
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,520
"My Lord"?

254
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,760
Who are you to call yourself a lord in front of me, gigolo?

255
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,560
Lord?

256
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,800
Qi, which lord is he?

257
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,520
How many lords do we have in Southern Chen?

258
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,620
Greetings, My Lord.

259
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,500
I was clueless about your presence, My Lord.

260
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,960
 Qi, 

261
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,999
First Madam told us that you're leaving soon. So, we come to bid you farewell.

262
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:03,359
Old Master, who are you kneeling for?

263
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:05,780
It's not a festival or something else.

264
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,119
Lord Ding.

265
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,820
We have Lord Ding here.

266
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,980
Lord Ding?

267
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:16,950
   

268
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,479
Qi has amounted to something.

269
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:44,820
She even brought home a lord.

270
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,579
You've just learned a lesson.

271
00:18:48,579 --> 00:18:50,400
Can't you watch your mouth?

272
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,939
I was terrified just now. Stop mocking me.

273
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,800
My dear Qi, I'm proud of her.

274
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,139
 I want some. 

275
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,199
 Here you go. 

276
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,500
I'll do this.

277
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,060
Your Highness, you've toiled these days.

278
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,919
Please return to the carriage and take a break. Leave this to me.

279
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:26,659
The people are suffering.

280
00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:28,800
How can I sit back in good conscience?

281
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,960
 Here. 

282
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:40,000
Orders from Official Zhou. We must find Xue Xiaotang before Lord Ding.

283
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,040
Use Princess Roujia as the bait to lure him out and eliminate him.

284
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,980
Understood.

285
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,400
 Don't worry. Everyone will get a share. 

286
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,800
 - Thank you. 
 - Give me more. 

287
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,380
 Those at the back, please move forward. 

288
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,380
 Don't break the line. 

289
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,539
Everyone will get a share. Be patient.

290
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:01,940
   

291
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,840
When my mother had just married Old Master Mu,

292
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,720
they were deeply in love.

293
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,920
But she could never predict that he would marry a new concubine

294
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,420
half a year later.

295
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,800
After that, my mother died in sorrow.

296
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:53,540
I don't even know if she regretted marrying into the Mu family.

297
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,080
At least she had you.

298
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,120
 My Lord, bad news! 

299
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,459
Princess is in trouble, My Lord.

300
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,060
A riot erupted at the congee stall and Princess went missing.

301
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,619
Dispatch troops from the county government office.

302
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,259
- We're going to quell the riot and search for my sister. 
 - Yes.

303
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:29,120
And save the innocent victims.

304
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,099
Stop right there! Stop running!

305
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,620
Stop!

306
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,720
Your Highness!

307
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,279
Why?

308
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:07,899
I've offered you food.

309
00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:09,820
Why do you have to do this to me?

310
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,120
No, you're not refugees.

311
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,400
Xue Xiaotang, you finally show up!

312
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,980
Xiaotang.

313
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,020
Your Highness.

314
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,280
Xiaotang!

315
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,380
Your Highness!

316
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,860
Your Highness!

317
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,620
Your Highness.

318
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,440
He's dead.

319
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,000
Sister!

320
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,800
Sister!

321
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,900
Sister.

322
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,099
The imperial physicians are treating the refugees out there.

323
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:05,140
I'll take it from here.

324
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,859
Don't worry, Official Shen.

325
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,679
Her Highness passed out due to a deficiency in both qi and blood,

326
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,960
combined with the impact of extreme anger.

327
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,860
She will heal up after resting for some days.

328
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,119
Thank you so much.

329
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,720
No problem.

330
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,019
How's my sister doing?

331
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,620
Greetings, Your Highness.

332
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,999
Her Highness is all right.

333
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:24,840
She just needs meticulous care.

334
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,080
How about you? Are you injured?

335
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,500
I'm all right. Thank you, Your Highness.

336
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,920
By the way, Your Highness.

337
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,540
Is there something off about those refugees?

338
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,960
I interrogated one of them, who got injured while hunting down my sister.

339
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,079
That guy flat-out said they were infuriated because Sister added bran to the congee to fool them.

340
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,000
But does this excuse warrant murder?

341
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,220
Besides, they know martial skills.

342
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:59,020
They're not refugees but assassins.

343
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,400
By the way, where's my uncle?

344
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,399
After seeing that Princess is all right, His Lordship led the Falcon Squad

345
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:08,700
to the bottom of the cliff to search for Xue Xiaotang's body.

346
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,900
Given the time, I'm afraid they haven't found anything.

347
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,180
The situation in Jiangnan is getting more complex.

348
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,860
Yes. At first, the food provisions were gone.

349
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,480
Although we'd found some, most remain unknown.

350
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,419
Then, the fake refugees initiated a riot.

351
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:31,019
As of now, the ledger Zhuang Wenfeng hid is missing.

352
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:33,340
How hateful of them!

353
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,500
How could they treat people's lives lightly?

354
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,720
The disaster relief is our priority now.

355
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,899
Given the time now, the new food provision allocated by the imperial court will arrive tomorrow.

356
00:26:44,899 --> 00:26:47,340
We must get ready for it.

357
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,020
Man'er.

358
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,279
How is she?

359
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,959
Official Shen. You've been taking care of Her Princess the whole night.

360
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:03,780
Why don't you get some rest?

361
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,460
I'm fine.

362
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,680
Your Highness.

363
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,559
Great! Finally, you're awake.

364
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,700
Official Shen was worried sick.

365
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,040
Your Highness, do you feel better now?

366
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,060
Have they found Xiaotang?

367
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,300
Well...

368
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,940
Your Highness,

369
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,400
General Xue risked his life to protect you

370
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,060
because he wanted you to be safe and happy.

371
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,879
Sister, you're finally awake.

372
00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:45,519
I've been worried all night.

373
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:46,920
Don't worry.

374
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,640
I'm all right.

375
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,240
You should let Ms. Mu check on you.

376
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,900
Your Highness.

377
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:11,460
You're all right, but your body is weak and needs proper rest.

378
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,040
I told you I'm fine.

379
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,579
How's the situation out there?

380
00:28:19,579 --> 00:28:23,039
Rest assured. Things are improving.

381
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,200
 Look! The relief provision from the imperial court are here! 

382
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,320
 - We're saved! 
 - Great! 

383
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,601
 We won't starve anymore! 

384
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,740
 - Come on. 
 - I didn't do that. 

385
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,240
 I wouldn't dare! 

386
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,299
Jeez! You wretched woman!

387
00:28:57,301 --> 00:28:58,799
How dare you come back here alone!

388
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,459
    
 You left with Wenfeng.

389
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,900
    
 But now he has been arrested, and you're back here. Why?

390
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,940
I don't know, Mother.

391
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,640
I was inside the room when they took him away. I have no idea about what happened.

392
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,279
They must have a reason to arrest him.

393
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:14,759
Didn't the officials tell you anything?

394
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:18,879
No. They just arrested him without saying anything.

395
00:29:18,879 --> 00:29:21,300
You useless woman!

396
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,440
This way, please.

397
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,760
 Wretched woman!  Jinx! 

398
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,130
 - Please stop! 
 - I'll beat you to death! 

399
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,950
 - I'll beat you to death! 
 - Please stop! 

400
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,020
Useless fool!

401
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,100
Stop.

402
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,199
Who are you?

403
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:43,639
Old woman,

404
00:29:43,639 --> 00:29:45,420
do you want to defy the law?

405
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:49,200
Beating people in broad daylight.

406
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,540
I have the right to teach my daughter-in-law.

407
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:56,379
Who are you to tell me what to do in my place?

408
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:57,980
Men.

409
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,979
How dare you threaten a primary sixth-rank official?

410
00:30:02,979 --> 00:30:04,359
Old woman,

411
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:06,980
do you want to accompany your son in prison?

412
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,260
No need to look at me like that.

413
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,580
Look at how successful you are after becoming an official.

414
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:37,280
You must be glad you ran off before the wedding

415
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,280
and avoided all this trouble.

416
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,780
Eighth Sister,

417
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,680
you're putting it the wrong way.

418
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,160
You were the one who insisted on marrying County Magistrate Zhuang.

419
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,380
I ran off before the wedding and it was what you wished for.

420
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,180
As for the things you went through afterward,

421
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:58,780
I didn't predict that, and neither did you.

422
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:02,780
So, don't you think it's ridiculous to put the blame on me?

423
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,980
I know you came here to laugh at me.

424
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,480
Well, that's all for the joke.

425
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,340
You should leave now.

426
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,360
Today, I'm here to make a deal with you.

427
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,660
What do you mean?

428
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:40,320
Eight Sister, you're smart.

429
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,880
You always know how to plan for yourself

430
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,500
and make the right choices that are most advantageous for you.

431
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,400
What are you trying to say?

432
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:59,960
I bet you know where Zhuang Wenfeng's ledger is.

433
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,980
You want me to sell him out?

434
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:11,079
As long as you hand over the evidence to the Ministry of Justice, Zhuang Wenfeng will be convicted.

435
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:14,119
And I assure you, I'll get you out of the Zhuang family

436
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:15,940
and give you a sum of money.

437
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:21,660
This way, you'll be free and can live carefreely for the rest of your life.

438
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:30,039
You're smart, however, you have confined yourself to this little residence.

439
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,679
As of now, I'm in favor of His Majesty.

440
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,680
If you're looking for someone to rely on,

441
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,920
aren't I the most trustworthy one?

442
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,540
How much?

443
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,919
One thousand guan.

444
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:54,019
Three thousand guan.

445
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:56,180
Are you sincere about this deal?

446
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,920
You want me to risk my life for a mere one thousand guan?

447
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,820
No way.

448
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:05,590
   

449
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,899
You couldn't convince her?

450
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,500
Let me try.

451
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,800
No need.

452
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,820
I can bring Zhuang Wenfeng down myself without her help.

453
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,580
   

454
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,759
My Lord.

455
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:26,579
You're on the mend. Don't stand here.

456
00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:28,360
You should go inside.

457
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,820
Are you going out?

458
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,099
We're returning to the capital soon.

459
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:38,480
So I want to pay Tutor Shang another visit.

460
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,399
Yes, you should.

461
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,100
I'll go with you.

462
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,520
Why are you standing there?

463
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,120
Come on.

464
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,740
Why are you going with me?

465
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,100
I'd like to pay Tutor Shang a visit.

466
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:01,860
No... No, you don't have to.

467
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,420
Why not?

468
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,459
Tutor Shang refrains from meeting strangers.

469
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,039
That's why he went into hiding in Yongding County.

470
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:13,160
You don't have to visit him, My Lord.

471
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,379
But I heard that Tutor Shang is cheerful.

472
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:21,180
And he has many friends.

473
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,679
No, he's not cheerful at all.

474
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:25,399
He only speaks to those fishing folks.

475
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:29,309
How could he groom a student as eloquent as you if he's not cheerful?

476
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:31,670
I was born with it.

477
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,180
My Lord.

478
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,879
Here's your peach blossom brew.

479
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,399
Wait... You even prepared a gift.

480
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:42,180
You fooled me again.

481
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,180
Obviously, it's you.

482
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,980
You're the one who fools me.

483
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,319
- I fool you? 
 - Let's go.

484
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,420
This is the place.

485
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:00,160
   

486
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,320
Excellent calligraphy.

487
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,420
My teacher writes great calligraphy.

488
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,040
I'll go and check it out.

489
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,579
It's dark inside.

490
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:23,459
Maybe he's not back yet.

491
00:35:23,459 --> 00:35:27,299
My Lord, let's go to the lakeside to look for him.

492
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:33,639
Looks like Tutor Shang is obsessed with fishing, just like those rumors say.

493
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:40,140
Well, my teacher is overconfident about his fishing skills.

494
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,519
He always imagines that he can reap a bigger and better harvest.

495
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:46,700
However, in fact, he ends up empty-handed most of the time.

496
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,820
You're disrespectful.

497
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,199
How dare you badmouth me behind my back?

498
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:56,380
If you say so, look at your empty basket.

499
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,160
You're so clueless to bring this up.

500
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:05,200
I, Liu Yan, offer my greetings, sir.

501
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,780
Oh.

502
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,319
He's pretending.

503
00:36:11,319 --> 00:36:13,179
- He noticed you long ago. 
 - You talk too much.

504
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:14,599
You talk too much.

505
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:16,100
Take this.

506
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,720
Here you go.

507
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,300
Is this for me?

508
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,520
Please accept my gift, sir.

509
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,779
Thank you.

510
00:36:29,779 --> 00:36:31,680
Let's go inside.

511
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,600
He likes drinking.

512
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,679
They must be good brews.

513
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:39,980
Come on, sit.

514
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,120
Let me have a taste of it.

515
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,079
Drink slowly. Don't drink too much.

516
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,679
Please take care of your health. You're old already.

517
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:48,440
Why bother?

518
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:54,049
Live to the fullest with fine brews, one couldn't care less about vain fame afterlife.

519
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:56,700
You're always full of nonsense.

520
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,979
Are you cooking something on the stove?

521
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,020
It seems overcooked.

522
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,759
Oh, no. I forgot that.

523
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,800
It smells familiar.

524
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,879
I knew you would be here.

525
00:37:16,879 --> 00:37:19,840
So I made this for you.

526
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,640
My favorite fish soup. I knew it.

527
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,479
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you so much.

528
00:37:25,479 --> 00:37:26,659
Have a taste, My Lord.

529
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,420
His fish soup is delicious.

530
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,700
Try it, My Lord.

531
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,740
This is so good.

532
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,860
Is it nice, My Lord?

533
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,119
This is a special serving for you.

534
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:49,180
I added more salt to your soup.

535
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,820
It tastes good.

536
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,359
You know what?

537
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:59,659
When I was little, whenever I sneaked out to attend lessons here,

538
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,259
I'd bribe Juli with my food.

539
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,919
She'd then keep a lookout for me.

540
00:38:03,919 --> 00:38:06,159
Afterward, Tutor Shang noticed I always came here starving,

541
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:09,800
he cooked all the fish he caught for me.

542
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:14,939
If it weren't for my fish soup, you wouldn't have grown up smart.

543
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:16,740
Rightfully so.

544
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,880
Regarding disaster relief, I need to give you a heads-up.

545
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,540
Strictly speaking, you merely solved it superficially.

546
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,840
Sir, do you mean we haven't solved the root of the issue?

547
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,320
Yes.

548
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:50,000
When you see mold on the fruit, it's futile to just remove the mold.

549
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,820
You might find it rotten to the core when you cut it open.

550
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:01,179
You're born into the royal family.

551
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:06,700
You should know these complexities better than we do.

552
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,920
Yongding County is a small township.

553
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,560
We used to think it was easy to deal with.

554
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:18,000
Little did we know that corruption keeps on showing up.

555
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,920
At this rate, these affluent clans

556
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,960
seem to be too big to control.

557
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,960
So, Zhuang Wenfeng is just a pawn.

558
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,660
It takes more than one cold day to freeze the river.

559
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,260
Young girl, why do you sigh?

560
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,220
I ask you not to drink, and you ask me not to sigh.

561
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,600
When are you leaving?

562
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,199
Soon.

563
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:02,600
Have you settled everything?

564
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,120
Most pressing matters have been taken care of.

565
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,940
As for the minor ones...

566
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,700
That means you have some minor issues pending.

567
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,200
Yes.

568
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,980
You may continue.

569
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,040
I'll step out to get some fresh air.

570
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,899
Okay. Sure.

571
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,580
Stop staring at him.

572
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:45,980
You can't get your eyes off him.

573
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,520
Stop making fun of me.

574
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:54,100
Whether or not I'm making fun of you, you know it well deep inside.

575
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,040
Do you really like him?

576
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,460
Yes.

577
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:20,960


578
00:41:23,299 --> 00:41:30,758
♫  I can't forget the love that is still is nipping at my ears and temples  ♫

579
00:41:30,758 --> 00:41:37,958
♫  Memories keep slamming into rocks and have nowhere to berth  ♫

580
00:41:37,958 --> 00:41:45,398
♫  Both sides gaze at each other in the drizzling rain, but one has turned into clouds and mist  ♫

581
00:41:45,398 --> 00:41:54,018
♫  Leaving the isolated heart's island, like waves without a shore  ♫

582
00:41:54,018 --> 00:41:57,658
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

583
00:41:57,658 --> 00:42:01,318
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

584
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:05,238
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

585
00:42:05,238 --> 00:42:08,718
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

586
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:12,238
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

587
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:15,958
♫  Obviously willing to swear life and death 
 to be entangled for a lifetime  ♫

588
00:42:15,959 --> 00:42:20,258
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

589
00:42:20,258 --> 00:42:25,959
♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

590
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:47,158
♫  I can't forget the turmoil of love and hate, 
 even if the next day is far away  ♫

591
00:42:47,158 --> 00:42:55,818
♫  Two souls embrace in chaos, how can it be written off?  ♫

592
00:42:55,818 --> 00:42:59,398
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

593
00:42:59,398 --> 00:43:03,038
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

594
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:06,918
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

595
00:43:06,919 --> 00:43:10,458
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

596
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:14,158
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

597
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:17,838
♫  Obviously can't be erased, and haunted by lingering dreams  ♫

598
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:21,818
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

599
00:43:21,818 --> 00:43:28,999
♫  Want to have one more glimpse of you, 
 even just for a second more  ♫
