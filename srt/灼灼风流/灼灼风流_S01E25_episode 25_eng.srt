00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,459
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:35,080
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:47,879
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,159
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,259
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,479
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,579
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,579
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:18,739
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

12
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:24,100
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,239
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:36,918
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,019
   

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,059
   

17
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:44,939
   

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
   

19
00:01:48,585 --> 00:01:50,144
    
 How fortunate Brother Sun is.

20
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:53,085
His wife isn't angry when he comes to Xiaoqin Pleasure House.

21
00:01:53,085 --> 00:01:55,844
She even prepares hangover soup and sends a coachman for him.

22
00:01:55,844 --> 00:01:57,944
Brother Sun and his wife are tight.

23
00:01:57,945 --> 00:01:59,645
I envy them very much.

24
00:01:59,645 --> 00:02:01,385
Let me send you home.

25
00:02:04,006 --> 00:02:06,324
No, thanks, Brother Shen. I have plans.

26
00:02:06,324 --> 00:02:07,805
I shall bid you farewell here.

27
00:02:07,805 --> 00:02:09,406
Yes, please.

28
00:02:49,946 --> 00:02:51,446
My Lord,

29
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:55,585
didn't you head home first?

30
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:00,425
You don't want me here?

31
00:03:01,226 --> 00:03:04,026
Do you want Shen Jinghong to send you home?

32
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:07,385
My Lord!

33
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:11,346
Everyone knows Brother Shen likes Princess Roujia.

34
00:03:11,346 --> 00:03:14,225
You shouldn't get jealous of him.

35
00:03:16,506 --> 00:03:19,744
Because someone never cares for me.

36
00:03:19,745 --> 00:03:21,024
Says who?

37
00:03:21,025 --> 00:03:23,686
I care so much for you.

38
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:33,306
By the way, My Lord, there's something I need to talk to you seriously about.

39
00:03:33,306 --> 00:03:37,725
Did you mean what you said this morning?

40
00:03:37,725 --> 00:03:40,345
What did you mean by "bad admirers"?

41
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:42,046
What do you think?

42
00:03:42,906 --> 00:03:45,085
What do I think...?

43
00:03:48,585 --> 00:03:50,785
I got it.

44
00:03:50,785 --> 00:03:54,005
You were talking about yourself.

45
00:03:54,005 --> 00:03:56,545
You're my admirer.

46
00:04:09,385 --> 00:04:13,535
♫  The flowing water bends and reflects the round moon  ♫

47
00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:17,285
♫  Gently sprinkling your eyebrows and eyes  ♫

48
00:04:17,285 --> 00:04:20,424
♫  The galaxy is like the sea, 
 the eyes are like the eaves covered with snow  ♫

49
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:23,246
 My Lord! 

50
00:04:24,785 --> 00:04:28,505
♫  The night rain hitting the sycamore tree disturbs a sparrow  ♫

51
00:04:28,505 --> 00:04:31,777
♫  The young maiden become acquainted with 
 the green robes in that moment  ♫

52
00:04:31,777 --> 00:04:34,665
♫  Afraid that the number of twists and turns will increase  ♫

53
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,766
I remember it now.

54
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:38,945
What did you remember?

55
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,324
At the hunting ground...

56
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:43,170
I...

57
00:04:47,315 --> 00:04:53,915
♫  Thousands of words are not enough 
 to accompany the long journey  ♫

58
00:04:58,026 --> 00:04:59,886
What are you thinking?

59
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:04,425
I'm helping you with your messy hair.

60
00:05:04,425 --> 00:05:07,446
♫  Accompanying you, calmly waiting 
 for the clouds to fade away  ♫

61
00:05:07,446 --> 00:05:08,986
My Lord!

62
00:05:08,986 --> 00:05:11,786
I thought you remembered everything.

63
00:05:11,786 --> 00:05:14,185
You fooled me.

64
00:05:14,185 --> 00:05:17,405
♫  Standing on heights looking clearly into the horizon with a shared aspiration  ♫

65
00:05:17,405 --> 00:05:20,705
♫  It is much farther than just two consensual hearts  ♫

66
00:05:20,705 --> 00:05:23,544
I wish I could have recalled that sooner.

67
00:05:24,946 --> 00:05:27,025
Had that happened,

68
00:05:27,825 --> 00:05:30,304
we wouldn't have had to waste so much time.

69
00:05:30,304 --> 00:05:32,235
♫  Toiling away long hours together with the candle's light  ♫

70
00:05:32,235 --> 00:05:35,985
♫  Not caring about the high mountains, deep waters, and long roads  ♫

71
00:05:35,985 --> 00:05:42,185
♫  Fortunately, you are here, not afraid of the repeated trips 
 and hanging around with me  ♫

72
00:05:54,305 --> 00:05:56,105
You get all worked up.

73
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,225
Why did you apologize to Mu Zhuohua?

74
00:05:58,226 --> 00:05:59,665
Just why?

75
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,204
She's the one in the wrong.

76
00:06:01,204 --> 00:06:04,526
She stole someone I love.

77
00:06:04,526 --> 00:06:06,446
Answer me.

78
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,504
Get out of here. You're not my brother.

79
00:06:09,505 --> 00:06:11,784
- You betrayed me. 
 - Yunyun.

80
00:06:17,205 --> 00:06:19,304
Mu Zhuohua and I are metropolitan graduates.

81
00:06:19,305 --> 00:06:20,905
And we're always on good terms.

82
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:23,805
I won't comment on what happened between Lord Ding and her.

83
00:06:23,805 --> 00:06:28,466
However, you shouldn't have snitched on her that she changed her birthplace.

84
00:06:28,466 --> 00:06:30,625
Are you blaming me?

85
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,824
Mu Zhuohua has admirable qualities in her personality and professionalism.

86
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,646
She's truly an excellent official.

87
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,125
Yunyun,

88
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:41,945
can you stop expecting something that is not meant for you?

89
00:06:44,745 --> 00:06:48,745
Brother, you're leading a happy life with your wife.

90
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:54,806
You can't understand how painful it is deep inside me.

91
00:06:57,106 --> 00:06:59,526
But will it work just by forcing him to love you?

92
00:07:00,346 --> 00:07:01,946
Yunyun.

93
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:09,366
Pain will fade as time goes by.

94
00:07:24,446 --> 00:07:26,246
Imperial Physician Lu.

95
00:07:28,745 --> 00:07:31,405
My Lord. Official Mu. You're finally back.

96
00:07:31,405 --> 00:07:33,966
I've been waiting for you.

97
00:07:33,966 --> 00:07:37,906
Have you found any clues about the Snow Dust Pill?

98
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:40,164
What you just said is right.

99
00:07:40,164 --> 00:07:42,624
I spent the entire day in the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

100
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,625
I found it.

101
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,725
There's one more Snow Dust Pill left.

102
00:07:48,586 --> 00:07:49,705
Where is it?

103
00:07:49,706 --> 00:07:51,025
It's with Princess Roujia.

104
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:52,905
When His Majesty was the Crown Prince,

105
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:55,985
he felt sorry for Princess Roujia as she lost her mother

106
00:07:55,986 --> 00:07:59,625
and was afraid staying in the capital would remind her of the loss.

107
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:03,685
So, Princess Roujia was sent to be raised by Border Defender Princess, the First Princess.

108
00:08:03,685 --> 00:08:06,912
Afterwards, before Princess Roujia got married,

109
00:08:06,912 --> 00:08:11,205
the First Princess gave Princess Roujia the only Snow Dust Pill

110
00:08:11,205 --> 00:08:16,265
she had as the dowry.

111
00:08:16,265 --> 00:08:19,085
All right. I'll go to see Princess Roujia now.

112
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:27,605
What brings you here?

113
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:30,345
Brother Shen, how fortuitous.

114
00:08:30,346 --> 00:08:31,846
Yes.

115
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:34,685
 But we have to start to purchase and hoard winter garments. 

116
00:08:34,685 --> 00:08:35,666
Let's go in.

117
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,065
 We need to get this done before the temperature drops. 

118
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:39,205
 Understood. 

119
00:08:39,205 --> 00:08:41,764
 Please leave this to me, Your Highness. 

120
00:08:41,764 --> 00:08:43,225
 You should go back and rest. 

121
00:08:43,226 --> 00:08:44,726
I'm fine.

122
00:08:45,346 --> 00:08:46,585
The cold hurt your lungs.

123
00:08:46,586 --> 00:08:50,845
The treatment is merely an expedient method.

124
00:08:50,845 --> 00:08:55,705
You should follow the medical advice to take medicine and rest.

125
00:08:55,706 --> 00:09:00,485
Your Highness, I have a problem that needs to be addressed.

126
00:09:00,485 --> 00:09:02,925
I'd like to seek your help.

127
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:04,666
What is it?

128
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,465
I'll do anything for you in my power.

129
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:10,806
Feel free to tell me if I can be of help.

130
00:09:10,806 --> 00:09:12,144
Thank you, Your Highness.

131
00:09:12,145 --> 00:09:13,945
Thank you, Brother Shen.

132
00:09:14,706 --> 00:09:15,744
Your Highness,

133
00:09:15,745 --> 00:09:21,205
I'd like to ask for the Snow Dust Pill from you to save someone.

134
00:09:21,205 --> 00:09:22,986
Snow Dust Pill?

135
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:29,905
It's been years.

136
00:09:29,905 --> 00:09:33,225
If you didn't ask me, I would have forgotten about it.

137
00:09:33,946 --> 00:09:37,265
But what has happened to your friend?

138
00:09:37,265 --> 00:09:39,346
Severely injured?

139
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:42,065
Well, my friend...

140
00:09:42,065 --> 00:09:43,864
It's not my friend, actually.

141
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:46,144
This person is badly injured.

142
00:09:46,145 --> 00:09:48,906
Only the Snow Dust Pill can save his life.

143
00:09:49,745 --> 00:09:54,245
Besides, if he awakes,

144
00:09:55,046 --> 00:09:59,146
it might be a pleasant surprise.

145
00:10:05,226 --> 00:10:10,886
If a life can be saved, the Snow Dust Pill isn't a big deal.

146
00:10:11,505 --> 00:10:13,205
Thank you, Your Highness.

147
00:10:42,826 --> 00:10:48,105
My Lord, the Snow Dust Pill from Princess Roujia is truly effective.

148
00:10:50,145 --> 00:10:54,326
As soon as General Xue took it, it started to take effect.

149
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,325
Do you like it here?

150
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,910
Of course I do.

151
00:11:05,145 --> 00:11:06,745
From now on,

152
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:10,725
this mansion is yours.

153
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:15,706
This is the key.

154
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:24,505
Afterward, you can manage this mansion however you wish.

155
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:28,165
Are the people in this mansion...

156
00:11:30,986 --> 00:11:33,045
under my charge, too?

157
00:11:39,505 --> 00:11:42,545
Whatever you want to do, you can do.

158
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:22,838
   

159
00:12:27,905 --> 00:12:29,905
My Lord.

160
00:12:29,905 --> 00:12:32,286
This belonged to my maternal grandfather.

161
00:12:32,905 --> 00:12:36,505
I didn't expect to have books left

162
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,946
after my maternal grandfather's residence was confiscated.

163
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:41,624
Good for you.

164
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:45,684
Back then, he was promoted to Director of the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

165
00:12:45,684 --> 00:12:47,786
He was the most skilled physician.

166
00:12:48,545 --> 00:12:51,024
Words have it that your grandfather had plenty of unique healing skills.

167
00:12:51,025 --> 00:12:53,265
Maybe you can find them in the book.

168
00:12:58,385 --> 00:13:00,565
Apricot blossoms...

169
00:13:10,986 --> 00:13:12,986
I'm returning this to you.

170
00:13:17,665 --> 00:13:20,106
This is my mother's handkerchief.

171
00:13:32,905 --> 00:13:39,305
My mother might have drawn this on it when she was little.

172
00:13:40,405 --> 00:13:46,585
My grandfather held her so dearly that he allowed her to scribble on his books.

173
00:13:52,426 --> 00:13:53,926
No.

174
00:13:55,506 --> 00:13:57,726
That handkerchief.

175
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:07,786
What's wrong with this handkerchief?

176
00:14:07,786 --> 00:14:09,905
Not the handkerchief.

177
00:14:09,905 --> 00:14:12,346
It's the apricot blossoms on it.

178
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,764
 Qi! Qi, come here. 

179
00:14:26,764 --> 00:14:29,385
 What are you doing? It's dangerous. 

180
00:14:29,385 --> 00:14:33,965
 Mother, I dropped your most cherished handkerchief into the water. 

181
00:14:33,965 --> 00:14:37,205
 Silly dear. It's not as important as you. 

182
00:14:37,205 --> 00:14:43,244
 Mother, isn't this handkerchief the precious gift given to you by Grandfather? 

183
00:14:43,244 --> 00:14:47,166
 Qi, you're the most precious gift to me. 

184
00:14:48,426 --> 00:14:50,185
 Give it to me. 

185
00:14:58,785 --> 00:15:00,485
 Mother. 

186
00:15:00,485 --> 00:15:04,945
 The drawing on this handkerchief didn't fade after soaking in the water for long. 

187
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,804
 Because it was painted with a solution. 

188
00:15:07,804 --> 00:15:09,425
 It won't wear off. 

189
00:15:09,425 --> 00:15:11,105
 That's great. 

190
00:15:11,105 --> 00:15:13,184
 Mother, can you make this solution? 

191
00:15:13,184 --> 00:15:14,985
 I want it. 

192
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,506
 I could. 

193
00:15:17,506 --> 00:15:21,106
 But I no longer remember how to do it. 

194
00:15:24,165 --> 00:15:25,965
 Isn't it nice? 

195
00:15:28,186 --> 00:15:33,105
My Lord, you said my grandfather's residence was seized

196
00:15:33,106 --> 00:15:37,924
because someone exploited the death of Consort Yun to hide the evidence.

197
00:15:40,905 --> 00:15:44,225
The apricot blossoms on this handkerchief aren't finely drawn.

198
00:15:44,226 --> 00:15:46,686
It must have been done in haste.

199
00:15:46,686 --> 00:15:53,445
Besides, it was drawn with an insoluble solution for preserving purposes.

200
00:15:54,466 --> 00:16:00,025
My mother didn't remember much about her past,

201
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:03,726
but she had a deep impression of the apricot blossoms.

202
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:07,266
Are you suggesting that your grandfather drew these apricot blossoms

203
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:11,066
on this handkerchief in a rush to leave a hint...

204
00:16:11,986 --> 00:16:14,066
before the residence was seized?

205
00:16:14,066 --> 00:16:18,026
And he asked your mother to keep it properly.

206
00:16:18,026 --> 00:16:19,866
That's right.

207
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:23,566
My mother cherished this handkerchief

208
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:27,526
and had a deep impression of the apricot blossom tree.

209
00:16:27,526 --> 00:16:33,466
I think my grandfather must have emphasized something to her.

210
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:52,766
My Lord.

211
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:07,484
It's the goatskin wrap used to wrap acupuncture needles.

212
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:10,105
It must have been left by my grandfather.

213
00:17:12,305 --> 00:17:14,485
Look at this, My Lord.

214
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:23,365
 I, Fu, formulated the Revival Powder to treat patients. 

215
00:17:23,365 --> 00:17:28,065
 However, the effects of this medicine are overly intense and not as intended. 

216
00:17:28,065 --> 00:17:30,285
 I wanted to destroy the formula, 

217
00:17:30,285 --> 00:17:33,045
 but Empress Zhou halted me. 

218
00:17:33,045 --> 00:17:35,626
 Later, Consort Yun suffered from bleeding during labor. 

219
00:17:35,626 --> 00:17:38,244
 I was tasked to save Her Highness. 

220
00:17:38,244 --> 00:17:42,026
 I discovered her condition was caused by the Revival Powder. 

221
00:17:42,026 --> 00:17:44,885
 Knowing a serious accusation would befall me, 

222
00:17:44,885 --> 00:17:46,646
 I am leaving this message, 

223
00:17:46,646 --> 00:17:51,985
 hoping that the truth will come to light one day. 

224
00:17:56,685 --> 00:17:58,585
I used to think...

225
00:17:59,725 --> 00:18:02,926
she wanted to take my life

226
00:18:02,926 --> 00:18:07,304
out of fear that my overwhelmed reputation would threaten His Majesty's throne.

227
00:18:08,706 --> 00:18:13,506
Now, it seems she has never regarded me...

228
00:18:14,972 --> 00:18:18,293
as her son.

229
00:18:18,293 --> 00:18:20,626
It has been...

230
00:18:22,165 --> 00:18:26,105
just her showmanship all the while.

231
00:18:30,745 --> 00:18:32,445
My Lord.

232
00:18:37,046 --> 00:18:38,926
My mother,

233
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:43,566
the 30,000 soldiers of the Cangwu Army,

234
00:18:43,566 --> 00:18:47,005
Yun Xiangyue, you,

235
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:52,965
the people, and the entire nation of Southern Chen.

236
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:57,586
She pegs all of you a plaything she can kill as she wishes.

237
00:18:58,585 --> 00:19:01,445
If it weren't for this letter...

238
00:19:01,445 --> 00:19:03,505
Fine.

239
00:19:03,505 --> 00:19:08,426
I have completely lost trust in her.

240
00:19:08,426 --> 00:19:10,585
My trust is dead.

241
00:19:11,265 --> 00:19:12,865
My Lord.

242
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:19,845
Evil will never get its way.

243
00:19:20,645 --> 00:19:25,565
All mistakes committed and false accusations

244
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:30,605
will return to us in various forms eventually.

245
00:19:30,605 --> 00:19:35,946
Your investigation of the war at the Juma River will come to a desirable end.

246
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:08,406
Xue Xiaotang.

247
00:20:11,825 --> 00:20:13,325
General Xue.

248
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:17,425
Looks like you recognize me.

249
00:20:23,146 --> 00:20:29,946
What happened at the Juma River five years ago?

250
00:20:34,745 --> 00:20:36,245
General Xue.

251
00:20:37,906 --> 00:20:40,106
Stop evading.

252
00:20:40,965 --> 00:20:45,286
Yes, you can turn a blind eye.

253
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:46,265
But what about later?

254
00:20:46,266 --> 00:20:49,465
Do you want to spend all your life in hiding

255
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:51,504
and looking over your shoulder?

256
00:20:51,505 --> 00:20:55,705
Do you never wish to see Princess Roujia again?

257
00:21:01,305 --> 00:21:02,905
Jiaojiao.

258
00:21:04,025 --> 00:21:06,544
You can't take your eyes off the view.

259
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:08,645
Greetings, Father.

260
00:21:08,645 --> 00:21:12,785
Just two of us, no need to stand on ceremony.

261
00:21:14,226 --> 00:21:16,425
Father, it's windy here.

262
00:21:16,426 --> 00:21:19,246
Let's go inside.

263
00:21:19,246 --> 00:21:21,525
I rarely have a chance to get fresh air outside.

264
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:23,905
Don't force me to go inside.

265
00:21:23,905 --> 00:21:26,905
I'll stay with you here for a while, then.

266
00:21:27,626 --> 00:21:28,945
You...

267
00:21:28,946 --> 00:21:33,684
You don't have to come to the temporary imperial residence for my sake.

268
00:21:33,684 --> 00:21:36,225
Father, you always skip your medicine.

269
00:21:41,046 --> 00:21:43,045
Are you under the weather?

270
00:21:43,045 --> 00:21:44,104
No, I'm not.

271
00:21:44,105 --> 00:21:46,105
You're holding a snuff bottle.

272
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:50,705
It was used to store the Snow Dust Pill before.

273
00:21:50,705 --> 00:21:52,646
Snow Dust Pill?

274
00:21:53,685 --> 00:21:57,505
Your uncle has taken that to save his life before.

275
00:21:57,505 --> 00:21:59,605
I remember it was the last pill.

276
00:21:59,605 --> 00:22:01,406
Who will you give it to?

277
00:22:05,406 --> 00:22:07,706
I have no idea either.

278
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:09,425
It's a friend of Official Mu.

279
00:22:09,426 --> 00:22:11,226
Mu Zhuohua?

280
00:22:12,105 --> 00:22:14,585
You sure are generous.

281
00:22:16,105 --> 00:22:18,126
I regard her as my dear friend.

282
00:22:18,126 --> 00:22:20,006
She asked me for this pill.

283
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:23,685
Naturally, I should help her.

284
00:22:23,685 --> 00:22:26,806
You're a kind child.

285
00:22:26,806 --> 00:22:29,066
Just like your mother.

286
00:22:31,445 --> 00:22:33,045
Father.

287
00:22:35,585 --> 00:22:37,024
You did a good thing.

288
00:22:37,025 --> 00:22:41,965
Despite its preciousness, the medicine is considered worthless if it doesn't save lives.

289
00:22:41,965 --> 00:22:43,525
Exactly.

290
00:22:44,146 --> 00:22:48,806
I wish Heaven could show its mercy and save the person.

291
00:22:50,445 --> 00:22:53,005
My kindness won't be let down.

292
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,506
General Xue.

293
00:22:56,505 --> 00:23:01,385
Do you know who gave you this

294
00:23:02,946 --> 00:23:04,446
Who?

295
00:23:05,466 --> 00:23:07,585
Princess Roujia.

296
00:23:08,505 --> 00:23:12,285
She asked me to save your life no matter what,

297
00:23:13,426 --> 00:23:17,626
even though she didn't know it was you.

298
00:23:17,626 --> 00:23:24,065
Besides, she said that her fiance would be glad to see this.

299
00:23:25,766 --> 00:23:29,086
General Xue, do you know?

300
00:23:29,086 --> 00:23:34,206
Princess Roujia fell very ill when she thought you had died.

301
00:23:34,986 --> 00:23:37,425
If you were to continue to hide yourself,

302
00:23:37,425 --> 00:23:40,566
she would be living in pain for the rest of her life.

303
00:23:49,265 --> 00:23:53,625
Do you really not want to walk to her without hiding?

304
00:23:58,505 --> 00:24:00,405
I'll tell you everything.

305
00:24:09,305 --> 00:24:11,286
Five years ago,

306
00:24:14,025 --> 00:24:16,886
before the army set off,

307
00:24:19,326 --> 00:24:22,866
the Dowager Empress suddenly summoned me for a secret meeting.

308
00:24:27,605 --> 00:24:31,126
 You'll soon become my grandson-in-law. 

309
00:24:31,126 --> 00:24:33,885
 Before you leave, 

310
00:24:33,885 --> 00:24:38,145
 I have something to tell you. 

311
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:40,286
 Yes, please. 

312
00:24:40,286 --> 00:24:43,966
 Lord Ding isn't my own son. 

313
00:24:43,966 --> 00:24:50,566
 He exploited his achievement to take the Cangwu Army as his own. 

314
00:24:51,226 --> 00:24:55,345
 He even breaks faith with the emperor. 

315
00:24:56,226 --> 00:24:58,045
 How could Lord Ding do that? 

316
00:24:58,045 --> 00:25:03,046
 I believe it must be a misunderstanding. 

317
00:25:03,046 --> 00:25:07,466
 Whether or not it's a misunderstanding, I have my own judgment. 

318
00:25:08,345 --> 00:25:10,886
 What you need to do... 

319
00:25:13,146 --> 00:25:17,266
 is uproot traitors from the imperial court. 

320
00:25:18,146 --> 00:25:21,645
 Keep him on the battlefield for good. 

321
00:25:24,226 --> 00:25:28,546
 By that time, you'll return decorated 

322
00:25:28,546 --> 00:25:31,406
 and marry Roujia. 

323
00:25:56,025 --> 00:25:59,505
 As you command, Your Highness. 

324
00:26:09,226 --> 00:26:16,225
 With this token, the Zhou family will be at your beck and call. 

325
00:26:25,146 --> 00:26:26,746
After that,

326
00:26:28,265 --> 00:26:30,385
I went to Yuan Chengming.

327
00:26:35,626 --> 00:26:38,466
I asked him for your military route plan.

328
00:26:39,105 --> 00:26:42,545
Deputy General Yuan was loyal.

329
00:26:43,866 --> 00:26:46,666
Did you threaten him?

330
00:26:50,706 --> 00:26:55,845
I threatened him with his wife and daughter's lives.

331
00:26:56,846 --> 00:26:59,046
Hence, he agreed.

332
00:27:02,625 --> 00:27:07,706
I thought I could return to the capital

333
00:27:07,706 --> 00:27:09,825
to marry Princess Roujia...

334
00:27:11,745 --> 00:27:15,206
and spend the rest of my life with her.

335
00:27:15,206 --> 00:27:17,505
But it backfired.

336
00:27:22,685 --> 00:27:26,025
I almost died.

337
00:27:29,026 --> 00:27:32,026
Under the order of Dowager Empress,

338
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:35,745
I led the Zhou family to hunt Yuan Chengming down.

339
00:27:35,745 --> 00:27:38,426
To avoid our trace from being revealed,

340
00:27:38,426 --> 00:27:43,825
I brought along the special weapon of Northern Liang, the hawk claw hook.

341
00:27:43,825 --> 00:27:47,905
Just as we could kill him, out of expectation,

342
00:27:49,146 --> 00:27:51,666
Imperial Shadow Guards turned up.

343
00:27:55,566 --> 00:27:57,886
You were attacked by Wandering Needle.

344
00:27:58,606 --> 00:28:03,086
To save yourself, you cut your arm off.

345
00:28:03,086 --> 00:28:04,826
Yes.

346
00:28:05,545 --> 00:28:09,965
Because of the Wandering Needle, all the men I brought

347
00:28:09,965 --> 00:28:12,865
died from its toxicity.

348
00:28:13,745 --> 00:28:16,045
Those Imperial Shadow Guards...

349
00:28:16,045 --> 00:28:17,985
His Majesty sent them over.

350
00:28:23,386 --> 00:28:26,305
If it were Dowager Empress,

351
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:30,305
Zhou's men wouldn't have been killed.

352
00:28:36,205 --> 00:28:38,425
They hold each other dearly.

353
00:28:39,265 --> 00:28:44,720
As the son, he would clean up after his mother.

354
00:28:47,046 --> 00:28:49,566
Not only does he want to protect Dowager Empress,

355
00:28:50,545 --> 00:28:52,625
but he also wants to protect me.

356
00:28:53,645 --> 00:28:58,245
My brother wishes I can let this go...

357
00:28:59,305 --> 00:29:03,624
to avoid confrontations between me and Dowager Empress that'll never end.

358
00:29:19,405 --> 00:29:21,845
 My Lord, someone from the palace is here. 

359
00:29:22,566 --> 00:29:24,646
 What perfect timing. 

360
00:29:52,545 --> 00:29:54,945
The food is ready, Your Lordship.

361
00:29:54,946 --> 00:29:57,786
Her Majesty sent me to show you in.

362
00:30:02,226 --> 00:30:05,666
Come inside with me and wait at the side chamber.

363
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:07,245
Yes.

364
00:30:11,014 --> 00:30:14,336
   

365
00:30:32,025 --> 00:30:34,666
Greetings, Your Highness.

366
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,085
You're here, Yan'er.

367
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,945
Take a seat.

368
00:30:38,945 --> 00:30:40,825
Thank you.

369
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:49,486
Your complexion doesn't look good.

370
00:30:49,486 --> 00:30:52,825
Havve you been feeling unwell lately?

371
00:30:55,426 --> 00:30:58,245
You should eat more.

372
00:30:58,245 --> 00:31:00,566
These are your favorite dishes.

373
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:06,765
Thank you.

374
00:31:08,186 --> 00:31:12,586
The last time we had a meal alone

375
00:31:12,586 --> 00:31:15,746
was a dozen years ago, I suppose.

376
00:31:16,545 --> 00:31:19,365
How time flies.

377
00:31:19,365 --> 00:31:25,745
I can still remember when you were first brought to my palace.

378
00:31:26,946 --> 00:31:31,426
You were so little in swaddling clothes.

379
00:31:32,426 --> 00:31:34,526
You were this big.

380
00:31:36,025 --> 00:31:40,826
Even though you looked tiny, you cried really loudly.

381
00:31:40,826 --> 00:31:44,426
Three wet nurses were looking after you,

382
00:31:44,426 --> 00:31:47,145
but you kept bawling and refused to sleep.

383
00:31:47,146 --> 00:31:50,145
I had no choice

384
00:31:50,145 --> 00:31:52,965
but to carry you at night.

385
00:31:53,785 --> 00:31:56,426
And you stopped crying.

386
00:31:57,806 --> 00:32:02,846
I was told that I couldn't sleep well at night when I was little.

387
00:32:02,846 --> 00:32:07,485
It was you who stayed up all night to soothe me.

388
00:32:08,265 --> 00:32:15,706
Hence, you were worn and gaunt back then.

389
00:32:17,706 --> 00:32:20,886
Your mother passed away when you were born.

390
00:32:20,886 --> 00:32:24,265
I felt sorry for you.

391
00:32:29,165 --> 00:32:33,385
I'll never forget your kindness for raising me.

392
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:35,086
My goodness.

393
00:32:37,146 --> 00:32:39,306
My child.

394
00:32:39,306 --> 00:32:43,326
Why do you bow all of a sudden?

395
00:32:46,806 --> 00:32:49,206
Being parents is never easy,

396
00:32:49,206 --> 00:32:53,026
let alone the fact that I'm not your biological son.

397
00:32:53,785 --> 00:32:59,505
I'll keep your kindness in my heart.

398
00:32:59,505 --> 00:33:02,305
Glad to know that.

399
00:33:02,305 --> 00:33:05,146
I know you're a filial child.

400
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:16,905
My condition has never shown improvement after taking medicine for years.

401
00:33:18,086 --> 00:33:21,025
Father, please take some candied fruit.

402
00:33:28,052 --> 00:33:32,586
Your candied fruit always has a better taste.

403
00:33:44,706 --> 00:33:46,385
Jiaojiao.

404
00:33:46,386 --> 00:33:48,526
Is there anything on your mind?

405
00:33:49,585 --> 00:33:52,086
I was thinking of Grandmother.

406
00:33:52,105 --> 00:33:56,165
Will she feel lonely in the palace?

407
00:33:58,305 --> 00:34:01,344
Mother said she was old and couldn't bear the bumpy journey.

408
00:34:01,345 --> 00:34:03,425
I couldn't persuade her to come.

409
00:34:03,425 --> 00:34:04,925
Don't worry, Father.

410
00:34:04,925 --> 00:34:07,204
Uncle stays in the capital, too.

411
00:34:07,204 --> 00:34:09,486
He can take care of Grandmother.

412
00:34:09,486 --> 00:34:11,185
You're right.

413
00:34:20,206 --> 00:34:21,606
Father?

414
00:34:21,606 --> 00:34:23,626
Nothing.

415
00:34:23,626 --> 00:34:29,746
I'm just worried about your uncle's health.

416
00:34:31,145 --> 00:34:33,566
Why do you eat so little?

417
00:34:33,566 --> 00:34:37,646
The cooking skills of the kitchen here seem to have regressed.

418
00:34:38,705 --> 00:34:42,445
I've been taking medicine these days.

419
00:34:42,445 --> 00:34:44,606
So, I don't have much appetite.

420
00:34:45,306 --> 00:34:47,106
Oh, dear.

421
00:34:47,106 --> 00:34:50,486
You need someone to take care of you.

422
00:34:50,486 --> 00:34:54,265
I can only rest assured after you settle down in your fief.

423
00:34:54,266 --> 00:34:58,466
Your Highness, you want me to go to the fief?

424
00:34:58,466 --> 00:35:02,086
You're interested in Mu Zhuohua, aren't you?

425
00:35:02,086 --> 00:35:05,485
She's from Jiangnan,

426
00:35:05,485 --> 00:35:08,045
which is in your fief.

427
00:35:08,045 --> 00:35:12,125
After you get married and settle down in Jiangnan,

428
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:14,946
you can enjoy your time as you wish.

429
00:35:17,746 --> 00:35:19,946
Yan'er,

430
00:35:19,946 --> 00:35:22,605
do I treat you well?

431
00:35:23,346 --> 00:35:27,666
Your Highness, you treat me like your own son.

432
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:30,845
How does the emperor treat you?

433
00:35:30,845 --> 00:35:35,085
His Majesty sees me as his biological brother.

434
00:35:36,186 --> 00:35:40,245
I know you've always been a grateful child.

435
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:45,086
You're leaving tomorrow.

436
00:35:45,086 --> 00:35:50,625
So today, I'll give you a send-off.

437
00:36:24,705 --> 00:36:26,205
Men.

438
00:36:29,826 --> 00:36:32,144
Yes, Your Majesty.

439
00:36:32,145 --> 00:36:33,624
Get ready with the carriage.

440
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,686
I'm returning to the palace.

441
00:36:35,686 --> 00:36:37,824
- Your Majesty. 
 - Now!

442
00:36:37,824 --> 00:36:39,845
Yes, Your Majesty.

443
00:36:44,105 --> 00:36:45,605
Father.

444
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,486
I'm worried about your health.

445
00:36:49,486 --> 00:36:51,925
Please allow me to go with you.

446
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,845
All right. You may come with me.

447
00:37:23,386 --> 00:37:26,124
Yan'er, do you not accept my offer?

448
00:37:26,124 --> 00:37:27,925
I daren't.

449
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:30,825
It's just...

450
00:37:32,085 --> 00:37:35,965
that I smell something strange in this liquor.

451
00:37:36,786 --> 00:37:38,286
Is that so?

452
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:42,046
How come I didn't notice that?

453
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:53,766
Maybe I made a mistake.

454
00:37:55,445 --> 00:38:00,745
However, have you heard

455
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:03,465
of a secret medicine called the Revival Powder?

456
00:38:04,705 --> 00:38:08,946
It cures all sickness and brings the dead back to life.

457
00:38:10,306 --> 00:38:16,046
I have never heard of such a panacea.

458
00:38:17,605 --> 00:38:20,046
Your Highness hasn't?

459
00:38:20,686 --> 00:38:22,986
That can't be.

460
00:38:22,986 --> 00:38:26,426
The medicine is from the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

461
00:38:38,218 --> 00:38:40,947
   

462
00:38:45,005 --> 00:38:49,105
Perhaps you've come across it.

463
00:38:55,495 --> 00:38:58,318
   

464
00:39:18,925 --> 00:39:22,646
It seems you're telling the truth.

465
00:39:24,866 --> 00:39:31,186
But how did my birth mother, Consort Yun, die?

466
00:39:31,186 --> 00:39:34,586
Yan'er, what a strange question that is.

467
00:39:34,586 --> 00:39:39,706
Consort Yun died in childbirth when she was giving birth to you.

468
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:46,305
But it's different from what Fu Shengru wrote in his final letter.

469
00:39:46,305 --> 00:39:48,906
Final letter?

470
00:39:48,906 --> 00:39:52,145
Can it be verified?

471
00:39:53,145 --> 00:39:57,646
What about the defeat of the war at the Juma River?

472
00:39:58,665 --> 00:40:01,405
Yan'er, what's wrong with you?

473
00:40:01,405 --> 00:40:05,726
You fought the war back then, not me.

474
00:40:05,726 --> 00:40:11,725
Your men colluded with the enemy and betrayed Southern Chen.

475
00:40:11,725 --> 00:40:16,224
Yet, the emperor and I didn't hold you accountable for mismanaging your subordinates.

476
00:40:16,224 --> 00:40:18,946
We were generous to you.

477
00:40:18,946 --> 00:40:22,286
How could you question me on that now?

478
00:40:27,085 --> 00:40:32,785
Looks like you're not going to admit it.

479
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:37,245
I don't understand what you're talking about.

480
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:44,725
You believe that the dead will stay silent forever.

481
00:40:44,725 --> 00:40:49,266
In that case, why don't we hear from someone who's still alive?

482
00:40:59,786 --> 00:41:02,266
How dare you come in uninvited?

483
00:41:03,746 --> 00:41:05,346
Your Majesty.

484
00:41:06,806 --> 00:41:10,365
Well, this is an old acquaintance of yours.

485
00:41:12,705 --> 00:41:15,146
Do you not remember him?

486
00:41:21,105 --> 00:41:22,425
Who are you?

487
00:41:22,426 --> 00:41:26,985
I, Xue Xiaotang, offer my greetings, Your Highness.

488
00:41:28,045 --> 00:41:32,645
Your Highness, you haven't forgotten...

489
00:41:33,386 --> 00:41:35,526
this name, have you?

490
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:38,945
Xue Xiaotang was once engaged to Roujia.

491
00:41:38,946 --> 00:41:41,366
I remember him.

492
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:44,346
But he died five years ago.

493
00:41:44,346 --> 00:41:51,085
If not for your secret edict to eliminate Lord Ding and the Cangwu Army five years ago,

494
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:56,045
I wouldn't have risked my life.

495
00:41:56,045 --> 00:42:01,525
Does it jog your memory about what you did back then?

496
00:42:02,346 --> 00:42:03,946
Liu Yan.

497
00:42:05,426 --> 00:42:08,405
I've been tolerating you all along,

498
00:42:08,405 --> 00:42:11,546
and yet you crossed the line.

499
00:42:12,225 --> 00:42:19,686
How could you find such a disfigured man to slander me here?

500
00:42:22,346 --> 00:42:24,246
Guards.

501
00:42:24,246 --> 00:42:28,826
I want you to take the two rebellious traitors down!

502
00:42:28,826 --> 00:42:35,306
Your Highness, you might as well take a guess whose men are coming in next.

503
00:42:37,145 --> 00:42:38,645
You!

504
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:13,960
