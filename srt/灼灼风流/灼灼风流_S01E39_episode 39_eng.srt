1
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:25,160


2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,459
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:34,980
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:47,879
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,159
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,259
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,479
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,579
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,679
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:18,639
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

12
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:24,100
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,139
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:36,918
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,019
   

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,059
   

17
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:45,039
   

18
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,940
   

19
00:01:51,235 --> 00:01:55,174
 Zhijian, leave for the Barracks of the Capital Region at once. 

20
00:01:56,174 --> 00:02:00,373
 Zhimo, you'll monitor Roujia's every move. 
   

21
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:39,835
Official Shen, my wealth and life are all in your hands.

22
00:02:39,835 --> 00:02:41,273
Don't worry.

23
00:02:41,274 --> 00:02:44,374
When the deed is done, you and your family will be safe.

24
00:02:44,374 --> 00:02:46,215
Thank you, Official Shen.

25
00:02:52,795 --> 00:02:55,555
As expected of the Imperial Seal.

26
00:02:55,555 --> 00:02:57,814
It is indeed extraordinary.

27
00:03:05,075 --> 00:03:07,155
It's all thanks to you.

28
00:03:38,795 --> 00:03:43,055
I look forward to seeing you don the dragon robe.

29
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:47,710
   

30
00:03:57,315 --> 00:03:58,815
Come in.

31
00:04:01,035 --> 00:04:02,835
Your Highness.

32
00:04:07,075 --> 00:04:10,115
Official Shen is here, too.

33
00:04:17,794 --> 00:04:20,834
Official Zhou, have a seat.

34
00:04:30,955 --> 00:04:33,314
Official Shen is a Master Scholar.

35
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:36,095
You are talented indeed.

36
00:04:36,095 --> 00:04:40,795
The nursery rhyme you wrote is catchy and well-written.

37
00:04:43,394 --> 00:04:45,874
However, for someone as promising as you,

38
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,614
the leader of the poor and humble scholars,

39
00:04:48,614 --> 00:04:52,840
to write such a pandering nursery rhyme,

40
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,770
isn't that a waste of your talent?

41
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:05,434
What?

42
00:05:05,434 --> 00:05:08,314
Just because I am a Master Scholar and I am the leader of the poor and humble scholars,

43
00:05:08,314 --> 00:05:10,635
I am not allowed to write nursery rhymes?

44
00:05:11,675 --> 00:05:16,115
Based on that logic, you aren't even qualified

45
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:19,094
to step foot inside this Wenzheng Parlor.

46
00:05:20,394 --> 00:05:21,793
How dare you!

47
00:05:21,794 --> 00:05:23,394
Enough.

48
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:31,975
Official Shen, Official Zhou is reputable and highly respected.

49
00:05:31,975 --> 00:05:33,875
He is your senior.

50
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,235
Be polite.

51
00:05:45,394 --> 00:05:47,255
Your Highness has spoken.

52
00:05:47,255 --> 00:05:50,335
I will, of course, obey.

53
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:03,054
Liu Yan is dead.

54
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:06,053
The one sitting on the throne does not have the hearts of the people.

55
00:06:06,053 --> 00:06:08,913
It's only a matter of time before everyone abandons him.

56
00:06:08,914 --> 00:06:13,594
May I know when Your Highness intends to act?

57
00:06:14,195 --> 00:06:16,415
We need one more push.

58
00:06:16,415 --> 00:06:20,815
- Then… 
 - But that will happen tonight.

59
00:06:23,234 --> 00:06:24,955
Go back and prepare.

60
00:06:24,955 --> 00:06:27,054
Rest assured, Your Highness.

61
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:28,774
The imperial guards of the Zhou family are all ready.

62
00:06:28,774 --> 00:06:32,294
We only await your order.

63
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:15,114
You've developed quite a temper lately.

64
00:07:18,215 --> 00:07:21,394
Do you truly care about how I feel?

65
00:07:25,415 --> 00:07:27,875
This is only a temporary measure.

66
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:34,715
Zhou Cishan and the Zhou family behind him are merely pieces on the board.

67
00:07:39,755 --> 00:07:42,675
I've never forgotten our aspiration.

68
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:45,194
When I am crowned,

69
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:48,895
I will eliminate all the noble families

70
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:53,034
and restore prosperity to Southern Chen.

71
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:10,460
   

72
00:08:23,714 --> 00:08:26,273
You are beautiful indeed, Jing'an.

73
00:08:26,274 --> 00:08:28,374
I can't help but feel adoration for you.

74
00:08:29,315 --> 00:08:32,794
You entered without even knocking.

75
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:35,135
Is this what you call manners?

76
00:08:35,135 --> 00:08:37,375
Perhaps you've forgotten, Jing'an.

77
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,614
This is my residence.

78
00:08:43,474 --> 00:08:46,014
You're drunk. Why did you come here?

79
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,575
Then, guess.

80
00:08:50,575 --> 00:08:53,154
Who did I drink with?

81
00:08:57,114 --> 00:08:59,715
So you came to gloat.

82
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,614
But don't let it get to your head yet.

83
00:09:03,614 --> 00:09:07,035
You might not have Shen Jinghong's heart yet.

84
00:09:11,095 --> 00:09:15,795
I carefully selected these South Sea pearls

85
00:09:15,795 --> 00:09:17,934
as a gift for you.

86
00:09:22,234 --> 00:09:24,174
Why did you throw it away?

87
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:31,454
I genuinely wonder.

88
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:34,353
Are you so used to pretending? Will you die if you stop pretending?

89
00:09:34,354 --> 00:09:38,995
Why bother putting up the airs of some noble holy maiden before me?

90
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,295
You're just a serpent under human skin.

91
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:44,734
I've seen through you.

92
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:46,775
Necklace? Gift?

93
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,395
I don't want it.

94
00:09:49,395 --> 00:09:51,654
It will dirty my neck.

95
00:09:52,714 --> 00:09:57,875
I think that this unique necklace...

96
00:09:58,795 --> 00:10:00,694
suits you well.

97
00:10:00,694 --> 00:10:02,895
Don't you understand what I said?

98
00:10:06,415 --> 00:10:11,394
The pearls are uniform in size, lustrous, and of excellent color.

99
00:10:12,175 --> 00:10:14,595
But the most precious of all...

100
00:10:15,534 --> 00:10:18,015
is the thread used to string these pearls.

101
00:10:18,015 --> 00:10:21,034
It is made from invulnerable gold thread.

102
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:23,315
It's worth a fortune.

103
00:10:25,315 --> 00:10:27,975
You think it will dirty your neck.

104
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:30,534
Now, that's unnecessary.

105
00:10:32,994 --> 00:10:37,274
It will only strangle you.

106
00:11:04,195 --> 00:11:05,895
You saw it.

107
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,634
Feeling sorry for her?

108
00:11:31,395 --> 00:11:33,534
I just feel that it's a shame...

109
00:11:34,614 --> 00:11:37,634
about those precious South Sea pearls.

110
00:11:45,595 --> 00:11:47,935
My hand hurts.

111
00:12:04,714 --> 00:12:10,394
Let me bear all your pain and suffering from now on.

112
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,555
Come in.

113
00:12:23,555 --> 00:12:25,055
Official Mu.

114
00:12:26,475 --> 00:12:30,215
There's an extra lantern in front of the Xiaoqin Pleasure House.

115
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:37,194
This is a good idea, Official Zhou.

116
00:12:37,195 --> 00:12:39,775
It's better to consider it carefully in the long run.

117
00:13:39,594 --> 00:13:40,934
 Don't worry. 

118
00:13:40,934 --> 00:13:45,075
 I will protect what you wish to protect. 

119
00:13:46,085 --> 00:13:52,010
   

120
00:13:53,134 --> 00:13:57,074
Your Majesty!  Something bad has happened!

121
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,755
Terrible news, Your Majesty!

122
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:05,955
In… In the moat,

123
00:14:05,955 --> 00:14:07,594
they found…

124
00:14:07,594 --> 00:14:09,614
What was found?

125
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,234
What did they find?

126
00:14:13,234 --> 00:14:16,614
Princess Jing'an's body.

127
00:14:28,414 --> 00:14:30,954
Who dared to do this?

128
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:33,954
Find the culprit!

129
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:35,873
Get to the bottom of this!

130
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:36,914
Go now!

131
00:14:36,915 --> 00:14:38,215
Yes.

132
00:14:53,795 --> 00:14:55,914
 Yemu Jing is coming. 

133
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:17,594
The South Sea pearl hairpin Official Shen gave you is exquisite.

134
00:15:17,594 --> 00:15:21,474
It complements your outfit so well.

135
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,870
   

136
00:16:33,915 --> 00:16:38,473
Why would Yemu Jing lead the Northern Liang Army into the borders of Southern Chen?

137
00:16:38,473 --> 00:16:41,415
And he's doing itin the name of avenging Yemu Zhen no less!

138
00:16:41,415 --> 00:16:44,955
He has surrounded the Barracks of the Capital Region.

139
00:16:44,994 --> 00:16:47,674
How long has it been since Yemu Zhen died?

140
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:52,401
Did the Northern Liang Army fall from the sky?

141
00:16:58,155 --> 00:16:59,655
Well?

142
00:17:01,035 --> 00:17:03,275
Are all of you mute? Answer me!

143
00:17:14,635 --> 00:17:18,473
Zhou Cishan, what use are you as the Minister of War?

144
00:17:18,474 --> 00:17:20,914
The Northern Liang Army has already reached the capital!

145
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,974
Are you blind?

146
00:17:22,974 --> 00:17:25,014
Have your eyes gone blind?

147
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:34,214
Your Majesty, I do not know.

148
00:17:34,214 --> 00:17:35,693
You do not know?

149
00:17:35,693 --> 00:17:37,594
What do you know, then?

150
00:17:55,635 --> 00:17:57,354
Your Majesty, the only way to stabilize the solution

151
00:17:57,355 --> 00:18:00,354
is to send respected generals to the Barracks of the Capital Region

152
00:18:00,355 --> 00:18:02,954
to control the situation and order the Capital Governor

153
00:18:02,955 --> 00:18:04,834
to search for the Northern Liang people hiding in the capital

154
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:06,874
so as not to harm the innocent.

155
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,715
Send generals?

156
00:18:09,314 --> 00:18:11,014
Who?

157
00:18:12,955 --> 00:18:18,734
Those from the Ministry of War don't even know how the Northern Liang Army got in.

158
00:18:20,675 --> 00:18:22,375
Useless.

159
00:18:23,714 --> 00:18:26,475
A bunch of useless things!

160
00:18:28,354 --> 00:18:30,594
Useless!

161
00:18:31,835 --> 00:18:33,475
 Bad news! 

162
00:18:33,475 --> 00:18:36,353
Bad news! Bad news!

163
00:18:36,955 --> 00:18:38,495
This is bad, Your Majesty!

164
00:18:38,495 --> 00:18:41,513
A large group of poor and humble scholars are gathered outside the palace.

165
00:18:41,513 --> 00:18:45,235
They're all dressed in mourning clothes,

166
00:18:45,235 --> 00:18:48,180
kneeling and shouting…

167
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,810
Tell me!

168
00:18:52,395 --> 00:18:54,235
They're kneeling and shouting,

169
00:18:54,235 --> 00:18:56,953
"An incompetent ruler is in power. The Imperial Seal is lost.

170
00:18:56,953 --> 00:19:00,195
The state is on the brink of destruction."

171
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:09,834
How dare they!

172
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:13,135
They've all turned against me!

173
00:19:24,355 --> 00:19:26,015
 The Imperial Seal is missing? 

174
00:19:26,714 --> 00:19:30,133
 The Imperial Seal is the symbol of Southern Chen. 

175
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:33,173
 That's right. How can it be misplaced? 

176
00:19:37,675 --> 00:19:42,195
Are you my subjects or their subjects?

177
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,055
You are so easily shaken.

178
00:19:45,055 --> 00:19:46,755
What?

179
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:49,994
Do all of you intend to rebel?

180
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:55,674
Your Majesty, the rumors are spreading.

181
00:19:55,674 --> 00:19:59,933
Why not bring forth the Imperial Seal for us to see?

182
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:05,635
So that we may cease the rumors and end the scholars' doubts.

183
00:20:10,234 --> 00:20:12,495
Is that what you all think?

184
00:20:21,794 --> 00:20:23,594
All right.

185
00:20:23,594 --> 00:20:26,595
I will show all of you

186
00:20:26,595 --> 00:20:31,414
that I am the rightful Emperor of Southern Chen.

187
00:20:54,835 --> 00:20:57,653
Go. Bring me the Imperial Seal.

188
00:20:58,635 --> 00:21:01,174
Your Majesty, this…

189
00:21:05,155 --> 00:21:06,653
Your Majesty! Have mercy, Your Majesty!

190
00:21:06,653 --> 00:21:10,334
Have mercy, Your Majesty! Have mercy, Your Majesty!

191
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:15,533
Please forgive me, Your Majesty!

192
00:21:16,155 --> 00:21:19,155
Your Majesty…

193
00:21:24,115 --> 00:21:28,154
Have mercy, Your Majesty!

194
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:30,895
Your Majesty… Your Majesty…

195
00:21:44,974 --> 00:21:47,114
The Imperial Seal is lost.

196
00:21:47,115 --> 00:21:51,855
Your Majesty, for the sake of Southern Chen,

197
00:21:52,635 --> 00:21:54,714
please abdicate the throne in favor of the virtuous.

198
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:59,534
 Your Majesty, for the sake of Southern Chen, 

199
00:21:59,534 --> 00:22:02,354
 please abdicate the throne in favor of the virtuous. 

200
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,260
   

201
00:23:02,635 --> 00:23:04,435
Official Zhou,

202
00:23:04,435 --> 00:23:06,513
in the midst of internal and external troubles,

203
00:23:06,514 --> 00:23:08,513
not only do you not ease His Majesty's burdens,

204
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:10,233
but instead, you are forcing His Majesty to abdicate.

205
00:23:10,234 --> 00:23:12,134
What are your intentions?

206
00:23:12,134 --> 00:23:15,995
Do you really intend to rebel?

207
00:23:22,395 --> 00:23:24,254
Official Mu,

208
00:23:24,794 --> 00:23:27,594
how can you accuse me of so?

209
00:23:27,595 --> 00:23:31,014
I am doing this for the sake of Southern Chen.

210
00:23:31,014 --> 00:23:32,993
The ruler is incompetent.

211
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,674
The people's grievances are resounding.

212
00:23:35,674 --> 00:23:39,914
Even the Imperial Seal is nowhere to be found.

213
00:23:39,914 --> 00:23:42,354
This is Heaven's will!

214
00:23:45,395 --> 00:23:51,454
Official Mu, have you forgotten about Prince Regent, who died an unjust death in prison?

215
00:24:06,335 --> 00:24:11,435
   

216
00:25:04,314 --> 00:25:07,233
What benefits did this fatuous and self-indulgent ruler offer you

217
00:25:07,234 --> 00:25:11,314
to make you betray the light and turn to the dark side?

218
00:25:11,314 --> 00:25:14,614
It seems like you're the one who did that, Official Zhou.

219
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:16,935
The Northern Liang Army is upon the territory of Southern Chen.

220
00:25:16,935 --> 00:25:19,313
Yet, you are ignorant of everything that is happening.

221
00:25:19,314 --> 00:25:24,875
Is Yemu Jing your new master?

222
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:26,934
Lies and slander!

223
00:25:26,934 --> 00:25:29,495
I am loyal to the country!

224
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:32,555
I would never collude with the likes of Northern Liang!

225
00:25:47,955 --> 00:25:49,895
A country cannot be without a ruler.

226
00:25:49,895 --> 00:25:52,695
His Majesty is the direct descendant of the Liu Clan.

227
00:25:52,695 --> 00:25:54,553
Yet, you are forcing him to abdicate in front of the court.

228
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:57,434
Aren't you doing this to make things easier for Yemu Jing?

229
00:25:57,435 --> 00:25:59,235
You…

230
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:07,055
I, too, am a direct descendant of Liu.

231
00:26:40,955 --> 00:26:44,455
Sister, you...

232
00:26:45,735 --> 00:26:47,975
First Princess,

233
00:26:47,994 --> 00:26:50,413
you dared to steal the Imperial Seal?

234
00:26:50,413 --> 00:26:51,834
You killed Yemu Zhen?

235
00:26:51,835 --> 00:26:56,274
You let the Northern Liang Army into the Barracks of the Capital Region. Right?

236
00:27:01,475 --> 00:27:04,374
In order to fulfill your ambition,

237
00:27:05,255 --> 00:27:09,055
you colluded with Northern Liang and let the enemies in.

238
00:27:12,055 --> 00:27:17,255
Zhuohua, I appreciate your talent.

239
00:27:17,255 --> 00:27:20,055
A wise bird chooses its tree to nest.

240
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:24,814
It's not too late for you to turn back from your misguided path.

241
00:27:27,254 --> 00:27:34,214
Sister, what Official Mu said is not true. Right?

242
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:44,555
Please abdicate, Your Majesty.

243
00:28:19,134 --> 00:28:22,614
Princess Roujia is the eldest daughter of the late emperor.

244
00:28:22,614 --> 00:28:25,474
She is loved and respected by the people.

245
00:28:25,474 --> 00:28:31,114
She is as wise and capable as the late Empress Yuanguang.

246
00:28:32,654 --> 00:28:35,815
I am willing to support Princess Roujia as Empress,

247
00:28:35,815 --> 00:28:39,474
to heed Heaven's will and assure the people.

248
00:28:42,575 --> 00:28:44,454
Please abdicate, Your Majesty.

249
00:28:44,454 --> 00:28:51,035
 Please abdicate the throne to Princess Roujia, Your Majesty. 

250
00:29:13,374 --> 00:29:19,474
Zhuohua, look. This is the emperor you serve.

251
00:29:19,474 --> 00:29:22,114
Look at how weak and pathetic he is.

252
00:29:22,114 --> 00:29:24,794
He doesn't deserve to be a ruler.

253
00:29:28,155 --> 00:29:30,114
You and I are both women.

254
00:29:30,115 --> 00:29:33,135
You should understand me.

255
00:29:33,135 --> 00:29:39,015
Why do you refuse to side with me and create a prosperous Southern Chen?

256
00:29:42,335 --> 00:29:46,435
Your Highness, I've told you.

257
00:29:47,435 --> 00:29:49,615
You and I are not the same.

258
00:29:51,094 --> 00:29:54,474
My path may be laden with thorns now,

259
00:29:54,474 --> 00:29:59,335
but my future is destined to be bright.

260
00:30:00,255 --> 00:30:02,195
But your path...

261
00:30:03,654 --> 00:30:06,014
will only be shrouded in darkness.

262
00:30:07,234 --> 00:30:09,614
So stubborn.

263
00:30:19,074 --> 00:30:25,814
Please abdicate the throne to Princess Roujia, Your Majesty.

264
00:30:47,415 --> 00:30:50,713
Chen'er, the outcome has been decided.

265
00:30:50,714 --> 00:30:53,874
Why covet a position that doesn't belong to you?

266
00:30:54,955 --> 00:30:57,374
If you know what's good for you,

267
00:30:57,395 --> 00:31:02,774
I will spare you and let you live a carefree life as a wealthy noble.

268
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:14,655
Sister,

269
00:31:16,314 --> 00:31:18,514
must you do this?

270
00:31:22,074 --> 00:31:24,975
Please abdicate, Your Majesty.

271
00:31:27,255 --> 00:31:30,855
 Please abdicate, Your Majesty. 

272
00:32:00,155 --> 00:32:03,055
Prince Regent! It's Prince Regent!

273
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:05,374
The Prince Regent is alive!

274
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,610
   

275
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:33,815
Surrender, and you will live.

276
00:32:33,815 --> 00:32:38,255
Resist, and you will be shown no mercy!

277
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:57,200
   

278
00:34:06,855 --> 00:34:10,495
Prince Regent, you are blessed indeed.

279
00:34:10,495 --> 00:34:13,415
But you've managed to save your life.

280
00:34:13,415 --> 00:34:16,774
Why did you come here to die?

281
00:34:16,774 --> 00:34:19,955
Official Zhou, why are you doing this?

282
00:34:21,055 --> 00:34:22,895
Your ancestors were all capable

283
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:26,675
and distinguished ministers whose names will be remembered throughout history.

284
00:34:26,675 --> 00:34:34,074
But you will end up an infamous and disloyal traitor in history.

285
00:34:34,074 --> 00:34:38,615
How my name will go down in history is not something

286
00:34:38,615 --> 00:34:41,355
for you to be concerned about, Prince Regent.

287
00:34:41,355 --> 00:34:43,335
The outcome has been decided.

288
00:34:43,335 --> 00:34:46,534
You will die with this fatuous and self-indulgent ruler.

289
00:34:47,395 --> 00:34:53,255
That's right. The outcome has been decided.

290
00:34:53,255 --> 00:34:56,894
Zhou Cishan, you are the Minister of War,

291
00:34:56,894 --> 00:35:00,174
but you will not be able to use your treacherous heart

292
00:35:00,174 --> 00:35:03,515
to waver the loyalty of our courageous troops.

293
00:35:03,515 --> 00:35:09,154
You think the rebels got in so easily because of your strategy?

294
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,795
It was His Majesty and I who wanted

295
00:35:13,795 --> 00:35:16,655
to lure you people out from the shadows.

296
00:35:16,655 --> 00:35:19,195
The rebels you let in

297
00:35:19,195 --> 00:35:23,274
have all been suppressed by the Cangwu Army.

298
00:35:23,274 --> 00:35:26,015
Impossible! That is not possible!

299
00:35:26,015 --> 00:35:32,335
Zhou Cishan, are you still counting on Yemu Jing's reinforcements?

300
00:35:33,415 --> 00:35:36,995
Zhijian has already seized control of the Barracks of the Capital Region.

301
00:35:36,995 --> 00:35:43,634
Yemu Jing is probably in a precarious situation himself.

302
00:35:43,634 --> 00:35:47,995
 The Imperial Seal has arrived! 

303
00:36:01,194 --> 00:36:04,794
 Your Majesty, there is no need to hide it from me. 

304
00:36:04,794 --> 00:36:09,535
 I thought it was strange that you two were arguing so often. 

305
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:15,955
 You must've been working together for a long time now. 

306
00:36:15,955 --> 00:36:19,354
 You deliberately created a false impression of discord 

307
00:36:19,354 --> 00:36:22,594
 so that Her Highness would think that her plan of turning you two against each other had succeeded. 

308
00:36:22,594 --> 00:36:26,015
 To obtain something, you must first give something. 

309
00:36:26,015 --> 00:36:28,054
 Indeed, it is a wise strategy. 

310
00:36:28,955 --> 00:36:31,355
 This was His Lordship's idea, wasn't it? 

311
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,794
 So you know everything. 

312
00:36:37,755 --> 00:36:39,954
 Uncle didn't mean to keep you in the dark. 

313
00:36:39,955 --> 00:36:43,074
 - He… 
 - Your Majesty, intentional or not, 

314
00:36:43,074 --> 00:36:46,955
 I will settle this matter with His Lordship at a later time. 

315
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:52,954
 But for now, our priority is to continue the act that you two have set up. 

316
00:36:52,954 --> 00:36:56,335
 Princess Roujia's prestige is on the rise. 

317
00:36:56,335 --> 00:36:58,834
 She is only one step away from the throne, 

318
00:36:58,834 --> 00:37:02,034
 and that step is legitimate authority. 

319
00:37:02,034 --> 00:37:04,694
 In my humble opinion, 

320
00:37:04,694 --> 00:37:09,794
 Her Highness's next move will surely be to get her hands on the Imperial Seal. 

321
00:37:13,855 --> 00:37:16,335
 If she acquires the Imperial Seal, 

322
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:20,154
 then, at the very least, on the surface, she has reason and legitimacy. 

323
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:22,395
 She will act under the will of Heaven. 

324
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:27,793
 It will complement her title as the reincarnation of Empress Yuanguang. 

325
00:37:29,795 --> 00:37:32,534
 Of course, we mustn't let her obtain the real Imperial Seal. 

326
00:37:32,534 --> 00:37:36,415
 So what you're suggesting is to replace the real seal with a fake? 

327
00:37:36,415 --> 00:37:39,135
 Let her think that she has succeeded 

328
00:37:39,135 --> 00:37:41,535
 so that her ambitions will be completely exposed. 

329
00:37:41,535 --> 00:37:45,875
 Precisely. But this is a grave matter. 

330
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:49,374
 We will need Your Majesty's approval before we proceed. 

331
00:37:58,114 --> 00:38:00,690
 Your Majesty, this… 

332
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:04,170
 I ordered you to make the switch. What have you got to fear? 

333
00:38:04,755 --> 00:38:06,080
 I… 

334
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,370
 Chief Eunuch, we're just switching the real with a fake. 

335
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:12,933
 Official Mu, you make it sound so easy. 

336
00:38:12,933 --> 00:38:15,754
 This is the Imperial Seal! 

337
00:38:15,755 --> 00:38:21,654
 Chief Eunuch, if the seal is lost, then you, as the Chief Steward, will not escape responsibility. 

338
00:38:21,654 --> 00:38:25,995
 Losing the Imperial Seal surely is worse than replacing it. Right? 

339
00:38:25,995 --> 00:38:30,214
 - I… 
 - Well, isn't that the case? 

340
00:38:30,214 --> 00:38:34,155
 That is true, but… 

341
00:38:49,755 --> 00:38:51,255
Seize them.

342
00:39:26,395 --> 00:39:30,695
Sister, give up.

343
00:39:30,695 --> 00:39:33,575
Out of consideration for our relationship,

344
00:39:34,355 --> 00:39:38,414
I will definitely show you grace.

345
00:39:44,554 --> 00:39:46,454
It was you!

346
00:39:49,994 --> 00:39:52,634
You betrayed me!

347
00:39:58,235 --> 00:40:00,035
 That Shen Jinghong. 

348
00:40:00,035 --> 00:40:03,874
 Since he doesn't know what's good for him, then don't blame me 

349
00:40:03,874 --> 00:40:06,455
 for disregarding our tie as graduates of the same batch. 

350
00:40:13,385 --> 00:40:16,435
   

351
00:40:17,235 --> 00:40:19,555
 Zhuohua, come in quickly. 

352
00:40:33,795 --> 00:40:37,094
 You had me lose Her Highness's spies 

353
00:40:37,094 --> 00:40:38,994
 to come here and see you. 

354
00:40:39,674 --> 00:40:41,655
 Why? 

355
00:40:41,655 --> 00:40:43,655
 You're already here. 

356
00:40:44,835 --> 00:40:47,235
 Why are you asking knowingly? 

357
00:40:48,335 --> 00:40:52,215
 I know you have ambitions, Brother Shen. 

358
00:40:53,274 --> 00:40:58,754
 You wish for a clean court, a fresh environment, and assisting the wise ruler. 

359
00:40:58,755 --> 00:41:03,554
 But is this the Southern Chen you wish to see? 

360
00:41:04,435 --> 00:41:06,235
 Or rather, 

361
00:41:07,295 --> 00:41:10,435
 when Her Highness takes over the crown, 

362
00:41:11,114 --> 00:41:13,094
 will the court of that time... 

363
00:41:15,355 --> 00:41:18,274
 become what you wish to see? 

364
00:41:19,034 --> 00:41:20,994
 Is she still the princess... 

365
00:41:21,795 --> 00:41:25,215
 you've always wanted to follow? 

366
00:41:27,915 --> 00:41:30,015
 What's the use of apologies?) 

367
00:41:32,014 --> 00:41:34,834
 Will apologies do anything to help now? 

368
00:42:16,355 --> 00:42:18,155
 Mu Zhuohua. 

369
00:42:30,085 --> 00:42:34,035
   

370
00:42:55,515 --> 00:42:57,315
It was me.

371
00:43:21,915 --> 00:43:23,615
Your Highness,

372
00:43:25,635 --> 00:43:27,535
stop this.

373
00:43:28,395 --> 00:43:30,374
Stop?

374
00:43:31,634 --> 00:43:34,374
Why should I?

375
00:43:35,835 --> 00:43:37,794
The incapable ruler is in power.

376
00:43:37,794 --> 00:43:40,073
I am doing this for the people of Southern Chen!

377
00:43:40,074 --> 00:43:42,494
I have done nothing wrong!

378
00:43:45,154 --> 00:43:46,854
It's you.

379
00:43:49,315 --> 00:43:51,215
It's you!

380
00:43:51,215 --> 00:43:54,875
You're the ones who are aiding and abetting tyranny!

381
00:43:58,955 --> 00:44:01,095
For the people?

382
00:44:07,514 --> 00:44:13,214
Sister, you colluded with the Zhou family to fabricate seven severe crimes

383
00:44:13,214 --> 00:44:15,534
to falsely accuse Uncle.

384
00:44:17,235 --> 00:44:19,455
Is this what you mean by doing it...

385
00:44:21,235 --> 00:44:23,494
"for the people"?

386
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:35,515
Extortion, oppression, and embezzlement of military funds,

387
00:44:35,515 --> 00:44:37,915
these are all crimes of the Zhou family.

388
00:44:38,835 --> 00:44:43,234
But you pinned all the blame on Uncle instead.

389
00:44:44,355 --> 00:44:47,394
You are the most despicable.

390
00:44:52,395 --> 00:44:54,114
Mobilizing troops without authorization.

391
00:44:54,114 --> 00:44:57,214
Those are all Uncle's personal guards.

392
00:44:57,214 --> 00:44:59,375
They are not part of the military.

393
00:45:00,194 --> 00:45:02,795
That accusation does not hold water.

394
00:45:02,795 --> 00:45:05,153
Assembling one's personal army and challenging authority.

395
00:45:05,154 --> 00:45:08,955
Uncle's military authority was entrusted to him by the late emperor.

396
00:45:08,955 --> 00:45:14,214
You are questioning the will of the late emperor.

397
00:45:16,114 --> 00:45:20,194
As for disrespecting the emperor and treason,

398
00:45:20,194 --> 00:45:24,154
those are all part of the plan Uncle and I designed.

399
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:30,474
All to expose you of your crimes today.

400
00:45:32,835 --> 00:45:34,335
Sister,

401
00:45:35,235 --> 00:45:39,974
you framed the loyal and righteous and disregarded ethics.

402
00:45:40,835 --> 00:45:43,454
Are you doing it for the people

403
00:45:43,454 --> 00:45:46,615
or for your own ambition?

404
00:45:49,835 --> 00:45:51,715
Ambition?

405
00:45:53,915 --> 00:45:56,975
From the moment you were born,

406
00:45:56,975 --> 00:45:59,095
you've been noble and blessed.

407
00:46:00,315 --> 00:46:02,315
But what about me?

408
00:46:06,275 --> 00:46:08,774
For your prestigious mother,

409
00:46:08,774 --> 00:46:11,294
for the noble you,

410
00:46:11,294 --> 00:46:14,215
should my mother deserve to die?

411
00:46:18,154 --> 00:46:21,254
Just because we had no power to rely on,

412
00:46:21,254 --> 00:46:27,055
should our lives be at your mercy like ants?

413
00:46:34,235 --> 00:46:36,274
My foolish brother,

414
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,775
without your supreme power,

415
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:45,354
how can you have the audacity...

416
00:46:46,114 --> 00:46:49,894
to behave so arrogantly in front of me?

417
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:12,980


418
00:47:17,262 --> 00:47:24,621
♫  I can't forget the love that is still is nipping at my ears and temples  ♫

419
00:47:24,621 --> 00:47:31,921
♫  Memories keep slamming into rocks and have nowhere to berth  ♫

420
00:47:31,921 --> 00:47:39,361
♫  Both sides gaze at each other in the drizzling rain, but one has turned into clouds and mist  ♫

421
00:47:39,361 --> 00:47:47,881
♫  Leaving the isolated heart's island, like waves without a shore  ♫

422
00:47:47,881 --> 00:47:51,521
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

423
00:47:51,521 --> 00:47:55,281
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

424
00:47:55,281 --> 00:47:59,201
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

425
00:47:59,201 --> 00:48:02,681
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

426
00:48:02,682 --> 00:48:06,201
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

427
00:48:06,202 --> 00:48:09,921
♫  Obviously willing to swear life and death 
 to be entangled for a lifetime  ♫

428
00:48:09,922 --> 00:48:14,221
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

429
00:48:14,221 --> 00:48:20,622
♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

430
00:48:33,522 --> 00:48:41,121
♫  I can't forget the turmoil of love and hate, 
 even if the next day is far away  ♫

431
00:48:41,121 --> 00:48:49,681
♫  Two souls embrace in chaos, how can it be written off?  ♫

432
00:48:49,681 --> 00:48:53,361
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

433

♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

437
00:49:08,021 --> 00:49:11,701
♫  Obviously can't be erased, and haunted by lingering dreams  ♫

438
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:15,781
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

439
00:49:15,781 --> 00:49:23,562
