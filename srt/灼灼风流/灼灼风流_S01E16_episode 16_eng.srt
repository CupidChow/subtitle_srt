17
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:44,939
   

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,039
   

19
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:50,730
   

20
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,410
   
 (An outstanding beauty) 

21
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,880
Gentlemen, it wasn't us who couldn't afford to lose, but Southern Chen.

22
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,879
Northern Liang will definitely win.

23
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,100
 Northern Liang will triumph! 

24
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,280
Lord Ding, you came uninvited and disrupted our merriment.

25
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,760
Is this how Southern Chen treats its guests?

26
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,540
Why?

27
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,999
Prince Yemu, you were usually keen to see

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,740
if I would still be good at drinking and combat.

29
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,420
I have specially come to invite you for a drink today.

30
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,540
Yet, you seem disinterested.

31
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,220
Ladies, let's go.

32
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,720
Prince Yemu,

33
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,980
don't you want to ask why I've come to you today?

34
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,720
I would never imagine...

35
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,480
there would be a day when you and I would share a drink like this.

36
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,320
You were poisoned with Yuanluo Flower.

37
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,580
Yet, you managed to survive.

38
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,520
Southern Chen is vast

39
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,860
and filled with countless skilled physicians.

40
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,660
The mere Yuanluo Flower poison is nothing.

41
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,700
Seeing that I'm still alive,

42
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,840
it must be truly disappointing to you.

43
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,680
Why would I be disappointed?

44
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,660
I'm only a little surprised.

45
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,519
I've always thought the generals of Southern Chen were valiant

46
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,820
and would rather die than be dishonored.

47
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,999
However, you shamelessly live until today

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,740
when all your trusted elite soldiers perished long ago.

49
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,420
When we faced each other back then,

50
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,400
I saw you bravely slaying enemies without regard for your life.

51
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,160
But now,

52
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,520
you value your life so much, Lord Ding.

53
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,920
Prince Yemu,

54
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,240
have you ever tasted human blood?

55
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,180
You've asked the right person.

56
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,780
Of course, I have.

57
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,860
Me too.

58
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,200
It was scalding hot,

59
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,420
carrying the scent of iron and rust.

60
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,300
He was my subordinate and my mentor.

61
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,320
I remember from the first day I joined the army, it was him...

62
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,680
who led me and guided me.

63
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,360
At that time,

64
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,600
he cut his own wrist.

65
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,780
He squeezed my cheek,

66
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,760
and his blood flowed into my mouth.

67
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,800
When his blood had cooled down, another comrade came.

68
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,960
On the battlefield, he could entrust his back to me.

69
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,620
 In the face of life and death, he chose to entrust his life to me. 

70
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,340
 After that, I lost consciousness. 

71
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,100
 I can't recall... 

72
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,700
how many of them had offered their blood and lives to me.

73
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,160
Prince Yemu,

74
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,160
if you carried the weight of so many lives on your shoulders,

75
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,240
you wouldn't be willing to die either.

76
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,860
You've seen through my strategy...

77
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,380
and laid an ambush for me.

78
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,500
Someone within the army must have tipped you off.

79
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,180
And this person holds a high position.

80
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,180
Later,

81
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,760
I was unconscious with severe injuries.

82
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,220
The morale of our army was low.

83
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,920
But you didn't seize the opportunity to launch a counterattack...

84
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,279
and achieve a major victory by attacking us from both sides.

85
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,000
This could have been used as a bargaining chip

86
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,900
to negotiate for more favorable terms.

87
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,480
So I believe the person...

88
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,260
who tipped you off wasn't under your control.

89
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,300
It's even possible...

90
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,640
that you don't know who that person was.

91
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,520
Prince Yemu, let's make a deal.

92
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,060
If you tell me everything you know,

93
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:30,140
I promise not to invade Northern Liang for ten years.

94
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,420
What kind of deal is this?

95
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,640
Do you think I'll be afraid if you invade us?

96
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,800
Well, I believe you will be afraid.

97
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,600
Lord Ding didn't age as you hoped.

98
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:02,800
And our First Prince is young and hostile toward Northern Liang.

99
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,820
Moreover, Your Highness...

100
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,980
seems eager to return to Northern Liang.

101
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,720
What do you mean?

102
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,939
Has something significant happened in the royal camp of Northern Liang?

103
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:27,360
Or else, why would you be in such a hurry to pack your belongings?

104
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,600
You're currently here.

105
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,680
Inside the royal camp, only the First Prince and the Second Prince are present.

106
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,560
This is a very unfavorable situation for you.

107
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,279
Lord Ding, since you are so magnanimous,

108
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,660
I might as well make a deal with you.

109
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,200
The person who tipped me off...

110
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,900
was Xue Xiaotang.

111
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,580
He has been hiding in Northern Liang.

112
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:34,820
Up until this peace negotiation, he disguised himself as a mute slave and stayed by my side.

113
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,240
Lord Ding,

114
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:43,800
are you satisfied with this great gift?

115
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,459
My Lord, it's clear that Yemu Jing doesn't really want to make a deal.

116
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:09,860
But he wants to disrupt Southern Chen's internal affairs on purpose.

117
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,660
You've also noticed that?

118
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,680
This person is ambitious and is not someone who advocates peace.

119
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,460
I don't trust him.

120
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,960
He wants to return and fight for power with two of his elder brothers.

121
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,799
But he can't let Southern Chen become stronger.

122
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,640
That's why he mentioned Xue Xiaotang,

123
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,880
hoping to sow discord within Southern Chen.

124
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,100
But how could I grant his wish?

125
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,226
My Lord, I'm glad you're sensible about this.

126
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,600
At least this matter has some initial results.

127
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,939
Now, it seems that Xue Xiaotang is one of the main culprits behind the war at Juma River.

128
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,980
He's the Grand General of the Nation.

129
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,860
In Southern Chen, his prestige was extremely high.

130
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,919
Back then, he went to war with me to fight against Northern Liang.

131
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,720
The reason the Northern Liang Army was able to ambush us unexpectedly

132
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:27,100
must have been because he threatened Yuan Chengming to obtain the marching map,

133
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,840
which led to our defeat.

134
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,520
My Lord, the political scene is clear, and the world is at peace.

135
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:48,939
All hidden matters will eventually come to light as long as you don't give up.

136
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,740
My Lord, you've already done a great job.

137
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,880
What he betrayed was his dignity as a human.

138
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,940
It's not related to you.

139
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,519
The peace negotiation will definitely succeed after today.

140
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,880
I'm genuinely happy for you.

141
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,800
Since I'm done with my task,

142
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,880
I shall take my leave now.

143
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,539
Why are you trying to run off again?

144
00:13:29,539 --> 00:13:31,640
You've been avoiding me lately.

145
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,760
Am I a terrifying beast?

146
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,840
You're not a terrifying beast.

147
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,180
You just make me feel restless.

148
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,360
What?

149
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,819
Nothing. Nothing, My Lord.

150
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:58,040
It's just that I need some quiet time to calm down.

151
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,660
My Lord, farewell.

152
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,020
Restless?

153
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,720
 Why is she avoiding me? 

154
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,430
   

155
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,960
Brother, are you really going back?

156
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,232
If I don't return, I'm afraid I won't even have a chance to compete.

157
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:41,440
But we've gained nothing from this peace negotiation.

158
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,040
I've already lit the fire.

159
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,320
Remember to add fuel to the fire at the right moment.

160
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:55,560
We must let the fire burn hotter and hotter until it's uncontrollable.

161
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,539
Brother, are you talking about the mute slave?

162
00:14:57,539 --> 00:14:59,240
I understand it now.

163
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,560
You've been living comfortably in Southern Chen.

164
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,380
But never forget our people who suffer back home.

165
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,820
I won't forget.

166
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,260
But...

167
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:34,119
As long as we can ignite this fire, the type of fuel doesn't matter. Right?

168
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:35,860
Of course.

169
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:51,239
That scoundrel Yemu Jing has finally dragged himself back to Northern Liang with his lackeys.

170
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,959
You're Southern Chen's Crown Prince.

171
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,040
Mind your language when speaking in public.

172
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,340
If not for Southern Chen's dignity, I would have surely...

173
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,192
knocked his teeth out.

174
00:16:06,193 --> 00:16:10,459
Now that Southern Chen and Northern Liang have formed an alliance and ceased hostilities,

175
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:14,339
the people at the border can finally enjoy peaceful days.

176
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:15,479
You're right.

177
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:21,620
Lord Ding is indeed ingenious to disrupt Yemu Jing's negotiations

178
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,080
by using the King of Northern Liang's illness.

179
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:29,200
By creating this distraction, Yemu Jing became restless and eager to leave.

180
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,859
Surely, he would have to agree to all the conditions proposed by Southern Chen.

181
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:38,200
Lord Ding is truly skilled at making people restless.

182
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,500
Jinghong? Miss Mu?

183
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,740
 Oh, no. What should I do? 

184
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,679
- Greetings, Lord Ding and Your Highness. 
 - Greetings, Lord Ding and Your Highness.

185
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,439
 To block a formidable opponent, 

186
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,660
 I can only seek help from another formidable figure. 

187
00:16:59,193 --> 00:17:02,833
Your Highness, how is your leg injury?

188
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,760
It's a lot better now.

189
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,500
Thank you for asking.

190
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,720
Miss Mu, your medical skills are truly remarkable.

191
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,860
Why have you been avoiding me?

192
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,880
I...

193
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,533
I haven't been avoiding you.

194
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:39,220
Uncle, when has she ever avoided you?

195
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:53,720
By the way, I have something to discuss with you, Miss Mu.

196
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,160
Grandmother had Father remove your teaching position.

197
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,719
His Majesty knows I've been busy entertaining the diplomatic corps and was being considerate of me.

198
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:15,540
That's why His Majesty relieved me from such duties.

199
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,200
Mr. Shen.

200
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,079
I have to discuss an important matter with you.

201
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,820
Come with me.

202
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,080
Your Highness, I'll take my leave for now.

203
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,839
You don't always have to be considerate of others or speak up for others.

204
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,520
Your Highness, I'm flattered.

205
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,320
I'm not a vengeful or ungrateful person.

206
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,040
About the previous incident,

207
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,820
I've misunderstood you.

208
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,519
I also know the teaching position holds great importance for officials.

209
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,820
I've discussed it with Father.

210
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,960
You can return to continue teaching anytime.

211
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,520
Your Highness, you...

212
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,140
What about me?

213
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,679
Your Highness,you treat others sincerely.

214
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,900
It is an honor for me and a blessing for the world.

215
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,140
 So this is the reason why you're distancing yourself from me. 

216
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,220
My Lord, what is it that you wanted to discuss with me?

217
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,660
Never mind. We'll discuss it another day.

218
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,320
Uncle, she complimented me.

219
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,400
Mu Zhuohua said I always treat people sincerely.

220
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,080
When have you not treated people sincerely?

221
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,080
Uncle, you were right.

222
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,160
Mu Zhuohua does have great potential.

223
00:20:41,193 --> 00:20:42,993
She truly understands me.

224
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm not like that two-faced Liu Yu.

225
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,239
During the peace negotiation with Northern Liang, she contributed a lot.

226
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:04,200
So I asked Father to resume Mu Zhuohua's teaching position.

227
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,380
Did she agree?

228
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,340
I think so.

229
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,400
It's not a bad thing, after all.

230
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:24,560
Uncle, Mu Zhuohua found a clue about Yemu Jing's intentions to leave.

231
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,960
Aren't you planning to reward her in some way?

232
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,460
No.

233
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:48,339
"Official Shen Jinghong of the Ministry of Revenue shall be promoted to Primary Fifth-Rank Director.

234
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:53,860
This decree takes effect on the 27th day of the 4th month, the 24th year of the Zhaoming Reign.

235
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,380
Granted by His Majesty."

236
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,540
My thanks for His Majesty's benevolence.

237
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:04,319
"Official Mu Zhuohua of the Ministry of Rites shall be promoted to Primary Sixth-Rank Administrator.

238
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:10,020
This decree takes effect on the 27th day of the 4th month, the 24th year of the Zhaoming Reign.

239
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,020
Granted by His Majesty."

240
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,320
My thanks for His Majesty's benevolence.

241
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,899
Miss Mu, your promotion wouldn't have happened without Lord Ding's support.

242
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,839
I understand.

243
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,299
Thank you for reminding me, sir.

244
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:28,380
You sure pick up fast.

245
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,159
By the way, tomorrow is Lord Ding's rest day.

246
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,839
It's a perfect chance for you to visit and thank him in person.

247
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,440
I will.

248
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:55,040
My Lord, since it's your rest day, why not take a herbal bath later?

249
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,560
All right.

250
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,480
My Lord, Mu wishes to see you.

251
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,100
No.

252
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,860
Yes.

253
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,160
Wait.

254
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,080
Let her in.

255
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,300
Let's see what excuse she'll come up with this time.

256
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,900
Greetings, My Lord.

257
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:57,100
Nowadays, you don't visit me unless there's something important.

258
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,119
I'm here to thank Your Lordship for helping me develop my potential.

259
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,880
But I don't know how to repay you.

260
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,519
I remember you appreciate calligraphy,

261
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,799
and I heard that Wenxin Pavilion had stocked up on a batch of extremely precious ink stones.

262
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,980
So I bought one as a gift for you.

263
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,160
Please accept it, My Lord.

264
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,600
I'm sure you spent a fortune on this.

265
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,420
But it's rare for you to do this.

266
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,839
I feel grateful to you, My Lord.

267
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,920
This ink stone is just a small token of appreciation.

268
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,180
A few days ago,

269
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,960
First Prince mentioned to me about requesting you

270
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,660
to resume your teaching duties.

271
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,540
What are your thoughts?

272
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:15,100
Whether I leave or stay, I shall let Your Lordship and His Highness decide.

273
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:25,380
I already told you not to get involved in the princes' conflicts.

274
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,200
Why won't you remember?

275
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,420
I do remember.

276
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,905
You're aware that First Prince is most likely to succeed to the throne.

277
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:43,559
So you approach him, trying to please him.

278
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:48,419
Haven't you learned your lesson after the fight between the princes back then?

279
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:52,359
If you get close to the First Prince, the other two princes will target you.

280
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:56,840
At that time, your life will always be in danger.

281
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,799
 I know it's dangerous. 

282
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,980
 But I'm more afraid of losing myself because of you. 

283
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,080
My Lord, you're right.

284
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,520
So...

285
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,600
You still insist on resuming your teaching position?

286
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,579
 How can I tell you the reason I want to keep this teaching position is to stay away from him? 

287
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,640
What's the problem?

288
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,400
You don't even dare to answer now?

289
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,100
 I just don't know how to answer. 

290
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,200
 I'm afraid of being troubled by this and affecting my future. 

291
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:44,240
It looks like you've already made up your mind.

292
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,000
- My Lord, I... 
 - Never mind.

293
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,860
You may go now.

294
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,040
I don't want to say anything more.

295
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,960
Young Lady, you're back.

296
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,160
By the way, have you thanked Lord Ding?

297
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,759
I did.

298
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,260
But...

299
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,480
But what?

300
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,319
I get so restless whenever I see him.

301
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,759
My thoughts are all over the place.

302
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,039
I can't understand anything, nor can I do anything well.

303
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,820
Tell me. How would I dare go near him?

304
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,759
Men are so terrifying.

305
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,439
What a distraction to my future.

306
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,319
That won't do, Young Lady.

307
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,559
How could you make Lord Ding angry?

308
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,660
Aren't you afraid your current behavior might affect your future?

309
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,500
He already said he wouldn't blame me.

310
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:30,740
But you don't seem very happy today.

311
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,700
It's because Lord Ding seemed upset.

312
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,080
What should I do?

313
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,359
Young Lady, Lord Ding is a forgiving person.

314
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,520
He won't hold a grudge.

315
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,719
Maybe I should prepare some sincere gifts and visit him tomorrow.

316
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,999
And I'll explain it to him.

317
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,039
It's all my fault.

318
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,220
It's all my fault for being so inept.

319
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,279
Juli, let's go and deliver this to Lord Ding.

320
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:40,080
Young Lady, why isn't there anyone at His Lordship's house?

321
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,580
It seems Lord Ding is truly angry with me.

322
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,620
That's not good.

323
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:55,820
By the way, you used to say that Lord Ding

324
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:59,140
- is a person of... 
 - A person of noble character.

325
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,540
In any case, he's definitely the forgiving type.

326
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,000
I think as long as we show a good attitude, he will forgive us.

327
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,980
Let's go to Lord Ding's residence.

328
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,759
Miss Mu.

329
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:45,860
Miss Mu, I'm not getting in your way on purpose.

330
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:49,020
His Lordship is already resting.

331
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,000
Maybe you can come another day?

332
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,819
All right.

333
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:58,120
Could you please give this to His Lordship?

334
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,159
♫  It's you who stripped me of my armor  ♫

335
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,279
Take care, Miss.

336
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,880
Thank you.

337
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:12,060
♫  Melting into your gaze like snowflakes  ♫

338
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:19,080
♫  Walking through the flying sand raised by the years  ♫

339
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:25,720
♫  Allowing each other's wounds to scab over  ♫

340
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:32,460
♫  Love is the concern that's burning in the heart  ♫

341
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:39,460
♫  Like ice and snow looking forward to midsummer  ♫

342
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:46,860
♫   It's burning within my heart and nourishing it for a lifetime  ♫

343
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,199
♫  Love is silent, no matter how far away it is, 
 it is measured by fate  ♫

344
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,000
Young Lady, it's very cold out there.

345
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,640
Have some warm water.

346
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,600
The weather can be unpredictable.

347
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,100
Lord Ding didn't look too good last night.

348
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,540
Today, Butler Zhang said he's unwell.

349
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,500
Do you think...

350
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,580
Could Lord Ding have caught a cold?

351
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,800
I was wrong before.

352
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,980
How can longing disappear just because we are far apart?

353
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,440
He doesn't seem to be angry now.

354
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,060
But he refuses to see me now.

355
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:33,220
It seems like he knows what's on my mind.

356
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:37,380
But for some reason, I'm feeling even sadder.

357
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,999
♫  Conquering the impermanence of fate  ♫

358
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,500
Juli,

359
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,639
do you think Lord Ding...

360
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,640
has given up on me?

361
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:56,653
♫  Love is the concern that's burning in the heart  ♫

362
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:03,409
♫  Like the stars chasing the horizon  ♫

363
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:10,800
♫   It's burning within my heart and nourishing it for a lifetime  ♫

364
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:22,100
♫  The flowers of two trees that grow together as one 
 and embrace each other will never decay  ♫

365
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,540
First, there was a drought in Jiangnan.

366
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:27,500
After the eager expectation,

367
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,320
the heavy rain finally brought sprouts of crops,

368
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,840
and it attracted swarms of locusts that covered the sky.

369
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:42,640
The scout reported that the locusts covered the sky.

370
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,640
They devoured the crops, leaving the land barren by evening.

371
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,240
The people are struggling to find enough to eat.

372
00:33:50,666 --> 00:33:52,266
Oh, Heaven.

373
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,580
You're really causing me distress.

374
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,720
Father.

375
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,359
The King of Northern Liang is seriously ill.

376
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,960
I feel like my strength is dwindling, too.

377
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,800
In recent days, even your uncle has been feeling ill.

378
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:25,460
The peace talks can at least ensure stability along the borders for several years.

379
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,300
But these internal issues...

380
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,540
When I think of the Jiangnan people suffering,

381
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:38,540
it feels like a fire scorching within me,

382
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,260
and my heart feels like it's being cut by a knife.

383
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,920
Father, please take care of your health.

384
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,500
Uncle should focus on nursing himself.

385
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,360
I'm not a child anymore.

386
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,380
I would like to share the burden with the elders.

387
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,880
Father, I request permission to go to Jiangnan to assist in disaster relief

388
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,900
and help the people settle down.

389
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,640
Good.

390
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,039
Your trip to Jiangnan will encounter challenges and difficulties.

391
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,640
It will be a great experience for you.

392
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,640
But I won't let you go alone.

393
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,300
How about this?

394
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,639
I'll send you two assistants.

395
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,580
They will surely be able to aid you.

396
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,700
Do you mean...

397
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,480
Mu Zhuohua and Shen Jinghong, of course.

398
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,300
Both of them will be a sheath and a sword.

399
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:46,700
If they can complement each other, they'll surely achieve great things.

400
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,539
- Father, I... 
 - Chen'er, Mu Zhuohua may be a woman.

401
00:35:51,539 --> 00:35:54,519
But she's intelligent, perceptive, and possesses great foresight.

402
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,340
She's a true talent.

403
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:00,140
You mustn't underestimate her.

404
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,980
I've witnessed Official Mu's abilities firsthand.

405
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,279
I no longer hold any prejudice against her.

406
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,000
Speaking of which, itwas Uncle's keen eye

407
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,279
that first recognized this hidden gem.

408
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,960
I'm fortunate enough that I didn't miss out either.

409
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,061
   

410
00:36:24,061 --> 00:36:26,861
   

411
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,340
   

412
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,179
Your Highness, are you reading the letter from Jishan Hall in Jiangnan?

413
00:36:37,179 --> 00:36:38,740
Yes.

414
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,880
The famine is widespread around Huaizhou.

415
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,840
And Jiangnan Jishan Hall's food reserves won't last much longer.

416
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,199
Speaking of the disaster,

417
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,339
I heard His Majesty has entrusted Jiangnan's disaster relief to the First Prince.

418
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,700
He's going to the south soon.

419
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,180
I've heard about it, too.

420
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,359
Well, Official Shen will likely travel with him.

421
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,260
After all, His Highness has always valued him.

422
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,720
Go and pack up some belongings.

423
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,840
I'm going to Jiangnan.

424
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,439
Now?

425
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,520
We must act fast to solve this.

426
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:20,700
I can't rest assured unless I take a look myself.

427
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,759
Yes.

428
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,119
Traveling with His Highness can save a lot of trouble.

429
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,540
Moreover, with Mr. Shen around, he can...

430
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,980
Bring along General Xue's portrait, too.

431
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,900
Yes, I'll go and make the preparations.

432
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,560
   

433
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,419
Your Highnesses, do you still have any questions that I need to answer?

434
00:37:46,419 --> 00:37:49,239
After I return, I'll revise the lessons,

435
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,440
and I'll ask Miss Mu for guidance in the next class.

436
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,500
I'm afraid you might be disappointed.

437
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,680
There might not be a next time for now.

438
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,900
What do you mean?

439
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,720
Are you planning to cause trouble for Miss Mu again?

440
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,280
Do you think I have nothing better to do like you?

441
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,319
That makes sense.

442
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,600
You will depart for Jiangnan for disaster relief.

443
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,680
I wonder if Miss Mu is joining, too.

444
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,560
Yes.

445
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,940
You're exceptionally talented, and you're from Jiangnan.

446
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,420
Are you willing to join me on this trip?

447
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,840
I shall comply.

448
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,540
You didn't let me down.

449
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:53,580
Your Highness, has Lord Ding replied to the official document yet?

450
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,680
Why?

451
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,400
Are you worried Uncle won't approve it?

452
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,860
 I'm just worried he'll approve it too quickly. 

453
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,319
    
 My Lord, here are today's documents.

454
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,679
The one on top is from First Prince.

455
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,120
He said it was somewhat urgent.

456
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,060
I shall take my leave.

457
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,399
    
 Lord Ding went to visit His Majesty.

458
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,159
He hasn't returned yet.

459
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,900
He's not available again?

460
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,740
Looks like I won't be able to bid farewell to him.

461
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,760
If it's something urgent, perhaps you can...

462
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,599
It's all right. I'll just wait for Lord Ding here.

463
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,100
Thank you.

464
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,220
Miss Mu, do you still plan on waiting?

465
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,319
I have to set out now.

466
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,159
Please convey this to Lord Ding

467
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,819
that Mu Zhuohua is about to set off for Jiangnan for disaster relief and came to bid farewell.

468
00:40:26,819 --> 00:40:28,200
Yes, Miss Mu.

469
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,760
Thank you.

470
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,919
My Lord, Official Mu came by earlier.

471
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,720
She wished to have a word with you.

472
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,399
Why did she come to me again?

473
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,279
No idea.

474
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,880
Everyone knows you haven't been valuing her lately.

475
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:10,119
My Lord, I heard that Official Mu has already gone to Jiangnan for disaster relief with the First Prince.

476
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,599
It seems she won't be bothering you for the next few days.

477
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,680
Jiangnan? Disaster relief?

478
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,020
Yes.

479
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,840
Weren't you the one who approved it?

480
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,399
♫  It's you who stripped me of my armor  ♫

481
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,000
My Lord!

482
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:36,060
