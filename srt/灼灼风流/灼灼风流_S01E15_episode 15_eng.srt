 Subtitles and Timing brought to you by the ❦Team of A Dazzling Love❀ @viki.com 

2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,459
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:34,980
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:47,779
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,779 --> 00:00:53,159
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,159
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:03,479
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,579
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,579
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:18,639
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

12
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:24,000
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,139
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:36,918
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,219
   

16
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:43,059
   

17
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:45,039
   

18
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,940
   

19
00:01:50,685 --> 00:01:54,885
My Lord, is the iron hook attached to the mute slave's left arm

20
00:01:54,886 --> 00:01:57,405
similar to the hawk claw hook?

21
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:01,326
I have sent Zhijian to look into it.

22
00:02:01,326 --> 00:02:04,925
Seeing that he has yet to return, I'm assuming that the mute slave got away.

23
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,645
What?

24
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:11,405
Yemu Jing brought him here, and now he has disappeared.

25
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:13,826
Why isn't Yemu Jing doing anything about it?

26
00:02:15,446 --> 00:02:20,546
Could it be that Yemu Jing let him go on purpose?

27
00:02:21,205 --> 00:02:24,426
Yemu Jing is indeed a snide one.

28
00:02:24,426 --> 00:02:27,546
I know that he came here with a hidden agenda.

29
00:02:28,446 --> 00:02:32,386
If he doesn't do anything, it will worry me even more.

30
00:02:32,846 --> 00:02:36,466
My Lord, will you attend the feast?

31
00:02:37,446 --> 00:02:39,046
Yes, I'm going.

32
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:42,905
But you shouldn't drink heavily given your injury.

33
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:50,705
My Lord, I said I'd bring the supplies to you.

34
00:02:51,406 --> 00:02:54,586
I made this hangover cure.

35
00:02:54,586 --> 00:02:56,805
You should eat this beforehand.

36
00:03:37,205 --> 00:03:38,805
Lord Ding,

37
00:03:38,805 --> 00:03:43,946
we must have a blast with fine brew tonight.

38
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:46,826
I will drink with you, Prince Yemu.

39
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,445
Take your time, Your Highness.

40
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:53,285
I'm very much looking forward to drinking with you all tonight.

41
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,845
Prince Yemu, you're our guest from afar.

42
00:04:02,726 --> 00:04:04,946
Here are my three shots.

43
00:04:04,946 --> 00:04:07,066
I must do you the honor.

44
00:04:24,845 --> 00:04:28,265
 Has he fully recovered? 

45
00:04:28,265 --> 00:04:30,724
 Yuanluo Flower's poison can't be detoxified, anyhow. 

46
00:04:30,725 --> 00:04:33,086
 He must be pretending. 

47
00:04:37,246 --> 00:04:41,265
My Lord, you can hold your liquor.

48
00:04:42,085 --> 00:04:43,685
Zhen'er.

49
00:04:44,886 --> 00:04:47,746
Quick, raise a toast to Lord Ding.

50
00:04:48,285 --> 00:04:50,905
Your Lordship, I've always admired you.

51
00:04:50,905 --> 00:04:53,606
So, I brought our great brew from Northern Liang.

52
00:04:53,606 --> 00:04:55,245
Please have a taste.

53
00:04:55,806 --> 00:04:59,706
Your Highness, my duty is to entertain you.

54
00:04:59,706 --> 00:05:04,085
Since you're in a merry mood, allow me to raise my glass to you.

55
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:05,885
A mere commoner.

56
00:05:05,886 --> 00:05:08,125
You don't deserve to raise a toast to me.

57
00:05:08,686 --> 00:05:10,304
Your Highness, this is your first time coming here.

58
00:05:10,304 --> 00:05:14,045
I guess you have some misunderstanding about the language of Southern Chen.

59
00:05:15,486 --> 00:05:19,646
People come first, and next is society, the ruler is beneath all.

60
00:05:19,646 --> 00:05:21,385
You aren't even a ruler.

61
00:05:21,385 --> 00:05:24,125
Why wouldn't I deserve to raise a toast to you as the nation's people?

62
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,765
Enough said.

63
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:28,565
Well...

64
00:05:30,845 --> 00:05:34,585
I'd like to savor this nice brew from Northern Liang.

65
00:05:54,606 --> 00:05:56,486
Lord Ding.

66
00:05:58,325 --> 00:05:59,925
Bottoms up.

67
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:08,046
Let's continue.

68
00:06:48,606 --> 00:06:50,286
My Lord!

69
00:06:50,765 --> 00:06:52,284
Are you all right, My Lord?

70
00:06:52,285 --> 00:06:53,485
My Lord!

71
00:06:54,085 --> 00:06:55,365
My Lord!

72
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:58,045
My Lord! How much did you drink?

73
00:06:58,725 --> 00:07:00,125
My Lord.

74
00:07:01,486 --> 00:07:02,786
My Lord!

75
00:07:03,525 --> 00:07:05,325
Careful, My Lord!

76
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:06,805
Juli!

77
00:07:07,706 --> 00:07:08,705
My Lord.

78
00:07:08,705 --> 00:07:10,106
Zhimo.

79
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:15,425
Where are you, Juli?

80
00:07:15,425 --> 00:07:16,890
Zhimo.

81
00:07:17,286 --> 00:07:18,925
Zhimo.

82
00:07:19,645 --> 00:07:21,445
Zhijian.

83
00:07:29,606 --> 00:07:31,106
My Lord.

84
00:07:42,746 --> 00:07:44,826
Where have they gone?

85
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,510
♫  The flowing water bends and reflects the round moon  ♫

86
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:54,465
My Lord, let's go. I'll help you.

87
00:07:54,465 --> 00:08:01,960
♫  The galaxy is like the sea, 
 the eyes are like the eaves covered with snow  ♫

88
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,146
♫  The night rain hitting the sycamore tree disturbs a sparrow  ♫

89
00:08:04,146 --> 00:08:05,765
- My Lord. 
 - Stay still.

90
00:08:05,765 --> 00:08:09,560
♫  The young maiden becomes acquainted with 
 the green robes in that moment  ♫

91
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:15,660
♫  Afraid that the number of twists and turns will increase  ♫

92
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:24,310
♫  You are like the flowers and moon, stretching while unbroken my time and drifting away  ♫

93
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:31,090
♫  Thousands of words are not enough 
 to accompany the long journey  ♫

94
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:39,510
♫  You are like the flowers and moon, 
 more graceful than a palace in the sky  ♫

95
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:46,402
♫  Accompanying you, calmly waiting 
 for the clouds to fade away  ♫

96
00:09:02,805 --> 00:09:04,625
Why are you running so fast?

97
00:09:07,645 --> 00:09:10,005
It's inappropriate to stop by here late at night.

98
00:09:10,006 --> 00:09:11,644
You need to take over from here.

99
00:09:11,645 --> 00:09:14,026
Please take care of him.

100
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:24,005
His Lordship is on the mend, and he's had too much to drink tonight.

101
00:09:24,006 --> 00:09:26,586
He needs meticulous care these days.

102
00:09:27,206 --> 00:09:28,845
These pills help maintain his blood circulation.

103
00:09:28,846 --> 00:09:31,825
Take one every four hours. Bear that in mind.

104
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,406
I'm leaving.

105
00:09:36,726 --> 00:09:38,386
She always wanted us to give her a ride.

106
00:09:38,386 --> 00:09:40,705
Can't she look after His Lordship as repayment?

107
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:49,879
♫  Thousands of words are not enough 
 to accompany the long journey  ♫

108
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:58,259
♫  You are like the flowers and moon, 
 more graceful than a palace in the sky  ♫

109
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:04,908
♫  Accompanying you, calmly waiting 
 for the clouds to fade away  ♫

110
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:13,125
♫  Standing on heights looking clearly into the horizon with a shared aspiration  ♫

111
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:17,055
♫  It is much farther than just two consensual hearts  ♫

112
00:10:17,055 --> 00:10:24,005
♫  Look at this world again after thousands of sails have passed  ♫

113
00:10:24,005 --> 00:10:27,754
♫  Toiling away long hours together with the candle's light  ♫

114
00:10:27,754 --> 00:10:31,905
♫  Not caring about the high mountains, deep waters and long roads  ♫

115
00:10:31,905 --> 00:10:38,505
♫  Fortunately, you are here, not afraid of the repeated trips 
 and hanging around with me  ♫

116
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:46,890
♫  You are like the flowers and moon, stretching while unbroken my time and drifting away  ♫

117
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:53,541
♫  Thousands of words are not enough 
 to accompany the long journey  ♫

118
00:10:53,541 --> 00:11:01,921
♫  You are like the flowers and moon, 
 more graceful than a palace in the sky  ♫

119
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:08,570
♫  Accompanying you, calmly waiting 
 for the clouds to fade away  ♫

120
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:17,011
♫  The flowers and the moon are boundless, having to drift desperately in exchange for a long-cherished wish  ♫

121
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:23,570
♫  The road is long, can the years be fulfilled?  ♫

122
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:31,491
♫  The flowers and the full moon in the sky, 
 a touching poem that has reached the world  ♫

123
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:39,269
♫  The flowering period is not too late, to guard my little wish  ♫

124
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:42,425
 "I think of the dear him, who's as gentle as jade. 

125
00:11:42,425 --> 00:11:45,486
 I stay in his log cabin, and my heart throbs." 

126
00:11:45,486 --> 00:11:47,726
 People always say women are trouble. 

127
00:11:47,726 --> 00:11:51,604
 But men can be worse. 

128
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,560
   

129
00:12:04,565 --> 00:12:06,065
My Lord.

130
00:12:08,006 --> 00:12:09,686
Have you found anything?

131
00:12:09,686 --> 00:12:13,344
Just when I was tasked to tail the mute slave, he had already planned to run off.

132
00:12:13,344 --> 00:12:16,205
I followed him to the woods, and we fought.

133
00:12:16,206 --> 00:12:20,404
I realized that his moves were similar to the spear arts of Southern Chen.

134
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:23,644
Have the Falcon Squad hunt for him.

135
00:12:23,645 --> 00:12:25,344
Find that mute slave no matter what.

136
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:26,845
Yes.

137
00:12:30,846 --> 00:12:32,325
What's wrong?

138
00:12:32,326 --> 00:12:36,644
My Lord, is Mu Zhuohua guilty of something?

139
00:12:38,805 --> 00:12:41,506
She has always asked us to give her a ride home.

140
00:12:41,506 --> 00:12:44,465
And yet she bolted home last night.

141
00:12:56,599 --> 00:13:00,480
   

142
00:13:19,805 --> 00:13:21,205
My Lord.

143
00:13:26,326 --> 00:13:28,345
What are you doing here?

144
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:32,866
Nothing. It's nothing.

145
00:13:53,285 --> 00:13:55,545
Did you not sleep well last night?

146
00:13:57,206 --> 00:14:00,586
The dark circles under your eyes are apparent.

147
00:14:01,486 --> 00:14:04,246
Are they really apparent?

148
00:14:13,026 --> 00:14:17,225
The task must have worn you out.

149
00:14:17,685 --> 00:14:19,686
Anyway, you did a great job.

150
00:14:28,606 --> 00:14:30,006
My Lord,

151
00:14:30,006 --> 00:14:32,944
are my dark circles the only thing you want to tell me

152
00:14:32,944 --> 00:14:36,925
after staring at my face for quite a while?

153
00:14:37,805 --> 00:14:39,705
Why?

154
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:42,126
Am I not allowed to stare at you?

155
00:14:43,246 --> 00:14:45,386
No, I didn't mean that.

156
00:14:46,506 --> 00:14:48,206
Never mind.

157
00:14:56,246 --> 00:14:57,785
Last night...

158
00:14:59,126 --> 00:15:00,726
Last night?

159
00:15:02,906 --> 00:15:05,066
What's wrong with last night?

160
00:15:07,805 --> 00:15:09,386
Last night...

161
00:15:11,685 --> 00:15:14,525
were you well?

162
00:15:15,606 --> 00:15:18,605
I was drunk.

163
00:15:19,445 --> 00:15:21,865
I don't remember what happened.

164
00:15:30,126 --> 00:15:31,966
You forgot it.

165
00:15:32,925 --> 00:15:34,925
It's good, though.

166
00:15:36,486 --> 00:15:38,745
Forgot? What did you say?

167
00:15:39,645 --> 00:15:41,325
I couldn't sleep well last night.

168
00:15:41,326 --> 00:15:44,906
My head is foggy today, and I've forgotten things.

169
00:15:50,086 --> 00:15:52,626
You can take a day off.

170
00:15:53,846 --> 00:15:55,446
Thank you, My Lord.

171
00:15:55,446 --> 00:15:57,025
It's getting late.

172
00:15:57,025 --> 00:15:58,605
You should attend the morning assembly.

173
00:15:58,606 --> 00:16:01,246
I need to report to my duty as well.

174
00:16:01,246 --> 00:16:03,305
I shall take my leave.

175
00:16:36,525 --> 00:16:38,906
I'll beat you to death, beggar.

176
00:16:44,565 --> 00:16:46,165
You...

177
00:16:46,165 --> 00:16:47,765
Let's go.

178
00:17:13,685 --> 00:17:15,485
You're injured.

179
00:17:18,645 --> 00:17:20,245
Don't be afraid.

180
00:17:20,846 --> 00:17:24,506
I'll take you to Jishan Hall for treatment.

181
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:29,993
   

182
00:17:53,725 --> 00:17:56,105
That's the drawing of Her Highness' fiance.

183
00:17:56,105 --> 00:18:01,505
Her Highness is upset whenever she sees it, but she never takes it down.

184
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:13,805
 Don't just stand there. 

185
00:18:13,806 --> 00:18:15,806
 Come and sit. 

186
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:18,707
 Are you done drawing, Your Highness?  
   

187
00:18:18,707 --> 00:18:23,046
 Your look has long been on my mind. 

188
00:18:46,445 --> 00:18:48,345
What's wrong with you?

189
00:18:51,946 --> 00:18:54,166
Do you have any difficulties?

190
00:18:54,886 --> 00:18:56,946
Maybe I can help you.

191
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,406
Are you all right?

192
00:19:14,766 --> 00:19:16,666
What's wrong?

193
00:19:21,485 --> 00:19:22,745
Your Highness.

194
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:25,764
Your Highness? Are you all right?

195
00:19:27,405 --> 00:19:28,885
Yes.

196
00:19:28,886 --> 00:19:31,525
 He looks very similar to General Xue. 

197
00:19:32,126 --> 00:19:33,626
I'm all right.

198
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:10,438
   

199
00:20:15,766 --> 00:20:17,505
Is she...

200
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:20,466
avoiding me?

201
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:35,358
   
 ("Thrive" is "Yan" in Mandarin. Also, Lord Ding's given name) 

202
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:48,490
   
 (Removes Yan) 

203
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,166
 We have steamed buns here. 

204
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,404
 Mr. Zhang. 

205
00:21:24,405 --> 00:21:26,105
 I want six steamed buns. 

206
00:21:26,925 --> 00:21:28,944
- Here's the money. 
 - Here you go.

207
00:21:30,645 --> 00:21:33,025
- Have a nice day. 
 - Thank you.

208
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,505
Juli. 
    

209
00:21:34,505 --> 00:21:36,385
Zhimo.

210
00:21:37,286 --> 00:21:39,785
- This is for you. 
 - For me?

211
00:21:39,785 --> 00:21:41,325
What good food do we have this time?

212
00:21:41,326 --> 00:21:42,724
Ham hock.

213
00:21:42,725 --> 00:21:44,985
How do you know I like ham hock?

214
00:21:44,985 --> 00:21:47,066
Is there anything you don't like?

215
00:21:47,925 --> 00:21:49,525
Nope.

216
00:21:50,645 --> 00:21:54,605
Food gives me the energy to work, and yummy food makes me happy.

217
00:21:59,086 --> 00:22:00,404
Eat up. I'll get going.

218
00:22:00,405 --> 00:22:01,805
Okay.

219
00:22:01,806 --> 00:22:03,306
Hold on.

220
00:22:04,326 --> 00:22:06,606
Zhimo, I have a question.

221
00:22:08,305 --> 00:22:10,585
Can you read this character?

222
00:22:12,126 --> 00:22:13,826
His Lordship's name.

223
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:17,445
Why did Young Lady write his name?

224
00:22:19,521 --> 00:22:21,809
   

225
00:22:22,566 --> 00:22:24,404
The Northern Liang diplomatic envoy has arrived in the capital.

226
00:22:24,405 --> 00:22:27,805
Given Lord Ding's character, he will surely act

227
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:32,325
to seek the thread from Yemu Jing about what happened back then.

228
00:22:32,325 --> 00:22:36,086
If so, we must distract Lord Ding.

229
00:22:36,086 --> 00:22:38,606
He shouldn't have had much spare time.

230
00:22:39,245 --> 00:22:41,164
You'll handle this.

231
00:22:41,165 --> 00:22:43,746
Yes, I know what to do.

232
00:22:49,925 --> 00:22:50,885
 Sir. 

233
00:22:50,886 --> 00:22:52,926
   
 You're here, sir. 

234
00:22:54,326 --> 00:22:57,304
Mister, I'll give you a toast too.

235
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:06,086
Who are you?

236
00:23:07,326 --> 00:23:10,925
Mister, she will perform a dance for you.

237
00:23:30,065 --> 00:23:32,586
Who are you?

238
00:23:36,825 --> 00:23:38,665
It's you.

239
00:23:44,687 --> 00:23:47,244
   

240
00:23:47,245 --> 00:23:48,845
Your Majesty.

241
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:52,525
For the enduring peace between Northern Liang and Southern Chen,

242
00:23:52,526 --> 00:23:55,724
we expect a marriage alliance with Princess Roujia.

243
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:58,825
 Pardon? He's asking for Princess Roujia to marry into Northern Liang? 

244
00:23:58,846 --> 00:24:00,146
 But... 

245
00:24:00,925 --> 00:24:02,625
Your Majesty.

246
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:04,444
This is a request of great interest.

247
00:24:04,445 --> 00:24:07,145
By forging a marriage alliance between the two nations,

248
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:09,504
    
 we put an end to warfare.

249
00:24:09,504 --> 00:24:12,145
    
 Nothing can be better than this.

250
00:24:14,366 --> 00:24:16,204
I beg to differ, Official Zhou.

251
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:19,225
Princess Roujia is the eldest daughter of His Majesty, and she's of noble origin.

252
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:20,845
How could Her Highness marry into a foreign nation?

253
00:24:20,846 --> 00:24:23,725
    
 This is ridiculous.

254
00:24:25,545 --> 00:24:31,025
What outcome of the terms Northern Liang stated in the letter of credence will it bring?

255
00:24:31,025 --> 00:24:33,825
Have you ever thought about this, Prince Yemu?

256
00:24:36,005 --> 00:24:40,086
What outcome do you prefer, Your Majesty?

257
00:24:41,092 --> 00:24:43,465
Lord Ding is in charge of the peace negotiation this time.

258
00:24:43,465 --> 00:24:47,166
His reply represents mine.

259
00:24:48,806 --> 00:24:53,686
Given that response, you disagree?

260
00:24:53,686 --> 00:24:55,404
We're here for the peace negotiation.

261
00:24:55,405 --> 00:24:57,866
Negotiating is our purpose.

262
00:24:57,866 --> 00:25:01,825
Why are you so anxious, Prince Yemu?

263
00:25:03,925 --> 00:25:06,025
Prince Yemu,

264
00:25:06,025 --> 00:25:09,585
you should've started a peaceful negotiation with me.

265
00:25:09,585 --> 00:25:11,786
Your request is somewhat ridiculous.

266
00:25:11,786 --> 00:25:17,265
Trading the marriage alliance with Princess Roujia for future peace?

267
00:25:17,286 --> 00:25:23,244
We, Southern Chen, might as well wage another war against Northern Liang.

268
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,580
   

269
00:25:38,445 --> 00:25:41,405
Look how anxious you are about Princess Roujia.

270
00:25:41,405 --> 00:25:43,786
I'll make her mine.

271
00:25:53,086 --> 00:25:57,186
Uncle, he's outrageous.

272
00:25:57,186 --> 00:26:01,964
If we didn't lose to them in such a humiliating defeat in the war at Juma River,

273
00:26:03,225 --> 00:26:07,405
we wouldn't have been on an equal footing with them now.

274
00:26:07,405 --> 00:26:11,926
There must be a reason for what happened just now.

275
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:24,925
I know this is unfair to you.

276
00:26:24,925 --> 00:26:27,665
However, Northern Liang is brutal, and war is ruthless.

277
00:26:27,665 --> 00:26:32,846
If you don't marry, millions of our people will suffer.

278
00:26:32,846 --> 00:26:36,566
I understand what you mean, Grandmother.

279
00:26:36,566 --> 00:26:38,185
You're the princess.

280
00:26:38,185 --> 00:26:40,766
You should consider the big picture.

281
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:44,285
Though your father didn't give his response in the imperial court,

282
00:26:44,285 --> 00:26:47,766
he shares the same thought as mine.

283
00:26:49,766 --> 00:26:51,786
Don't worry, Grandmother.

284
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:57,745
If I alone am enough to trade for a peaceful world, I'm willing to go.

285
00:26:57,745 --> 00:27:02,005
I always knew you're a sensible child.

286
00:27:13,005 --> 00:27:14,505
Your Highness.

287
00:27:14,505 --> 00:27:16,045
I thought you were supposed to rest today.

288
00:27:16,046 --> 00:27:17,285
What brings you here?

289
00:27:17,286 --> 00:27:19,306
Which princess were you greeting?

290
00:27:22,645 --> 00:27:24,866
Greetings, Princess Jing'an.

291
00:27:28,165 --> 00:27:31,765
Your Highness, I'm here for you.

292
00:27:31,765 --> 00:27:32,904
You came just in time.

293
00:27:32,904 --> 00:27:35,905
We can accompany Princess Jing'an.

294
00:27:40,165 --> 00:27:41,765
I'm all right.

295
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:46,045
Where's my brother?

296
00:27:46,046 --> 00:27:49,465
Prince Yemu said Southern Chen is hesitant about a mere marriage alliance.

297
00:27:49,486 --> 00:27:51,226
He's going to reason with them.

298
00:27:51,226 --> 00:27:52,745
He's right.

299
00:27:53,326 --> 00:27:55,085
My brother has tactical and martial prowess.

300
00:27:55,086 --> 00:27:57,986
He's the real man representing Northern Liang.

301
00:27:57,986 --> 00:28:00,026
He lacks nothing.

302
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:04,644
Shouldn't a real man possess bravery, intelligence,

303
00:28:04,645 --> 00:28:08,125
and respect others' wishes, instead of coercing them?

304
00:28:08,126 --> 00:28:09,726
Say that again.

305
00:28:10,645 --> 00:28:12,705
I didn't refer it to anyone.

306
00:28:12,705 --> 00:28:16,386
I said it because most men in Southern Chen are like this.

307
00:28:17,846 --> 00:28:22,526
Princess Jing'an, why do you look upset?

308
00:28:31,046 --> 00:28:33,045
My bracelet is on the ground.

309
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:37,805
Maybe you should pick it up for me, Envoy.

310
00:28:47,746 --> 00:28:51,386
The land of Southern Chen is dirty, though.

311
00:28:51,386 --> 00:28:54,185
My boots are tainted with dirt.

312
00:28:54,185 --> 00:28:56,446
Can I trouble you, Envoy,

313
00:28:57,205 --> 00:28:58,905
to wipe it off for me?

314
00:29:05,086 --> 00:29:06,786
Princess Yemu,

315
00:29:07,286 --> 00:29:12,645
though she's not a high-ranked official, you shouldn't humiliate her like this.

316
00:29:26,645 --> 00:29:28,245
It's dirty.

317
00:29:31,126 --> 00:29:33,286
I don't want it anymore.

318
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:40,945
Princess Yemu,

319
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:46,765
do you think you and the bracelet have something in common?

320
00:29:47,526 --> 00:29:49,026
What?

321
00:29:50,366 --> 00:29:54,904
Both of you seem glamorous on the outside, but you're forced to do something against your will.

322
00:29:54,904 --> 00:29:59,066
You will be given out as a gift when you hold values.

323
00:29:59,066 --> 00:30:03,586
When you're no longer deemed necessary, you'll be abandoned.

324
00:30:03,586 --> 00:30:05,645
I can't help but wonder about this.

325
00:30:05,645 --> 00:30:08,705
Do you think it has a heart?

326
00:30:08,705 --> 00:30:12,986
If it does, does it suffer inside?

327
00:30:12,986 --> 00:30:18,746
Is it really willing to please someone it doesn't like or doesn't understand?

328
00:30:19,286 --> 00:30:21,665
 How sharp-tongued. 

329
00:30:24,965 --> 00:30:28,305
 Yemu Jing hasn't gained any advantage ever since the diplomatic corps came here. 

330
00:30:28,305 --> 00:30:32,485
 Why would he lose his patience and start picking on the officials? 

331
00:30:32,485 --> 00:30:35,006
 Besides, his men are busy with the boxes. 

332
00:30:35,006 --> 00:30:37,785
Your Highness, something has come up.

333
00:30:37,785 --> 00:30:40,418
I can't keep you company today.

334
00:30:41,238 --> 00:30:43,558
I'm very glad that you came.

335
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:44,864
Go ahead.

336
00:30:44,864 --> 00:30:47,165
I want to make you happier.

337
00:30:48,105 --> 00:30:49,705
I shall take my leave.

338
00:31:03,645 --> 00:31:05,345
I'm in for the challenge.

339
00:31:05,345 --> 00:31:09,766
If I win, you will not marry my sister.

340
00:31:11,326 --> 00:31:13,026
Sure.

341
00:31:13,026 --> 00:31:17,386
I've been itching to have a match with you, Your Highness.

342
00:31:22,286 --> 00:31:24,186
Your Highness,

343
00:31:24,186 --> 00:31:27,725
you haven't recovered yet. Please don't be reckless.

344
00:31:28,806 --> 00:31:34,485
I'd rather lose my life than let my sister marry into a foreign nation.

345
00:31:37,326 --> 00:31:39,365
Your leg is injured, Your Highness.

346
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:41,966
- Let me do this. 
 - But you...

347
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:43,244
This is trivial.

348
00:31:43,245 --> 00:31:46,344
No need to waste your effort, Your Highness. I'll do this for you.

349
00:31:46,846 --> 00:31:48,346
Very well.

350
00:31:48,346 --> 00:31:50,766
Anyone will do. I don't care.

351
00:31:57,005 --> 00:31:58,045
Your Highness.

352
00:31:58,046 --> 00:32:02,524
Prince Yemu wants to challenge the peace negotiators to an archery match,

353
00:32:02,524 --> 00:32:04,945
as he claims that the men of Southern Chen are weak

354
00:32:04,945 --> 00:32:08,126
and he's the only man who deserves you.

355
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:11,025
Hence, Official Shen took up the challenge.

356
00:32:12,951 --> 00:32:16,290
 Excellent! 

357
00:32:24,086 --> 00:32:25,886
 Well-played! 

358
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:29,766
 Well done! 

359
00:32:30,846 --> 00:32:32,085
Your Highness.

360
00:32:32,086 --> 00:32:36,205
My brother is more excellent than the men here. Right?

361
00:32:39,445 --> 00:32:42,505
Mr. Shen, it's your turn.

362
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:54,565
He seems to have some guts.

363
00:32:54,566 --> 00:32:59,626
But he better not assume he can win against my brother.

364
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:21,404
 How dare you study behind my back! 

365
00:33:21,405 --> 00:33:23,405
 How dare you! 

366
00:33:23,405 --> 00:33:26,445
   
 You were born to be a hunter, not a scholar. 

367
00:33:26,445 --> 00:33:29,005
 Practice your archery skill! 

368
00:34:17,646 --> 00:34:21,226
Is he trying so hard because of you?

369
00:35:01,445 --> 00:35:04,246
Prince Yemu, thank you for your concession.

370
00:35:07,766 --> 00:35:10,646
Both of us hit the mark on all three shots.

371
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:15,966
You didn't win the game with such petty skills.

372
00:35:16,925 --> 00:35:21,145
Just now, you said that Prince Yemu gave you a concession.

373
00:35:21,145 --> 00:35:23,864
- So, it's a tie. 
 - Right?

374
00:35:23,864 --> 00:35:25,506
 Yes! 

375
00:35:25,506 --> 00:35:27,885
 You're not playing fair! 

376
00:35:27,885 --> 00:35:30,086
Petty tricks.

377
00:35:35,646 --> 00:35:37,246
Let's head back.

378
00:36:01,005 --> 00:36:02,084
Be careful of sharp weapons.

379
00:36:02,085 --> 00:36:03,765
Are you all right, Princess Jing'an?

380
00:36:03,766 --> 00:36:05,066
I...

381
00:36:05,066 --> 00:36:07,126
I'm all right.

382
00:36:17,646 --> 00:36:19,146
Your Highness.

383
00:36:21,965 --> 00:36:24,425
I'm the Princess of Southern Chen.

384
00:36:24,425 --> 00:36:28,746
If my marriage could trade for peace at the border,

385
00:36:29,366 --> 00:36:33,526
even if it's only a few years for the borderland soldiers

386
00:36:33,526 --> 00:36:37,945
to gather their strength, it's worth it.

387
00:36:39,206 --> 00:36:42,906
Official Shen, no need to worry about it.

388
00:36:44,825 --> 00:36:47,286
I beg to differ, Your Highness.

389
00:36:47,286 --> 00:36:49,125
What did I get wrong?

390
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:53,865
I disagree that a person's sacrifice can save the entire nation.

391
00:36:54,605 --> 00:36:59,005
Besides, the peace is at the cost of a woman.

392
00:36:59,005 --> 00:37:02,152
This is a humiliation for us men.

393
00:37:03,517 --> 00:37:05,858
This is the destiny of a princess.

394
00:37:07,326 --> 00:37:10,125
I've enjoyed offerings from the nation.

395
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:11,845
So I must repay the people.

396
00:37:11,846 --> 00:37:15,425
If we have to sacrifice a princess to reclaim peace,

397
00:37:15,425 --> 00:37:18,285
what's the use of the imperial court?

398
00:37:18,285 --> 00:37:20,564
Anyone can sacrifice themselves for the nation.

399
00:37:20,565 --> 00:37:22,625
Why can't a princess do this?

400
00:37:24,045 --> 00:37:25,745
Because...

401
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:28,925
it's the same...

402
00:37:30,525 --> 00:37:32,425
and also different.

403
00:37:33,045 --> 00:37:34,985
Why is it different?

404
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:49,540
♫  The love that opened my eyes  ♫

405
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:56,830
♫  Moonlight illuminates the path once traveled  ♫

406
00:37:56,830 --> 00:38:00,700
♫  A dream of a goose and a phoenix crossing together  ♫

407
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,769
♫  Tenderness is like parting and complaints  ♫

408
00:38:03,769 --> 00:38:08,969
♫  Going around for a lifetime, constantly cut and scattered, 
 the world is day and night  ♫

409
00:38:08,969 --> 00:38:11,425
 To me, it's different. 

410
00:38:11,425 --> 00:38:18,929
♫  The fireworks of the world are like quicksand 
 of the world after all  ♫

411
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:26,449
♫  In that moment of confusion, 
 I want to know what your answer will be  ♫

412
00:38:26,449 --> 00:38:30,389
♫  Again, someone on the precipice of fate  ♫

413
00:38:31,445 --> 00:38:33,746
What's wrong, Your Highness?

414
00:38:35,726 --> 00:38:37,225
Nothing.

415
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:42,580
   

416
00:38:43,785 --> 00:38:46,205
Why are you on duty at this hour, Official Mu?

417
00:38:46,206 --> 00:38:47,645
I have something to deal with.

418
00:38:47,646 --> 00:38:49,446
I'll get going.

419
00:38:58,005 --> 00:39:00,225
Must I really go to His Lordship?

420
00:39:04,905 --> 00:39:06,044
No.

421
00:39:06,045 --> 00:39:10,166
For the sake of Her Highness, I must talk to him.

422
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:13,606
Official Mu, why are you standing there?

423
00:39:13,606 --> 00:39:16,624
- Are you here for His Lordship? 
 - Yes, I want to meet His Lordship.

424
00:39:16,624 --> 00:39:18,726
I have something to report.

425
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:36,706
Greetings, My Lord.

426
00:39:37,925 --> 00:39:40,125
I'm surprised to see you here.

427
00:39:44,445 --> 00:39:46,845
What brings you here today?

428
00:39:46,845 --> 00:39:50,186
I thought you'd been avoiding me all this time.

429
00:39:50,186 --> 00:39:51,845
 I'm helpless, after all. 

430
00:39:51,846 --> 00:39:53,325
 How can I be overwhelmed by this man? 

431
00:39:53,326 --> 00:39:55,466
 This is ridiculous. 

432
00:40:02,886 --> 00:40:05,985
Why are you in a trance?

433
00:40:07,646 --> 00:40:11,225
I... I didn't avoid you, My Lord.

434
00:40:11,225 --> 00:40:15,605
If I do, I wouldn't be here now.

435
00:40:15,605 --> 00:40:18,385
You always have excuses.

436
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,325
Tell me.

437
00:40:20,326 --> 00:40:22,325
Why do you want to see me?

438
00:40:22,326 --> 00:40:23,404
My Lord.

439
00:40:23,405 --> 00:40:26,325
I heard about the marriage alliance of Princess Roujia.

440
00:40:26,326 --> 00:40:28,466
It's been keeping me awake at night.

441
00:40:30,445 --> 00:40:32,986
Will you sleep better by coming to me?

442
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:37,146
That will be worse.

443
00:40:40,766 --> 00:40:42,205
My Lord,

444
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:44,045
I have something to report.

445
00:40:44,965 --> 00:40:47,684
I realized that the Northern Liang diplomatic envoy didn't come here well-prepared.

446
00:40:47,684 --> 00:40:49,966
Instead, they're eager to leave.

447
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:55,786
I see.

448
00:40:57,206 --> 00:41:01,205
It matches the intelligence we received some days ago.

449
00:41:02,806 --> 00:41:04,306
Let's go.

450
00:41:05,806 --> 00:41:07,606
Where are we going?

451
00:41:07,606 --> 00:41:10,186
Since we've figured something's wrong with them,

452
00:41:10,186 --> 00:41:13,125
we're going to negotiate with Yemu Jing.

453
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:27,030
