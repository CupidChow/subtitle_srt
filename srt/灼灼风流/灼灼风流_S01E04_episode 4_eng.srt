00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,359
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,080
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:47,879
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,160
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,259
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,480
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground,

♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11

♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:39,220
   

16
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,160
   

17
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,040
   

18
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,910
   

19
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,460
He's a nefarious demon to Northern Liang and the god of war to Southern Chen.

20
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,800
Be that as it may,

21
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:00,150
some might think his meritorious reputation has surpassed the emperor.

22
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,670
Lord Ding is scary.

23
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,080
He's like a tiger.

24
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,310
And worst, a giant tiger.

25
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,410
Young Lady, you shouldn't get involved with him.

26
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,100
I think so, too.

27
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,780
The capital sure is a complicated place to stay.

28
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,390
There are dangers everywhere.

29
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,350
All we want is to make a decent living.

30
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,460
Miss, here are your dishes.

31
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,740
   

32
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,540
So who wants to answer?

33
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,750
I'll answer it.

34
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,210
He's Scholar Zong, who ranked second in the literary examination.

35
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,810
Before Shen Jinghong arrived in the capital, he dominated the top of the list.

36
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,950
After that, he lost to Shen Jinghong five times continuously.

37
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,900
Today, he still goes on the stage.

38
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,941
Leaving aside his literary talents... he sure is mentally strong. 
    

39
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,470
A tiger, a fierce beast.

40
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,860
When raised, it becomes a danger. So strive to eliminate it.

41
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,460
 Young Master Wen has a point. 

42
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,180
A sage has a compassionate heart, and a virtuous person is righteous.

43
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,490
I, as a humble individual, am only concerned about upholding righteousness.

44
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,610
Thus achieving the utmost benevolence.

45
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,870
Why do we read the books of sages and scholars?

46
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,880
It's learning how to serve the country and share the emperor's burdens.

47
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,280
 - Nicely put! 
 - Well said! 

48
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,790
 - That's right! 
 - Young Master Wen, well said! 

49
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,990
 - Well said! 
 - Good! 

50
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,530
To think a mere commoner would dare to show such disrespect to Lord Ding.

51
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,060
Perhaps, he also knows that the mighty tiger is injured.

52
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,720
The mighty tiger is injured?

53
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,940
 How did he get injured? 

54
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,940
 Five years ago, at Juma River. 

55
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,620
Lord Ding faced off against the Northern Liang Army.

56
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,150
He was trapped and surrounded.

57
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,780
Almost thirty thousand elite soldiers were killed and injured.

58
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,880
And even Lord Ding's life was hanging by a thread.

59
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,390
 Fortunately, First Prince led his troops deep into enemy territory 

60
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,840
 and saved Lord Ding. 

61
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,610
But it's said that Lord Ding suffered serious injuries from that battle.

62
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,770
So he handed over most of his military power to First Prince.

63
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,850
 How did Wen Shizong know that the First Prince and Lord Ding weren't on the same side? 

64
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,020
Don't they fear offending First Prince?

65
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,950
That was because you think too simply and they overcomplicated it.

66
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,070
You know what?

67
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,220
They thought Lord Ding lost the battle

68
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:42,450
because of the First Prince's interference in order to seize power from Lord Ding.

69
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,960
 They sure overthink this. 

70
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:50,110
 However, what the people know about the war at Juma River may not be the truth. 

71
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,510
 Uncle seems to be paying attention to this female provincial graduate. 

72
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,860
 I'm only guessing. 

73
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,860
During the battle in Yan City,

74
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,080
Lord Ding remained meticulous and unparalleled in his strategic brilliance.

75
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,530
But why did Lord Ding become so ambitious and reckless...

76
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,460
in the war at Juma River three years later?

77
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,240
Young Lady, you're right.

78
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,060
How could someone's skills possibly regress over time?

79
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,070
 Look. 

80
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:19,020
 Lord Ding already has such accomplishments, why would he seek further recognition? 

81
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,860
 And what other recognition could he seek? 

82
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,270
 That's my first point. 

83
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:28,100
Lord Ding's understanding of the people from Northern Liang has reached a point where he knows all strategies.

84
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,420
How could he easily fall into the ambush

85
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,190
set by the Northern Liang people in the war at Juma River?

86
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,430
 That's my second point. 

87
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,980
 Yuan Chengming betrayed us! 

88
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,220
 We were ambushed! 

89
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,780
 There's one thing that puzzles me the most. 

90
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,340
It has already been five years since that battle.

91
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,950
Yet why is there a rumor still circulating among the people

92
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:33,360
that Lord Ding was greedy for achievements, acted recklessly, was arrogant, and underestimated the enemy?

93
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,950
 This is my third point. 

94
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,260
 I just can't figure that out. 

95
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,120
Even a woman knows that.

96
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,300
Yet there's a bunch of ignorant fools who constantly chatter in front of Father.

97
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,340
Chen'er.

98
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,150
 Young Lady. 

99
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,870
 Based on what you just said, that means Lord Ding did nothing wrong. 

100
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,900
 He may not be greedy for achievements. 

101
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,730
But there was a possibility of recklessness.

102
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,760
I didn't know you knew Lord Ding this well.

103
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,150
Oh, no. Not at all.

104
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,000
This woman's words are too one-sided.

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,750
Uncle, you lead by example, unite the three armies.

106
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,890
You are a model in the hearts of many.

107
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,250
Speaking of which,

108
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,550
I came to watch Young Master Jinghong in action.

109
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,600
But he hasn't shown up yet.

110
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,770
Uncle, who do you want to see today?

111
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,450
For one small fry.

112
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,510
After hearing so many answers, Wen Shizong's answer is still the best.

113
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,510
    
 His answer is logical and well-founded.

114
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,650
You're flattering me.

115
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,410
I bet Shen Jinghong won't dare to come anymore.

116
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,560
He definitely won't dare.

117
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,610
He wouldn't dare to come.

118
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,290
Since all of you miss me that much,

119
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,640
how can I disappoint all of you?

120
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,780
   

121
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,330
So it's him.

122
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,850
Young Lady, do you know him?

123
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,500
No, I don't.

124
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,890
Young Master Jinghong, you took your time to show up.

125
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,850
You sure made us wait for quite a while.

126
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:05,100
- I wonder what you have to say about today's topic. 
 - That's right.

127
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,160
Young Master Jinghong is the number one scholar.

128
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,050
I'm sure your insights must be extraordinary. Surely, you'll present us with fresh perspectives.

129
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,070
 - Yes. 
 - Indeed. 

130
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,960
 Tell us what you think. 

131
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,010
Pardon me for making you wait.

132
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,420
Young Master Shen, why were you late?

133
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,520
Don't tell us you were scared.

134
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,820
I had to help an elderly cross the bridge.

135
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,320
That's why I was late.

136
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,820
Young Master Shen, are you joking?

137
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,950
I thought you were joking, Brother Fang.

138
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,700
Young Master Shen, this place is for exchanging ideas, not a place for joking around.

139
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,150
Brother Wen, you spoke up just in time.

140
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,630
I have a question I think you might be able to help with.

141
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,270
Young Master Shen, please ask away.

142
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,060
The warm weather is changing to the cold weather.

143
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,600
Brother Wen, aren't you cold from fanning yourself all the time?

144
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,700
You... Brother Wen, your literary talent is exceptional.

145
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,780
Truly a master of both literary and martial arts.

146
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,500
I feel inadequate in comparison.

147
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,060
Master of both literary and martial arts?

148
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,420
The name Wen Shizong, indeed. 
(Wen, literary; Shi, soldier)

149
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,470
You bring shame to intellectuals.

150
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,970
Brother Wen.

151
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,920
Juli, did you hear how he talks?

152
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,630
He's so mean.

153
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:29,410
From now on, "Master of both literary and martial arts" might become a term of mockery.

154
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:34,750
Apart from anything else, Shen Jinghong has a sharp tongue.

155
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,690
A perfect candidate as an imperial censor.

156
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,860
His words sure are sharp enough.

157
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,370
Young Master Shen, since you're here to answer the question, why indulge in empty talk first?

158
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,700
 - He's right, Young Master Shen. 
 - That's right. 

159
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,350
 - Answer the question. 
 - We're all waiting here. 

160
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,940
 Young Master Shen, hurry up and answer it. 

161
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,080
 Come on, Young Master Shen. 

162
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,780
Since everyone is so eager, I'll offer my humble answer.

163
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,270
Raising a tiger is a threat.

164
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,850
The question is inappropriate.

165
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,370
That's quite audacious of you.

166
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,520
These topics are contributed by masters of literature.

167
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,020
That's inaccurate.

168
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,970
Even in the literary world, some deceive and steal fame.

169
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,280
   

170
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:42,330
   

171
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,470
"Raising a tiger as an asset?"

172
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,850
For the word "asset," he uses bold and well-defined strokes.

173
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,230
This person truly has profound insights.

174
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,660
Astonishingly elegant.

175
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,820
Juli, bring me the brush and ink.

176
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,760
- I want to answer the topic as well. 
 - All right.

177
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,110
    
 "Raising a tiger as an asset?"

178
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,480
What does that mean?

179
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,220
Since tigers are fierce, how could they be an asset?

180
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,370
Young Master Shen, are you sensationalizing your answer?

181
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,460
Ordinary people are timid.

182
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,190
So raising a tiger would naturally be a threat to them.

183
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,080
His Majesty has no fear.

184
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,700
So naturally, he can make use of the tiger.

185
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,880
But tigers are ferocious, what if they hurt someone?

186
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,200
As long as the one who tames the tiger possesses great wisdom and courage,

187
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,370
they can naturally subdue the ferocious beast.

188
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:48,210
Just like Duke Huan of Qi, who appointed Guan Zhong who once injured him as his minister,

189
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:51,690
achieving prosperity and strength, ultimately achieving hegemony.

190
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:57,070
Basically, the fierceness of a tiger is its nature, without a clear moral judgment.

191
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,470
It's the fear in people that's misguided.

192
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:03,500
Being inadequate themselves, yet speculating about His Majesty.

193
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,300
What purpose does this question serve?

194
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,800
 - Well said. 
 - He's right. 

195
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,750
He has a point.

196
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,030
 The Princess didn't come. 

197
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,610
   

198
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,680
Why did Shen Jinghong just leave like that?

199
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,530
Young Lady, I thought you were preparing to take the challenge as well.

200
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,420
Truly a person of remarkable demeanor.

201
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,970
It's just...

202
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,010
a bit too good at flattery.

203
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:09,490
- If no one opposes, the one who holds the top spot today is...  
 - Shen Jinghong!

204
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,420
 Shen Jinghong! 

205
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:17,330
"Raising a tiger as an asset" manages to buy everyone's heart all at once.

206
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,770
I'm really inferior compared to that.

207
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,750
Young Lady, don't say that.

208
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,360
You're quite skilled at flattery, too.

209
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,770
You should improve your skills, too.

210
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,650
Your flattery is too excessive.

211
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,710
Young Lady...

212
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,910
I won't take the challenge.

213
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:39,620
Wenzheng Parlor might have some powerful backing.

214
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,870
 Young Lady, I'm not that smart. 

215
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,600
I really can't catch up to you.

216
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,380
That's all right. You can take your time to catch up.

217
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,850
"Raising a tiger is a threat."

218
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:54,760
It's too dangerous to come up with such a topic.

219
00:14:55,650 --> 00:15:00,170
Someone who dares to present this must be someone with powerful backing.

220
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,650
It's also likely that the question

221
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,360
was given by someone's command.

222
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,180
No, that's unlikely.

223
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,830
What benefit does it bring to present such a topic?

224
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,390
Time to go.

225
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,930
   

226
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,510
Even the steamed buns at Wenzheng Parlor are so expensive.

227
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,480
Next time, I won't buy them again.

228
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,820
 - This annoying person.  
 - Young Lady.

229
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,370
 is really difficult to deal with. 

230
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,340
Yesterday, I used Princess Roujia's influence to scare him off.

231
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,820
I didn't expect him to show up again today.

232
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,690
It's going to be troublesome.

233
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,200
Young Lady.

234
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,990
Don't get in my way.

235
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,850
Your Lordship.

236
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:16,090
I didn't expect to run into you here, Your Lordship.

237
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,340
Sit down.

238
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:28,280
Put your cleverness to good use.

239
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,550
Lord Ding. Wait, Lord Ding.

240
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,470
The topic posed by Wenzheng Parlor was quite audacious.

241
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,700
Earlier, I was puzzled and couldn't understand it.

242
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,560
Suddenly, I have a sudden realization at this moment.

243
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,530
You came to Wenzheng Parlor but didn't take the stage to speak.

244
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:56,240
This doesn't quite match your pursuit of fame and profit, does it?

245
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,990
When the gods fight, the innocent suffer.

246
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:02,800
I just want to climb the ranks and get wealthy, not get impacted.

247
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,070
Moreover, now that Shen Jinghong is a prominent figure in the capital,

248
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,990
it's difficult for others to gain fame.

249
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,540
After failing to gain fame,

250
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,650
they might end up becoming "masters of both literary and martial arts."

251
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,260
Did you catch up to me just to talk about these things with me?

252
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:26,730
After all, I'm working for Your Lordship.

253
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,420
Drop the act.

254
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,630
Stop uttering nonsense.

255
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:45,560
Mu Zhuohua, will you ever stop lying?

256
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,780
You even claimed to be under me.

257
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,810
Are you even working for me?

258
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,320
I...

259
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,990
It was a misunderstanding.

260
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,010
Lord Ding.

261
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,290
Zhimo, tell me.

262
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:16,320
What exactly is my uncle up to?

263
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:20,690
Did Zhijian recruit that person, too?

264
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,150
Fishing.

265
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:30,030
Over a small fry, Uncle had to sacrifice to this extent.

266
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,210
He's truly yielding for the greater good.

267
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,870
If it weren't for me finding out about this person's whereabouts,

268
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:43,210
how would I know you're trying to play up to me like this for your own benefit?

269
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,760
You should keep your ulterior motives away.

270
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,030
I won't use disloyal individuals.

271
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:58,500
Does pursuing one's own benefit mean it's wrong?

272
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,390
Can't a woman strive for her aspirations rather than being married off?

273
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,370
Lord Ding, you proposed to allow females to attend the examination.

274
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,140
But do you know that the female provincial graduate in front of you

275
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:15,590
has already exhausted all her energy just to arrive at Wenzheng Parlor?

276
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,470
Yes, a gentleman is truthful and I'm often dishonest.

277
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:24,270
But is it wrong for me to resort to any means for the sake of survival?

278
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,240
You mentioned loyalty.

279
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,130
Look at the answer I prepared.

280
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,680
   

281
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,580
If one is reckless for the sake of the country, that is an act of unparalleled bravery.

282
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,540
A tiger's nature is brave.

283
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,270
Yet, it also serves the country and the people.

284
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:56,200
Instead of keeping it captive, why not let it return to the wild?

285
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,410
Keeping it around puts other beasts under control.

286
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,570
Releasing it can deter threats.

287
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,930
This is how a tiger finds its rightful place.

288
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:08,380
   

289
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,790
Aren't you reckless, too?

290
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,940
- Zhijian. 
 - Yes, Your Lordship.

291
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,710
Escort them back.

292
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,310
Yes, Your Lordship.

293
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,350
Come on.

294
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,710
Butler Zhou.

295
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,410
Butler Zhou, they're gone.

296
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,990
Butler Zhou, what does Lord Ding mean by this?

297
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,750
Miss Seventh is indeed clever.

298
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,210
Follow them and find out where she lives.

299
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,840
Let's go.

300
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,741
 Let me see. 

301
00:21:21,741 --> 00:21:26,100
   

302
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,920
 Please line up! Everyone has one. 

303
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,220
 Don't push! Everyone will have one! 

304
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:35,510
Excuse me, I just want something lightweight.

305
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,760
Can I have the one without cotton?

306
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,480
The price is already quite reasonable.

307
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,960
Besides, in a couple of days, the weather will become chilly.

308
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,330
Don't you agree?

309
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,520
Yes, you're right about that.

310
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,460
I'll take two adult-sized ones.

311
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,930
All right.

312
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,000
Here you go. For two adults, right?

313
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,170
Thank you very much.

314
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,370
Take care.

315
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,510
All right, next!

316
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,490
Uncle Tan.

317
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:09,480
   

318
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,030
Oh, please don't address me that. 
    

319
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,070
I'm a commoner. 
    

320
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:16,610
I don't deserve to be addressed as such. 
    

321
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,000
Why didn't you take any children's clothes?

322
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,900
Hu...

323
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,010
Hu?

324
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,410
What's wrong with him?

325
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:32,830
Hu had typhoid fever.

326
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,000
He passed away...

327
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,810
Why didn't you tell me?

328
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,330
Hu was Tan Lin's only child.

329
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,710
Go to you?

330
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,910
Why should I?

331
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:56,540
Didn't Tan Lin also die after following you?

332
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,700
Your Lordship has elixirs.

333
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,360
Out of the thirty thousand soldiers from the Cangwu Army, only you survived.

334
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:11,230
Before the expedition, I was bedridden due to illness.

335
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,420
I told Tan Lin not to go.

336
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:17,240
But this child insisted anyway.

337
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,680
I dragged my sick body to your residence to beg you.

338
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,780
But what did you say?

339
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:29,280
You promised to bring Tan Lin back to me safe and sound.

340
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,580
But did he return safely?

341
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:41,590
Tan Lin was my only child.

342
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,410
Did you bring him back?

343
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,710
Did you?

344
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,420
Uncle.

345
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,850
Greetings, Uncle.

346
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,670
What brings you to Jishan Hall today?

347
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,930
I was passing by.

348
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,950
You can get back to your matters.

349
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:59,690
It seems Uncle hasn't fully recovered yet.

350
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,790
Just like Father.

351
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,200
They all have troubled hearts.

352
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:11,200
I didn't expect so many people would come for help on the first day of the Jishan Hall opening in the capital.

353
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,830
 Next! 

354
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:36,310
Your Highness, the ledgers of Jishan Halls from various regions have been sent over.

355
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,240
Please take a look.

356
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,890
   

357
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,960
All regions of Jishan Halls' past year's expenditures of silver,

358
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,620
grains, wood, cloth, paper, brush, and medicines are all recorded.

359
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,740
We have provided aid to more than three thousand people and set up ten schools

360
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,360
with five hundred students enrolling in the schools.

361
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:07,070
Your Highness, the impoverished people and students from humble backgrounds

362
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:10,650
who have received assistance are deeply grateful to you.

363
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:18,220
There are countless poor people in the world.

364
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,170
Jishan Hall merely helped one-tenth of them.

365
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:25,230
Besides, I didn't do this alone.

366
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,730
So don't mention this again in the future.

367
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,410
Yes, Your Highness.

368
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,650
We just set up Jishan Hall in the capital.

369
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,240
So we are short of manpower.

370
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,320
You should recruit more people.

371
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,440
Yes, Your Highness.

372
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,060
We need more help to teach children, write letters, and do other heavy and arduous chores.

373
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:46,490
I'll put up more recruitment notices, especially for teachers.

374
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:50,930
Currently, we have many children in the side courtyard who are learning to read and write.

375
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:53,911
 - Go home! 
 - Father, please let me go to school! 

376
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:55,130
 - Go home! 
 - No! I don't want to go home! 

377
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,140
 Come home with me! 

378
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,440
Father, please let me go to school!

379
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,130
For what? We don't have money to send you to school?

380
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:02,620
- Come with me! 
 - Let her stay.

381
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,890
You don't have to pay to study here.

382
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,890
A girl doesn't need to go to school. She'll marry someone sooner or later.

383
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,440
She still has a lot of chores to do back home.

384
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,650
I want to learn to read and write.

385
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:14,170
She stays. You can leave.

386
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:17,650
I want to give her a chance to study.

387
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,010
You're Princess Roujia?

388
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,930
You can stay at Jishan Hall.

389
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,710
You don't have to be afraid anymore.

390
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,210
Yes.

391
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:42,580
Take her with you.

392
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,380
Yes, Your Highness.

393
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,570
Come with me.

394
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:16,720
I saw a job advertisement here and thought I'd give it a try.

395
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,720
I didn't expect to be so lucky.

396
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:33,070
 Your Highness, when did you... 
   

397
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:46,790
Writing on sand is different from writing on paper.

398
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,400
You don't need to be so frugal.

399
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,170
Jishan Hall has already helped me a lot.

400
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,440
Writing materials are not cheap.

401
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,760
So are you going to answer your exams on the sand in the future?

402
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,820
Just come with me.

403
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,520
Next time, practice your writing in the study room.

404
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,030
You're writing it wrongly.

405
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:27,320
It's been so long. You've grown a lot.

406
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,610
It's been a while. But Your Highness is still the same.

407
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:41,370
It still doesn't look right.

408
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,330
   

409
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,280
Your Highness, it's been a while since you visited.

410
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,340
- We've missed you. 
 - We've missed you so much.

411
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,570
It's about time.

412
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,310
Time to go for your meal.

413
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:16,590
- Thank you, Your Highness. 
 - Thank you, Your Highness.

414
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,830
   

415
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,010
I didn't expect you would come and teach at Jishan Hall.

416
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,690
With the blessings of Your Highness

417
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:40,930
that I can come from that remote place to the bustling capital city.

418
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:44,150
So I wanted to help others as well.

419
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,890
The metropolitan examination is approaching.

420
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,010
You are meant to be a Master Scholar. 
  (Zhuàng yuán - top scorer in the palace examination - highest rank of the Imperial examination system) 

421
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,490
So focusing on your preparations is important.

422
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:54,390
Please rest assured. It won't affect me.

423
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,890
I'll be waiting to see how you perform.

424
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:06,060
Your Highness, Fuyun Temple will host a poetry event the day after tomorrow.

425
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,670
May I be bold to invite Your Highness to attend it with me?

426
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:12,350
Can I have the honor, Your Highness?

427
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,710
Considering the busy schedule at Jishan Hall lately,

428
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:19,030
it shouldn't be a problem if I have time.

429
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:23,740
Then I'll look forward to your gracious presence.

430
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,760
   

431
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,240
Young Lady, I'll go and open the door.

432
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,690
Young Lady.

433
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,810
Didn't Lord Ding tell you to escort us home?

434
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,990
But we haven't reached home yet.

435
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,420
You're right about that.

436
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,130
Good intentions always fall short.

437
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:52,650
It's not enough to just send you to the doorstep.

438
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,170
Or you can have dinner before leaving.

439
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:58,570
Juli has excellent culinary skills.

440
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,670
What are you doing?

441
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,890
Yeah.

442
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:05,420
I'm just trying to thank you for escorting us back.

443
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:08,820
Is there a need to wield your weapon?

444
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,960
Young Lady, don't be scared. I got you.

445
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,040
It's all right. It's all right.

446
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,410
All right, then.

447
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:20,010
Now that the sword is out of its sheath, surely, you have something to say.

448
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:22,040
So speak.

449
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,730
Young Lady...

450
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:27,710
I hope you don't think this will truly gain you favor with His Lordship.

451
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:32,760
I advise you to be cautious and not even try to take advantage of His Lordship.

452
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:38,740
Although Zhimo looks fierce, most of the time he's just trying to intimidate people.

453
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,980
But I'm different.

454
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,900
I can really...

455
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,610
Young Lady.

456
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,420
I can really kill you.

457
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,520
That was terrifying.

458
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,110
- Are you all right? 
 - I'm fine. Young Lady. I got you.

459
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:03,680
The people around Lord Ding are indeed not to be taken lightly.

460
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,280
Let's hurry.

461
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,610
Don't forget the bag.

462
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,730
Young Lady, go inside first.

463
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:14,130
Mister, come and take a look at these trinkets.

464
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,770
They are the latest trendy items.

465
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:24,440
 Where does this maidservant get her strength from? 

466
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:28,910
 I almost couldn't hold out and shame His Lordship. 

467
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:37,480
There, there. Don't be upset.

468
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,150
I'm going to tell Zhimo.

469
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:42,910
No, I'm telling Lord Ding.

470
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,690
You even want to tell on him.

471
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:48,730
Have you forgotten how the public perceives Lord Ding?

472
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:52,680
They say he's impotent

473
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:57,430
Young Lady. Young Lady, what does "impotent" mean?

474
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,360
You shouldn't listen to or speak of inappropriate things.

475
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:07,310
Remember not to spread such words.

476
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:10,110
You mustn't speak irresponsibly. Do you remember that?

477
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,710
Yes.

478
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,930
A person like Lord Ding,

479
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:20,240
who has experienced life and death on the battlefield won't be fooled by my little tricks.

480
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,720
I never intended to deceive him for long.

481
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,620
But, Juli, I'm genuinely scared.

482
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:31,180
For a nobody like me, I wouldn't want to die if I could live.

483
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:36,310
Forget it. As long as I can borrow his influence to solve my current problem, it's already good enough.

484
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,950
So did you manage to borrow it?

485
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,650
Yes.

486
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:53,660
My Lord, your health is not as good as before.

487
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,310
In the future, you mustn't get agitated in any situation.

488
00:34:56,310 --> 00:35:00,130
You must control your emotions.

489
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:04,140
The unresolved concerns are troublesome but must be resolved.

490
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:12,600
Otherwise, how can I face my 30,000 brothers again after I die?

491
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:17,860
Also, Zhijian once asked me something.

492
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,910
But I've been a physician for decades

493
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:25,470
and I've never heard of a medicine called Revival Powder.

494
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:28,390
I know you attach great importance to this matter.

495
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:33,110
I also indirectly asked other imperial physicians, and they all said

496
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:36,250
they had never heard of such a medicine.

497
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:40,890
Have you checked all the medical records of the Imperial Academy of Medicine?

498
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:44,040
I did, but there was no record of it.

499
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,310
Could Mu have made it up?

500
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,700
How can the prescription be made up?

501
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:54,110
The proportions of the prescription are supported by cases.

502
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:59,780
Then, I'll leave it to you then, Imperial Physician Zhao.

503
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,280
Zhimo, help me see him off.

504
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,580
Please come this way.

505
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,660
Mu Zhuohua.

506
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:23,410
I didn't expect you to stay at Flower Alley, Miss Seventh.

507
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:27,200
No wonder I couldn't find where you stayed even though I've checked everywhere in the capital.

508
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,580
You really have a trick up your sleeve.

509
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:34,470
Butler Zhou, I don't know what you're talking about.

510
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:37,220
I dare not probe into your matters.

511
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,780
But after this, you're going to sit for the national examination.

512
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,240
So what should we do about the marriage?

513
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:47,370
Butler Zhou, you say you dare not ask.

514
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,540
But you ask anyway.

515
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,670
I dare not.

516
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:55,740
It's just that I need to report back to my master.

517
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,640
Official Zhuang is still waiting for news.

518
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,380
What news?

519
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:04,160
Is he waiting for me to achieve success and return to my hometown,

520
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:09,860
or waiting for me to serve the privileged and rise to success?

521
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,470
Well... I...

522
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,700
I know you've been tailing me lately.

523
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,580
I'm sure you have questions, too.

524
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,590
But you already saw what happened.

525
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:23,530
At the entrance of Wenzheng Parlor, Lord Ding agreed

526
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:26,940
that I would work for him in the future,

527
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,960
which is why he instructed his people to escort me back here.

528
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:37,060
If you can't even tell, how can you gain trust from Official Zhuang in the future?

529
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,160
In the past few days, I've come to understand.

530
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,670
You're undoubtedly someone who will achieve great things.

531
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,930
Of course.

532
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,880
Butler Zhou, you're a clever person too.

533
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,340
I don't need to remind you more.

534
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:00,550
Between a mistress of a household or the support of the imperial court,

535
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:05,290
I think Official Zhuang knows what's best for him.

536
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:08,030
Don't you agree?

537
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:20,140
Young Lady. Young Lady.

538
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:23,460
Do you think Butler Zhou has really let us go?

539
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,750
Very likely.

540
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:29,060
Butler Zhou thinks I'm working for Lord Ding.

541
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,460
So he naturally won't press us too hard.

542
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,200
Although my father is the richest man in Jiangnan,

543
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:39,190
compared to these prominent figures in the capital, we're even less than ants.

544
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:42,670
Then will he go back and say something reckless?

545
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:47,330
What Official Zhuang will hear depends on what Butler Zhou reports to him.

546
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:52,120
Juli, go and bring out the five silver ingots we got earlier.

547
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,380
Tomorrow morning, go to the inn and give them to Butler Zhou.

548
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,410
Tell him to be careful with his words.

549
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:58,790
You can't, Young Lady.

550
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,890
You risked your life to earn this money.

551
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:03,160
Are you really going to give them to Butler Zhou like that?

552
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,220
Yes.

553
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:07,240
Only after I give him the money can I take the examination without worries

554
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:11,570
and truly not be affected by other distractions.

555
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:24,970
