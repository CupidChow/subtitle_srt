♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:35,080
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5

♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,159
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,259
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,479
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,579
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,579
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,019
   

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,959
   

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,939
   

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
   

19
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,890
Have a hot cup of tea.

20
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,490
This tea is clean and refreshing,

21
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,090
and the flavor lingers on.

22
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,069
Just like the young man who just left.

23
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,570
Grandaunt, you flatter him.

24
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,530
He came late at night.

25
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,750
Who is he?

26
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:18,089
He's just a poor scholar who's been helped by Jishan Hall,

27
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:21,148
and he came specifically today to express his gratitude in person.

28
00:02:21,149 --> 00:02:23,569
He's from a poor background?

29
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:29,009
Which poor scholar can be as talented as him?

30
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:37,069
I may be old and senile,

31
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:43,189
I still know the famous Shen Jinghong.

32
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:54,429
Jiaojiao, don't blame me for nagging you.

33
00:02:54,429 --> 00:02:57,669
Gather sweet blossoms while you may,

34
00:02:57,669 --> 00:03:01,289
and not the twig devoid of flowers.

35
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:04,250
Grandaunt, don't worry.

36
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,709
I know what I'm doing.

37
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,169
By the way, Grandaunt.

38
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:14,048
Why haven't I seen the Evil-erasing Sword? Where did you put it?

39
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:20,789
Why did you suddenly bring the Evil-erasing Sword up?

40
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:27,230
I just don't understand it.

41
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,428
The Evil-erasing Sword was handed down from Grandfather.

42
00:03:30,429 --> 00:03:34,610
It's sharp, it protects Southern Chen

43
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:38,189
and represents the supreme power of the imperial family.

44
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:42,309
Grandaunt, you've kept the sword for years

45
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:46,590
and never thought to unsheathe it?

46
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,249
The Evil-erasing Sword is an important weapon of the country.

47
00:03:51,249 --> 00:03:55,089
Although it's sharp, it can only be used once.

48
00:03:55,089 --> 00:03:57,090
I must be very careful

49
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,329
so as not to bring harm to the people of Southern Chen.

50
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:06,910
Roujia, you're a smart girl.

51
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,989
You should know what to ask

52
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:13,889
and what not to ask.

53
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:17,930
Grandaunt, I will keep your words in mind.

54
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,210
   

55
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:31,670
Yunqian, are you sure you don't want to help this time?

56
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,170
It's not that I don't want to,

57
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,970
it's that I can't.

58
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,070
No matter how much he's sinned,

59
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,030
he's still my father who gave me life and raised me.

60
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:49,770
I really...

61
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:02,309
Yunqian, you were born into a wealthy family...

62
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:06,489
and raised with great privileges.

63
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:11,129
But have you ever thought that those fine clothes and food

64
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:13,670
were really given to you by the Sun family?

65
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,908
No.

66
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:16,849
It's obvious that millions of people

67
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:20,910
in Southern Chen are providing for you.

68
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:27,729
You've been provided for so long.

69
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:32,149
Don't you really want to think about them for once?

70
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,070
I know you better than anyone else.

71
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,509
I know you're big-hearted and ambitious.

72
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:45,903
You'll make the right choice. Right?

73
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,869
If...

74
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:03,609
If I promise you that I can keep everyone in the Sun family safe,

75
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,430
will you help me

76
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,430
restore political clarity and peace to the people?

77
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,060
   

78
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:58,310
Jinghong, do you think...

79
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,810
do you think I wish my last name was Sun?

80
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,890
When every scholar first reads about improving people's livelihoods,

81
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:11,249
everyone is passionate about becoming a prominent figure one day

82
00:07:11,249 --> 00:07:14,640
and to take on the responsibility of governing the country for years to come.

83
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:20,969
There have been so many talented individuals throughout the ages.

84
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:23,349
But how many passionate scholars...

85
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:27,090
have there been?

86
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:32,469
And my last name is Sun.

87
00:07:34,369 --> 00:07:36,850
My last name is Sun.

88
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,409
You're a man of great talent.

89
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:43,529
Tell me. Is there a way...

90
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,110
to make both sides work?

91
00:07:54,489 --> 00:07:56,489
It's not your fault.

92
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,270
This is the ledger of Tian Xing Company.

93
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,280
   

94
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,289
Tian Xing Company?

95
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:32,189
The big trading company with branches all over the country?

96
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,809
Is it related to the Sun family?

97
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:35,809
That's right.

98
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,269
   

99
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:42,629
Everything you need is in this ledger.

100
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:53,609
Don't forget...

101
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,549
what you promised me.

102
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:06,288
Don't worry. I'm a man of my word.

103
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,020
   

104
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,790
   

105
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:31,860
   

106
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,540
   

107
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:03,909
Official Shen, you're accusing the Sun family. 
  iXuanzheng Palace Hall] 

108
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,890
Do you have any solid evidence?

109
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:11,229
Your Majesty, I do have some solid evidence.

110
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:26,490
Your Majesty, the biggest boss behind Tian Xing Company is the Sun family of Jiangzuo.

111
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,949
Sun Ru used his power for personal gain

112
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:31,409
and exploited the food for disaster relief,

113
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:33,669
which led to a loss of millions of taels to the government

114
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,010
and starvation in Huaizhou.

115
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:41,049
Your Majesty, please punish him severely as a warning to others.

116
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:43,030
Sun Ru.

117
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:46,990
With the evidence,

118
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,670
what do you have to say?

119
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:55,609
Your Majesty, I...

120
00:10:55,609 --> 00:10:58,149
I know I was wrong.

121
00:10:58,149 --> 00:10:59,929
Official Shen,

122
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:04,890
what do you think Sun Ru should be punished for?

123
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:10,050
I think Sun Ru's crimes are too many to mention.

124
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:19,490
However, this ledger was given to me by Sun Yunqian, Sun Ru's son.

125
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:22,549
Since Sun Yunqian is righteous enough to expose his father's deeds

126
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:27,070
and his ancestors helped the late emperor secure the country

127
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:31,030
and made remarkable achievements, please show some mercy

128
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,988
and spare the lives of the Sun family.

129
00:11:32,989 --> 00:11:36,989
If that's the case, well...

130
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:41,790
Your Majesty, I've got something to report.

131
00:11:56,229 --> 00:11:58,689
Official Zhou, what do you have to say?

132
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,270
I've found out

133
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,628
that Sun Ru not only defrauded the National Treasury

134
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:11,348
but also colluded with Northern Liang to smuggle salt and tea.

135
00:12:11,349 --> 00:12:15,330
All of this is recorded in this ledger.

136
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,789
Your Majesty, please have a look.

137
00:12:26,349 --> 00:12:28,030
Sun Ru, how bold you are!

138
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,868
How dare you collude with Northern Liang?

139
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:32,609
You're absolutely unforgivable!

140
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,810
I was thinking of sparing your life

141
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,810
because of the merits of your ancestors,

142
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:44,189
but I didn't expect you to collude with the enemy and commit treason!

143
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,109
Pass on my orders.

144
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,430
Sun Ru's crimes are so heinous

145
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,228
that he should be beheaded.

146
00:13:02,229 --> 00:13:05,209
The men of the Sun family will be exiled

147
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:09,689
while the women of the Sun family will be deprived of their birthright.

148
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:13,430
Your Majesty, Sun Ru is certainly guilty, but Sun Yunqian...

149
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:18,389
Sun Yunqian merited for reporting his father's misdeeds.

150
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:19,769
He's fully exonerated.

151
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:21,828
But... I've made up my mind.

152
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:23,669
No further advice is necessary.

153
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,210
You're wise, Your Majesty.

154
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:28,229
 You're wise, Your Majesty. 

155
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,160
   

156
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,070
Shen Jinghong!

157
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,170
What did you promise me?

158
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,930
You said you'd save everyone in the Sun family.

159
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,669
What's the result?

160
00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:38,189
I'm sorry.

161
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:40,270
Sorry?

162
00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:43,770
Does an apology help?

163
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,709
I'm asking you, does an apology help?

164
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,790
I thought you were my confidant,

165
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,749
but you used me.

166
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,950
Fine.

167
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:29,989
I, Sun Yunqian, have seen through you today.

168
00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:33,749
My father was right.

169
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:37,409
I was stupid.

170
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:39,189
I was too naive.

171
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:42,190
I brought down the Sun family!

172
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,330
Brother Jinghong.

173
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,230
No.

174
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,790
I should call you...

175
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,190
Official Shen.

176
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,050
A good one...

177
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:16,629
who keeps his word...

178
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:07,029
Your Highness.

179
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,228
Now that the Sun family has been crushed,

180
00:17:12,229 --> 00:17:15,049
the Zhou family is the most powerful in the imperial court.

181
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:18,860
Official Zhou, I've kept my promise.

182
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:22,360
Can we join forces now?

183
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,650
Have you been waiting long?

184
00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:00,010
In the imperial court today,

185
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,389
Zhou Cishan suddenly revealed

186
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:06,280
Sun Ru's collusion with Northern Liang and the smuggling of salt and tea.

187
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,830
His Majesty was furious

188
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,489
and sentenced Sun Ru to be beheaded,

189
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:15,660
all the men of the Sun family to be exiled as slaves,

190
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,490
while the women to be deprived of their birthright.

191
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,370
From now on,

192
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,129
there will be no more Suns in the imperial court.

193
00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:28,170
I have heard about it.

194
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,960
   

195
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:39,109
When did this happen?

196
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:40,330
What?

197
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,850
When did you start working with the Zhou family?

198
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,609
It's all over now.

199
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:52,600
What's the point of pursuing this?

200
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,340
The Sun family covered up bad deeds, embezzled public funds,

201
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,490
defrauded the National Treasury, cheated both the authorities.

202
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,430
There's solid evidence for all of this.

203
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,409
I didn't wrong anyone.

204
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,169
But I told you

205
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:08,790
that I promised Sun Yunqian that I'd keep his family safe.

206
00:19:10,209 --> 00:19:14,110
Wasn't that good friend of yours exonerated?

207
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,580
Since you've made up your mind,

208
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,309
I have nothing more to say.

209
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:45,170
Your Highness, Official Shen seems to be very angry.

210
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,010
It's no bother.

211
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,850
Let him be.

212
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:52,560
   

213
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,590
   

214
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,490
Regarding the Protected Appointments System,

215
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:45,950
Official Shen and Official Mu, what do you think about that?

216
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:50,280
Your Majesty, I have something to report.

217
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:11,429
You're not in favor of abolishing the Protected Appointments System,

218
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,970
but in favor of promoting the Talent Appreciation System.

219
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:16,609
Your Majesty,

220
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:21,088
it is not for nothing that the Protected Appointments System has lasted for hundreds of years.

221
00:21:21,088 --> 00:21:24,060
Descendants of most noble, poetic, and scholarly families

222
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,190
are better in literature and martial arts than poor and humble scholars.

223
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,310
And they have made a lot of contributions to the imperial court.

224
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:35,400
It would be a loss to the imperial court to abolish the Protected Appointments System.

225
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,268
Hence, in my opinion,

226
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:39,589
why don't we get rid of the bad and keep the good,

227
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,930
and show some appreciation for the talent?

228
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:53,150
Get rid of the bad and keep the good,

229
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,389
as well as show some appreciation for the talent?

230
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,029
That's right.

231
00:21:57,029 --> 00:22:00,949
An official of the seventh rank or above can appoint a son

232
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,149
to be a civil official of the third rank or above.

233
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:07,589
A military official of the second rank or above may enroll a son in the imperial academy.

234
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:15,380
You said in this report that the quota for the imperial examination will be increased

235
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,209
after the Protected Appointments System is brought under control?

236
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:21,150
That's right.

237
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:24,148
As long as the offspring of officials passes the metropolitan examination,

238
00:22:24,148 --> 00:22:27,349
he's bound to pass the palace examination.

239
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:30,189
Be it the Imperial Examination System or the Protected Appointments System,

240
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:34,850
the purpose is to select talent for the country, not to keep trash.

241
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,169
If one has no real talent,

242
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,028
then he should go home before it's too late,

243
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:42,670
lest he bring harm to himself, the country, and the people.

244
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:02,429
 I've only read the first volume 

245
00:23:02,429 --> 00:23:05,068
 of "Eradicating Corruption Proposal" written by Mr. Shang 

246
00:23:05,069 --> 00:23:09,268
 but I didn't know that the second volume is the most important one. 

247
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,829
 If it is hastily abolished, 

248
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,069
 we cannot be sure what will happen. 

249
00:23:14,069 --> 00:23:19,029
 That's the solution that works. 

250
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:21,490
 Although Mr. Shang was against the Protected Appointments System, 

251
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:24,909
 he never wanted to abolish it in one fell swoop. 

252
00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:26,969
 As His Lordship said, 

253
00:23:26,969 --> 00:23:31,890
 we should take a step-by-step approach and work our way up. 

254
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,068
   

255
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:45,869
 Sir, 

256
00:23:45,869 --> 00:23:50,030
 I almost went astray when I wasn't in my senses. 

257
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:54,100
 Fortunately, you enlightened me in the dark. 

258
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:58,749
 I'll follow in your footsteps and not let you down. 

259
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,810
 You've finally made it through. 

260
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:18,450
 Tutor Shang would be very proud of you in Heaven. 

261
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,910
   

262
00:24:29,889 --> 00:24:33,540
 My heart was filled with grief and indignation when Mr. Shang died. 

263
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:38,930
 For a long time, I couldn't calm my mind and think straight. 

264
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:42,610
 And I acted in a radical way. 

265
00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:46,929
 Even when I fought with the Sun family 

266
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:49,449
 and had the upper hand, 

267
00:24:49,449 --> 00:24:52,150
 I didn't feel happy. 

268
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:55,569
 On the contrary, I was rather depressed. 

269
00:24:59,509 --> 00:25:01,749
 I have something to tell you. 

270
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:05,330
 He Xin investigated and found 

271
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:10,049
 that two groups of people went to see Tutor Shang when he was alive. 

272
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:12,889
 What? 

273
00:25:12,889 --> 00:25:16,990
 The first group was sent by the Sun family 

274
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:21,510
 to warn Tutor Shang not to write any nonsense. 

275
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,749
 The second group... 

276
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:27,469
 is the one who killed Tutor Shang. 

277
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:32,570
 So you're saying 

278
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:35,930
 it wasn't the Sun family that killed Tutor Shang, 

279
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,269
 but someone else. 

280
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:52,309
 Killing my teacher is just a way to get me involved. 

281
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:57,320
 Only Princess Roujia can be so shrewd... 

282
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,829
 and knows me so well. 

283
00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:11,189
 Zhuohua, 

284
00:26:11,189 --> 00:26:13,969
 they're trying to confuse you. 

285
00:26:13,969 --> 00:26:16,989
 You mustn't fall into their trap. 

286
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:20,350
 They almost made it. 

287
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:26,130
 No, they never had a chance of winning. 

288
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:32,640
 As Tutor Shang said in this essay, 

289
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:38,830
 the continuation of the Protected Appointments System can't be achieved in a single day. 

290
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:44,569
 So the abolition of the Protected Appointments System won't be done in a day either. 

291
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:49,410
 I've found a lot of new directions in this essay by Tutor Shang. 

292
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,509
 My Lord, 

293
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:58,069
 are you willing to collaborate with me to find a more secure method for reform? 

294
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,726
 Yes. 

295
00:27:04,727 --> 00:27:09,917
♫  A trek of a lifetime, a barren hill  ♫

296
00:27:09,917 --> 00:27:14,547
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

297
00:27:14,547 --> 00:27:20,587
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

298
00:27:20,587 --> 00:27:27,317
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

299
00:27:27,317 --> 00:27:32,726
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

300
00:27:32,726 --> 00:27:37,747
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

301
00:27:37,747 --> 00:27:42,876
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

302
00:27:42,876 --> 00:27:47,921
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

303
00:27:47,921 --> 00:27:53,173
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

304
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:57,923
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

305
00:27:57,924 --> 00:28:03,463
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

306
00:28:03,463 --> 00:28:08,904
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

307
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:16,190
After long deliberation,

308
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,770
I think what Official Mu has said is well-founded

309
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,969
and sensible,

310
00:28:21,969 --> 00:28:26,210
and has taken into account the situation of both noble and low-class families.

311
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:30,349
It's a good idea worth trying.

312
00:28:31,449 --> 00:28:35,949
Official Mu, you do live up to my expectations.

313
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,589
Your Majesty, you flatter me.

314
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:41,330
I do not deserve your praise.

315
00:28:54,129 --> 00:28:57,229
Court adjourned!

316
00:29:00,649 --> 00:29:02,649
Uncle.

317
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,889
Your Majesty,

318
00:29:05,889 --> 00:29:09,649
I have something to add on the matter of the Protected Appointments System.

319
00:29:09,649 --> 00:29:12,109
Uncle, please go ahead.

320
00:29:12,109 --> 00:29:15,830
The protected appointments of the noble families has always been a tumor

321
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:18,490
that must be eradicated.

322
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,748
The Talent Appreciation System

323
00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:23,580
is just a stopgap measure for the transition period.

324
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,029
You and I share the same thoughts.

325
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,189
- Your Highness.  
 - Come in.

326
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,570
Today, in the imperial court,

327
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:04,270
Official Mu suddenly changed her mind

328
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,189
and proposed to get rid of the bad and keep the good,

329
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:08,490
as well as implement the Talent Appreciation System.

330
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:13,390
And His Majesty immediately agreed to her new proposal.

331
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,600
   

332
00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:24,830
Looks like you knew about it.

333
00:30:26,689 --> 00:30:29,869
I didn't expect her to take a different approach.

334
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:32,069
This way,

335
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:37,220
even though the noble families are unhappy, they won't act rashly.

336
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:41,090
And our plans have come to naught.

337
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:53,629
Coming up with a plan in such a short time that people can't find fault with,

338
00:30:53,629 --> 00:30:57,190
and convincing the proud and impetuous Liu Chen,

339
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:01,849
she is really the person who I've been looking out for.

340
00:31:01,849 --> 00:31:04,490
She's really something.

341
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:08,050
Official Mu is very talented indeed.

342
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:12,390
This Talent Appreciation System she proposed will definitely

343
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,590
have some value in time,

344
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:20,209
but it's too conservative for Southern Chen at the moment.

345
00:31:20,209 --> 00:31:25,700
And the influence of the noble families will not be crushed in any time.

346
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,228
If we don't get rid of them completely,

347
00:31:28,229 --> 00:31:30,670
Southern Chen will be hopeless.

348
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,449
It's all right.

349
00:31:35,449 --> 00:31:37,449
Our efforts...

350
00:31:38,409 --> 00:31:40,989
will not be in vain.

351
00:31:41,969 --> 00:31:45,109
When poor, humble scholars become officials,

352
00:31:45,109 --> 00:31:49,110
our power in the imperial court will surely grow.

353
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:53,000
Besides, Liu Chen's conflict with the noble families

354
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,289
has only been suppressed for the time being.

355
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:59,609
If there's the slightest fuss,

356
00:31:59,609 --> 00:32:01,530
there'll be trouble again.

357
00:32:02,969 --> 00:32:05,769
His Majesty has approved the Talent Appreciation System,

358
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:07,930
which will be implemented in a few days,

359
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:11,390
you must be relieved now.

360
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,969
It's a long way to go and there are many obstacles.

361
00:32:12,969 --> 00:32:14,830
This is just the beginning.

362
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,030
We've just taken the first step.

363
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:19,950
There's still a long way to go.

364
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:22,910
You and I share a common vision.

365
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,910
I advised His Majesty today

366
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:29,800
that the Protected Appointments System must be eradicated.

367
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,689
Hopefully, in the near future,

368
00:32:31,689 --> 00:32:35,069
the Talent Appreciation System will only bring out the real talent.

369
00:32:35,069 --> 00:32:39,300
From now on, regardless of gender, regardless of status,

370
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,268
only the best will be chosen, and only the talented will be appointed.

371
00:32:42,269 --> 00:32:47,490
I hope for equality for all in the country.

372
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:50,169
Even if we can't see that day,

373
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:54,050
it will come.

374
00:32:56,649 --> 00:32:58,249
No way.

375
00:32:58,249 --> 00:33:03,720
You must live long enough to see the arrival of that day.

376
00:33:06,409 --> 00:33:11,270
But some people don't want me to live long.

377
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:14,960
Then you must live a good life to piss her off.

378
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,750
First, she forged the testamentary edict.

379
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:21,150
Then, she spread the rumor that I was going to my fiefdom.

380
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:26,563
And now, she's stirring up conflict between the noble families and His Majesty.

381
00:33:27,229 --> 00:33:31,069
Roujia is wildly ambitious indeed.

382
00:33:31,069 --> 00:33:33,610
Not only is she wildly ambitious,

383
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:37,710
but she's clearly aiming for that position.

384
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:44,189
My brother entrusted me with his children.

385
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,190
Now, it seems...

386
00:33:47,469 --> 00:33:49,549
that I can't live up to that promise.

387
00:33:50,509 --> 00:33:54,709
My Lord, you've never done anything wrong to anyone.

388
00:34:02,509 --> 00:34:04,209
What's the matter?

389
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,330
I'm worried about Brother Sun.

390
00:34:07,409 --> 00:34:09,209
Sun Yunqian?

391
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:13,468
On the one hand, he's a righteous man,

392
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:16,188
and on the other, he's thinking of his family.

393
00:34:16,189 --> 00:34:19,969
That's why he decided to hand over the evidence of the Sun family's crimes.

394
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:23,529
The Sun family deserved it,

395
00:34:23,529 --> 00:34:26,269
but I'm afraid he can't get over it.

396
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,870
Does it hurt?

397
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:46,369
Your Highness, thank you for saving me by getting me out of hell.

398
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:51,310
We've known each other for a long time,

399
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:54,029
how can I just stand by and do nothing?

400
00:34:56,149 --> 00:35:00,589
Where are my mother and sister-in-law?

401
00:35:00,589 --> 00:35:03,230
Your Highness, do you know where they are?

402
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:07,409
The two of them are doing hard labor.

403
00:35:08,049 --> 00:35:11,930
Your Highness, can you please save them both?

404
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:17,568
I begged many times in front of His Majesty to get you out.

405
00:35:17,568 --> 00:35:22,850
His Majesty won't have mercy on your mother and sister-in-law.

406
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:27,650
How much longer will they both suffer?

407
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:30,190
We'll have to wait for His Majesty to show mercy.

408
00:35:34,069 --> 00:35:36,290
My mother is old.

409
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:40,169
My sister-in-law has always been weak.

410
00:35:40,169 --> 00:35:43,009
How can they stand doing hard labor?

411
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,968
I'm sure both of them are worried about you, too.

412
00:35:46,968 --> 00:35:50,009
So you must pull yourself together.

413
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,189
The Sun family doesn't deserve such a harsh punishment.

414
00:35:56,189 --> 00:35:58,729
His Majesty would like to be lenient.

415
00:36:00,109 --> 00:36:02,689
It wouldn't have been so bad...

416
00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:06,049
if someone hadn't tried to make things worse.

417
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:09,049
It's Mu Zhuohua.

418
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:12,310
It's Mu Zhuohua. Right?

419
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:16,489
If she hadn't kept targeting my father,

420
00:36:16,489 --> 00:36:19,049
how would the Sun family have...

421
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,569
I didn't expect that either.

422
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,989
I misjudged her.

423
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,670
I want to take revenge.

424
00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:36,030
Now is not the time to do so.

425
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:41,650
You mustn't do anything rash that might get you into trouble.

426
00:37:03,669 --> 00:37:06,129
I, Sun Yunqian,

427
00:37:06,989 --> 00:37:09,930
thought I could tell right from wrong,

428
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:14,791
and wanted to get away from the despicable world of the noble families,

429
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:20,609
but I just can't get away from it.

430
00:37:20,609 --> 00:37:22,390
Talent is everywhere?

431
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:25,189
Disregard for worldly affairs?

432
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,309
They're just delusions.

433
00:37:28,309 --> 00:37:30,350
I thought...

434
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:34,869
I could protect my father

435
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:37,349
and keep him with my mother.

436
00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:42,270
I thought I could keep my younger sister safe...

437
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:45,989
and my family happy.

438
00:37:48,629 --> 00:37:50,769
But in the end,

439
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:56,569
it's all for naught.

440
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,710
What a pity.

441
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,250
How ridiculous.

442
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,269
I, the unfilial son,

443
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:32,949
am here to apologize to you, Father.

444
00:38:32,949 --> 00:38:36,449
I hope we won't meet again...

445
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:40,230
in the next life.

446
00:39:28,029 --> 00:39:29,629
No.

447
00:39:30,349 --> 00:39:31,849
Brother.

448
00:39:34,009 --> 00:39:36,049
I'll get the imperial physician now.

449
00:39:36,049 --> 00:39:38,089
You'll be fine.

450
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,169
No.

451
00:39:47,169 --> 00:39:48,508
Don't leave me.

452
00:39:48,509 --> 00:39:51,210
Don't leave me! Don't die!

453
00:39:56,509 --> 00:39:58,529
Brother!

454
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:09,569
Yunyun,

455
00:40:10,469 --> 00:40:12,369
I'm sorry for your loss.

456
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,290
Yunyun.

457
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:46,309
This letter was written by your brother, wasn't it?

458
00:40:53,069 --> 00:40:56,030
 I've been a slacker all my life. 

459
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,628
 And I've never been ambitious. 

460
00:40:57,629 --> 00:40:59,349
 I've tried to get the best out of everything, 

461
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:01,450
 but it's hard to achieve it. 

462
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:04,649
 It's God's will that the Sun family can't be brought to power. 

463
00:41:04,649 --> 00:41:07,969
 Yunyun, don't make the same mistake I did. 

464
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:09,769
 Don't hold grudges. 

465
00:41:10,629 --> 00:41:12,850
You want me to not hold grudges?

466
00:41:13,509 --> 00:41:15,489
How is that possible?

467
00:41:20,389 --> 00:41:25,129
I'll make Mu Zhuohua pay for what she has done!

468
00:41:37,969 --> 00:41:41,369
Sun Yunqian committed suicide?

469
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,750
It's not your fault.

470
00:42:05,509 --> 00:42:07,850
Sun Yunqian wasn't wrong either.

471
00:42:09,669 --> 00:42:11,889
But he died just like that.

472
00:42:15,149 --> 00:42:20,049
It's Roujia who joined forces with the Zhou family

473
00:42:20,049 --> 00:42:22,609
and dealt a fatal blow to the Sun family.

474
00:42:23,989 --> 00:42:25,789
It's her again.

475
00:42:36,369 --> 00:42:38,469
Don't worry.

476
00:42:38,469 --> 00:42:40,870
I won't be driven by hatred.

477
00:42:41,669 --> 00:42:46,550
And I won't repeat the same mistake.

478
00:42:51,960 --> 00:43:02,020

♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

488
00:43:52,954 --> 00:43:56,673
♫  Obviously willing to swear life and death 
 to be entangled for a lifetime  ♫

489
00:43:56,674 --> 00:44:00,973
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

490
00:44:00,973 --> 00:44:07,174
♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

491
00:44:20,374 --> 00:44:27,773
♫  I can't forget the turmoil of love and hate, 
 even if the next day is far away  ♫

492
00:44:27,773 --> 00:44:36,133
♫  Two souls embrace in chaos, how can it be written off?  ♫

493
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:40,013
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

494
00:44:40,013 --> 00:44:43,753
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

495
00:44:43,753 --> 00:44:47,733
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

496
00:44:47,733 --> 00:44:51,073
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

497
00:44:51,074 --> 00:44:54,773
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

498
00:44:54,773 --> 00:44:58,453
♫  Obviously can't be erased, and haunted by lingering dreams  ♫

499
00:44:58,453 --> 00:45:02,433
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

500
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:10,014
♫  Want to have one more glimpse of you, 
 even just for a second more  ♫
