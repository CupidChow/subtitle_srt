1
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:25,160


2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,359
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,980
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:47,879
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,159
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,359
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:03,479
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,579
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,579
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:18,639
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

12
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:24,000
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,139
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:36,918
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,119
   

16
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,059
   

17
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:44,939
   

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,084
   

19
00:01:48,085 --> 00:01:49,759
   

20
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,898
 Zhuohua, 

21
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:52,699
you look exceptionally beautiful in this outfit today.

22
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,280
Is there something that's making you happy?

23
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,219
Thanks to First Prince and Your Highness.

24
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,378
The disaster situation has finally eased.

25
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:02,639
I can finally feel at ease because of this.

26
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:04,080
   

27
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,699
 Your Highness. 

28
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,418
 Your Highness. 

29
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,059
You're like a goddess descending to the mortal realm.

30
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,898
Thank you for saving our lives.

31
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,900
 - He's right. 
 - Thank you, Your Highness. 

32
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,299
Also, this kind-hearted official.

33
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,879
I've seen it very clearly.

34
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,458
She is one of the officials whohas been tirelessly working for us over the days.

35
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,939
 - Thank you, Official. 
 - Thank you, Official. 

36
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,818
Your Highness. Official.

37
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,299
We're not well-off, and we don't have much to offer.

38
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,138
This is a purse embroidered by my wife.

39
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:32,678
- Please accept it. 
 - This is my gift.

40
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:34,339
 - Please accept it. 
 - Please accept our gifts. 

41
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,918
We can't accept things for nothing.

42
00:02:35,918 --> 00:02:37,499
These are things we should do, anyway.

43
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,018
 - Your Highness, please accept it.  
 - Thank you.

44
00:02:39,018 --> 00:02:40,579
 - Please accept our gifts.  
 - Thank you.

45
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:41,899
- Official. Your Highness. 
 - Please accept our gifts.

46
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,039
- Many thanks. 
 - Thank you.

47
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,760
Thank you.

48
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,939
Thank you all.

49
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,378
These are my favorites, and I'm giving them to you.

50
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:49,418
What are these?

51
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,559
These are colorful pebbles.

52
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:54,220
Colorful pebbles?

53
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,378
Thank you, Your Highness.

54
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,339
Then we won't be in your way anymore.

55
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,820
Thank you, Your Highness and Official.

56
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,219
- Thank you, Your Highness. 
 - Thank you, Official.

57
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,920
It's our responsibility.

58
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,760
Your Highness, I now understand why you established Jishan Hall.

59
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,459
Well, tell me your thoughts.

60
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,759
To let more children have colorful pebbles to play with.

61
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:24,298
As an official before this, I always thought about making a path for myself.

62
00:03:24,298 --> 00:03:28,719
But from now on, I want to make a path for everyone as well.

63
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:40,359
 I was wondering where you were. 

64
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:41,658
 It turns out you were here. 

65
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:42,818
Sleeping, huh?

66
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:44,719
Did I say you can sleep?

67
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,138
I told you to attend to Old Madam's illness.

68
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:50,039
Yet you're slacking off right here?

69
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,019
Look at you.

70
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,678
You can't have children or take care of others.

71
00:03:54,678 --> 00:03:56,739
Why should I raise you, then?

72
00:03:56,739 --> 00:03:58,980
Zhuang Wenfeng,

73
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,899
you know very well what happened to my child.

74
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,160
He was four months old and was already moving.

75
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,500
You were the one who beat him to death!

76
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,659
Wait... Are you... Are you blaming me now?

77
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,540
How dare you!

78
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,800
Zhuang Wenfeng, are you even human?

79
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,440
I just had a miscarriage.

80
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,420
I only wanted to rest for a while in the room because I wasn't feeling well.

81
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,179
And you started hitting and kicking me.

82
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:39,279
Listen here.

83
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:43,619
I did not marry into the Zhuang family to be your servant!

84
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,059
Unbelievable. It's outrageous, completely outrageous!

85
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,499
You dare talk back to me?

86
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,178
You're talking back to me? 
 - Let me go!

87
00:04:49,178 --> 00:04:50,940
You dare to talk back to me?

88
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,390
Let me go! Stop it!

89
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:55,099
This is what you get for talking back to me! Do it again!

90
00:04:55,099 --> 00:04:58,439
 I have something to report. Official Zhuang! 

91
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,819
 Official Zhuang! 

92
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:01,520
What is it?

93
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,939
You'd better reflect on your actions.

94
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,250
   

95
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:19,859
What is it?

96
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:24,080
Official Zhuang, Mu Zhuohua has returned.

97
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,739
- Really? 
 - Yes.

98
00:05:25,739 --> 00:05:29,499
But you're heading to the capital next month for the triennial evaluations.

99
00:05:29,499 --> 00:05:32,380
- Well... 
 - I've taken care of the things there.

100
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:37,320
But before I leave, I must settle things here first.

101
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,899
You must deliver this to First Prince for me.

102
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,860
Seventh Sister.

103
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,410
   

104
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,019
How fate has played tricks on us.

105
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:08,099
I was the one eager to get married.

106
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,139
Yet, because you got caught in the rain, and I lost my chance to get married.

107
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:16,400
But unexpectedly, you ran away from marriage.

108
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:20,119
And I ended up marrying the person I wanted.

109
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:23,819
Speaking of which, I have to thank you, Seventh Sister.

110
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,760
By the way, why didn't you go home since you've returned?

111
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,980
How have you been lately?

112
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:41,859
My life has been hard, of course.

113
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:45,779
It's nothing like your high life.

114
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:58,220
Eighth Sister, have you been doing well?

115
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,100
Of course, I have.

116
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,740
That's why I want to thank you, Seventh Sister.

117
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,739
How about this?

118
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:10,599
Instead of wine, I'll use this cup of tea to give you a toast.

119
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:40,619
Seventh Sister?

120
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,378
Why did you come back since you've run away from that marriage?

121
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:51,898
It's fine even if you returned.

122
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:54,779
But why did you let Butler Zhou see you?

123
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,860
 You'd better listen to me. 

124
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,619
 She's nothing more than an illegitimate daughter. 

125
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,140
 Your mother said she was mine long ago. 

126
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,939
 It's only reasonable and lawful for me to bring back my runaway concubine. 

127
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:09,700
 What are you worrying about? 

128
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,839
 But if you defy me, 

129
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,599
 you know what I'll do to you. 

130
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,280
 Do you hear me? 

131
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,759
 Huh? 

132
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,400
Just blame yourself for this.

133
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,760
My beauty, you're finally in my hands.

134
00:08:58,219 --> 00:09:02,060
Do you know I've been looking for you everywhere?

135
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:13,199
Official Zhuang, I've finally met you.

136
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:14,698
Wait.

137
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:15,779
What's going on here?

138
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,919
You wanted to see me?

139
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:20,080
Didn't you escape?

140
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,240
I heard you were working under Lord Ding...

141
00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:29,859
when you were in the capital.

142
00:09:29,859 --> 00:09:31,999
Why did you come back?

143
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:38,680
Official Zhuang, Lord Ding is a fickle person.

144
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,459
How can he be a reliable long-term support?

145
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,140
Besides,

146
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:48,099
I didn't intend to escape the marriage back then.

147
00:09:48,099 --> 00:09:50,580
You didn't intend to escape the marriage?

148
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,880
How so?

149
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,578
Think about it, sir.

150
00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:58,580
If I did intend to escape, why would I return now?

151
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,498
Actually, that day, I didn't intend to run away from the marriage.

152
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:04,978
I was knocked unconscious and sent away.

153
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,779
What happened?

154
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,580
Sir, you don't know this.

155
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,978
I'm only an illegitimate daughter of the Mu family.

156
00:10:13,979 --> 00:10:18,218
I never received any affection from the First Madam of the family and went through a lot of hardships.

157
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,579
And you're the respected county magistrate.

158
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:24,098
It's a blessing for me to be able to associate with you.

159
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:26,299
How could I possibly want to run away from the marriage?

160
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,140
I then gave the situation a thought.

161
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,839
The marriage didn't go according to plan,

162
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,260
and I was accused of escaping the marriage.

163
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,700
So, I could only find a supporter in the capital.

164
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,900
Who... Who did it?

165
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,740
After giving it thought,

166
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,939
Eighth Sister is likely behind it.

167
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,240
Her?

168
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:51,500
Why would she do that?

169
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,558
You may not know, but that day, Eighth Sister invited me to the mountains to offer incense.

170
00:10:56,558 --> 00:10:59,919
Only then did I realize that she wanted to marry you.

171
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:02,738
She thought I was dull and ordinary,

172
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:06,179
which would make her appear more beautiful in comparison.

173
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:12,219
But who knew that heavy rain would bring us together,

174
00:11:12,219 --> 00:11:15,459
and I caught your attention.

175
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:17,059
Eighth Sister worked hard planning this.

176
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,179
But her effort ended up benefiting someone else.

177
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,859
She felt upset and sought revenge against me.

178
00:11:22,859 --> 00:11:23,978
Outrageous!

179
00:11:23,979 --> 00:11:25,239
Guards!

180
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,680
Bring that wretched woman here!

181
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,260
Greetings, sir.

182
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,160
Why have you called for me?

183
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,419
You wretched woman!

184
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,818
You were the one who hired people to abduct Miss Seventh that day and ruined my plan!

185
00:11:43,818 --> 00:11:45,859
- Sir, why do you say that? 
 - You...

186
00:11:45,859 --> 00:11:48,618
Sister, you invited me to the mountain

187
00:11:48,619 --> 00:11:50,939
because you wanted to marry him.

188
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,738
I never intended to compete with you.

189
00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:54,519
So why did you harm me?

190
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:56,419
I didn't do it!

191
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,419
We lived close to each other.

192
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,539
If I disappeared, you would have known right away.

193
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,259
But when did you tell our parents about it?

194
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,599
I didn't hire anyone to abduct her.

195
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:10,499
I wouldn't have the ability to do so.

196
00:12:10,499 --> 00:12:12,578
Oh, no. You truly are quite resourceful.

197
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:16,359
Otherwise, how could you have gathered such detailed information

198
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:18,098
about when he went up the mountain?

199
00:12:18,099 --> 00:12:19,978
- Mu Zhuohua, you... 
 - Guards!

200
00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:21,779
Take her away and lock her up!

201
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:23,579
No visitation is allowed!

202
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,640
Come with me, please.

203
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,098
Sir, please calm down.

204
00:12:38,099 --> 00:12:41,399
Today is a joyful day.

205
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:46,379
Sir, could you please have someone fetch some rouge for me?

206
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,639
I want to do makeup.

207
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,539
Of course.

208
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:03,659
Sir, could you wait outside for me?

209
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:08,379
I'd like to surprise you after getting ready.

210
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,299
Can't I stay here instead?

211
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,779
Sir, it'll just be a moment.

212
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:17,080
When I'm ready, I'll call you right away.

213
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,899
There's no rush, sir. Please wait a moment.

214
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:22,579
Just be patient, sir.

215
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:24,480
I'll be ready soon.

216
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,840
 Isn't that Zhijian? 

217
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:43,779
 If this is Zhuang's Residence's side courtyard, 

218
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,920
 it's easier to hide documents of illicit dealings here. 

219
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,539
 Could it be that it's not in the warehouse? 

220
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,380
 (Various types of grain) 

221
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,338
 You're unbelievable, Zhuang Wenfeng. 

222
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:32,339
 You're indeed involved in the missing official grain. 

223
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,660
 Ledgers? 

224
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:47,738
You did come with intentions.

225
00:14:47,739 --> 00:14:50,659
I was wondering why you were willing to come to me.

226
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,899
It turns out you were here with a plan.

227
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,019
Get her!

228
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,520
Zhijian!

229
00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:02,419
Leave now.

230
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:05,218
 After them! 

231
00:15:05,219 --> 00:15:06,539
Kill them if you can't catch them!

232
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,540
Kill them all!

233
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,338
It's Zhijian.

234
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:52,939
He's in danger.

235
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,020
Follow it.

236
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:15,690
♫  It's you who stripped me of my armor  ♫

237
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:22,890
♫  Melting into your gaze like snowflakes  ♫

238
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:29,310
♫  Walking through the flying sand raised by the years  ♫

239
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,550
♫  Allowing each other's wounds to scab over  ♫

240
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:43,290
♫  Love is the concern that's burning in the heart  ♫

241
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:50,290
♫  Like the stars chasing the horizon  ♫

242
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:57,690
♫   It's burning within my heart and nourishing it for a lifetime  ♫

243
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:06,158
♫  Love is silent, no matter how far away it is, 
 it is measured by fate  ♫

244
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:13,399
♫  This untainted heart imprints your image  ♫

245
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:19,805
♫  Like a shadow, it accompanies me around the world  ♫

246
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:27,140
♫  This untainted love, makes two complete double rainbows  ♫

247
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:33,156
♫  Longing is a home to love  ♫

248
00:17:33,156 --> 00:17:39,950
♫  Love is the concern that's burning in the heart  ♫

249
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:46,870
♫  Like dead wood longing for floating flowers in the air  ♫

250
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:54,631
♫   It's burning within my heart and nourishing it for a lifetime  ♫

251
00:17:54,631 --> 00:17:58,936
♫  The flowers of two trees that grow together as one 
 and embrace each other will never decay  ♫

252
00:17:58,936 --> 00:18:03,978
♫  The flowers of two trees that grow together as one 
 and embrace each other will never decay  ♫

253
00:18:03,979 --> 00:18:05,779
Are you hurt?

254
00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:07,260
No.

255
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,919
My Lord, why are you here?

256
00:18:26,219 --> 00:18:27,719
My Lord!

257
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:33,379
Zhuang Wenfeng, you corrupted scum.

258
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,480
Do you know who she is?

259
00:18:36,219 --> 00:18:39,099
She's Mu Zhuohua, a sixth-rank official of the Hanlin Academy

260
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,240
and a court official appointed by His Majesty.

261
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:47,819
You sure have a lot of nerve.

262
00:18:57,459 --> 00:18:59,299
How is His Lordship?

263
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,658
The Yuanluo Flower and Snow Dust Pill in His Lordship's body

264
00:19:04,658 --> 00:19:06,379
have been maintaining a delicate balance.

265
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,819
He shouldn't use force recklessly.

266
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,698
He exerted his strength with force just now.

267
00:19:09,699 --> 00:19:11,679
Not only did it damage his meridians,

268
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,739
but it also caused a struggle between these two energies.

269
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:16,420
Do you have any solution?

270
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,819
Go to the Mu Residence.

271
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,179
Where's Zhijian?

272
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,260
Zhijian will meet us after he reports our safety to the First Prince.

273
00:19:35,121 --> 00:19:39,978
   

274
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:41,379
Who are you?

275
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,158
- Why are you here? 
 - Greetings, Your Highness.

276
00:19:51,158 --> 00:19:53,078
I came to Jiangnan with Lord Ding on official duties.

277
00:19:53,078 --> 00:19:54,879
Uncle is also here?

278
00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:55,919
That's perfect.

279
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,419
Follow me and rescue Mu Zhuohua.

280
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,778
Your Highness, Official Mu is safe.

281
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:01,779
She sent me to bring the news of her safety to you.

282
00:20:02,385 --> 00:20:04,798
However, His Lordship

283
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:06,699
Uncle is injured?

284
00:20:08,219 --> 00:20:09,538
Where is he? Take me to him now.

285
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:14,199
Your Highness, Official Mu has taken His Lordship to a relative's house for treatment.

286
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:16,159
You don't need to worry.

287
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,218
She also said the current situation is unstable.

288
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:21,520
You need to stay at the county office to reassure the people.

289
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:26,239
I understand.

290
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,420
Take care of Uncle.

291
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,980
I'll handle the disaster relief.

292
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,787
Yes, Your Highness.

293
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,439
Your Highness, we counted the grains in the granary

294
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:38,419
and found that the quantity of relief grains doesn't match up.

295
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,179
I'm afraid Zhuang Wenfeng has sold off most of it.

296
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,719
How much longer can the remaining grain last?

297
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:46,179
If we continue making congee with the same amount as before,

298
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,500
it can only last for up to seven days.

299
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,778
Transport the remaining relief grain to the congee stall.

300
00:20:53,779 --> 00:20:59,199
I'll issue an order to nearby counties to send a new batch of relief grain.

301
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,939
The congee portion must be the same as the previous days.

302
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,379
We mustn't deceive the people.

303
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,880
Yes, Your Highness.

304
00:21:08,499 --> 00:21:09,759
Why are you still here?

305
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,520
Go and take care of Uncle.

306
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,639
Your Highness, I haven't finished my words.

307
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:17,299
Then go on.

308
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:22,158
Have you heard?

309
00:21:22,158 --> 00:21:24,859
County Magistrate Zhuang has been arrested by First Prince, who came from the capital.

310
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:27,078
 It serves him right. That Zhuang has been overbearing for too long. 

311
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:28,859
 It's about time he was caught. 

312
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,899
 This is karma catching up to him. 

313
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,600
 Indeed. 

314
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,059
 Zhuang Wenfeng has caused the people to suffer. 

315
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:40,419
 Yet, he's still safe to this day. 

316
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:44,240
 The situation in Jiangnan is quite complicated. 

317
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:52,000
   

318
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:04,619
Now that County Magistrate Zhuang has been arrested,

319
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:10,920
I wonder if all the business dealings we colluded in before will come to light.

320
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:17,959
That depends on the relationship between you and County Magistrate Zhuang.

321
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:19,760
Stop teasing me.

322
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,439
Master! Madam!

323
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,599
Master. Madam. Miss Seventh has returned.

324
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,840
Qi?

325
00:22:32,879 --> 00:22:35,599
Didn't she marry County Magistrate Zhuang?

326
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,380
Why is that darned lass back now?

327
00:22:41,639 --> 00:22:42,939
Master...

328
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:48,399
Madam, wasn't it Miss Eighth who married County Magistrate Zhuang?

329
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,960
Don't I know that?

330
00:22:54,697 --> 00:22:58,830
   

331
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:07,698
Did you report it to First Prince?

332
00:23:07,699 --> 00:23:09,599
How's His Lordship?

333
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:16,339
What's going on here? Why is this carriage in the courtyard?

334
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:19,139
Miss Seventh... She has an official badge.

335
00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:23,040
Official badge? I have a belt!

336
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,600
   

337
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,000
Administrator of the Ministry of Rites?

338
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,620
Official Mu.

339
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:42,879
It's been a while.

340
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:45,739
Old Master Mu, we meet again.

341
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,979
Is First Prince in the carriage?

342
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,559
His Highness didn't come. I have an urgent matter.

343
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,200
Hope you can lend a chamber to me.

344
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,979
Of course, it's not a problem. Please come inside.

345
00:23:59,979 --> 00:24:03,698
Qi, you know the way. Take your friend there.

346
00:24:03,698 --> 00:24:06,539
If you need anything, just let me know.

347
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:08,359
Thank you, Mother.

348
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:17,619
My dear, what did you call her?

349
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,799
Qi?

350
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,859
Your daughter, Qi.

351
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:26,498
- She's my daughter, Qi? 
 - Yes.

352
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:30,100
My dear, is she really my daughter?

353
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:04,019
His Lordship's pulse has stabilized for now.

354
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:06,179
Stay here and take care of His Lordship. I'll be back soon.

355
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,439
- Is His Lordship... 
 - Is His Lordship safe now?

356
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:12,519
I won't let anything happen to him.

357
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,978
 My Lord,  you must survive. 

358
00:25:17,979 --> 00:25:23,200
 You're the pillar of the Cangwu Army, the unyielding rock of Southern Chen 

359
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,620
 As long as you're here, the spirit of the Cangwu Army will never fade! 

360
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:32,079
 - My Lord, you must survive. 
 - Live on! 

361
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:43,580
Mother, you must watch over him.

362
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,560
Bless him so that he'll be safe.

363
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,660
Be safe and sound.

364
00:25:52,879 --> 00:25:57,479
With so many courtyards in the residence, why did she pick this one?

365
00:25:58,199 --> 00:26:00,760
Isn't this too shabby?

366
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,099
This won't work. I must move them to a better place.

367
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,980
Qi, I was looking for you.

368
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,840
- Listen, I... 
 - I was looking for you, too.

369
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,279
What is it? You can tell me.

370
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,698
I want that Qinghe sprig from the dispensary.

371
00:26:19,699 --> 00:26:22,819
What did you say? You little rascal. You...

372
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:31,498
Well, Qi. You have to know that Qinghe sprig is very valuable.

373
00:26:31,499 --> 00:26:34,418
It's a life-saving medicinal herb. Choose something else.

374
00:26:34,418 --> 00:26:36,738
- I'll surely satisfy your request. 
 - I only want the Qinghe sprig.

375
00:26:36,738 --> 00:26:38,579
I need it urgently.

376
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,500
I can't...

377
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:47,919
I know what you're worried about.

378
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,298
Don't worry.

379
00:26:49,299 --> 00:26:53,620
With me around, what Zhuang Wenfeng has done won't implicate you.

380
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,180
Can you really handle it?

381
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,980
Of course.

382
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,199
I may be merely a sixth-rank official.

383
00:27:02,199 --> 00:27:05,999
But currently, I'm working for First Prince.

384
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:10,540
The successful relief efforts in Jiangnan are thanks to First Prince.

385
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,919
After we return, we will definitely be generously...

386
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,119
You're right.

387
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:19,899
The Qinghe sprig is now yours.

388
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,719
- Did you manage to get the medicinal herb? 
 - It's being decocted.

389
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:53,599
Is he all right now?

390
00:27:54,459 --> 00:27:56,339
He's safe for now.

391
00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:04,999
I wonder how the First Prince's interrogation of Zhuang Wenfeng is going.

392
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:08,779
By the way, there are some ledgers in the hidden compartment of Zhuang Wenfeng's side courtyard.

393
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:12,139
- You must find them. 
 - All right. You can leave it to me.

394
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,080
What's the matter?

395
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,620
You seem different now.

396
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,399
Why are you so nagging?

397
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,219
Do you want me to go or not?

398
00:28:28,219 --> 00:28:31,498
Of course. Only you can handle it, Hero Zhijian.

399
00:28:31,499 --> 00:28:33,099
Off you go now.

400
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:35,899
Who's there?

401
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,280
 Who are you? 

402
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:46,538
- What's the matter? 
 - Qi. Qi, what's wrong with this person?

403
00:28:46,538 --> 00:28:49,018
He appeared out of nowhere and gave me a fright.

404
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,079
I didn't lay a finger on him.

405
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,599
I know.

406
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,319
What were you doing hiding outside?

407
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:58,499
I... I wasn't doing anything.

408
00:28:58,499 --> 00:29:01,161
- He was eavesdropping. 
 - Eavesdropping?

409
00:29:01,161 --> 00:29:04,219
Oh, no, no, no. How could I be eavesdropping?

410
00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:08,839
I only wanted to give you some advice.

411
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:10,940
Advice for what?

412
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:14,958
Qi, you may not admit it. But I understand.

413
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:18,439
Isn't it about choosing a man? It's no big deal.

414
00:29:18,439 --> 00:29:21,379
But let me tell you. You have a bright future ahead.

415
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:25,600
So you must choose the people around you carefully.

416
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,039
Look at that lad behind you. You can never choose him.

417
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:30,418
- I beg your pardon. 
 - Listen.

418
00:29:30,418 --> 00:29:32,820
- He has a bad temper. 
 - Ignore him.

419
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:37,159
Don't take it to heart. He's talking nonsense.

420
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,819
Qi, listen to me.

421
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,739
I'm not done talking, Qi.

422
00:29:48,459 --> 00:29:51,200
Qi, I'm experienced.

423
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,719
A person's character is crucial. And...

424
00:29:58,779 --> 00:30:02,898
Also, you must make the decision in the household.

425
00:30:02,898 --> 00:30:04,980
Rules must not be disregarded.

426
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,738
So, tell me.

427
00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:10,779
Which one did you choose?

428
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:12,419
   

429
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,258
Your Highness, I'm innocent.

430
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:19,440
I wouldn't dare to switch the grain distributed by the court.

431
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,018
Someone must have framed me.

432
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,860
Please make a fair judgment for me.

433
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:31,380
Butler Zhou. He must have done it behind my back.

434
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,900
Butler Zhou is a mere servant.

435
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:38,180
Without your permission, how would he dare to switch disaster relief grain?

436
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:44,100
Besides, this is only a portion of the official grain.

437
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,240
Where is the rest?

438
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,339
Fess up now.

439
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:52,340
Your Highness, I'm telling the truth.

440
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:56,099
You... You may be a high-ranking noble.

441
00:30:56,099 --> 00:30:59,080
But I am an appointed official of the court.

442
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,879
You surely can't force a confession from me.

443
00:31:02,879 --> 00:31:05,020
Outrageous!

444
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:11,379
 By the way, 

445
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,778
 Official Mu wants me to remind Your Highness one thing. 

446
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:17,399
 Zhuang Wenfeng may have no guts. But he's cunning. 

447
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,418
 She hopes that you won't act impulsively to avoid falling for his tricks. 

448
00:31:23,499 --> 00:31:25,099
Fine.

449
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:29,540
Since you said you were framed,

450
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,799
follow me back to the capital

451
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,420
so that the law can seek justice for you.

452
00:31:37,259 --> 00:31:39,538
Your Highness. Your Highness! Your Highness!

453
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:41,819
Your Highness! I'm innocent, Your Highness!

454
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,218
Your Highness, please! Let me explain, Your Highness!

455
00:31:43,219 --> 00:31:46,060
I'm innocent, Your Highness!

456
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:50,679
 These may be old injuries. But you still need to be careful. 

457
00:31:56,979 --> 00:31:58,679
Thank you.

458
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,040
Don't mention it.

459
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,000
You've been nice to Juli, after all.

460
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:11,819
Juli always talks about food.

461
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,140
Other than that, you're the one she talks about the most.

462
00:32:18,459 --> 00:32:20,639
You must not mistreat Juli.

463
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:22,139
Do you hear me?

464
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,040
I won't.

465
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,579
I'm glad to hear that.

466
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,140
Is this where you two lived?

467
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:40,920
Yes. My father has many concubines.

468
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:47,399
We're lucky to have a place to stay and enough to eat and wear.

469
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,780
Juli used to be picked on in other places.

470
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,799
She doesn't eat a lot because she's greedy.

471
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:59,000
But if she doesn't eat, there won't be anything for her.

472
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:09,760
 - Are you hungry? 
   

473
00:33:16,499 --> 00:33:19,980
 I'm going out for a while. Can you keep a lookout for me? 

474
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,018
 Thank you, Juli. 

475
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:52,899
 Did you finish your steamed bun? 

476
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:55,319
 I'll get you more next time. 

477
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,860
 I'll get going first. 

478
00:34:02,219 --> 00:34:05,379
The older maid found out about Juli keeping a lookout for me.

479
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,460
She'd rather get punished than reveal my secret.

480
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,819
What happened after that?

481
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:16,040
Later, I begged my mother to talk to First Madam to let Juli come to us.

482
00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:24,060
That's how Juli became the closest person to me besides my mother.

483
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:32,680
At that time, my mother forced me to take lessons with Tutor Shang every day.

484
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,658
At first, I thought First Madam was indifferent to us

485
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:41,039
because she thought nothing useful would come out of this shabby courtyard.

486
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:46,179
But when I think about it, she even agreed to assign Juli to our courtyard.

487
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,219
It shows how smart and capable she is.

488
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:53,360
Anything happening in this family cannot be hidden from her.

489
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,840
First Madam's situation was similar to my mother's at first.

490
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,219
She thought she found a good husband.

491
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:06,359
So she brought a huge dowry and married my father.

492
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:09,360
It gave my father the capital to start his business.

493
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:18,980
But who would have thought that this man

494
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,760
would fancy other women?

495
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,240
He married them one by one

496
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,699
and brought them home.

497
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,879
Once they got here, he would neglect them.

498
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:36,900
Yet, how many women can be like First Madam,

499
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,579
who can make their own decisions?

500
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:49,760
But my mother had it better than Miss Song and the others.

501
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,760
Look at that portrait.

502
00:35:57,759 --> 00:35:59,560
That's my mother.

503
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:05,180
Doesn't she look beautiful when she smiles?

504
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,079
Everyone says,

505
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:14,859
"A single glance and smile can captivate the entire city."

506
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,259
That's how her name came about.

507
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,680
My Lord?

508
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,300
My Lord, you're awake.

509
00:36:30,139 --> 00:36:32,500
My Lord, you're finally awake.

510
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,159
How do you feel?

511
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:41,660
I just dreamed of you.

512
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:46,979
What did you dream of me?

513
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:53,280
I saw you saving my life.

514
00:36:54,499 --> 00:36:57,319
You were the one who saved my life.

515
00:36:57,319 --> 00:36:59,300
Let me check your pulse.

516
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,299
Qinghe sprig is working.

517
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,259
The energy of the two medicines within His Lordship's body has stabilized.

518
00:37:16,243 --> 00:37:18,828
   

519
00:37:19,499 --> 00:37:20,819
How is His Lordship?

520
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,320
He's awake.

521
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,278
- Why are you stopping me? 
 - His Lordship is talking to Mu.

522
00:37:26,278 --> 00:37:29,279
You will be a spoiler.

523
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:33,799
I really have to thank you for this.

524
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:38,200
My Lord, no need to thank me.

525
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:46,300
By the way, the jade pendant you gave me was shattered.

526
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,300
It took a blow for me.

527
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,979
Let it be, then.

528
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:55,999
I gave you the jade pendant as a protective charm.

529
00:37:55,999 --> 00:38:01,059
Now that it has protected you once, you can say it has served its purpose.

530
00:38:01,059 --> 00:38:03,059
Thank you, My Lord.

531
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:05,259
You're such a kind person.

532
00:38:05,259 --> 00:38:07,180
Back then...

533
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:13,499
Back then, it was my mother who protected me.

534
00:38:24,979 --> 00:38:28,659
Your mother's original name was Fu Yin.

535
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:36,459
Fu Yin?

536
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:44,979
My Lord, didn't you forbid me from investigating further?

537
00:38:46,179 --> 00:38:51,879
It was because the more you knew back then, the more dangerous it would become.

538
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:57,419
Now, I feel you have the right to know these things.

539
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:03,459
Is the small residence with the medicinal pool

540
00:39:03,459 --> 00:39:07,459
you're staying in now my mother's former home?

541
00:39:11,179 --> 00:39:14,120
Your mother...

542
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:18,584
was Fu Shengru's only daughter, the Imperial Academy of Medicine's former head.

543
00:39:18,584 --> 00:39:22,360
Your maternal grandfather, Fu Shengru,

544
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:27,279
once expended a large amount of Immortal Fruits to research a new medicine.

545
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:34,440
Thirty years ago, my mother died in childbirth.

546
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,320
Physicians involved in her treatment were held accountable.

547
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,239
It shouldn't have implicated their family.

548
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,640
But even after your grandfather took his life,

549
00:39:45,659 --> 00:39:48,299
his entire family couldn't be saved.

550
00:39:49,499 --> 00:39:54,999
Are you saying someone wanted to use your mother's death

551
00:39:54,999 --> 00:39:57,099
to wipe them out?

552
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,420
Yes.

553
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:08,539
Could this person...

554
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,079
be the true culprit behind the incident five years ago?

555
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,619
Yes.

556
00:40:40,459 --> 00:40:43,819
My Lord, you may have had some recovery, but you're still weak.

557
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,400
You should get some rest.

558
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,020
Wait.

559
00:40:51,979 --> 00:40:54,459
Are you still not willing to tell me?

560
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,840
Why did you approach other high-ranking individuals?

561
00:41:01,179 --> 00:41:05,720
Were you upset because you thought I curried favor with other people?

562
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,939
So, is that the case?

563
00:41:17,301 --> 00:41:18,959
Why would I do that?

564
00:41:18,959 --> 00:41:22,618
From the get-go, you're the only and biggest support I have.

565
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:24,939
That's what I call unwavering loyalty.

566
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:34,740
Then why did you distance yourself from me?

567
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:44,020
Did you hear what I said about my family just now?

568
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,519
Yes.

569
00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:48,899
My father is a promiscuous man.

570
00:41:48,899 --> 00:41:53,220
He married many women, and has seven sons and eight daughters.

571
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:57,880
Since young, I hardly saw him.

572
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,098
So he couldn't even recognize me when he saw me.

573
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:06,778
That's why I've known from a young age that women shouldn't rely solely on men.

574
00:42:06,778 --> 00:42:08,940
They should strive for self-improvement.

575

♫  The flowing water bends and reflects the round moon  ♫

576
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,359
My Lord.

577
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:28,339
So you were avoiding me...

578
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:34,734
