1
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:25,160


2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,359
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,980
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:47,879
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,159
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,259
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,479
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,579
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,579
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:18,639
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

12
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:24,000
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,139
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:36,918
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,119
   

16
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,059
   

17
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:44,939
   

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
   

19
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,010
My Lord, the food at your residence is delicious.

20
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,850
My Lord, why aren't you eating?

21
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,520
I have eaten at the Ministry of Rites.

22
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,780
The communal meal there can't taste better than the food at home.

23
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:15,960
My Lord, you know my background.

24
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,680
My last name is Mu, but I am not considered part of the Mu family.

25
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,240
In that family, no one cares about me.

26
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,250
I don't care about them either.

27
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,420
Juli is the only family I have.

28
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,870
You're good at reading the room.

29
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,610
If you wished to please your father and his wife,

30
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,890
I'm sure your life at home wouldn't be so tough.

31
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,309
My Lord, you were born into the imperial family.

32
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,530
Don't you get it?

33
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:55,700
Being liked by someone superior may not necessarily be a good thing.

34
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,560
If I were liked by my father,

35
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,190
I would be ostracized and envied by my stepmothers and sisters.

36
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,169
But if I were liked by my stepmothers and sisters, they would pester me.

37
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:10,480
I wouldn't be able to get any moments of peace to properly study.

38
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:16,540
To be liked by irrelevant people is meaningless to me.

39
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,190
My Lord,

40
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,790
did I say something wrong?

41
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,060
What about me taking a liking to you?

42
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,840
Am I irrelevant?

43
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,589
My Lord, you are sensible.

44
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,160
Stop making fun of me.

45
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,910
Liar.

46
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,709
My Lord, you have my utmost loyalty.

47
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,610
I dare not deceive you.

48
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,870
Is there only loyalty?

49
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:05,150
I remember that you adore me.

50
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,030
Well... Indeed. I adore you.

51
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,940
But there are many kinds of adoration.

52
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,610
Which one is yours?

53
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,290
Obviously, the kind with undying loyalty.

54
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,780
"Undying loyalty"?

55
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:40,140
Then if I get married one day, wouldn't you be heartbroken?

56
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,870
My Lord,

57
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,750
has your illness been cured?

58
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,360
What illness?

59
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,940
It's nothing.

60
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:58,440
My Lord, as long as you are happy, my feelings don't matter.

61
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,050
Hurry to the study if you are done eating.

62
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,730
I barely took a few bites.

63
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,630
Thank you, My Lord.

64
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,190
Aren't you having any?

65
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,290
Young Lady, what are you thinking about?

66
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,990
You seem out of it.

67
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,029
Juli,

68
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,170
I think His Lordship was acting a little strange today.

69
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,750
What happened?

70
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,120
He seemed preoccupied.

71
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:48,400
Was he trying to hint that I should treat his illness?

72
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,469
That could be the reason.

73
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:54,070
I guess men are usually too embarrassed to say such things.

74
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:03,290
After this hectic period, I am going to find ways to treat this illness.

75
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,149
Greetings, Your Highness.

76
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,750
You're here.

77
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,000
Playing pitch-pot, Your Highness?

78
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,910
Yes.

79
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,370
Sadly, I am not very good at it.

80
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,659
I remember you are good at archery.

81
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,360
How about giving it a shot so that I get to learn from you?

82
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,460
I shall make a humble attempt, then.

83
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,470
As expected, you're great.

84
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,659
I come from a family of hunters.

85
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,540
I learned a few tricks since my father taught me when I was young.

86
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,880
Your words just put many generals to shame.

87
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,680
I'm flattered.

88
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,949
You don't have to teach the children today.

89
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,980
Is there something important for your sudden visit?

90
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,149
I actually came to ask for a leave of absence.

91
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,659
The Northern Liang diplomatic corps will visit soon.

92
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,339
Thanks to First Prince, I have joined the reception team.

93
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,140
But the children's classes must not be held up.

94
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,950
So I was hoping that you could find a substitute tutor.

95
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,339
That's a good thing for the nation and the people.

96
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,850
Chen'er truly thinks highly of you.

97
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,899
Feel free to do your duty.

98
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,900
I will make arrangements for the children's classes.

99
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:07,319
What are your thoughts on the Northern Liang diplomatic corps' sudden visit?

100
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,640
It's not a friendly visit.

101
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,580
There's a hidden agenda.

102
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:39,039
My Lord, there aren't many mistakes in this time's dictation. Right?

103
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,260
You have a good memory.

104
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,160
Only one word is wrong.

105
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,979
That's for sure. After all, I work for you.

106
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:50,010
I must be skilled in something.

107
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,940
You've passed the test.

108
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,120
Thank you, My Lord.

109
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,749
We waited from dawn until noon.

110
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,659
What is the Northern Liang diplomatic corps up to?

111
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,749
Exactly.

112
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,120
I have hosted a reception many times but never waited so long before.

113
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,870
Observer Mu.

114
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,109
Brother Shen.

115
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,269
It is so scorching today.

116
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,659
You are so delicate as a woman.

117
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,220
Why don't you take a rest under the pergola?

118
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,140
Everyone is standing here, so I should too.

119
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,929
Moreover, welcoming the Northern Liang diplomatic corps concerns our nation's prestige.

120
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:32,170
I dare not be lax.

121
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,229
You make a good point.

122
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,269
Looks like I was being narrow-minded.

123
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,819
Absolutely not. You were just concerned about me.

124
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,730
 Report! Northern Liang emissaries have arrived! 

125
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,160
   

126
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,880
   

127
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,580
   

128
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,060
   

129
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,440
Welcome, Your Highness.

130
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,509
It must have been a tiring journey.

131
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:43,579
    
 His Majesty has prepared a feast in the palace to welcome your arrival.

132
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:46,480
Please come with us to enter the capital.

133
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,520
I wish to do so.

134
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,839
But the gate is too small.

135
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,560
My imperial tents won't fit through.

136
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,220
There is even a woman?

137
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,579
I am Mu Zhuohua, the political observer of the Ministry of Rites.

138
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,160
I am also a member of the reception team.

139
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,560
Greetings, Your Highness.

140
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,640
Are the men in Southern Chen that incompetent?

141
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,370
I can't believe you let a woman be an official.

142
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,960
I am Shen Jinghong, the administrator of the Ministry of Revenue.

143
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,120
Since you come from afar, you must be unfamiliar with my nation.

144
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,649
His Majesty's political and military achievements benefit the whole nation.

145
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:45,059
For men and women alike.

146
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,880
Therefore, belittling women is out of the question,

147
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,869
let alone treating women as slaves.

148
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:56,190
So it is not uncommon for women to be an official in our imperial court.

149
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,129
 Precisely. 

150
00:11:57,129 --> 00:12:00,380
Men and women are equal in Southern Chen.

151
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:09,509
Your Highness, you don't know about Southern Chen just as we don't know about Northern Liang.

152
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:11,509
Here in Southern Chen, we are a peaceful nation.

153
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,140
There is no burglary or theft.

154
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:20,310
It is my first time seeing people bringing along their houses while traveling.

155
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,310
It's not like we are snails.

156
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,480
 How dare you! 

157
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,620
 How dare a lowly official not show any respect? 

158
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,670
 Is this how Southern Chen respects someone superior? 

159
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,080
Respect comes from the heart.

160
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,829
The most superior people would not feel disrespected even if they dine and sleep in the open.

161
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:44,630
But those who are inferior would not appear noble even if His Majesty...

162
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,939
welcomes them personally.

163
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,840
Watch your tongue.

164
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,480
Mu Zhuohua.

165
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,670
You impressed me.

166
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,580
It would be my honor.

167
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,990
This way, Your Highness.

168
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:18,870
   

169
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,880
How dare a lowly official

170
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,160
humiliate me in public like that

171
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,290
by using my background against me?

172
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,550
How dare she!

173
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,799
 Your Highness, a eunuch is here with a decree. 

174
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,250
   

175
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,919
Your Highness, please bow to accept the imperial decree.

176
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:23,629
"Prince Yemu, since you have traveled a long and arduous journey to make it here,

177
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:28,389
I have specially prepared a banquet in the palace to welcome the emissaries.

178
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:31,269
I grant you my permission."

179
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,150
Thank you, Your Majesty.

180
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,819
Your Highness,

181
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,269
by the law of Southern Chen, weapons are forbidden during an audience with His Majesty.

182
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:41,220
I would like to ask for your cooperation.

183
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,060
What's the matter?

184
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:32,250
Is there something wrong with the hand of my mute slave?

185
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,920
I am Yemu Jing from Northern Liang.

186
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,120
Greetings, Your Majesty.

187
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,750
At ease.

188
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,659
It must have been an arduous journey to come here.

189
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,109
Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty.

190
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,879
Master Huiming was a highly virtuous senior monk of Northern Liang.

191
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:32,629
It is our honor to present this Sarira to Your Majesty.

192
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,330
I dare not complain.

193
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:43,580
Southern Chen is truly lucky to receive this treasure.

194
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,960
Take a seat.

195
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,930
Thank you, Your Majesty.

196
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:10,149
Prince Yemu, welcome to my nation.

197
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,270
You've got quite the nerve.

198
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:59,160
Do you think it was your place as a low-ranking observer to speak at the city gate earlier today?

199
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,329
My Lord, subjects must defend their ruler.

200
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,349
He insulted the people of Southern Chen.

201
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,520
I spoke up to defend my nation and showed patriotism.

202
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:11,010
You should be praising me, My Lord.

203
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:16,360
Yemu Jing is atrocious.

204
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,620
Aren't you afraid of offending him?

205
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,869
He is in the lands of Southern Chen.

206
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,710
What can he do to me?

207
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:27,449
Furthermore, I have you to protect me.

208
00:18:27,449 --> 00:18:28,950
Am I right?

209
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,629
Then you must stay close to me.

210
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:35,530
Don't fall behind in case he wants revenge.

211
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,030
Understood, My Lord.

212
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,050
Your Majesty.

213
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:05,019
To show our intentions to form a lasting friendly relationship with Southern Chen,

214
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:08,490
I have specially prepared a valuable gift.

215
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,520
Your Majesty,

216
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,739
this is my younger sister, Yemu Zhen.

217
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:38,320
She is 20 years old and the most beautiful woman in Northern Liang.

218
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:50,810
   

219
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,670
A honey trap.

220
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,830
What a disgrace.

221
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,990
Chen'er.

222
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,720
Your Majesty,

223
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,979
this is a sincere gift from Northern Liang.

224
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,120
I hope you will accept it and treat my sister well.

225
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,920
I appreciate the thought.

226
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,019
It's just that Princess Yemu is still so young.

227
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:37,850
I feel sorry that she has to be so far away from home.

228
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:41,490
Here's the thing, Your Majesty.

229
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,750
Northern Liang will never take back a gift.

230
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:50,230
Otherwise, we would deem it as disrespect.

231
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,419
If you are afraid of mistreating my sister,

232
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:05,749
you can betroth her to an imperial family member who is of marriageable age.

233
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:11,760
I heard that Lord Ding is still not married.

234
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:22,339
 This cunning fox of Northern Liang is truly disgusting. 

235
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:37,749
I did not expect such a huge difference between the customs of Northern Liang and Southern Chen.

236
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:42,730
I can't believe you would present a woman as a gift.

237
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,950
Since this is a sincere gift from Northern Liang,

238
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:49,300
it would be rude of us to decline.

239
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,480
We will definitely treat her well.

240
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,260
Your Majesty,

241
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,260
I would like to ask you to take Yemu Zhen in as your goddaughter.

242
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,390
Lord Ding.

243
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,290
That is a good idea.

244
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,920
Princess Yemu is a princess in Northern Liang.

245
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,020
She will still be a princess here in Southern Chen.

246
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,350
She will not be mistreated.

247
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:26,730
His Majesty and the empress will also get her a good teacher

248
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:31,620
to teach her the etiquette and culture of Southern Chen to refine her overall qualities.

249
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:36,269
That will also do justice to her title as the most beautiful woman in the world.

250
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,200
Father.

251
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,580
I think Princess Yemu and I will get along.

252
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,389
How about letting her stay with me?

253
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,829
Not only can I take care of her daily necessities,

254
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,969
but I can also show her around the capital.

255
00:22:52,969 --> 00:22:56,259
Good. I approve.

256
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:04,900
In that case, I shall thank you, Your Majesty.

257
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,100
Lord Ding,

258
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,419
you and I are considered old acquaintances.

259
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,499
I brought lots of good wine from Northern Liang with me.

260
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,950
I would like to catch up with you.

261
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:20,800
Do I have the honor of doing so?

262
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,840
You are my guest.

263
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,190
I should be the host.

264
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:29,150
Northern Liang is good at martial arts and hunting.

265
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:34,550
How about joining me at the hunting ground?

266
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:37,179
That would also make your emissaries feel at home.

267
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,549
What do you think?

268
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,250
Lord Ding,

269
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:46,560
you shall entertain Prince Yemu on my behalf tomorrow as the host.

270
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,570
I will comply, Your Majesty.

271
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,420
Thank you, Your Majesty.

272
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,930
My Lord.

273
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,090
That's a beautiful woman.

274
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:11,010
Don't you think it is a pity?

275
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,850
Why?

276
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,940
Are you feeling sorry for me?

277
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,820
You said that you adored me.

278
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:26,550
Was it all a lie?

279
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:33,420
I obviously believe that you are not someone superficial.

280
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:37,260
You won't be easily tempted by beauty.

281
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:46,030
 I want to be with you to keep going forward. 

282
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,629
♫  The flowing water bends and reflects the round moon  ♫

283
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:53,430
 I know that you treat me sincerely. 

284
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,850
 Here, My Lord. Try it. 

285
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:02,370
♫  The galaxy is like the sea, 
 the eyes are like the eaves covered with snow  ♫

286
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:06,190
♫  The night rain hitting the sycamore tree disturbs a sparrow  ♫

287
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,100
 Are you worried that it's poisoned? I will test it for you. 

288
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,739
♫  Afraid that the number of twists and turns will increase  ♫

289
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,490
I have also once been superficial.

290
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:31,450
My Lord, that was so clever of you.

291
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:34,360
You invited Yemu Jing instead.

292
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,420
Do you have something else in mind?

293
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,250
What do you think it is?

294
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:46,610
I think the ultimate goal of Northern Liang is to prepare for war.

295
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,349
They still dare not act rashly.

296
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:53,690
That is because they know that you are guarding Southern Chen.

297
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:57,820
That is why I think they visited

298
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:03,850
to find out if you are healthy enough to lead the army.

299
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,440
You are right.

300
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:11,859
He thinks Southern Chen and Eastern Xia formed an alliance to fight against Northern Liang.

301
00:26:11,859 --> 00:26:15,140
That's why he risked coming to Southern Chen under strained circumstances

302
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,219
while fighting to be appointed as Crown Prince.

303
00:26:19,219 --> 00:26:22,350
He wants to find out my real condition.

304
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:30,139
But, My Lord, if Yemu Jing learns that he has been tricked, would he be furious?

305
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,140
Since he has fallen into my trap,

306
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:36,120
I will make sure he is under my thumb.

307
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:42,429
My Lord, you have such great foresight.

308
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,060
But your health...

309
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,459
I am unable to go with you,

310
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,160
but I will prepare enough supplies for you.

311
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,829
Supplies?

312
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:02,240
I will make sure they are delivered before you set off tomorrow.

313
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,549
All right.

314
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:09,600
In that case, bring those supplies personally and follow me tomorrow.

315
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,499
I'm coming with you?

316
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,260
 My Lord, we have arrived at Zhuque Street. 

317
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,829
That's settled, then.

318
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:20,620
I will go with you tomorrow.

319
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:26,830
Please request a leave of absence with His Majesty for me.

320
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,680
I should get going.

321
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,179
My Lord.

322
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,680
Where is Chen'er?

323
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,790
My Lord, the Northern Liang emissaries are hunting in the woods.

324
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:21,219
First Prince is laying out the tents for resting.

325
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,020
All right.

326
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,570
Yes.

327
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:31,339
I didn't expect His Highness to arrive first and have everything settled.

328
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,920
Chen'er dislikes people from Northern Liang,

329
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,540
but he has treated the Northern Liang diplomatic corps

330
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:42,490
with great hospitality as the host.

331
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,370
He has improved a lot.

332
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,570
Where is Mu Zhuohua?

333
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,659
She said she felt sick from the bumpy journey.

334
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,240
So she went to the riverside to freshen up.

335
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,149
My Lord, that's the way to the riverside.

336
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,650
My Lord!

337
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,120
Going to Mu Zhuohua again.

338
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,320
Lord Ding.

339
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:33,090
Yemu Zhen is seriously such a bother.

340
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,910
Your Highness.

341
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,000
That's a romantic affair between them.

342
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,160
You should just stay out of it.

343
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,710
A romantic affair, you say?

344
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,400
I don't think so.

345
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:52,490
It is clearly an affair between two nations.

346
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,549
You were willing to use a woman as leverage,

347
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:59,910
but Southern Chen was unwilling to accept it.

348
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,000
My Lord.

349
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,130
Stay still.

350
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:11,009
Your Highness, now isn't a good time.

351
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,430
Don't read too much into it.

352
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:21,560
Look at your disheveled appearance.

353
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,590
It will taint the prestige of Southern Chen officials.

354
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:32,829
Then, why did you do something like this yourself?

355
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,430
It is called...

356
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:39,060
Showing respect to those with talent.

357
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,260
Who is that?

358
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,069
You are now the goddaughter of His Majesty.

359
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:54,010
So you should address Lord Ding as your uncle.

360
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,670
You are sensible.

361
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:58,439
- I'm sure you know what it means to excuse yourself.
 - You...

362
00:31:58,439 --> 00:32:02,650
Speaking of which, is Northern Liang about to lose?

363
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,450
Well, My Lord.

364
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:10,729
My Lord, she has left.

365
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,050
I see.

366
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:24,520
The falling flowers yearn for love, but the heartless brook ripples on.

367
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,810
You are good at playing hooky.

368
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:30,150
I like the rippling waters.

369
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,939
My Lord,

370
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,869
tt was a slip of the tongue.

371
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:40,589
His Highness said civil officials didn't have to remain at our posts

372
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,780
as long as we don't wander off.

373
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,420
It's all right.

374
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:50,330
My Lord, is there any progress?

375
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,150
Hawk claw hook?

376
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:06,530
I remember that the wounds on Deputy General Yuan were caused by it.

377
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:09,460
The casting technique of it is from Northern Liang.

378
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,259
You showed intentions to make peace with Eastern Xia.

379
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:16,400
But it was actually to lure Northern Liang out.

380
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:22,410
You intend to find the owner of this hawk claw hook.

381
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:25,510
Getting an answer will not be easy.

382
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:30,259
My Lord, I can give you some suggestions.

383
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,160
Prince Yemu.

384
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,760
You win some battles, and you lose some.

385
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:11,349
You can't be a sore loser, can you?

386
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,380
Lord Ding.

387
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,059
I have won every battle in recent years.

388
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,120
How can I be a sore loser?

389
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:23,110
Instead, I wonder if your skills have regressed.

390
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,950
Prince Yemu.

391
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:37,640
If you want to find the answer,

392
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:42,090
how about trying it yourself?

393
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,620
We have a banquet today.

394
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:51,420
I think we'd better compete over wine.

395
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,920
Lord Ding.

396
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,300
Brother.

397
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,900
Why do you look like a mess?

398
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,099
The banquet will begin soon.

399
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,770
Your Highness, how about returning to your tent to freshen up?

400
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,040
After all, you represent Northern Liang.

401
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:21,630
Your Highness, are you all right?

402
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:25,850
I'm fine.

403
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:41,369
It's said in the secret letter that Liu Yan hasn't practiced martial arts for years.

404
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,420
Possibly due to the poison residue of the Yuanluo Flower.

405
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,490
But based on his vigor earlier,

406
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:51,229
he doesn't look weak at all.

407
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,769
Then does he still have poison in him or not?

408
00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:55,950
We will find out at the banquet.

409
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:01,170
If he really suffered internal injuries,

410
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:06,470
I doubt he would keep drinking with a straight face.

411
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:15,700
Regardless, I cannot rest assured with none of my people around Liu Yan.

412
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:19,860
But Lord Ding is unresponsive like a rock.

413
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:24,130
Even with my aggressive approach, he never took a glance at me.

414
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,980
But he treats that female official differently.

415
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,990
I saw it with my own eyes.

416
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,719
Brother, what should I do?

417
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:41,930
If the soft approach doesn't work, we will just use force.

418
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:46,550
I have released that mute slave.

419
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:52,310
I will see if this sheep

420
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:57,830
can make the wolves tear each other apart.

421
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,640
Uncle,

422
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:10,999
I know you are trying to intimidate Yemu Jing so that he won't act rashly.

423
00:37:10,999 --> 00:37:14,270
But his wine is clearly a trap.

424
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:17,030
Why would you invite him to drink?

425
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:22,310
Worry about yourself first.

426
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:26,110
Yemu Jing is very cunning.

427
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:31,120
Do you really want to have petty fights with him?

428
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,720
Well, he got on my nerves.

429
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,170
My Lord. Your Highness.

430
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:46,320
Mu Zhuohua? What are you doing here?

431
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,780
I... I called her over to treat your wound.

432
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:53,189
Uncle, I'm perfectly fine. Look.

433
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,700
Cut it out.

434
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,839
- Go ahead. 
 - Yes, My Lord.

435
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,420
But, Uncle...

436
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:17,319
Your Highness, physicians treat patients the same regardless of gender.

437
00:38:17,319 --> 00:38:21,570
Moreover, I have already treated your wound last time.

438
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,950
Be gentle.

439
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:45,550
How can a girl be so rough?

440
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,710
Do you want me to proceed?

441
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,019
Such a bother.

442
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,540
How are you going to get married?

443
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,579
Your Highness,

444
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:05,369
you can talk less while I treat your wound so as not to waste your energy.

445
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:18,630
Yemu Jing has spines on every inch of his body.

446
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,220
He is basically a reincarnation of a hedgehog.

447
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:27,869
My Lord,

448
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:31,789
the wound on His Highness did reopen, but it is not that serious.

449
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,939
I have changed the wound dressing.

450
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,220
All right. I am fine.

451
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:39,880
You may leave. I have important things to discuss with my uncle.

452
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:44,120
Your Highness, Yemu Jing must be up to no good.

453
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,040
I think you'd better check.

454
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,939
How big of a wave can he make?

455
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,550
He was defeated by me.

456
00:39:55,670 --> 00:40:00,970
Chen'er, you are in charge of the banquet.

457
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:03,440
You should carry it through.

458
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:08,139
Uncle, are you kicking me out?

459
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,250
Focus on the big picture.

460
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,640
Why are you still here?

461
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:24,650
I have something to discuss with His Lordship.

462
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:44,919
My Lord, is the iron hook attached to the mute slave's left arm

463
00:40:44,919 --> 00:40:47,480
similar to the hawk claw hook?

464
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,320
I have sent Zhijian to look into it.

465
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,129
Seeing that he has yet to return, I'm assuming that the mute slave got away.

466
00:40:55,129 --> 00:40:56,830
Got away?

467
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:11,980


468
00:41:14,026 --> 00:41:21,485
♫  I can't forget the love that is still is nipping at my ears and temples  ♫

469
00:41:21,485 --> 00:41:28,785
♫  Memories keep slamming into rocks and have nowhere to berth  ♫

470
00:41:28,785 --> 00:41:36,225
♫  Both sides gaze at each other in the drizzling rain, but one has turned into clouds and mist  ♫

471
00:41:36,225 --> 00:41:44,745
♫  Leaving the isolated heart's island, like waves without a shore  ♫

472
00:41:44,745 --> 00:41:48,385
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

473
00:41:48,385 --> 00:41:52,045
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

474
00:41:52,045 --> 00:41:55,965
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

475
00:41:55,965 --> 00:41:59,545
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

476
00:41:59,546 --> 00:42:03,065
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

477
00:42:03,066 --> 00:42:06,785
♫  Obviously willing to swear life and death 
 to be entangled for a lifetime  ♫

478
00:42:06,786 --> 00:42:10,985
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

479
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:16,886
♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

480
00:42:30,486 --> 00:42:37,885
♫  I can't forget the turmoil of love and hate,

481
00:42:37,885 --> 00:42:46,545
♫  Two souls embrace in chaos, how can it be written off?  ♫

482

♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

485

♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

487
00:43:04,885 --> 00:43:08,665

00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:12,645
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

00:43:12,645 --> 00:43:19,926
♫  Want to have one more glimpse of you, 
 even just for a second more  ♫
