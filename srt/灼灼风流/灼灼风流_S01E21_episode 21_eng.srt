2
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,459
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:34,980
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,999
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:47,779
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,779 --> 00:00:53,159
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,159
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:03,479
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,579
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,579
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:18,539
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

12
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:24,000
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,239
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:36,918
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,019
   

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,959
   

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,939
   

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
   

19
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,330
Seventh Sister...

20
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,109
Thank you.

21
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,330
You don't have to thank me.

22
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:13,190
You should be thankful to yourself.

23
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:19,630
Despite the wrong path or mistake you've made,

24
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:22,649
you managed to come this far.

25
00:02:22,649 --> 00:02:26,969
You should thank yourself for swallowing your pride...

26
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,729
and making desperate efforts.

27
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,970
What's wrong?

28
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:03,509
I'm returning this to you.

29
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,190
This... This is my mother's handkerchief.

30
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:44,725
Come in.

31
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,849
Zhuang Wenfeng and Zhuang Zixian are dead.

32
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:54,589
They are dead?

33
00:03:56,749 --> 00:03:59,649
They committed suicide.

34
00:03:59,649 --> 00:04:01,969
They committed suicide. Seriously?

35
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:04,609
The Ministry of Justice has already closed the case.

36
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:07,269
This is infuriating!

37
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:22,609
Tell me.

38
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,909
Did they really kill themselves?

39
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:30,249
Of course, they didn't.

40
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:35,529
But I'm afraid we're done here.

41
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:37,649
Why?

42
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:39,969
It's just a simple corruption case.

43
00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:42,789
Why can't we continue the investigation?

44
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:44,750
Are you sure it's simple?

45
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:53,769
You're saying this because you've never thought of the complexities hidden behind it.

46
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:04,330
Do you think it's unfair about the Zhuangs' death?

47
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:09,768
Not at all. Considering their sinful act, they deserve more than a public execution.

48
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:15,370
However, their death is likely to conceal another bigger sin.

49
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:35,929
My Lord.

50
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:01,609
A flower petal?

51
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:33,788
My Lord, we've searched through Zhuang Zixian's residence and abode.

52
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:37,330
Aside from excessive fortune that he didn't warrant,

53
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:42,069
none of the potential evidence has been found yet.

54
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,110
Send someone to Jiangnan.

55
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,229
A trivial country magistrate like Zhuang Wenfeng was able to manipulate everything there.

56
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,269
There must be something traceable left.

57
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:56,149
Yes.

58
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,670
Miss Mu, good morning.

59
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:42,108
Are you... Are you Official Li, the vice minister?

60
00:07:42,109 --> 00:07:43,669
Greetings, Official Li.

61
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:46,649
- Morning. 
 - Please go in.

62
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:50,050
   
 - Ms. Mu, please come with me. 

63
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,889
Our fellows in the Ministry of Revenue are friendly

64
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,729
as we have to associate with other ministries.

65
00:07:55,729 --> 00:07:58,269
Official Li, does the Ministry of Rites do the same thing, too?

66
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,149
It's different. 
    

67
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:02,449
The Ministry of Rites deals with external matters.

68
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,769
They have to make sure all protocols run correctly.

69
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:07,629
While the Ministry of Revenue deals with internal matters,

70
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:10,468
we have to be good at people skills and keep our manners in check.

71
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:13,189
That's the way we can get everything done well.

72
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,490
Is there any ministry with a bad temper?

73
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,870
Ministry of Personnel, the head of the six ministries.

74
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,889
They strictly abide by rules.

75
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:22,210
Shen serves there.

76
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,330
The Ministry of Justice has a bad temper, too.

77
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:30,149
You see, Miss Mu, the Ministry of Revenue is the most easygoing one.

78
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:33,109
I'll work harder to serve the ministry.

79
00:08:33,109 --> 00:08:34,989
Official Li.

80
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,129
Who's that?

81
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:42,109
That's Observer Fang. He came in through connections.

82
00:08:42,109 --> 00:08:44,029
His family desperately sought help around

83
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,030
and has spent a great fortune to pull strings.

84
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,130
Fortunately, he's diligent and serious.

85
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,330
Compared with the children of other aristocratic families, he is much better.

86
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,349
You reminded me of something.

87
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:01,189
You attended the same examination.

88
00:09:01,189 --> 00:09:03,189
I suppose you've met him before.

89
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:06,050
The same examination?

90
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:11,470
 That's great. First Prince and Lord Ding were siding with us. 

91
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,270
I met him before.

92
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:17,329
Indeed, he has changed a lot.

93
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,050
Official Li, may I know where my desk is?

94
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,930
- Miss Mu, follow me. 
 - Sure.

95
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,790
This way.

96
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:42,649
Official Mu.

97
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:47,690
Observer Fang. Is there anything I can help you with?

98
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,308
Please don't say that.

99
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:51,649
I want to apologize to you.

100
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:54,389
- Apologize? 
 - Official Mu, you have genuine talents.

101
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,849
Since you've become an official, you confronted the Northern Liang,

102
00:09:56,849 --> 00:09:59,429
rescued the famine victims, and investigated corrupt cases.

103
00:09:59,429 --> 00:10:03,529
I'm ashamed of myself.

104
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:05,249
You flatter me.

105
00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:07,788
You and I originally didn't have any contact.

106
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:10,429
We have different stances, and that's all.

107
00:10:10,429 --> 00:10:11,890
You're generous, Official Mu.

108
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,789
I was arrogant because of my wealthy family.

109
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:19,990
But when I saw my father begging around to get me employed,

110
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,289
I found myself useless.

111
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,428
No need to sell yourself short, Observer Fang.

112
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:27,908
Official Li and Official Song were praising you at noon.

113
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:31,170
We all thought you would come for lunch.

114
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,210
It's my fault.

115
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:36,689
The ambitious cherishes short days,

116
00:10:36,689 --> 00:10:38,649
while the sullen laments during long nights.

117
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:43,029
After all, I don't have high expectations for myself.

118
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:45,370
You befriended Official Wen...

119
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:48,770
I befriended him because of his personality.

120
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,609
Turns out he's a fickle social climber.

121
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,588
He started to keep his distance from me when my family experienced a downfall.

122
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,269
Forget it.

123
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:03,229
Anyway, please look out for me, Miss Mu.

124
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,130
Likewise.

125
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:13,149
I heard that Mu Zhuohua was defending Liu Yan before the emperor

126
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,529
over his impeachment.

127
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:17,908
Yes.

128
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:22,089
She's now in favor with His Majesty.

129
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:24,870
I predicted that.

130
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:29,289
He has shielded off those Liu Yan impeachments,

131
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:33,070
claiming that he issued a secretive edict

132
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:37,050
to send Liu Yan to Chen'er's aid in Jiangnan.

133
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:44,689
The emperor actually lied for the sake of him.

134
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:49,830
What else do you know about Liu Yan's movement in Jiangnan?

135
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,668
I don't, Your Majesty.

136
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:57,570
I used to think it was a showmanship between him and Mu Zhuohua.

137
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:03,170
Now it seems they're truly in love with each other.

138
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,690
The emperor halted me to act against Yan.

139
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,090
And I won't do anything.

140
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,060
   

141
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:18,290
But watching him be proud of the spring breeze,

142
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:23,090
I can't allow him to be happy and for everything to run smoothly.

143
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,588
   

144
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:28,629
Juli.

145
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,930
Princess Roujia sent this over?

146
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:32,869
Yes.

147
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,749
The Tongxin Festival is around the corner.

148
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,548
There'll be a banquet held in the palace.

149
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:40,150
Sister Man'er said Princess Roujia invited you over.

150
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,289
The Tongxin Festival is a folk custom in the capital.

151
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:49,350
Do they celebrate this grandly in the palace, too?

152
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,149
I've never heard of it.

153
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,428
But, Young Lady, what's the Tongxin Festival?

154
00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:55,629
This is my first time hearing this.

155
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:00,409
"Hiding in a quiet place, I tie a knot with my tresses and his."

156
00:13:00,409 --> 00:13:03,788
It's a common tradition between young men and ladies in the capital.

157
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:07,969
At the end of the sixth month and the beginning of the seventh month, they exchange gifts.

158
00:13:07,969 --> 00:13:09,708
And that's the Tongxin Festival.

159
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:12,150
Young Lady, will I get one from you?

160
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:17,409
Juli, the gift exchange is between young men and ladies.

161
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:19,588
So, you're not giving me a gift.

162
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:22,689
You're only giving it to Lord Ding, aren't you?

163
00:13:22,689 --> 00:13:25,229
How so?

164
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,989
Because he saved you.

165
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,030
You should repay his kindness.

166
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:35,589
That makes sense.

167
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:40,689
I should prepare a gift for him.

168
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,489
Your Highness, keep it in the same place?

169
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,070
You should blame me for misplacing it.

170
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,690
Get up.

171
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,130
It's not your fault.

172
00:14:12,495 --> 00:14:19,945
♫  The love that opened my eyes  ♫

173
00:14:19,945 --> 00:14:27,235
♫  Moonlight illuminates the path once traveled  ♫

174
00:14:27,235 --> 00:14:31,005
♫  A dream of a goose and a phoenix crossing together  ♫

175
00:14:31,005 --> 00:14:34,074
♫  Tenderness is like parting and complaints  ♫

176
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:39,200
♫  Going around for a lifetime, constantly cut and scattered, 
 the world is day and night  ♫

177
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,470
   

178
00:14:41,475 --> 00:14:49,234
♫  The fireworks of the world are like quicksand 
 of the world after all  ♫

179
00:14:49,234 --> 00:14:56,754
♫  In that moment of confusion, 
 I want to know what your answer will be  ♫

180
00:14:56,754 --> 00:15:04,494
♫  Again, someone on the precipice of fate  ♫

181
00:15:04,494 --> 00:15:12,495
♫  The heartache is caused by the painful loneliness  ♫

182
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,669
This hits the spot.

183
00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:32,229
Indeed.

184
00:15:32,229 --> 00:15:34,509
♫  The moon in the water asked the flowers 
 in the mirror why lovesickness hurt?  ♫

185
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:39,209
This hits my heart, too.

186
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:43,019
♫  The setting sun cannot clear the morning fog  ♫

187
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:49,861
♫  The fleeting years burst into pieces, 
 the memories of them cause me pain  ♫

188
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:57,182
♫  I can't hold onto my lover's heart, turning back, 
 I realize there is nowhere to go  ♫

189
00:15:57,182 --> 00:16:05,142
♫  The fireworks of the world are like quicksand 
 of the world after all  ♫

190
00:16:05,142 --> 00:16:12,592
♫  In that moment of confusion, 
 I want to know what your answer will be  ♫

191
00:16:12,592 --> 00:16:20,272
♫  Again, someone on the precipice of fate 
 Leaves tear stains behind while bidding farewell  ♫

192
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:27,819
♫  The city in my heart gives up in the loneliness and pain  ♫

193
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,849
Young Lady, are you looking for a store that sells flutes?

194
00:16:50,849 --> 00:16:55,430
Yes, I didn't know Lord Ding could play the flute.

195
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,629
Yeah, you didn't.

196
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,468
I brought you this message from Zhimo.

197
00:16:59,468 --> 00:17:01,908
Well, I'll buy him the best flute.

198
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:03,309
Is that okay?

199
00:17:03,309 --> 00:17:07,670
But can you afford thatwith your meager salary?

200
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,628
Miss, have a look at this patterned fabric.

201
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,170
It should be here.

202
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,253
   

203
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,706
   

204
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:22,909
That smells nice.

205
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:26,710
That young lady smells fragrant.

206
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,430
It must be some exquisite fragrance.

207
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:32,749
But do they sell expensive things here, too?

208
00:17:32,749 --> 00:17:36,108
I don't think a flute can be costly.

209
00:17:36,109 --> 00:17:37,109
   

210
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:38,509
This is hefty.

211
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:40,610
180 guan.

212
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,849
This is the cheapest item we have here.

213
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:48,148
Sir, you might as well rob us.

214
00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:49,588
Can't afford this?

215
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:52,469
You can buy a bamboo stick and poke some holes.

216
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,909
It makes sound too. Also, it's free.

217
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,388
Good idea.

218
00:17:57,389 --> 00:17:59,749
Young Lady, let's go and chop bamboo.

219
00:17:59,749 --> 00:18:01,470
Don't be ridiculous.

220
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:09,249
Sir, we'll browse a bit.

221
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,869
The rest are expensive, too.

222
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:18,194
   

223
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,689
Sitting alone languidly in the bamboo groove,

224
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:30,650
plucking the strings while singing.

225
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:34,009
Sir, I will have Duyou. 
 - I will have Duyou.

226
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:35,709
- I will have Duyou. 
 - I will have Duyou.

227
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:41,189
Make me an offer, ladies.

228
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:43,469
Make an offer?

229
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:49,049
You can name your price.

230
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:53,469
Miss, I can tell you can afford this at any price.

231
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:57,189
Unlike this noisy cakesniffer here.

232
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,749
Who are you calling a cakesniffer?

233
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,149
She's an official...

234
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,488
No.

235
00:19:05,488 --> 00:19:06,749
Young Lady.

236
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,050
It's true that we don't have much money.

237
00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:12,448
I'll go with 500 guan. What do you say?

238
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:14,010
No.

239
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:18,149
800 guan.

240
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:24,689
Young Lady, it costs several years' worth of your salary.

241
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,669
You can trade it with something else.

242
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,229
Don't even think about it.

243
00:19:36,229 --> 00:19:39,330
Juli, he doesn't mean it that way.

244
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:44,109
Sir, I'll go with 1,000 guan.

245
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:52,270
Given your temperament, you're not from a merchant family.

246
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:56,590
Sir, you should close down the business if you can't tell that.

247
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:01,428
Miss, you offered a high price, and you're not from a merchant's family.

248
00:20:01,428 --> 00:20:04,230
You must be from a prestigious origin.

249
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:09,480
But my apologies. I won't sell it for even 100,000 guan.

250
00:20:10,069 --> 00:20:11,749
But why?

251
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,870
Did I not make myself clear enough?

252
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,710
I won't sell it.

253
00:20:23,629 --> 00:20:25,429
Have a nice day.

254
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:33,649
Miss, I doubt if you can offer 100 guan.

255
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:40,210
Sir, didn't you say we can trade it with something else?

256
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,788
Yes, I did say that.

257
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:44,870
What do you want from me?

258
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:48,189
The most valuable thing you have.

259
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:51,249
The most valuable thing?

260
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:59,630
The most valuable thing you have is none other than the jade pendant given by Lord Ding.

261
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,709
But it's broken.

262
00:21:04,069 --> 00:21:07,209
Well, it was an emergency.

263
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:11,789
How about this, Young Lady? We'll buy a knife for chopping bamboo.

264
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:17,309
Juli, I know what the most valuable item I have is.

265
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,149
It's my talent.

266
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:24,249
    
  If I'm not mistaken, you're that female Tanhua.

267
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:28,348
Yes, it's me.

268
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:31,269
Besides, you just returned from the disaster relief mission in Jiangnan.

269
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,790
Sir, you sure know a lot.

270
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:38,950
Not only me, but the entire capital knows about that.

271
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,070
I come from Jiangnan.

272
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:50,110
You worked tirelessly to support disaster relief missions.

273
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,229
I greatly admire you.

274
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:55,688
Please don't say that. Just sell Duyou to me.

275
00:21:55,688 --> 00:21:59,190
Sir, could you lower the price?

276
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:04,070
Official Mu, you can exchange this with your calligraphy.

277
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,308
Sir, what do you want me to write?

278
00:22:12,308 --> 00:22:13,968
Anything except poetry.

279
00:22:13,968 --> 00:22:15,890
I want poetry.

280
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:18,409
You want poetry?

281
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:24,090
Well, you made this request.

282
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,590
Official Mu.

283
00:22:42,389 --> 00:22:44,410
Thank you so much.

284
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,548
Sir,

285
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:48,890
please don't hang my calligraphy.

286
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,169
We're leaving, then.

287
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:51,670
Thank you.

288
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,828
Thank you so much.

289
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,329
Let's go.

290
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:03,549
The poetry...

291
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:07,149
Nice writing.

292
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:13,189
Sir.

293
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,429
Please name any price you want.

294
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:20,489
I'm sorry, but Duyou has been sold.

295
00:23:23,389 --> 00:23:24,889
    
 Sold?

296
00:23:24,889 --> 00:23:26,108
To whom?

297
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:29,810
The other lady who wanted to buy Duyou just now.

298
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,030
It's her?

299
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,949
How much did she offer?

300
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:45,669
"Duyou is an exquisite piece, shan't be tainted by money.

301
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:49,810
Only wise people can discern its value, not those foolish moneybags."

302
00:24:01,829 --> 00:24:03,909
Juli, is everything ready?

303
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:06,289
Yes, there are many.

304
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,030
Let me see.

305
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:16,350
I know you look great in any clothes.

306
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:21,208
But I'm afraid other noble ladies might outshine you if you wear this.

307
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:26,868
Dowager Empress gathers so many noble ladies together in the palace during the Tongxin Festival.

308
00:24:26,868 --> 00:24:28,429
That isn't for celebrating it.

309
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:31,288
Apparently, she wants to choose a consort for First Prince.

310
00:24:31,288 --> 00:24:34,970
Those noble ladies are all vying for the only candidature.

311
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,989
I'm not joining them.

312
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,768
No, Young Lady.

313
00:24:39,768 --> 00:24:41,488
You'd better not attend it.

314
00:24:41,488 --> 00:24:43,068
The Dowager Empress is terrifying.

315
00:24:43,069 --> 00:24:45,810
She could punish anyone she wants.

316
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:49,870
I mustn't turn down the invitation from Princess.

317
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,870
Though the Dowager Empress hosts this banquet,

318
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,430
she wouldn't punish me for no reason

319
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:59,469
if I behave myself properly in front of the public.

320
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,070
Right?

321
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,788
True.

322
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:04,909
Prepare this more.

323
00:25:13,069 --> 00:25:14,370
It's lively here.

324
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,289
The Tanhua is here, too.

325
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,189
She's a new face.

326
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,650
Which clan is she from?

327
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:24,789
You mean her? She's the latest Tanhua, Mu Zhuohua.

328
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:28,348
She's from a rustic town.

329
00:25:28,348 --> 00:25:29,668
Oh, it's her.

330
00:25:29,668 --> 00:25:30,968
I know her.

331
00:25:30,968 --> 00:25:36,430
I thought she was a female scholar in her thirties, but she's young.

332
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:39,269
First Prince seems to regard her highly.

333
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,409
She was once the princes' tutor.

334
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:44,388
However, for some reason, she was removed from the position.

335
00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:48,088
A few days ago, she was promoted to director in the Ministry of Revenue.

336
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:51,390
Does she come here for that purpose, too?

337
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,749
I don't think so.

338
00:25:52,749 --> 00:25:55,148
I heard that she's dedicated to her career.

339
00:25:55,148 --> 00:26:00,508
According to the state law, she has to stand down from the position once she gets married.

340
00:26:03,489 --> 00:26:06,520
 Here comes Dowager Empress. 

341
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,750
   

342
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,049
 Her Majesty's gaze was fierce. 

343
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:03,250
 Is she going to punish me again? 

344
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:12,868
 Greetings to Dowager Empress, Lord Ding, First Prince, 

345
00:27:12,868 --> 00:27:17,690
 Second Prince, Third Prince, and Princess Roujia. 

346
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:21,769
I hold the Tongxin Festival here

347
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:24,890
as a cheerful celebration.

348
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,649
So, don't stand on ceremony.

349
00:27:27,649 --> 00:27:29,148
Get up.

350
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:31,810
 Thank you, Your Majesty. 

351
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:46,588
Uncle,

352
00:27:46,589 --> 00:27:48,890
what's wrong with Mu Zhuohua?

353
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,590
She ignores me.

354
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:53,209
If she had responded to you just now,

355
00:27:53,209 --> 00:27:58,370
she might become the common enemy of all noble ladies tomorrow.

356
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,490
Older Brother,

357
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:23,150
Grandmother organized this banquet to select a consort for you.

358
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:26,130
Please don't disappoint her.

359
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:27,769
Older Brother,

360
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:30,348
all of the noble ladies who are at their marriageable age are here.

361
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:32,629
Do pick carefully.

362
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:40,850
Chen'er has matured a lot after the Jiangnan trip.

363
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,050
Where's Yunyun?

364
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:03,089
I don't see Yunyun here.

365
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:04,649
Yunyun?

366
00:29:04,649 --> 00:29:07,369
Is she the eldest daughter of the Sun clan?

367
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:09,868
When did she return from Jiangzhou?

368
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:11,469
No idea.

369
00:29:14,829 --> 00:29:18,310
Please pardon my late arrival, Your Majesty.

370
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:32,949
Greetings to Dowager Empress, Lord Ding, First Prince, Second Prince,

371
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:35,650
Third Prince, and Princess Roujia.

372
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:41,030
Yunyun, go ahead and take your seat.

373
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:44,749
Yes.

374
00:29:55,829 --> 00:29:59,089
 Isn't she the silly moneybag I saw in Qingyin Music Shop? 

375
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:01,029
 So, she's Brother Sun's sister. 

376
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:05,468
 The most prominent noble lady, Sun Yunyun. 

377
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:10,470
Since everyone's here, don't be reserved.

378
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:15,230
Let's celebrate this festival the way it should be celebrated.

379
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,809
I'm going over there.

380
00:30:17,809 --> 00:30:19,648
- I'm leaving. 
 - I'm quite nervous.

381
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,830
Do my clothes look good?

382
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,630
My Lord.

383
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,090
Who are you?

384
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:53,849
My Lord, don't you remember me?

385
00:30:53,849 --> 00:30:56,249
I'm Sun Yunyun.

386
00:30:56,249 --> 00:30:58,450
You forgot me?

387
00:30:59,909 --> 00:31:02,690
- Back then... 
 - Miss Sun.

388
00:31:03,349 --> 00:31:06,989
I don't have time to revisit the past with you.

389
00:31:06,989 --> 00:31:09,229
Please leave, Miss Sun.

390
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:15,848
My Lord, I've prepared a special gift for you.

391
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:19,189
This flute is called Lingxi.

392
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,270
Please have a look, My Lord.

393
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,588
It's Lingxi.

394
00:31:23,589 --> 00:31:25,229
This flute is worth a big fortune.

395
00:31:25,229 --> 00:31:27,169
As expected of the trueborn daughter of the Sun clan in Jiangzhuo.

396
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:28,809
She's even gifting His Lordship an exceptional musical instrument.

397
00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:31,289
Ah! I'm envious of her.

398
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:33,609
Thank you for your kindness.

399
00:31:33,609 --> 00:31:36,009
But I don't accept gifts.

400
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:50,969
- It's a festival gift for you. 
 - Thank you, Miss Mu.

401
00:31:50,969 --> 00:31:53,770
Here you go, a festival gift.

402
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,970
I made this lotus pastry myself.

403
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:58,370
Take this.

404
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,029
Hello.

405
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,788
- It's a festival gift for you. 
 - Thank you, Miss Mu.

406
00:32:06,788 --> 00:32:08,610
Thank you, Miss Mu.

407
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,510
Mu Zhuohua.

408
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,049
Your Highness.

409
00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:18,850
Finally, those noble ladies let you go?

410
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,534
Stop mocking me.

411
00:32:20,535 --> 00:32:22,462
It wasn't easy for me to slip away.

412
00:32:22,463 --> 00:32:27,028
They gave me lots of handkerchiefs and pouches with mandarin ducks or lotus pairs on them.

413
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,649
I thought noble ladies should be demure.

414
00:32:29,649 --> 00:32:31,929
But they were not at all.

415
00:32:33,589 --> 00:32:35,089
What's with that look?

416
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:37,229
I slipped away to look for you.

417
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,830
Me?

418
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:41,210
What's the matter, Your Highness?

419
00:32:48,189 --> 00:32:50,189
Take this.

420
00:32:50,189 --> 00:32:51,970
What's this?

421
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:56,210
Your gift for the Tongxin Festival.

422
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:59,389
Thank you, Your Highness. I didn't expect that.

423
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:10,189
Your gift is very useful.

424
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:11,528
Certainly.

425
00:33:11,528 --> 00:33:13,890
I always have good taste.

426
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,690
That's a lot.

427
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,450
Thank you, Your Highness.

428
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,349
Where's my gift?

429
00:33:25,349 --> 00:33:28,969
I... Don't tell me you didn't prepare one.

430
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,548
I did.

431
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:33,449
Of course, I did.

432
00:33:33,449 --> 00:33:35,449
A moment.

433
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,810
Lotus pastry?

434
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:53,209
- You made this yourself? 
 - Yes. Have a taste.

435
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,669
How is it?

436
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,710
This tastes so good.

437
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:06,049
Uncle.

438
00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:08,989
My Lord.

439
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:12,329
Look. Mu Zhuohua gave me this.

440
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:21,309
Hey, I want more.

441
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:24,188
Your Highness, gifts aren't meant to be many, though.

442
00:34:24,189 --> 00:34:25,469
One is enough.

443
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:29,169
Your little pouch is just half the size of mine.

444
00:34:29,169 --> 00:34:30,469
How about this?

445
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:32,370
Give me back some silver.

446
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:36,989
Never mind.

447
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:38,590
Just take it.

448
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,469
Uncle.

449
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:42,550
Why are you taking her side?

450
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:46,950
Your Highness, you can't take back the gift once it's given.

451
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,570
Run now.

452
00:34:54,069 --> 00:34:55,849
I'm not insisting. Why are you running?

453
00:34:55,849 --> 00:34:57,450
What's wrong with her?

454
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,789
 Yes, it's him. 

455
00:35:02,789 --> 00:35:07,469
 - First Prince. 
 - First Prince. 

456
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:12,810
My Lord, here's your gift.

457
00:35:15,629 --> 00:35:17,469
Is it the same dessert?

458
00:35:17,469 --> 00:35:18,909
Of course not.

459
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,289
This is a unique gift.

460
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:24,069
I won this with my talent.

461
00:35:24,069 --> 00:35:25,889
Talent?

462
00:35:25,889 --> 00:35:28,989
The store owner approves of my talent.

463
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:33,250
So, he traded this with my poem without taking any money.

464
00:35:34,189 --> 00:35:38,770
This store owner has quite a unique taste.

465
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,530
Open it.

466
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,228
My Lord.

467
00:35:50,229 --> 00:35:52,029
Do you like it?

468
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,390
Yes, I do.

469
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,310
I'm glad that you like it.

470
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,790
What's wrong?

471
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:21,810
My Lord, today is the Tongxin Festival.

472
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,449
I know.

473
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:29,610
First Prince gave me a gift just now.

474
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:33,049
I saw it.

475
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:37,789
Then... My Lord.

476
00:36:37,789 --> 00:36:39,210
Well...

477
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:43,449
Don't you have anything for me?

478
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,350
Well...

479
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:55,689
I never celebrate festivals.

480
00:36:55,689 --> 00:37:00,069
It's my mistake.

481
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:03,470
I didn't prepare a gift for you.

482
00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:07,469
It's all right.

483
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:13,029
I know you don't celebrate festivals.

484
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:15,810
I'll take my leave.

485
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,430
Lord Ding.

486
00:37:23,229 --> 00:37:25,949
I made this embroidered pouch for you.

487
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,389
I hope you'll like it.

488
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,909
I don't accept gifts.

489
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,800
- Have you given out your gift? 
 - Yes.

490
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,349
I received two gifts.

491
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,350
From whom?

492
00:37:59,529 --> 00:38:02,389
The lotus pastry made by Mu Zhuohua tastes really good.

493
00:38:03,189 --> 00:38:05,509
It's better than those from the Imperial Kitchen.

494
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,390
You have that, too?

495
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:13,170
Why do you look so surprised?

496
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:16,489
Ms. Mu is very generous.

497
00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:07,228
The dancing is graceful.

498
00:39:07,229 --> 00:39:09,628
It's pleasing to the eye.

499
00:39:09,629 --> 00:39:11,129
Indeed.

500
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:14,068
Especially the noble lady who led the dance.

501
00:39:14,069 --> 00:39:15,869
She's beautiful.

502
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,830
Just average.

503
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:29,170
Older Brother,

504
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:32,749
all noble ladies here are well known for their talents.

505
00:39:32,749 --> 00:39:36,068
You're picky, aren't you?

506
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:37,669
Older Brother,

507
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:41,829
you can't make random comments if you know nothing about music.

508
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,929
If you want to hear something nice,

509
00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:55,470
Yunyun has picked up her guqin skills from a great master.

510
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:58,249
Her guqin playing was once the talk of the capital.

511
00:39:58,249 --> 00:40:04,810
I wonder if I will have the pleasure to hear you play, Yunyun.

512
00:40:12,669 --> 00:40:15,502
You flatter me, Your Majesty.

513
00:40:15,503 --> 00:40:18,803
It's my honor to perform for you.

514
00:40:18,803 --> 00:40:21,029
Don't be humble, Yunyun.

515
00:40:21,749 --> 00:40:25,088
As the old saying goes, "Good things come in pairs."

516
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:29,449
Guqin always goes well with the flute.

517
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:34,990
Lord Ding is renowned for his flute playing.

518
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:38,989
Why don't you have a duet with Yunyun?

519
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:42,610
It would be marvelous.

520
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:59,030
