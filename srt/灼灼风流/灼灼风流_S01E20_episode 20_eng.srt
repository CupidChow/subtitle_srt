1
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:25,230


2
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,459
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:35,080
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:47,779
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,779 --> 00:00:53,159
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,259
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,479
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,679
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:13,779
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,779 --> 00:01:18,639
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

12
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:24,100
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,239
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:36,718
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,718 --> 00:01:39,119
   

16
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,059
   

17
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:44,939
   

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
   

19
00:01:49,785 --> 00:01:52,224
Do you really like him?

20
00:01:56,985 --> 00:02:00,445
Yes, I've fallen for him.

21
00:02:02,345 --> 00:02:04,245
But...

22
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:07,844
I can't do that.

23
00:02:08,505 --> 00:02:10,284
Why not?

24
00:02:13,305 --> 00:02:17,405
Sir, you already know this.

25
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:23,124
My journey has been full of twists and turns, ups and downs.

26
00:02:23,124 --> 00:02:29,604
I've endured countless hardships and overcame many obstacles to accomplish what I have today.

27
00:02:32,144 --> 00:02:39,264
I'm afraid that if I allow myself to fall for Lord Ding,

28
00:02:39,264 --> 00:02:41,665
I'll undo all my previous efforts...

29
00:02:42,524 --> 00:02:44,665
and burn my bridges.

30
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:51,165
I've watched you grow up.

31
00:02:51,165 --> 00:02:57,665
Naturally, I understand the hardships you've faced better than anyone.

32
00:02:57,665 --> 00:03:01,616
But you need to understand one thing.

33
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:05,383
If you lose yourself for the sake of love,

34
00:03:05,383 --> 00:03:09,605
then it's the fault of the world, not yours.

35
00:03:12,864 --> 00:03:15,144
Sir, your words make sense.

36
00:03:15,144 --> 00:03:21,565
But I'm still not capable of changing the current situation.

37
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:28,484
I'll bury my feelings for him deep in my heart

38
00:03:28,484 --> 00:03:33,445
because I must continue moving forward.

39
00:03:35,685 --> 00:03:40,440
   

40
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:51,005
Sir, I must take my leave now.

41
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:54,004
Do you have anything else to say to me?

42
00:03:54,004 --> 00:03:55,983
I've said everything that needs to be said.

43
00:03:55,983 --> 00:03:57,684
Go on.

44
00:03:59,325 --> 00:04:01,884
After I leave this time,

45
00:04:01,884 --> 00:04:05,124
I don't know when I'll be able to return and visit you again.

46
00:04:06,984 --> 00:04:11,025
If you're having a bad time, come and visit me in the capital.

47
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:13,464
I will take good care of you.

48
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:20,744
Just focus on being a good official, that's how you'll show your care and piety to me.

49
00:04:26,564 --> 00:04:32,064
Zhuohua, I have something to talk to Tutor Shang about.

50
00:04:41,884 --> 00:04:43,384
Then I'll take my leave.

51
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:45,005
Off you go.

52
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:55,225
Go.

53
00:05:03,144 --> 00:05:09,244
Coincidentally, I also have a couple of things to say to Your Lordship.

54
00:05:09,884 --> 00:05:11,865
Please go ahead.

55
00:05:11,865 --> 00:05:16,805
I can tell your relationship with Qi is not ordinary.

56
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:19,984
You should know that she changed her identity. Right?

57
00:05:19,984 --> 00:05:22,285
She didn't hide it from me.

58
00:05:22,965 --> 00:05:26,364
Qi changed her identity out of necessity.

59
00:05:26,364 --> 00:05:30,544
When a woman holds an official position, she encounters constraints and limitations at every turn.

60
00:05:31,185 --> 00:05:36,765
Her unique background makes her journey even more challenging.

61
00:05:36,765 --> 00:05:40,705
You should understand this better than I do.

62
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:46,437
Forgive my drunken ramblings.

63
00:05:47,285 --> 00:05:50,305
You treat Qi differently.

64
00:05:50,305 --> 00:05:54,223
This kind of treatment might be a form of blessing for others.

65
00:05:54,223 --> 00:06:01,520
But for Qi, it's perhaps more like a shackle.

66
00:06:03,384 --> 00:06:07,504
Do you understand what I'm trying to imply here?

67
00:06:11,484 --> 00:06:13,844
Thank you for your reminder, Tutor Shang.

68
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:20,025
I know she has her ambitions.

69
00:06:20,025 --> 00:06:25,424
And I will clear the path for her.

70
00:06:26,305 --> 00:06:31,125
I won't let her be held back because of me.

71
00:06:35,824 --> 00:06:39,440
I'm nearing the end of my life.

72
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,590
It's my greatest fortune to have met her in this lifetime.

73
00:06:45,345 --> 00:06:49,785
I won't ask for more.

74
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:54,224
Very well, then. Your words put my mind at ease.

75
00:06:54,224 --> 00:06:59,424
It's also Qi's blessing to have met you.

76
00:07:01,784 --> 00:07:03,584
You should leave, too.

77
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,050
   

78
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:55,445
My Lord, what did Tutor Shang tell you?

79
00:08:01,165 --> 00:08:03,765
What did Tutor Shang tell you?

80
00:08:04,425 --> 00:08:06,845
I asked you first.

81
00:08:17,684 --> 00:08:22,310
Well... I won't tell you...

82
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,680
if you don't tell me.

83
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:32,216
♫  The flowing water bends and reflects the round moon  ♫

84
00:08:32,216 --> 00:08:35,866
♫  Gently sprinkling your eyebrows and eyes  ♫

85
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:43,466
♫  The galaxy is like the sea, 
 the eyes are like the eaves covered with snow  ♫

86
00:08:43,466 --> 00:08:47,286
♫  The night rain hitting the sycamore tree disturbs a sparrow  ♫

87
00:08:47,286 --> 00:08:50,966
♫  The young maiden become acquainted with 
 the green robes in that moment  ♫

88
00:08:50,966 --> 00:08:57,486
♫  Afraid that the number of twists and turns will increase  ♫

89
00:08:57,486 --> 00:09:05,916
♫  You are like the flowers and moon, stretching while not breaking my time and drifting away  ♫

90
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:12,596
♫  Thousands of words are not enough 
 to accompany the long journey  ♫

91
00:09:12,596 --> 00:09:20,916
♫  You are like the flowers and moon, 
 more graceful than a palace in the sky  ♫

92
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:28,016
♫  Accompanying you, calmly waiting 
 for the clouds to fade away  ♫

93
00:09:31,636 --> 00:09:35,986
♫  Standing on heights looking clearly into the horizon with a shared aspiration  ♫

94
00:09:35,986 --> 00:09:39,716
♫  It is much farther than just two consensual hearts  ♫

95
00:09:39,716 --> 00:09:47,090
♫  Look at this world again after thousands of sails have passed  ♫

96
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:51,685
My Lord, you're back!

97
00:10:06,545 --> 00:10:08,545
What is it?

98
00:10:08,545 --> 00:10:10,145
Nothing.

99
00:10:10,145 --> 00:10:13,585
Please continue your stroll with Official Mu, My Lord.

100
00:10:27,945 --> 00:10:29,264
It's getting late.

101
00:10:29,264 --> 00:10:33,164
Get an early rest, My Lord.

102
00:11:07,104 --> 00:11:08,885
 Isn't that the scum? 

103
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:14,225
 Beat him! Hit him! 

104
00:11:14,225 --> 00:11:22,505
 Beat him! Hit him! 

105
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:28,780
 Beat him! Hit him! 

106
00:11:35,385 --> 00:11:40,305
 Your Highness! Over here, Your Highness! 

107
00:11:49,285 --> 00:11:51,863
Your Highness, we prepared these gifts for you. Please accept them.

108
00:11:51,863 --> 00:11:52,764
That's right, Your Highness.

109
00:11:52,764 --> 00:11:54,823
It's a token of our appreciation. Please accept them.

110
00:11:54,823 --> 00:11:56,264
Sister, just accept them.

111
00:11:56,264 --> 00:11:58,124
They're giving your gifts out of their kind intention.

112
00:11:58,124 --> 00:12:01,624
That's right. Please accept these gifts.

113
00:12:08,984 --> 00:12:11,265
Brother, don't take this to heart.

114
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:13,405
They're only...

115
00:12:13,405 --> 00:12:15,463
Sister, you gave out congee to the hungry.

116
00:12:15,463 --> 00:12:18,665
It's only natural that they're grateful.

117
00:12:18,665 --> 00:12:20,863
I just provided some rice and grains.

118
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:25,905
You and Zhuohua were the ones who tirelessly worked for disaster relief.

119
00:12:25,905 --> 00:12:27,743
I truly feel undeserving.

120
00:12:27,743 --> 00:12:29,184
Sister, I beg to differ.

121
00:12:29,184 --> 00:12:31,845
We've both done it for the country and the people.

122
00:12:35,305 --> 00:12:37,005
Official Mu.

123
00:12:39,905 --> 00:12:43,064
You must be elated to see the people being this happy. Right?

124
00:12:43,064 --> 00:12:46,625
The people of Yongding County have successfully overcome the disaster.

125
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:49,665
The greedy and corrupt Zhuang Wenfeng has been caught.

126
00:12:49,665 --> 00:12:52,964
What could be more gratifying than this?

127
00:12:54,265 --> 00:12:59,664
It is indeed a joyful occasion that Yongding County is back on track.

128
00:12:59,664 --> 00:13:01,658
But...

129
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:06,145
What is it, Brother Shen?

130
00:13:06,145 --> 00:13:10,844
Earlier, the First Prince instructed me to investigate Zhuang Wenfeng's background.

131
00:13:10,844 --> 00:13:14,424
Care to guess how he obtained his official position?

132
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,984
Brother Shen, stop the suspense.

133
00:13:18,684 --> 00:13:21,725
He's the assistant of Imperial Censor, Zhuang Zixian's nephew.

134
00:13:21,725 --> 00:13:24,564
His father was a high-ranking official.

135
00:13:24,564 --> 00:13:28,103
After his father's death, he was granted this position through connections.

136
00:13:28,103 --> 00:13:32,365
Despite his mediocrity, he secured a good job position.

137
00:13:32,365 --> 00:13:37,104
I'm afraid apprehending Zhuang Wenfeng may not be an end,

138
00:13:37,104 --> 00:13:39,265
but a beginning.

139
00:13:44,964 --> 00:13:46,284
It doesn't matter.

140
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,944
We'll face whatever comes our way.

141
00:13:48,944 --> 00:13:53,284
After all, anything and everything that begins has to come to an end.

142
00:13:55,265 --> 00:13:58,465
Official Mu, you're right.

143
00:14:02,505 --> 00:14:04,748
   

144
00:14:09,025 --> 00:14:12,625
My son has been taken to the capital.

145
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:17,103
You useless fool! What do I need you for?

146
00:14:17,864 --> 00:14:21,385
If anything happens to my son,

147
00:14:21,385 --> 00:14:25,503
you can just be prepared to be buried with him!

148
00:14:25,503 --> 00:14:28,285
Mother-in-law, please calm down.

149
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:31,724
Mu Zhuohua may have Lord Ding as her support,

150
00:14:31,724 --> 00:14:34,004
but I know her secret.

151
00:14:34,004 --> 00:14:36,184
You?

152
00:14:36,184 --> 00:14:40,524
Mother-in-law, Mu Zhuohua is the Zhuang family's runaway concubine.

153
00:14:40,524 --> 00:14:42,524
We even exchanged an engagement letter before.

154
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:45,783
How can she deserve an official position after she's done such an improper thing?

155
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:49,424
Why? Why does she get her way?

156
00:14:49,424 --> 00:14:53,285
How could she throw her weight around and make me utterly miserable?

157
00:14:53,285 --> 00:14:59,140
I... I'm going to make her pay.

158
00:15:00,045 --> 00:15:02,944
What are you planning to do?

159
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:10,485
I will go to the capital and strike the Dengwen Drum.

160
00:15:10,485 --> 00:15:12,870
I'm going to sue Mu Zhuohua!

161
00:15:23,804 --> 00:15:25,604
Juli!

162
00:15:25,604 --> 00:15:28,682
Young Lady! Young Lady!

163
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:31,984
Young Lady, you're finally back. I missed you so much.

164
00:15:31,984 --> 00:15:34,164
I missed you too. It's my fault.

165
00:15:34,164 --> 00:15:38,564
Next time, I'll never leave you alone at home for so long again.

166
00:15:39,485 --> 00:15:42,644
Young Lady, this is...

167
00:15:42,644 --> 00:15:44,343
It's my mother's ashes.

168
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,444
I brought them back.

169
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:51,944
Third Madam, Young Lady has finally brought you back.

170
00:15:51,944 --> 00:15:54,384
This place will be our home from now on.

171
00:15:54,384 --> 00:15:57,324
Our days will get better and better.

172
00:15:57,324 --> 00:16:00,764
That's for sure. Our days must get better and better.

173
00:16:00,764 --> 00:16:03,164
Young Lady, you must be exhausted. Hurry inside and get some rest.

174
00:16:03,164 --> 00:16:06,083
- I'll go and carry the luggage. 
 - Okay, go ahead.

175
00:16:27,964 --> 00:16:32,464
Mother, can you see this?

176
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,885
You're home now.

177
00:16:36,905 --> 00:16:39,324
I've brought you home.

178
00:17:10,264 --> 00:17:14,864
 Qi, this is my home. 

179
00:17:14,864 --> 00:17:17,324
 Look at this apricot tree. 

180
00:17:17,324 --> 00:17:19,464
 Isn't it beautiful? 

181
00:17:23,285 --> 00:17:27,785
 In spring, it's full of apricot blossoms on its branches. 

182
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:32,005
 In summer, red apricots adorn its tips. 

183
00:18:00,464 --> 00:18:05,930
Earlier, I had someone choose an auspicious time for her burial.

184
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:11,430
I also picked a burial site with excellent feng shui.

185
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:16,685
Tomorrow, I'll accompany you to put your mother to rest in peace.

186
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:20,485
Thank you, My Lord.

187
00:18:22,984 --> 00:18:28,884
My mother was trapped in the Mu Residence

188
00:18:28,884 --> 00:18:31,084
for most of her life.

189
00:18:31,084 --> 00:18:33,724
She always wanted to break free from destiny.

190
00:18:34,784 --> 00:18:36,905
But in the end,

191
00:18:38,264 --> 00:18:43,404
she couldn't escape it even after she traded her life.

192
00:18:47,984 --> 00:18:54,384
Now, it was you who helped her overcome her fate.

193
00:19:03,064 --> 00:19:07,764
Mother, you were right.

194
00:19:07,764 --> 00:19:12,624
You said that if a woman studies, there will be a way out for her.

195
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,643
   

196
00:19:22,643 --> 00:19:25,083
Zhimo? It's really you.

197
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,183
I'm back.

198
00:19:26,183 --> 00:19:27,503
You're finally back.

199
00:19:27,503 --> 00:19:29,824
Why didn't you tell me before you left?

200
00:19:29,824 --> 00:19:31,603
By the way, where did you go?

201
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:32,964
Have you eaten?

202
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:34,563
You... You're not injured. Right?

203
00:19:34,563 --> 00:19:36,044
I didn't have time to tell you.

204
00:19:36,044 --> 00:19:37,545
We went to Jiangnan.

205
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:39,063
I haven't eaten.

206
00:19:39,063 --> 00:19:40,764
I'm not injured.

207
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:43,664
Luckily, you came back safe and sound.

208
00:19:47,264 --> 00:19:49,385
You have delicious snacks.

209
00:19:54,564 --> 00:19:58,045
By the way, why don't you have one?

210
00:20:01,544 --> 00:20:03,984
- Is it good? 
 - Yes.

211
00:20:06,285 --> 00:20:07,785
Hey?

212
00:20:09,024 --> 00:20:11,484
I thought you didn't like sweet things.

213
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,703
It's fortunate that you've reconciled with Lord Ding.

214
00:20:15,703 --> 00:20:18,504
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to enjoy such delicious pig's trotters again.

215
00:20:18,504 --> 00:20:20,685
Try the chicken wings.

216
00:20:20,685 --> 00:20:22,123
Look at you.

217
00:20:22,123 --> 00:20:25,364
A few mouthfuls of food and you're taking his side.

218
00:20:25,364 --> 00:20:28,684
Young Lady, why are you judging me when you're the same?

219
00:20:28,684 --> 00:20:31,503
A few mouthfuls of food and you're staying next door for the meal.

220
00:20:31,503 --> 00:20:34,604
I even made so much delicious food waiting for you here.

221
00:20:34,604 --> 00:20:37,144
Lord Ding saved my life.

222
00:20:37,144 --> 00:20:40,485
I couldn't bring myself to reject him when he invited me for dinner.

223
00:20:40,485 --> 00:20:43,524
Young Lady, are you injured? Are your injuries serious?

224
00:20:43,524 --> 00:20:46,724
I'm fine, no need to worry.

225
00:20:46,724 --> 00:20:50,945
It was Lord Ding who got seriously injured while trying to save me.

226
00:20:50,945 --> 00:20:52,885
You scared me half to death.

227
00:20:53,564 --> 00:20:54,710
Eat slowly.

228
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:59,245
By the way, Young Lady, Lord Ding sure has a streak of bad luck.

229
00:20:59,245 --> 00:21:02,303
First, he got injured in Jiangnan while saving you.

230
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:05,485
Now, someone filed a complaint against him in the capital.

231
00:21:05,485 --> 00:21:08,503
A complaint? What do you mean?

232
00:21:09,264 --> 00:21:10,323
I'm not too sure.

233
00:21:10,323 --> 00:21:12,264
Zhimo told me.

234
00:21:12,264 --> 00:21:14,883
It seems Lord Ding left the capital without permission.

235
00:21:14,883 --> 00:21:18,304
Many people went to His Majesty to complain about him.

236
00:21:18,304 --> 00:21:21,984
He was impeached because he left the capital without permission?

237
00:21:21,984 --> 00:21:24,970
Yes, that's the word Zhimo used.

238
00:21:25,465 --> 00:21:28,203
These gossipmongers. They sure have nothing better to do.

239
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,104
Are they the only ones who can complain?

240
00:21:30,104 --> 00:21:32,783
Tomorrow morning, I'll seek an audience with His Majesty

241
00:21:32,783 --> 00:21:35,284
and put this false accusation to an end.

242
00:21:39,055 --> 00:21:40,264
   

243
00:21:40,264 --> 00:21:42,304
 Greetings, Your Majesty. 

244
00:21:42,304 --> 00:21:43,804
You may rise.

245
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:45,725
Thank you, Your Majesty.

246
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,125
Official Mu, what brings you here today?

247
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:54,265
Your Majesty, I know you're busy,

248
00:21:54,265 --> 00:21:56,584
and I shouldn't trouble you.

249
00:21:56,584 --> 00:22:00,564
But something has been bothering me.

250
00:22:00,564 --> 00:22:02,824
Thus, I felt compelled to see you.

251
00:22:05,385 --> 00:22:06,825
What's bothering you?

252
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,865
I've heard...

253
00:22:09,884 --> 00:22:13,304
about the recent accusations against Lord Ding for leaving the capital.

254
00:22:13,304 --> 00:22:18,683
Some even claim he's arrogant and disrespectful due to his accomplishments.

255
00:22:18,683 --> 00:22:20,924
It's just as you've said.

256
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:23,145
Almost accurate.

257
00:22:24,164 --> 00:22:25,984
So what are your thoughts on this matter, Official Mu?

258
00:22:25,984 --> 00:22:30,640
I believe these memorials are full of nonsense.

259
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,120
Oh?

260
00:22:34,204 --> 00:22:36,404
Why do you say that?

261
00:22:36,404 --> 00:22:39,625
Your Majesty, you and Lord Ding are biological brothers.

262
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:43,985
Who could understand Lord Ding's character better than you?

263
00:22:43,985 --> 00:22:47,485
To Your Majesty, his loyalty and sincerity are unmatched.

264
00:22:47,485 --> 00:22:50,945
To his nephew, his care and guidance are wholehearted.

265
00:22:50,945 --> 00:22:55,783
Even toward his subordinates, he's fair and understanding, setting a positive example.

266
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:01,124
You've always shown great approval toward Lord Ding.

267
00:23:01,124 --> 00:23:03,224
Yet, these individuals are spreading malicious words,

268
00:23:03,224 --> 00:23:07,204
trying to incite discord between Your Majesty and His Lordship's brotherly affection.

269
00:23:07,204 --> 00:23:11,584
So do you have any idea why they would dare to slander him?

270
00:23:12,245 --> 00:23:17,265
They criticize and defame him only because they fear and envy him.

271
00:23:22,385 --> 00:23:24,404
It's exactly as you said.

272
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:27,625
I know Lord Ding's character and personality very well.

273
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:32,403
That's why I've already rejected all these impeachments made against him.

274
00:23:35,345 --> 00:23:37,265
Your Majesty is indeed wise.

275
00:23:37,265 --> 00:23:39,804
If I knew, I...

276
00:23:39,804 --> 00:23:42,284
I would...

277
00:23:42,984 --> 00:23:46,765
Your willingness to do so is truly rare and admirable.

278
00:23:46,765 --> 00:23:51,305
If Lord Ding knew, he would be very pleased.

279
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:55,224
Your Majesty, I shall take my leave, then.

280
00:24:18,632 --> 00:24:22,189
   

281
00:24:38,585 --> 00:24:41,644
Someone has struck the Dengwen Drum?

282
00:24:41,644 --> 00:24:43,884
 Dengwen Drum? 

283
00:24:43,884 --> 00:24:45,864
How many grievances did one endure to willingly bear 30 floggings to strike the drum?

284
00:24:48,844 --> 00:24:53,584
Hurry up and see who's striking the drum and what grievance to address.

285
00:24:53,584 --> 00:24:55,225
Yes, Your Majesty.

286
00:25:01,764 --> 00:25:06,423
Do you know you have to receive 30 floggings before meeting His Majesty after you strike this drum?

287
00:25:07,904 --> 00:25:09,684
I know.

288
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:12,844
Eight!

289
00:25:14,744 --> 00:25:16,044
Nine!

290
00:25:17,504 --> 00:25:18,904
Ten!

291
00:25:22,345 --> 00:25:23,945
Eleven!

292
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,624
Twelve!

293
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:29,684
- Thirteen!  
 &lt;- What?

294
00:25:29,684 --> 00:25:33,124
She would rather endure 30 floggings just to accuse me?

295
00:25:33,124 --> 00:25:35,164
What is she up to?

296
00:25:35,164 --> 00:25:39,663
Official Mu, you just returned from Jiangnan and can't even rest peacefully.

297
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,784
But now, His Majesty has summoned you.

298
00:25:41,784 --> 00:25:44,984
Official Mu,  please come with me.

299
00:25:44,984 --> 00:25:48,825
Miss Eighth... She... How could she accuse us when she's the evildoer?

300
00:25:48,825 --> 00:25:52,504
Young Lady, what should we do now?

301
00:25:52,504 --> 00:25:54,185
What should we do?

302
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:58,503
Just change into the court attire. I will go to the Xuanzheng Palace and confront her head-on.

303
00:25:59,464 --> 00:26:02,764
I respectfully greet Your Majesty.

304
00:26:02,764 --> 00:26:04,625
Who is kneeling?

305
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:07,845
What grievance do you wish to report?

306
00:26:07,845 --> 00:26:12,865
I'm Madam Mu, wife of Zhuang Wenfeng, Yongding County's county magistrate.

307
00:26:15,525 --> 00:26:17,924
I want to accuse someone.

308
00:26:17,924 --> 00:26:20,404
This person is guilty of embezzlement, abusing power,

309
00:26:20,404 --> 00:26:25,483
condoning acts of violence, oppressing innocent people, and committing all kinds of evil deeds!

310
00:26:34,765 --> 00:26:36,704
Zhuang Wenfeng?

311
00:26:37,865 --> 00:26:39,765
Zhuang Zixian.

312
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:45,705
Yes, Your Majesty.

313
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:47,725
Who is this Zhuang Wenfeng to you?

314
00:26:47,725 --> 00:26:52,764
Your Majesty, Zhuang Wenfeng is my nephew.

315
00:26:52,764 --> 00:26:59,085
Your Majesty, as Madam Mu stated, my nephew is innocent.

316
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:03,757
Now, Madam Mu struck the Dengwen Drum

317
00:27:03,757 --> 00:27:06,945
to seek justice for her husband.

318
00:27:09,704 --> 00:27:13,704
Madam Mu, you're now at Xuanzheng Palace.

319
00:27:13,704 --> 00:27:19,024
Please speak sensibly before me.

320
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:22,205
Yes, Your Majesty.

321
00:27:22,205 --> 00:27:27,305
I'm risking my life today to seek justice!

322
00:27:29,145 --> 00:27:34,045
The people I want to accuse today...

323
00:27:37,704 --> 00:27:43,984
are County Magistrate Zhuang Wenfeng and Imperial Censor Zhuang Zixian!

324
00:27:43,984 --> 00:27:45,464
You!

325
00:27:46,045 --> 00:27:49,064
What nonsense are you spouting?

326
00:27:49,064 --> 00:27:50,584
Insolence!

327
00:27:51,164 --> 00:27:54,705
How dare you behave insolently in the presence of His Majesty?

328
00:27:59,105 --> 00:28:03,584
Madam Mu, Zhuang Wenfeng and Zhuang Zixian are appointed officials of the court.

329
00:28:03,584 --> 00:28:06,164
Do you have evidence to accuse them?

330
00:28:06,164 --> 00:28:07,764
I do!

331
00:28:20,084 --> 00:28:26,263
This ledger contains records of Zhuang Wenfeng's bribery and corruption in Yongding County.

332
00:28:26,263 --> 00:28:28,984
Other than this, he colluded with wealthy merchants, released counterfeited currency,

333
00:28:28,984 --> 00:28:33,425
destroyed families, seized land, committed murder and arson.

334
00:28:33,425 --> 00:28:37,744
No, no, no! Your Majesty, Zhuang Wenfeng is just my nephew.

335
00:28:37,744 --> 00:28:40,023
I did not know of this matter.

336
00:28:40,023 --> 00:28:42,205
I'm innocent!

337
00:28:42,205 --> 00:28:48,243
This ledger also records Zhuang Wenfeng's accumulation of wealth in Yongding County for Zhuang Zixian.

338
00:28:49,064 --> 00:28:53,764
If it weren't for Lord Ding and Official Mu handling it impartially,

339
00:28:53,764 --> 00:28:58,005
I couldn't have brought this ledger here.

340
00:28:58,005 --> 00:29:00,864
Your Majesty, please investigate this thoroughly.

341
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,404
Your... Your Majesty.

342
00:29:02,404 --> 00:29:03,804
Your Majesty.

343
00:29:08,364 --> 00:29:10,665
Take Madam Mu to the Imperial Academy of Medicine for treatment.

344
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,265
Yes, Your Majesty.

345
00:29:12,265 --> 00:29:13,845
Guards!

346
00:29:21,905 --> 00:29:24,364
Your Majesty, I...

347
00:29:24,364 --> 00:29:26,525
I'm innocent, Your Majesty.

348
00:29:26,525 --> 00:29:30,703
Zhuang Wenfeng and Zhuang Zixian are guilty of embezzlement and corruption.

349
00:29:30,703 --> 00:29:33,884
From this day on, imprison him and the Ministry of Justice shall take over this case.

350
00:29:33,884 --> 00:29:36,005
He shall be executed on an appointed day!

351
00:29:36,005 --> 00:29:39,425
Those who assisted his wrongdoing shall be executed.

352
00:29:39,425 --> 00:29:41,985
The others shall be sent into exile.

353
00:29:41,985 --> 00:29:46,383
Madam Mu, wife of Zhuang Wenfeng, who stood up for justice by accusing him shall be pardoned.

354
00:29:46,383 --> 00:29:50,344
She shall be rewarded thousands of taels of silver and erect a monument of loyalty and righteousness.

355
00:29:51,844 --> 00:29:53,825
Your Majesty!

356
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:56,825
Your Majesty, I'm innocent!

357
00:29:56,825 --> 00:29:58,223
What are you doing?

358
00:29:58,223 --> 00:30:01,230
 Your Majesty! Your Majesty! I'm innocent! 

359
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,400
 Your Majesty! 

360
00:30:04,445 --> 00:30:05,945
Your Majesty is wise.

361
00:30:05,945 --> 00:30:08,825
 Your Majesty is wise! 

362
00:30:10,424 --> 00:30:12,204
Official Shen.

363
00:30:16,665 --> 00:30:21,625
The First Prince told me that Mu Zhuohua, the administrator of the Ministry of Rites,

364
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:23,884
and Shen Jinghong, the Director of the Ministry of Revenue,

365
00:30:23,884 --> 00:30:27,804
have selflessly served the people and shared the country's worries.

366
00:30:27,804 --> 00:30:30,625
It was sure a painstaking effort.

367
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:35,084
Mu Zhuohua, the administrator of the Ministry of Rites, who has shown loyalty to the ruler and compassion for the people

368
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:40,064
and thoroughly investigated corruption, is hereby promoted to the Director of the Ministry of Revenue.

369
00:30:41,045 --> 00:30:44,784
Thank you, Your Majesty.

370
00:30:49,205 --> 00:30:51,364
As for Shen Jinghong,

371
00:30:53,364 --> 00:30:56,803
you will go to the Ministry of Personnel and be promoted to the director there.

372
00:30:58,784 --> 00:31:02,185
Thank you, Your Majesty.

373
00:31:03,485 --> 00:31:09,204
Also, Princess Roujia has contributed to disaster relief and aided the afflicted.

374
00:31:09,204 --> 00:31:12,445
I shall reward her generously.

375
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:34,340
   

376
00:31:35,744 --> 00:31:37,464
Congratulations, Your Highness.

377
00:31:37,464 --> 00:31:39,404
I shall take my leave now.

378
00:31:48,804 --> 00:31:53,604
Man'er, convert these rewards into rice and supplies

379
00:31:53,604 --> 00:31:56,125
for those in need at Jishan Hall.

380
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:57,905
Yes, Your Highness.

381
00:32:01,765 --> 00:32:04,905
Is there anything, Father?

382
00:32:07,045 --> 00:32:09,744
Everyone received rewards, except you.

383
00:32:09,744 --> 00:32:13,425
You must be displeased.

384
00:32:15,905 --> 00:32:17,805
Well...

385
00:32:20,865 --> 00:32:23,665
I am indeed slightly disappointed.

386
00:32:24,264 --> 00:32:25,764
Chen'er,

387
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:31,185
you didn't receive any rewards because those were your duties.

388
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:35,624
What you should see aren't those rewards

389
00:32:35,624 --> 00:32:38,185
but the people of the country.

390
00:32:41,765 --> 00:32:45,344
I shall remember your guidance in my heart.

391
00:32:52,084 --> 00:32:56,525
My Lord, thank you for what you did at Xuanzheng Palace.

392
00:32:57,105 --> 00:33:01,444
Consider it as your repayment for defending me in front of His Majesty.

393
00:33:02,585 --> 00:33:07,945
So you found out what I told His Majesty.

394
00:33:08,704 --> 00:33:13,144
But you earned your promotion.

395
00:33:13,144 --> 00:33:15,085
It was not because of me.

396
00:33:19,585 --> 00:33:22,344
But I'm thanking you not just because you helped me get promoted.

397
00:33:22,345 --> 00:33:27,164
But also for not letting my eighth sister be flogged again.

398
00:33:28,385 --> 00:33:31,023
My Lord, my eighth sister is currently recovering.

399
00:33:31,024 --> 00:33:34,224
Can I go and visit her?

400
00:33:34,224 --> 00:33:37,824
There's nothing you can't do as long as I'm in charge.

401
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,564
But...

402
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:48,065
did you and your sister plot this together beforehand?

403
00:33:52,604 --> 00:33:54,624
You sure have deep familial affection.

404
00:33:55,604 --> 00:33:59,104
My eighth sister is smart.

405
00:33:59,865 --> 00:34:02,905
 You want me to risk my life for merely one thousand guan? 

406
00:34:02,905 --> 00:34:05,285
 No way. 

407
00:34:08,244 --> 00:34:12,864
 What if you could obtain something worth more than 3,000 guan? 

408
00:34:15,945 --> 00:34:17,545
 What do you mean? 

409
00:34:18,705 --> 00:34:21,264
 Free of worries for the rest of your life. 

410
00:34:23,984 --> 00:34:25,925
 And you're capable of that? 

411
00:34:26,705 --> 00:34:28,224
 I'm not. 

412
00:34:28,225 --> 00:34:30,344
 But His Majesty is. 

413
00:34:36,104 --> 00:34:38,125
 Are you saying... 

414
00:34:44,584 --> 00:34:46,284
 All right. 

415
00:34:47,664 --> 00:34:49,364
 I'll do what you say. 

416
00:34:49,785 --> 00:34:54,924
My Lord, will you blame me for not telling you about this?

417
00:34:55,445 --> 00:34:57,784
You don't need to tell me everything.

418
00:34:57,784 --> 00:34:59,385
You have your freedom.

419
00:35:00,305 --> 00:35:02,285
Thank you for your guidance, My Lord.

420
00:35:02,285 --> 00:35:06,204
I will fulfill my duties and not disappoint His Majesty.

421
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:11,204
You're an official of the Department of State Affairs,

422
00:35:11,204 --> 00:35:14,704
so I naturally must advise you.

423
00:35:14,705 --> 00:35:19,025
If you ever have doubts in the future, you can always come to me for guidance.

424
00:35:19,025 --> 00:35:21,145
Yes, I understand.

425
00:35:22,637 --> 00:35:25,006
   

426
00:35:41,965 --> 00:35:45,704
This medicine can relieve pain.

427
00:35:48,705 --> 00:35:50,405
So,

428
00:35:51,544 --> 00:35:53,464
why did you help me?

429
00:35:54,265 --> 00:35:56,225
Did I help you?

430
00:35:57,005 --> 00:36:00,445
If you didn't accuse me, I wouldn't be at Xuanzheng Palace.

431
00:36:00,445 --> 00:36:04,664
If I didn't go there, how would I receive His Majesty's rewards?

432
00:36:08,265 --> 00:36:10,023
You're silly.

433
00:36:10,024 --> 00:36:12,744
You could have handed the ledger to the Ministry of Justice.

434
00:36:12,745 --> 00:36:15,624
Why did you have to strike the Dengwen Drum?

435
00:36:17,984 --> 00:36:22,184
If I didn't do that, how could I see His Majesty?

436
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:27,985
Fair enough.

437
00:36:28,865 --> 00:36:31,704
His Majesty rewarded you with thousands of taels of silver,

438
00:36:31,705 --> 00:36:34,184
a mansion in Jiangnan,

439
00:36:34,184 --> 00:36:36,964
and a monument

440
00:36:38,184 --> 00:36:40,344
With this monument protecting you,

441
00:36:40,344 --> 00:36:41,965
no one will dare...

442
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:45,925
to mistreat you again in the future.

443
00:36:51,225 --> 00:36:53,025
Really?

444
00:37:01,104 --> 00:37:02,604
That's great.

445
00:37:03,184 --> 00:37:04,684
Great.

446
00:37:05,945 --> 00:37:07,545
It's great.

447
00:37:10,464 --> 00:37:12,064
Eighth Sister.

448
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:18,164
In the future, you won't need to rely on others for a living anymore.

449
00:37:24,865 --> 00:37:26,885
After we bid farewell today,

450
00:37:28,265 --> 00:37:30,065
I wish you well.

451
00:37:36,825 --> 00:37:38,425
What's wrong?

452
00:37:48,105 --> 00:37:50,104
I have something...

453
00:37:51,064 --> 00:37:53,325
I didn't tell you all this while.

454
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:56,204
What is it?

455
00:37:57,705 --> 00:37:59,685
When I was a child,

456
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:03,964
I had a Chausie cat.

457
00:38:04,664 --> 00:38:06,964
It was white and fluffy,

458
00:38:06,964 --> 00:38:08,805
and quite adorable.

459
00:38:08,805 --> 00:38:10,545
I liked it a lot.

460
00:38:11,464 --> 00:38:13,745
But as you know,

461
00:38:13,745 --> 00:38:17,383
whenever Father encounters a cat, his tears will flow profusely.

462
00:38:17,383 --> 00:38:21,665
So no one in the Mu Residence ever kept a cat.

463
00:38:22,184 --> 00:38:25,624
Later, someone told him about the cat.

464
00:38:25,624 --> 00:38:27,645
Father was furious.

465
00:38:29,104 --> 00:38:31,025
And I was terrified.

466
00:38:34,584 --> 00:38:36,284
What happened after that?

467
00:38:37,905 --> 00:38:39,745
After that,

468
00:38:40,745 --> 00:38:45,704
Madam said to kill the cat.

469
00:38:46,664 --> 00:38:48,264
I didn't let them.

470
00:38:49,265 --> 00:38:53,385
After that, she said I must get rid of the cat.

471
00:38:55,164 --> 00:38:58,625
I held it and cried for a long time.

472
00:39:00,385 --> 00:39:02,185
In the end,

473
00:39:04,984 --> 00:39:09,084
I left it in your courtyard.

474
00:39:11,485 --> 00:39:14,025
So it was really you who left the cat there.

475
00:39:14,705 --> 00:39:16,405
You knew?

476
00:39:17,005 --> 00:39:19,304
The cat was clean and white.

477
00:39:19,305 --> 00:39:21,224
It must have been someone's pet.

478
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:23,025
It was clearly not a stray.

479
00:39:23,025 --> 00:39:27,604
But because of that, Father almost threw you out of the house.

480
00:39:27,604 --> 00:39:29,784
You didn't deny it either.

481
00:39:37,265 --> 00:39:38,965
But it's as expected.

482
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:43,884
I took a bet that you wouldn't deny it.

483
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:49,105
That's why I chose to leave the cat in your courtyard.

484
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:58,525
I hope you don't think that I think you were kind.

485
00:40:01,664 --> 00:40:03,605
I think you were silly.

486
00:40:03,605 --> 00:40:05,625
A complete fool.

487
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:14,884
I didn't bother because I knew you wanted to keep the cat alive.

488
00:40:16,064 --> 00:40:18,425
It's not because I'm a pushover.

489
00:40:25,504 --> 00:40:29,404
What happened to the cat after that?

490
00:40:30,284 --> 00:40:33,304
I didn't see you raising it.

491
00:40:33,304 --> 00:40:35,805
I gave it to my teacher.

492
00:40:35,805 --> 00:40:39,724
Taking care of it was too troublesome. I'm not so fond of cats anyway.

493
00:40:41,945 --> 00:40:43,745
As long as it's alive.

494
00:40:45,664 --> 00:40:47,503
You're the foolish one.

495
00:40:47,504 --> 00:40:50,585
That cat has long since passed away peacefully.

496
00:40:52,385 --> 00:40:53,985
I'm not a fool.

497
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:55,884
You're the fool.

498
00:41:04,584 --> 00:41:06,284
Seventh Sister...

499
00:41:10,484 --> 00:41:12,184
Thank you.

500
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:27,040


501
00:41:29,642 --> 00:41:37,101
♫  I can't forget the love that is still is nipping at my ears and temples  ♫

502
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:44,401
♫  Memories keep slamming into rocks and have nowhere to berth  ♫

503
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:51,841
♫  Both sides gaze at each other in the drizzling rain, but one has turned into clouds and mist  ♫

504
00:41:51,841 --> 00:42:00,461
♫  Leaving the isolated heart's island, like waves without a shore  ♫

505
00:42:00,461 --> 00:42:04,101
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

506
00:42:04,101 --> 00:42:07,761
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

507
00:42:07,761 --> 00:42:11,681
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

508
00:42:11,681 --> 00:42:15,161
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

509
00:42:15,162 --> 00:42:18,681
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

510
00:42:18,682 --> 00:42:22,401
♫  Obviously willing to swear life and death 
 to be entangled for a lifetime  ♫

511
00:42:22,402 --> 00:42:26,701
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

512
00:42:26,701 --> 00:42:32,902
♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

513
00:42:46,202 --> 00:42:53,601
♫  I can't forget the turmoil of love and hate, 
 even if the next day is far away  ♫

514
00:42:53,601 --> 00:42:57,161
♫  Two souls embrace in chaos, how can it be written off?  ♫

515
00:42:57,162 --> 00:43:02,182
♫  Two souls embrace in chaos, how can it be written off?  ♫

516
00:43:02,182 --> 00:43:05,841
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

517
00:43:05,841 --> 00:43:09,482
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

518
00:43:09,482 --> 00:43:13,361
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

519
00:43:13,362 --> 00:43:16,901
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

520
00:43:16,901 --> 00:43:20,501
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

521
00:43:20,501 --> 00:43:24,181
♫  Obviously can't be erased, and haunted by lingering dreams  ♫

522
00:43:24,181 --> 00:43:28,261
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

523
00:43:28,261 --> 00:43:35,442
♫  Want to have one more glimpse of you, 
 even just for a second more  ♫
