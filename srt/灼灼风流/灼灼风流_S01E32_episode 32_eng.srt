1
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:25,160


2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,459
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:34,980
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:47,779
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,779 --> 00:00:53,159
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,159
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:03,479
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,579
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,679
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:18,539
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

12
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:24,000
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,239
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:36,918
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,019
   

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,959
   

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,939
   

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,195
   

19
00:01:48,196 --> 00:01:51,184
   

20
00:01:51,185 --> 00:01:53,544
Tutor Shang's words have raised awareness. 
    

21
00:01:53,544 --> 00:01:55,964
Those from noble families are now favored by the emperor,

22
00:01:55,964 --> 00:01:58,464
but they are complacent and bully the common people.

23
00:01:58,465 --> 00:02:01,043
They're unworthy of being favored. And look at us.

24
00:02:01,043 --> 00:02:03,264
We studied for years and passed the examination.

25
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:04,564
We aspire to serve the nation.

26
00:02:04,564 --> 00:02:07,503
But that ambition is being hindered by these pests.

27
00:02:07,504 --> 00:02:09,224
   

28
00:02:09,225 --> 00:02:14,265
This is the Eradicating Corruption Proposal that's been widely spread among the poor, humble scholars lately?

29
00:02:14,265 --> 00:02:15,463
Yes.

30
00:02:15,464 --> 00:02:18,964
The Protected Appointments System has carried on for a century.

31
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:22,904
It is like a towering old tree that is deeply rooted.

32
00:02:22,904 --> 00:02:25,563
These words hit the nail on the head.

33
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:29,284
This Tutor Shang is indeed very insightful.

34
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:30,844
Your Majesty,

35
00:02:30,844 --> 00:02:35,164
Tutor Shang also pointed out in his essay that if one is an official,

36
00:02:35,164 --> 00:02:39,624
their descendants and relatives can all become officials with ease.

37
00:02:39,624 --> 00:02:43,604
In the worst case, there will be free riders acting with impunity.

38
00:02:46,164 --> 00:02:50,445
Your Majesty, even a teacher who isn't a court official

39
00:02:50,445 --> 00:02:52,504
knows the harms of the Protected Appointments System.

40
00:02:52,504 --> 00:02:54,525
But those court officials

41
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:57,745
are afraid to speak up as they fear the power of the noble families.

42
00:02:57,745 --> 00:03:01,465
This shows that the powers of the noble families have been a scourge.

43
00:03:03,044 --> 00:03:07,004
If they are not removed soon, the nation's foundation might be harmed.

44
00:03:17,524 --> 00:03:21,324
Jinghong, why are you suddenly on your knees?

45
00:03:21,324 --> 00:03:23,085
Quickly get up.

46
00:03:24,064 --> 00:03:28,585
I know you are concerned for the sake of Southern Chen.

47
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:32,624
The Protected Appointments System has indeed become a threat.

48
00:03:32,624 --> 00:03:34,705
It cannot be condoned any further.

49
00:03:35,405 --> 00:03:37,285
That is very wise, Your Majesty.

50
00:04:03,204 --> 00:04:05,944
You need to hold your breath and concentrate when you shoot an arrow.

51
00:04:05,944 --> 00:04:07,844
You cannot be distracted.

52
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:17,544
As expected from Mr. Jinghong who outperformed Yemu Jing.

53
00:04:17,544 --> 00:04:20,004
You have excellent archery skills.

54
00:04:26,644 --> 00:04:28,344
That was rude of me.

55
00:04:32,384 --> 00:04:34,184
It's all right.

56
00:04:50,844 --> 00:04:52,104
You did well.

57
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:55,444
I shall make a toast to you with tea instead of wine.

58
00:05:04,925 --> 00:05:06,485
The tea has a strong aroma.

59
00:05:06,485 --> 00:05:09,505
But it has a refreshing taste like the green mountains.

60
00:05:09,505 --> 00:05:12,944
That's right. Sit.

61
00:05:21,685 --> 00:05:25,805
I get to come here and enjoy a moment of peace from the chaos.

62
00:05:26,605 --> 00:05:32,885
But there are still many people in Southern Chen who are struggling in the mire.

63
00:05:32,885 --> 00:05:34,605
Not to worry, Your Highness.

64
00:05:34,605 --> 00:05:38,124
The proposal has highlighted problems of the system.

65
00:05:38,124 --> 00:05:42,825
Now, it has caused a great stir among the poor, humble scholars.

66
00:05:42,825 --> 00:05:47,485
His Majesty is also aware of it and thinks the essay is substantial.

67
00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:50,804
If so, we will be able to accomplish our plan.

68
00:05:50,804 --> 00:05:55,285
Shang Shou, the author of this essay, is the teacher of Mu Zhuohua.

69
00:05:56,245 --> 00:06:00,565
Shang Shou and Mu Zhuohua seemed to be more than just a teacher and a disciple.

70
00:06:00,565 --> 00:06:03,384
They are more like father and daughter.

71
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,500
Since Shang Shou has become the leader in supporting the abolition of the Protected Appointments System,

72
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,945
we don't have to worry about Mu Zhuohua not being on board.

73
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,324
   

74
00:06:16,324 --> 00:06:19,605
This essay was written by Mr. Shang in his early years.

75
00:06:19,605 --> 00:06:22,785
Now, it's being publicized and spread.

76
00:06:22,785 --> 00:06:27,145
I wonder if someone is doing this deliberately.

77
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:31,245
Mr. Shang is sharp-tongued,

78
00:06:31,245 --> 00:06:34,705
but he would never offend anyone.

79
00:06:37,225 --> 00:06:43,385
I think their target isn't Tutor Shang but you.

80
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:51,825
Mr. Shang got dragged into this because of me. My Lord...

81
00:06:56,204 --> 00:06:58,204
Don't worry.

82
00:06:58,204 --> 00:07:02,124
I will send He Xin to Jiangnan with his squad to protect Tutor Shang.

83
00:07:03,025 --> 00:07:04,925
Thank you, My Lord.

84
00:07:06,545 --> 00:07:12,884
Old Master, the writer of the proposal, Shang Shou, is from Yongding County in Huaizhou, Jiangnan.

85
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,563
- Huaizhou? 
 - Yes.

86
00:07:20,724 --> 00:07:23,263
This darn Eradicating Corruption Proposal.

87
00:07:23,264 --> 00:07:25,665
Darn you, Shang Shou.

88
00:07:25,665 --> 00:07:29,744
How dare you stir trouble in the Sun family's territory!

89
00:07:29,744 --> 00:07:31,964
Go. Bring a few men.

90
00:07:31,964 --> 00:07:35,565
Give him a good warning.

91
00:07:35,565 --> 00:07:38,743
Yes, Old Master. I'll see to that at once.

92
00:08:08,844 --> 00:08:12,605
Look at that bend. It must be a big fish.

93
00:08:20,245 --> 00:08:22,045
Ouch, my hand.

94
00:08:33,005 --> 00:08:35,070
Young man,

95
00:08:35,864 --> 00:08:43,085
I guess you aren't here to fish, are you?

96
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:47,305
You didn't even use bait.

97
00:08:56,225 --> 00:09:00,584
I work for Official Sun Ru, the Minister of Works.

98
00:09:00,584 --> 00:09:03,345
He sent me to warn you.

99
00:09:03,345 --> 00:09:07,224
If you still can't watch over your mouth,

100
00:09:08,985 --> 00:09:13,785
then the next time I am here, I won't just be accompanying you.

101
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,310
   

102
00:09:34,345 --> 00:09:38,645
It turns out that I was the bait.

103
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:05,424
All right. That's all for today.

104
00:10:05,425 --> 00:10:06,503
Go home.

105
00:10:06,504 --> 00:10:08,503
 Goodbye, sir. 

106
00:10:08,504 --> 00:10:11,403
 Goodbye. All right. 

107
00:10:12,785 --> 00:10:16,944
All of you must remember to study hard,

108
00:10:16,944 --> 00:10:20,664
especially you girls.

109
00:10:20,664 --> 00:10:24,623
If you want to live a different life and get out of the house,

110
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,404
you must study hard and pass the examination.

111
00:10:27,404 --> 00:10:29,404
I will, sir.

112
00:10:29,404 --> 00:10:33,244
It is a big world out there.

113
00:10:33,244 --> 00:10:36,243
Sir, what's wrong with you today?

114
00:10:36,243 --> 00:10:40,805
Whenever classes were over, you would run faster than a rabbit.

115
00:10:40,805 --> 00:10:43,104
But today, you are seeing us out at the entrance.

116
00:10:43,105 --> 00:10:44,543
That's so strange.

117
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:47,964
You rascal! You naughty little thing.

118
00:10:47,964 --> 00:10:50,804
Use that intelligence in your studies from now on.

119
00:10:50,804 --> 00:10:53,744
Isn't it better? Go home.

120
00:10:53,744 --> 00:10:56,324
- That's more like you, sir. 
 - Scram!

121
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:59,025
See you tomorrow, sir.

122
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,803
 - Goodbye, sir.  
 - Goodbye.

123
00:11:19,864 --> 00:11:22,384
Go on.

124
00:11:22,384 --> 00:11:24,325
All of you should leave.

125
00:11:26,544 --> 00:11:29,145
I should leave, too.

126
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:33,784
If that old geezer finds out that I dreamed of him,

127
00:12:33,784 --> 00:12:36,005
he is going to be so delighted.

128
00:12:42,864 --> 00:12:46,385
Old geezer, why aren't you fishing today?

129
00:12:54,544 --> 00:12:56,144
Old geezer!

130
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,644
Young Lady.

131
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,444
Young Lady, what's wrong?

132
00:13:05,005 --> 00:13:07,984
Juli, I dreamed of Mr. Shang.

133
00:13:07,984 --> 00:13:09,304
Mr. Shang?

134
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:11,524
What happened to him?

135
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,684
Young Lady, are you all right?

136
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,625
Coming.

137
00:13:48,624 --> 00:13:50,424
My Lord.

138
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:56,744
My Lord.

139
00:13:56,744 --> 00:13:59,705
So? Do you have news about Mr. Shang?

140
00:14:00,644 --> 00:14:03,644
The Falcon Squad sent news from Jiangnan.

141
00:14:03,644 --> 00:14:06,205
They have found Tutor Shang.

142
00:14:06,205 --> 00:14:07,925
How is he?

143
00:14:09,804 --> 00:14:11,744
Tutor Shang...

144
00:14:15,764 --> 00:14:17,664
...has passed away.

145
00:15:02,664 --> 00:15:04,785
He has passed away?

146
00:15:15,005 --> 00:15:17,005
This old man.

147
00:15:18,225 --> 00:15:21,184
How can he leave without caring?

148
00:15:23,644 --> 00:15:26,904
Did he not even leave me any last words?

149
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:36,425
Although Tutor Shang did not leave behind any last wishes,

150
00:15:37,065 --> 00:15:41,725
he has always worried about you the most.

151
00:15:56,145 --> 00:15:58,045
I know.

152
00:15:58,045 --> 00:16:02,885
He didn't want me to fall under someone's control.

153
00:16:05,624 --> 00:16:07,224
Zhuohua,

154
00:16:08,044 --> 00:16:09,785
stop blaming yourself.

155
00:17:34,585 --> 00:17:37,235
   

156
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,860
   

157
00:17:50,724 --> 00:17:54,924
As per my investigation, two groups of people looked for Mr. Shang.

158
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:57,605
The first group was sent by Sun Ru.

159
00:17:57,605 --> 00:18:00,685
The second group was unknown.

160
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:05,225
They were the ones who killed Mr. Shang.

161
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:09,004
Their purpose was unclear.

162
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:13,904
But I am assuming it is related to the essay written by Mr. Shang.

163
00:18:14,504 --> 00:18:16,004
Noted.

164
00:18:17,225 --> 00:18:19,425
Keep investigating.

165
00:18:19,425 --> 00:18:22,484
Be sure to get to the bottom of it.

166
00:18:22,484 --> 00:18:24,325
Yes, My Lord.

167
00:18:28,004 --> 00:18:30,085
Two groups of people.

168
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:35,525
Besides the Sun family,who else can it be?

169
00:18:41,605 --> 00:18:43,445
The wind is cold at night.

170
00:18:43,445 --> 00:18:44,844
Here.

171
00:18:44,844 --> 00:18:47,085
Warm yourself with some tea.

172
00:18:47,565 --> 00:18:48,984
Your Highness,

173
00:18:48,985 --> 00:18:51,164
did you hear about it?

174
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:58,465
Are you referring to Zhuohua's teacher being murdered?

175
00:19:00,225 --> 00:19:06,025
If only I hadn't pushed ahead with the Eradicating Corruption Proposal

176
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:08,465
and dragged him into this,

177
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:12,624
this innocent man wouldn't have been killed.

178
00:19:15,605 --> 00:19:17,284
That is the Sun family's sin.

179
00:19:17,284 --> 00:19:19,585
It has nothing to do with you.

180
00:19:20,705 --> 00:19:24,805
However, if Shang Shou hadn't died,

181
00:19:24,805 --> 00:19:28,384
it would have been hard for us to make our next move.

182
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,484
Why do you say so?

183
00:19:35,484 --> 00:19:40,965
Mu Zhuohua has been hesitant about going against noble families.

184
00:19:40,965 --> 00:19:43,165
Now that Shang Shou has been killed,

185
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:48,065
as his student, how can she stay silent?

186
00:19:49,185 --> 00:19:53,465
I suppose you know what we have to do next.

187
00:19:53,465 --> 00:19:56,644
But Shang Shou was just murdered.

188
00:19:56,644 --> 00:20:01,025
Do we have to be so eager to make an issue of his death?

189
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:02,963
We must proceed with the abolition of the system.

190
00:20:02,963 --> 00:20:05,404
We have no time to waste.

191
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,303
Don't you want to root out noble families

192
00:20:07,304 --> 00:20:10,465
and give the poor, humble scholars a world to shine?

193
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:17,884
Besides, it's always about life and death in the court.

194
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:20,745
Since you have chosen this path, you should be aware

195
00:20:20,745 --> 00:20:24,905
that you often don't have a choice.

196
00:20:32,404 --> 00:20:35,985
 She never believed in Buddhism. 

197
00:20:37,064 --> 00:20:40,309
 I pray for the benevolence of the Goddess of Mercy. 

198
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:43,184
 Please let my teacher, Shang Shou, ascend to Heaven soon 

199
00:20:43,184 --> 00:20:45,924
 and be free of the world's sufferings. 

200
00:20:45,924 --> 00:20:47,384
Young Lady,

201
00:20:47,385 --> 00:20:51,904
if we let Tutor Shang stay here, will it disrupt his tranquility?

202
00:20:51,905 --> 00:20:54,544
This is a tranquil place in the city.

203
00:20:55,724 --> 00:20:57,765
He will like it here.

204
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:02,885
Zhuohua, we should go.

205
00:21:10,004 --> 00:21:11,904
Let's go home.

206
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,344
 Teacher. 

207
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:45,084
 I have waited all day. 

208
00:21:45,084 --> 00:21:47,784
 Why hasn't the fish taken the bait? 

209
00:21:50,145 --> 00:21:55,985
 Do you know what it means by "Where there is a will, there is a way"? 

210
00:21:56,625 --> 00:22:02,425
 The most fearful thing about doing things is half-heartedness. 

211
00:22:02,425 --> 00:22:06,544
 Three days of fishing and two days of drying nets. 

212
00:22:06,544 --> 00:22:13,704
 How can you accomplish something without investing your energy and time? 

213
00:22:13,704 --> 00:22:16,344
 You are right. I will keep that in mind. 

214
00:22:21,904 --> 00:22:23,343
Young Lady.

215
00:22:23,344 --> 00:22:24,944
Juli.

216
00:22:26,164 --> 00:22:28,144
Bring me my official robe.

217
00:22:29,484 --> 00:22:30,923
Your official robe?

218
00:22:30,923 --> 00:22:33,284
Mr. Shang died for my sake.

219
00:22:34,164 --> 00:22:36,644
His grievances.

220
00:22:36,644 --> 00:22:38,784
His expectations.

221
00:22:38,784 --> 00:22:41,484
He had placed them all on me.

222
00:22:44,845 --> 00:22:47,444
I mustn't be here grieving over his death.

223
00:22:48,945 --> 00:22:50,934
I want to see Shen Jinghong.

224
00:22:50,935 --> 00:22:55,710
   

225
00:23:18,985 --> 00:23:21,085
About Tutor Shang...

226
00:23:22,544 --> 00:23:26,665
- I'm... 
 - I was just about to see you.

227
00:23:26,665 --> 00:23:30,325
If you need my help with anything,

228
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,844
I am willing to help.

229
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:36,225
Do you have the bylaws for the abolition of the Protected Appointments System?

230
00:23:36,225 --> 00:23:40,925
Are you saying that you are joining me?

231
00:23:42,264 --> 00:23:44,565
I was once taught to take it slow.

232
00:23:44,565 --> 00:23:48,605
But noble families have operated in Southern Chen for years.

233
00:23:48,605 --> 00:23:52,304
Now, they have become like a tumor.

234
00:23:52,304 --> 00:23:54,964
A strong medicine is needed to cure a serious illness.

235
00:23:54,964 --> 00:24:01,164
I am willing to be the knife to make the first cut.

236
00:24:02,744 --> 00:24:04,144
Very well.

237
00:24:06,525 --> 00:24:08,023
Your Majesty,

238
00:24:08,024 --> 00:24:10,743
noble families have pocketed public funds and taken national treasures,

239
00:24:10,743 --> 00:24:12,723
causing a flood of complaints from commoners.

240
00:24:12,723 --> 00:24:15,125
This is their first offense.

241
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,824
Ignoring the law. Disregarding people's lives.

242
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:20,104
That is their second offense.

243
00:24:20,145 --> 00:24:22,343
Using the Protected Appointments System as a shield

244
00:24:22,344 --> 00:24:25,343
to help those without virtue and talent hold a high position,

245
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,384
while those with competence and knowledge are not appreciated.

246
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:30,685
That is their third offense.

247
00:24:31,465 --> 00:24:36,023
In my opinion, noble families have committed a long list of offenses.

248
00:24:36,024 --> 00:24:40,063
In order to appease the people and correct the law, we must first get rid of them.

249
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:43,384
Show the nation to ease their hearts.

250
00:24:54,644 --> 00:24:55,844
Your Majesty,

251
00:24:55,844 --> 00:24:59,225
I think what Official Mu said is very true.

252
00:24:59,225 --> 00:25:03,284
The Protected Appointments System has not protected loyal subjects

253
00:25:03,284 --> 00:25:06,365
but have been pests who feed on the nation over the years.

254
00:25:07,145 --> 00:25:09,784
There is no making without breaking or gain without pain.

255
00:25:09,785 --> 00:25:12,585
If you want to completely eliminate the disadvantages, you need to be ruthless.

256
00:25:12,585 --> 00:25:15,604
Please abolish the Protected Appointments System

257
00:25:15,604 --> 00:25:18,303
and remove all free riders from the imperial court

258
00:25:18,304 --> 00:25:21,824
so that those who are competent can serve the nation.

259
00:25:23,544 --> 00:25:24,944
- Your Majesty 
 - Your Majesty,

260
00:25:24,944 --> 00:25:28,144
doing so might weaken the nation's foundation.

261
00:25:28,145 --> 00:25:33,144
Official Mu and Official Shen are acting rashly without considering the consequences.

262
00:25:33,144 --> 00:25:36,483
Do not blindly listen to them.

263
00:25:36,483 --> 00:25:38,403
Official Zhou is absolutely right.

264
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:42,845
Please consider it carefully before making a decision.

265
00:25:49,385 --> 00:25:51,384
This is a great matter.

266
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:52,984
We shall discuss this again.

267
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:55,125
 Court adjourned! 

268
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:12,884
Do you have orders for me, Your Majesty?

269
00:26:12,884 --> 00:26:18,025
I just heard about what happened to Tutor Shang.

270
00:26:19,824 --> 00:26:22,825
Are you all right?

271
00:26:24,265 --> 00:26:26,085
The court is still unstable.

272
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,924
I dare not be careless towards my health.

273
00:26:30,225 --> 00:26:32,265
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

274
00:26:32,265 --> 00:26:38,085
I will take care of myself as I wait for the day justice is prevailed.

275
00:26:38,085 --> 00:26:43,004
I knew you would definitely pull through.

276
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:48,963
   

277
00:26:48,963 --> 00:26:51,265
You acted sort of rashly today.

278
00:26:54,004 --> 00:26:57,023
Do you think what I said wasn't true?

279
00:26:57,024 --> 00:26:59,185
You spoke the truth.

280
00:27:00,765 --> 00:27:02,865
But right now,

281
00:27:02,865 --> 00:27:07,064
it is not the best time to have a head-on fight with the noble families.

282
00:27:07,824 --> 00:27:12,624
As you know, someone is standing by and watching the fire.

283
00:27:12,624 --> 00:27:14,585
They have set a trap.

284
00:27:15,004 --> 00:27:17,103
- You can't... 
 - Why can't I?

285
00:27:17,104 --> 00:27:18,583
Someone has to do it.

286
00:27:18,584 --> 00:27:19,904
Am I wrong?

287
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:21,405
No.

288
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:24,384
It can't be you.

289
00:27:31,425 --> 00:27:33,885
Still, I should do something.

290
00:27:38,765 --> 00:27:40,265
Fine.

291
00:27:42,584 --> 00:27:44,985
You can do whatever you want.

292
00:27:44,985 --> 00:27:47,064
I won't interfere.

293
00:27:47,924 --> 00:27:50,024
Thank you, My Lord.

294
00:27:58,865 --> 00:28:00,203
My Lord.

295
00:28:00,203 --> 00:28:03,365
What did Official Mu do to make you so worried?

296
00:28:04,924 --> 00:28:07,404
Did I say something wrong?

297
00:28:07,404 --> 00:28:10,245
Have you forgotten how you were set on taking revenge

298
00:28:10,245 --> 00:28:13,425
and fighting to the death with Roujia?

299
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:17,284
My Lord, I... I was just...

300
00:28:17,284 --> 00:28:21,544
She lost her mother and wasn't cared for by her father.

301
00:28:21,544 --> 00:28:24,305
Tutor Shang was like her second father.

302
00:28:24,305 --> 00:28:30,804
Anyone who has lost their family will feel devastated and aggrieved.

303
00:28:31,985 --> 00:28:34,125
Give her some time.

304
00:28:36,365 --> 00:28:40,443
What Zhuohua did was no different from declaring war against the noble families.

305
00:28:40,443 --> 00:28:43,725
I'm worried the Sun family will harm her.

306
00:28:43,725 --> 00:28:48,485
From this moment on, stay close to her and keep her safe.

307
00:28:48,485 --> 00:28:50,325
Yes, My Lord.

308
00:28:54,045 --> 00:28:56,663
Qi. Qi!

309
00:28:56,663 --> 00:28:57,624
Father.

310
00:28:57,625 --> 00:28:59,625
- Mother. 
 - Qi.

311
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:01,944
Listen. Our house has been seized.

312
00:29:01,944 --> 00:29:03,624
I have nowhere to go now.

313
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:05,723
You have to help me.

314
00:29:05,723 --> 00:29:07,665
I'm telling you...

315
00:29:08,425 --> 00:29:10,125
Zhijian?

316
00:29:11,565 --> 00:29:13,444
My Lord.

317
00:29:13,444 --> 00:29:17,403
Seeing that we will be a family in the future, please help me.

318
00:29:17,403 --> 00:29:20,225
If anything bad happens to me,

319
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:23,425
you will no longer have a father-in-law.

320
00:29:23,425 --> 00:29:28,104
Mother, why did you and Father come to the capital?

321
00:29:29,425 --> 00:29:31,025
It's a long story.

322
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:33,325
 What? 

323
00:29:33,325 --> 00:29:34,965
 Tutor Shang is dead? 

324
00:29:34,965 --> 00:29:37,104
 Yes. 

325
00:29:37,104 --> 00:29:40,823
 I heard that some ruffians broke into his house late at night. 

326
00:29:40,824 --> 00:29:44,823
 When the officials arrived the next day, the ground was covered in blood. 

327
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:47,585
 How awful. 

328
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:49,444
 This won't do. 

329
00:29:49,444 --> 00:29:52,264
 We must leave for the capital at once. 

330
00:29:52,264 --> 00:29:53,864
 The capital? 

331
00:29:53,865 --> 00:29:56,685
 Why are you so impulsive? 

332
00:29:56,685 --> 00:29:59,524
 There must be more to Tutor Shang's death. 

333
00:29:59,524 --> 00:30:02,864
 The next to be targeted might be our family. 

334
00:30:02,864 --> 00:30:04,485
 Us? 

335
00:30:08,865 --> 00:30:11,664
Seems like I have put you and Father through trouble.

336
00:30:11,665 --> 00:30:13,184
I suppose you don't know.

337
00:30:13,185 --> 00:30:17,144
Not long ago, I had conflicts with the Sun family in the imperial court

338
00:30:17,144 --> 00:30:19,044
due to the abolition of the Protected Appointments System.

339
00:30:19,044 --> 00:30:24,164
Seems like Sun Ru dragged the Mu family into this in order to get revenge on me.

340
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:27,125
What do you mean?

341
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:30,525
Sun, that nasty thing!

342
00:30:30,525 --> 00:30:32,864
What a corrupted official.

343
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:36,244
He has benefited so much from my family all these years.

344
00:30:36,244 --> 00:30:38,724
What's the use of saying this now?

345
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,160
Qi,

346
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:45,919
we don't mind losing all our money as long as we can overcome this crisis.

347
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,640
What are you talking about?

348
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,139
Lose all our money?

349
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,180
Then all my efforts will go to waste.

350
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,240
What else can we do?

351
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,180
The Mu family has fallen into poverty,

352
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:03,739
but as long as we are still alive, we will always get a chance to start over.

353
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,339
Qi,

354
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,560
you are now a court official.

355
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:15,380
Find a way to help me.

356
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:18,759
It wasn't easy for me to establish a family business.

357
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:21,280
You value money more than your life.

358
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,379
You are just a young girl.

359
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,380
What do you know?

360
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,859
Old Master Mu, you have been a businessman for years.

361
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,960
You should know that you can't have your cake and eat it, too.

362
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,040
I can find a way to save your business.

363
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,439
But there's no mercy in the law.

364
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:41,560
So I cannot guarantee if I can save your life.

365
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,660
Why, you little...

366
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,459
Qi, I will do as you say.

367
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,760
I will leave it to you.

368
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,180
Dear,

369
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:04,560
when Lord Ding glared at me earlier, it was terrifying.

370
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,139
Seriously, this brat.

371
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,820
She didn't show me any respect.

372
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,179
She even said there's no mercy in the law.

373
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,720
She doesn't care about her old man at all.

374
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,520
Why didn't you say that earlier?

375
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:28,340
That's because of our son-in-law, who is second only to the emperor.

376
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,280
How would I dare?

377
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,580
Don't worry about the Mu family.

378
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,580
I will take care of it.

379
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,019
Thank you, My Lord.

380
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,060
But as you said, it is the Mu family.

381
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:47,580
I want to handle it myself.

382
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,980
Must you draw a line with me?

383
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:55,060
If you need me to do anything, just let me know.

384
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,240
Mu Rong is greedy for money and personal gains.

385
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,800
He Xin,

386
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,379
keep a close eye on him.

387
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:24,740
Don't let him do anything wrong that can be used against him.

388
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,480
Yes, My Lord.

389
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,360
My Lord, why do you care about him?

390
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,720
He is Zhuohua's father, after all.

391
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,379
I don't want to see what happened to Tutor Shang happen again.

392
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:42,080
My Lord, Official Mu asked you to stay out of it.

393
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,180
Are you really not doing anything?

394
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,800
I trust her.

395
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:50,460
She will be able to take care of it in her own way.

396
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,779
   

397
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,259
Your Majesty,

398
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,919
Mu Rong disregarded the law for his personal gain.

399
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,280
He must be condemned for such immoral conduct.

400
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,779
Ministry of Revenue Director, Mu Zhuohua, condoned her father's abuse of the law.

401
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,020
She is just as guilty.

402
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,940
Ms. Mu, Mu Rong is your father.

403
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,000
Do you have anything to say?

404
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,880
Your Majesty.

405
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,920
My father is well aware of his wrongdoings.

406
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,019
He feels ashamed, looking back on his past actions.

407
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:30,159
As such, he has come to the capital with his wife to plead guilty.

408
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,640
He is now kneeling before the Capital Governor Hall.

409
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,539
He's just putting on an act.

410
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,880
Who knows if Mu Rong has truly repented?

411
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,379
Your Majesty,

412
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:44,420
my father is willing to hand over all his property to the treasury

413
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,640
as a gesture of repentance.

414
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,779
He knows it can barely make up for his wrong actions.

415
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:53,880
He is willing to obey the judgments of Your Majesty.

416
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:59,160
Mu Rong's unlawful act is indeed outrageous.

417
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,200
However, since the Mu family has been charitable for years,

418
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,600
gained merits through disaster relief,

419
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,760
and handed over all their property,

420
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,120
I will consider that as atonement and reduce their punishment.

421
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,480
Mu Rong will be flogged 30 times as punishment,

422
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:21,020
while his wife will be imprisoned with him for ten days to serve as a warning to others.

423
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

424
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,019
- Move it. 
 - What?

425
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,520
Why?

426
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,159
- What for? 
 - Move it.

427
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:37,660
- Where are you taking me? 
 - Hurry up.

428
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,420
Where are we going?

429
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,739
- Dear. 
 - Why?

430
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:42,200
- Dear. 
 - My dear!

431
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,159
- Dear! 
 - Where are you taking me?

432
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,779
Please have mercy!

433
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,299
Don't kill me!

434
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,180
Please have mercy!

435
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,299
Dear.  Dear.

436
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,719
   

437
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:20,079
Due to the abolition of the Protected Appointments System,

438
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,800
crisis after crisis has been occurring in the capital,

439
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,700
while court officials keep stirring up trouble.

440
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,440
I have decided to quickly put an end to this.

441
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,860
I want both of you to present a bylaw as soon as possible.

442
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:37,800
Be sure to root out this tumor in the imperial court.

443
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,080
- Yes, Your Majesty. 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

444
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,840
Mu Zhuohua is now in our trap.

445
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,280
We can proceed to the next step.

446
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,280
Since Uncle has put a target on the Sun family,

447
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,420
why don't we start with them?

448
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,780
What's wrong?

449
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,839
Nothing.

450
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:12,400
I was just thinking of Brother Sun.

451
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,779
Sun Yunqian?

452
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,380
Yes.

453
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:24,200
He is indeed different from other noble scholars.

454
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,560
He has no arrogance and peremptory manner.

455
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:31,480
Brother Sun remained pure and untainted.

456
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,140
He is a breath of fresh air among the noble families.

457
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:38,480
But dragging him into this movement is inevitable.

458
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:45,600
I would like to ask Your Highness to keep him out of this when the time comes.

459
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,540
He never had anything to do with this.

460
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,360
And he is your good friend.

461
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,420
I will obviously leave a way out for him.

462
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:00,220
In that case, I shall thank Your Highness in advance.

463
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,100
How do you plan to thank me?

464
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,860
I am at your disposal.

465
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,800
Father.

466
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,859
I resigned on your behalf from your position at the academy.

467
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,139
Take the office at the Ministry of Works tomorrow.

468
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,459
Father.

469
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,219
I like teaching children.

470
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,859
Who are you to decide for me?

471
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,460
Who am I?

472
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,299
I am your father.

473
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,700
You are the eldest son of the Sun family.

474
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,660
Since you carry the family name,

475
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:56,019
being an official and stepping into politics is the only future you have.

476
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,820
All right. It is decided.

477
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,180
Take office tomorrow.

478
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,840
Fine.

479
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:15,700
But I'm taking the imperial examination to enter the Ministry of Works on my own merits.

480
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,500
You despise the privilege of protected appointments.

481
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,040
You want to take the exam?

482
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,059
Fine.

483
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,960
Go ahead.

484
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,100
But don't forget.

485
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,320
Your family name is Sun.

486
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,379
You have the blood of the Sun family.

487
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,740
No matter how capable you are, people will still see you

488
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:38,200
as just a member of the Sun family.

489
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,040
I knew you would be here.

490
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,020
You made it back home.

491
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,880
Did you have fun outside?

492
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,279
There's nothing to be happy about.

493
00:40:03,279 --> 00:40:07,479
They just know that I didn't get married to Prince Regent.

494
00:40:07,479 --> 00:40:09,860
They fear I will disgrace the family.

495
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:19,540
Once I got back, I heard that you and Father had an argument.

496
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:23,379
What you're trying to do is just a hopeless endeavor.

497
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,379
Just let it go.

498
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,080
What about you?

499
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:30,260
You can't let go of Prince Regent.

500
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,760
Isn't that a hopeless endeavor as well?

501
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,220
Prince Regent?

502
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,560
You're right.

503
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,940
He is now Prince Regent.

504
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,420
I can't believe I missed my chance.

505
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:09,839
As a member of this family, I have to be the most praiseworthy young lady.

506
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,780
This way, I won't get a carelessly arranged marriage.

507
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:17,440
Furthermore, His Lordship is someone I like.

508
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,219
He is also my best choice.

509
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,480
Why should I give up?

510
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,859
I can't be bothered fighting to be the best.

511
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:31,220
I don't care if you say I'm not ambitious or call me ungrateful.

512
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:34,060
I just wish for my family to be safe.

513
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,500
And to be free.

514
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:57,080


515
00:41:59,871 --> 00:42:07,430
♫  I can't forget the love that is still is nipping at my ears and temples  ♫

516
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:14,730
♫  Memories keep slamming into rocks and have nowhere to berth  ♫

517
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:22,070
♫  Both sides gaze at each other in the drizzling rain, but one has turned into clouds and mist  ♫

518
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:30,590
♫  Leaving the isolated heart's island, like waves without a shore  ♫

519
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:34,230
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

520
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:37,990
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

521
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:41,910
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

522
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:45,390
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

523
00:42:45,391 --> 00:42:48,910
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

524
00:42:48,911 --> 00:42:52,630
♫  Obviously willing to swear life and death 
 to be entangled for a lifetime  ♫

525
00:42:52,631 --> 00:42:56,930
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

526
00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:03,131
♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

527
00:43:16,431 --> 00:43:23,830
♫  I can't forget the turmoil of love and hate, 
 even if the next day is far away  ♫

528
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:32,190
♫  Two souls embrace in chaos, how can it be written off?  ♫

529
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:36,070
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

530
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:39,810
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

531
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:43,790
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

532
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:47,130
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

533
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:50,830
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

534
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:54,510
♫  Obviously can't be erased, and haunted by lingering dreams  ♫

535
00:43:54,511 --> 00:43:58,490
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

536
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:06,071
♫  Want to have one more glimpse of you, 
 even just for a second more  ♫
