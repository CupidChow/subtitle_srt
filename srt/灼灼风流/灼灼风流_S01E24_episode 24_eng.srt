1
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:25,260


2
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,459
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:34,980
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:47,879
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,159
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,259
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,479
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,579
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,579
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:18,639
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

12
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:24,000
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,239
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:36,918
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,019
   

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,059
   

17
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:44,939
   

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
   

19
00:01:48,535 --> 00:01:51,996
If His Majesty were to know that she's a problematic person,

20
00:01:51,996 --> 00:01:54,875
I'm afraid she'll be removed.

21
00:01:56,136 --> 00:01:59,556
Lord Ding, what are your thoughts on this?

22
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,855
Miss Sun,

23
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:05,215
what you have done is unethical.

24
00:02:05,215 --> 00:02:07,875
Yet you dare to ask for my opinion.

25
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:15,076
Your Majesty, I shall take my leave.

26
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,590
   

27
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,180
   

28
00:02:44,615 --> 00:02:48,155
Greetings, Your Majesty. I'm Mu Zhuohua, the Director of the Ministry of Revenue.

29
00:02:48,155 --> 00:02:51,656
Mu Zhuohua, do you plead guilty?

30
00:02:53,655 --> 00:02:57,934
Your Majesty, what is it that I am guilty of?

31
00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:02,155
Observer Sun, tell her.

32
00:03:02,155 --> 00:03:04,496
What exactly is Mu Zhuohua guilty of?

33
00:03:04,496 --> 00:03:08,156
You changed your birthplace from Huaizhou to Yanzhou.

34
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:11,196
Deceiving the emperor is a grave offense.

35
00:03:11,196 --> 00:03:14,174
Mu Zhuohua, you still pretend not to know.

36
00:03:14,174 --> 00:03:16,696
 My change of origins was like a hanging knife. 

37
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,456
 I didn't expect it to fall on me today. 

38
00:03:22,615 --> 00:03:24,215
Mu Zhuohua,

39
00:03:24,215 --> 00:03:27,695
the last time, I gave you 30 floggings as punishment.

40
00:03:27,696 --> 00:03:30,616
How should I punish you this time?

41
00:03:30,616 --> 00:03:33,695
Do you have anything else to say?

42
00:03:36,976 --> 00:03:38,576
I...

43
00:03:39,935 --> 00:03:43,535
I... I have nothing to say.

44
00:03:43,535 --> 00:03:45,496
Guards!

45
00:03:45,496 --> 00:03:47,036
Take her away!

46
00:03:50,276 --> 00:03:51,876
 Wait! 

47
00:04:03,495 --> 00:04:05,295
Down.

48
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:19,696
Greetings, Your Majesty and Lord Ding.

49
00:04:32,616 --> 00:04:33,935
Your Majesty,

50
00:04:33,936 --> 00:04:37,755
Mu Zhuohua is unworthy of her title as Tanhua.

51
00:04:37,755 --> 00:04:40,055
She is originally from Huaizhou, Jiangnan.

52
00:04:40,056 --> 00:04:43,114
She is the seventh daughter of Mu Rong, whose family is the richest in Jiangnan.

53
00:04:43,114 --> 00:04:45,316
Her real name is Mu Qi.

54
00:04:45,316 --> 00:04:49,215
She took the metropolitan examination by changing her birthplace.

55
00:04:49,215 --> 00:04:52,156
I can explain, Your Majesties.

56
00:04:52,156 --> 00:04:55,736
I changed my birthplace because I didn't have a choice.

57
00:04:55,736 --> 00:04:59,356
I am indeed from Huaizhou.

58
00:05:00,056 --> 00:05:02,575
At the time, I was being forced to marry Zhuang Wenfeng.

59
00:05:02,576 --> 00:05:04,376
I refused to do so.

60
00:05:04,376 --> 00:05:09,334
I was determined to pass the imperial examination and become a scholar.

61
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:14,655
I only changed my birthplace to Yanzhou out... out of desperation.

62
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:17,414
Even so, it is a crime of deceiving the emperor.

63
00:05:17,415 --> 00:05:20,836
Mu Zhuohua gained the title of Tanhua with her talents.

64
00:05:20,836 --> 00:05:26,596
However, due to the change in her birthplace, she has been walking on thin ice and living in fear.

65
00:05:26,596 --> 00:05:28,135
She was afraid that if it got exposed,

66
00:05:28,136 --> 00:05:32,095
everything she did for the people of Southern Chen would turn to ashes.

67
00:05:32,816 --> 00:05:34,695
What about you, Miss Sun?

68
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:37,355
You were born with advantages.

69
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:40,635
You made it to a political observer with the merits of your ancestors.

70
00:05:40,635 --> 00:05:44,276
However, you never thought of ways to benefit the people.

71
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:48,195
Instead, you are acting shamelessly and meanly for your own gain.

72
00:05:48,195 --> 00:05:49,815
May I ask Miss Sun.

73
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:54,555
Do you feel worthy of being a political observer in the Ministry of Revenue?

74
00:05:56,616 --> 00:05:57,915
Your Majesties,

75
00:05:57,915 --> 00:06:01,534
I gained this position according to the system of the court.

76
00:06:01,535 --> 00:06:03,114
I have never deceived the emperor.

77
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:05,015
That's enough!

78
00:06:05,015 --> 00:06:09,196
I was already aware that Mu Zhuohua changed her birthplace.

79
00:06:10,535 --> 00:06:12,396
How can that be?

80
00:06:15,636 --> 00:06:19,795
 I am now clear about Mu Zhuohua and the change of her birthplace. 

81
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:23,895
 Emperor Brother, how do you plan to punish her? 

82
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:28,315
 How do you want me to punish her? 

83
00:06:31,115 --> 00:06:33,335
 I dare not overstep my authority. 

84
00:06:33,335 --> 00:06:37,655
 It's just that passing the examination isn't easy for a lady. 

85
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:42,755
 Moreover, Mu Zhuohua has exceptional character and abilities. 

86
00:06:42,755 --> 00:06:46,355
 I hope you can forgive her. 

87
00:06:49,215 --> 00:06:53,255
 It is rare to see you think so highly of someone. 

88
00:06:54,376 --> 00:06:59,515
 Mu Zhuohua's reason for changing her birthplace is justified. 

89
00:06:59,515 --> 00:07:05,616
 Furthermore, she is the right-hand woman whom I am planning to keep for the new emperor. 

90
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,575
 Don't worry. I value talent more than you do. 

91
00:07:13,435 --> 00:07:17,616
 I thank Your Majesty on Mu Zhuohua's behalf. 

92
00:07:18,895 --> 00:07:20,874
Lord Ding had informed me of this matter long ago.

93
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:25,515
It was to show me if Tanhua Mu was really competent.

94
00:07:25,515 --> 00:07:28,956
The reason I sent her to Jiangnan was to see

95
00:07:28,956 --> 00:07:31,894
if she was able to turn the tide in her hometown.

96
00:07:31,895 --> 00:07:33,895
She has proven that she is capable of it.

97
00:07:33,895 --> 00:07:35,616
But you?

98
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:39,616
If you really thought she deceived me,

99
00:07:39,616 --> 00:07:43,475
you should have come to me about it, but not the Dowager Empress.

100
00:07:43,975 --> 00:07:48,275
Don't forget that you are now not the Young Lady Sun

101
00:07:48,275 --> 00:07:51,075
but a political observer in the Ministry of Revenue.

102
00:07:53,655 --> 00:07:55,735
Please have mercy, Your Majesty!

103
00:07:55,735 --> 00:07:57,155
Have mercy?

104
00:07:57,155 --> 00:08:01,255
You have held this position for so long, yet you addressed yourself as a common person.

105
00:08:01,255 --> 00:08:02,795
Miss Sun,

106
00:08:02,795 --> 00:08:09,096
if you don't intend to be an official, why take up the position of a political observer?

107
00:08:12,376 --> 00:08:14,276
Yunyun was just...

108
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:18,915
Mother,

109
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:22,235
please stop interfering in politics.

110
00:08:24,936 --> 00:08:26,536
Sun Yunyun,

111
00:08:26,536 --> 00:08:28,955
since you have no intention to be an official,

112
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:33,375
you can go home and be the young lady of the Sun family.

113
00:08:39,456 --> 00:08:43,474
As for Ms. Mu, deceiving was not your intention,

114
00:08:43,474 --> 00:08:45,714
but it was still wrong to change your birthplace.

115
00:08:45,714 --> 00:08:49,675
I'll deduct your salary for three months as your punishment.

116
00:08:49,675 --> 00:08:51,236
Yes, Your Majesty.

117
00:09:02,195 --> 00:09:04,195
I shall take my leave.

118
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,550
   

119
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:36,375
Still feeling scared?

120
00:09:39,096 --> 00:09:43,035
My Lord, changing my birthplace was enough to get me executed.

121
00:09:43,035 --> 00:09:45,554
I just came back from the gates of Hell.

122
00:09:45,554 --> 00:09:47,655
I'm obviously scared.

123
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:49,755
I'm still feeling scared.

124
00:09:51,395 --> 00:09:55,150
My Lord, why didn't you tell me that

125
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:59,460
that His Majesty was already aware of it?

126
00:10:00,216 --> 00:10:02,156
Only His Majesty needs to know.

127
00:10:02,156 --> 00:10:04,836
This matter cannot be disclosed.

128
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:09,015
If it weren't for Miss Sun picking a fight today,

129
00:10:09,015 --> 00:10:14,756
His Majesty and I would have planned to take it to our graves.

130
00:10:16,256 --> 00:10:17,495
You are right.

131
00:10:17,496 --> 00:10:20,455
After all, I wasn't honest about this.

132
00:10:20,455 --> 00:10:25,856
I am really lucky that I am still alive.

133
00:10:27,216 --> 00:10:29,775
I can finally have a good sleep.

134
00:10:36,256 --> 00:10:38,156
Do you want to sleep?

135
00:10:42,216 --> 00:10:44,496
I won't sleep in your carriage.

136
00:10:53,175 --> 00:10:54,395
 My Lord! 

137
00:10:54,395 --> 00:10:56,194
 Xue Xiaotang is having another relapse. 

138
00:10:56,194 --> 00:10:57,794
 It seems unlikely for him to make it through this time. 

139
00:10:57,794 --> 00:11:00,135
 Imperial Physician Lu is doing his best to save him. 

140
00:11:02,055 --> 00:11:04,354
- Quickly return. 
 - Yes, My Lord.

141
00:11:11,835 --> 00:11:13,435
Hold him down.

142
00:11:13,435 --> 00:11:15,315
Imperial Physician Lu, I'll help you.

143
00:11:15,315 --> 00:11:16,915
Get the needle.

144
00:11:34,096 --> 00:11:36,175
He can't carry on like this.

145
00:11:36,175 --> 00:11:39,555
Imperial Physician Lu, I heard the Imperial Academy of Medicine has rare books.

146
00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:41,594
Please try to find another cure.

147
00:11:41,594 --> 00:11:44,435
All right, I will look through them right away.

148
00:12:06,056 --> 00:12:07,255
Miss Sun.

149
00:12:07,256 --> 00:12:08,556
Official Fang.

150
00:12:08,556 --> 00:12:10,455
Are you going home?

151
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:12,916
I'm waiting for someone. You may go ahead.

152
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,376
All right.

153
00:12:41,276 --> 00:12:44,016
Thank Official Mu for me.

154
00:12:44,016 --> 00:12:48,236
Thank her for looking after me as of late.

155
00:12:49,256 --> 00:12:53,015
It's just that dealing with so many men every day

156
00:12:53,016 --> 00:12:56,156
is not good for a lady's reputation.

157
00:12:56,156 --> 00:12:59,135
I didn't know any better at first and took the wrong path.

158
00:12:59,136 --> 00:13:02,935
Now that I've come to a realization, that means farewell.

159
00:13:08,336 --> 00:13:10,095
Stop, miss.

160
00:13:10,096 --> 00:13:12,096
No need to relay it.

161
00:13:14,256 --> 00:13:20,056
How many people have had a hard time walking this short journey?

162
00:13:20,056 --> 00:13:22,035
    
 Some people go straight to the top

163
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:24,255
and still criticize others with a petty heart.

164
00:13:24,256 --> 00:13:27,875
It is truly ridiculous and pathetic.

165
00:13:30,415 --> 00:13:33,395
You are wrong, Official Mu.

166
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,335
Even if a sparrow has the ambition of a swan,

167
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:37,515
it won't be strong enough to fly up high in the sky.

168
00:13:37,515 --> 00:13:39,455
One's destiny is fixed.

169
00:13:39,456 --> 00:13:42,295
How can the silt rise above the clouds?

170
00:13:42,295 --> 00:13:44,076
Rise above?

171
00:13:44,076 --> 00:13:45,574
I'm afraid what you said was wrong.

172
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:48,654
Everything I have today was earned on my own.

173
00:13:48,655 --> 00:13:53,435
Besides, to me, my career as an official

174
00:13:53,435 --> 00:13:55,535
always comes first.

175
00:13:57,535 --> 00:13:59,656
- Lord Ding. 
 - My Lord.

176
00:14:02,695 --> 00:14:06,095
I know that I have no place in your heart,

177
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,475
but you don't have to emphasize it all the time.

178
00:14:48,695 --> 00:14:49,974
Official Mu.

179
00:14:49,974 --> 00:14:51,775
What a coincidence.

180
00:14:58,715 --> 00:15:03,134
My Lord, we must set some rules from now on.

181
00:15:03,134 --> 00:15:05,095
All right.

182
00:15:05,095 --> 00:15:07,574
Act appropriately in front of others.

183
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:10,054
We can't let them find out about our relationship.

184
00:15:10,055 --> 00:15:12,595
My Lord is so clever.

185
00:15:12,595 --> 00:15:14,655
I'm returning to my duty.

186
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:23,927
   

187
00:15:34,496 --> 00:15:36,895
Was this also sent to other places

188
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:39,156
or am I the only one getting it?

189
00:15:39,156 --> 00:15:43,236
Officials of Six Ministries don't have it, to say the least.

190
00:16:03,216 --> 00:16:05,016
Thank you.

191
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:14,796
My Lord, Ministry of Personnel extended their thanks.

192
00:16:14,796 --> 00:16:17,936
Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Rites,

193
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:21,116
Ministry of War, and Ministry of Works as well.

194
00:16:23,336 --> 00:16:24,635
And the Ministry of Revenue?

195
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:26,976
Did they send someone to say thanks?

196
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:31,116
The cost of the ice was appropriated from them.

197
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:33,096
Minister Xu feels upset over it.

198
00:16:33,096 --> 00:16:35,123
He probably won't come.

199
00:16:39,496 --> 00:16:42,235
Anything can be solved, as danger is nothing to be afraid of.

200
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:46,035
Is this what the Ministry of Revenue thinks of the disaster in Jiangnan?

201
00:16:46,035 --> 00:16:47,995
Tell me what you think.

202
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:51,356
The locust plague was cruel,

203
00:16:51,356 --> 00:16:53,796
but you are wise, My Lord.

204
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:57,035
You are not making any sense.

205
00:16:57,035 --> 00:16:58,836
Next.

206
00:16:58,836 --> 00:17:01,936
I think there is nothing wrong with that remark.

207
00:17:01,936 --> 00:17:06,916
Thanks to your decisive judgment, we were able to overcome the crisis.

208
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:10,582
It's also a blessing in disguise for the people of Jiangnan.

209
00:17:10,582 --> 00:17:12,015
Full of flattery.

210
00:17:12,016 --> 00:17:13,795
Not a word is sincere.

211
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:16,035
Next.

212
00:17:16,896 --> 00:17:20,655
We will do as you say, My Lord.

213
00:17:20,656 --> 00:17:25,155
No one from the Ministry of Revenue can make things clear.

214
00:17:25,155 --> 00:17:28,475
I will go and figure something out.

215
00:17:31,295 --> 00:17:33,736
What am I supposed to do?

216
00:17:33,736 --> 00:17:35,775
Official Li, how did it go? Is His Lordship happy?

217
00:17:35,775 --> 00:17:38,454
Happy? Far from it!

218
00:17:57,515 --> 00:17:59,215
Official Li.

219
00:17:59,855 --> 00:18:01,955
Official Mu.

220
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:06,656
The hopes of the Ministry of Revenue all lie with you now.

221
00:18:08,656 --> 00:18:11,655
I don't know what is going on with Lord Ding today.

222
00:18:11,656 --> 00:18:13,636
He's so cranky.

223
00:18:13,636 --> 00:18:15,334
He's unhappy with everything.

224
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:17,795
He keeps torturing us.

225
00:18:18,335 --> 00:18:20,574
We have appropriated funds for the ice today.

226
00:18:20,575 --> 00:18:23,676
Why is he always giving us such a hard time?

227
00:18:24,496 --> 00:18:29,276
That's why we have no choice but to send you to deal with him.

228
00:18:30,496 --> 00:18:32,836
Me?

229
00:18:32,836 --> 00:18:35,052
   

230
00:18:39,055 --> 00:18:40,895
Is he in a bad mood?

231
00:19:00,456 --> 00:19:01,854
My Lord.

232
00:19:01,855 --> 00:19:05,515
It took them long enough to send you here.

233
00:19:05,515 --> 00:19:09,295
What are your thoughts on the disaster relief for Jiangnan?

234
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,320
Disasters don't come out of nowhere. Blessings don't fall from the sky.

235
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,935
This is what I think.

236
00:19:16,936 --> 00:19:20,735
The disaster in Jiangnan was both natural and man-made.

237
00:19:20,736 --> 00:19:22,556
But isn't it a good thing for the people

238
00:19:22,556 --> 00:19:29,095
if corrupted and greedy officials were weeded out because of this?

239
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:37,015
Yes.

240
00:19:37,015 --> 00:19:39,056
No one says it better than you.

241
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:43,155
You have had a hard time writing documents lately.

242
00:19:45,295 --> 00:19:46,094
Come.

243
00:19:46,095 --> 00:19:47,695
Come on.

244
00:19:50,696 --> 00:19:53,135
I've been waiting for you to eat.

245
00:19:53,135 --> 00:19:56,315
I'm still on duty. I have to go back and tidy up.

246
00:19:56,315 --> 00:19:58,235
Eating is also an important matter.

247
00:19:59,896 --> 00:20:01,215
My Lord,

248
00:20:01,216 --> 00:20:04,434
you have caused the Ministry of Revenue to be in a panic today.

249
00:20:04,434 --> 00:20:05,854
That's good.

250
00:20:05,855 --> 00:20:09,635
This way, they will learn that brown-nosing won't solve the problem.

251
00:20:09,635 --> 00:20:11,576
Then they will always send you here.

252
00:20:14,696 --> 00:20:18,095
After all, I am just your secret lover.

253
00:20:18,095 --> 00:20:22,316
I cannot be with you in public.

254
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:27,556
All right. My Lord has suffered.

255
00:20:31,736 --> 00:20:33,336
Are you happy now?

256
00:20:33,336 --> 00:20:35,075
I'm not upset anymore.

257
00:20:36,176 --> 00:20:37,876
Have some more.

258
00:21:01,936 --> 00:21:04,215
My Lord, I'm done eating.

259
00:21:04,216 --> 00:21:06,216
I have to go now.

260
00:21:06,216 --> 00:21:08,116
So soon?

261
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:13,435
Once I am off duty, I'll wait for you outside.

262
00:21:13,435 --> 00:21:17,215
I'll bring back the document, tidy up for a bit, and come out.

263
00:21:34,976 --> 00:21:37,954
This step forward that His Lordship took is such a big step.

264
00:21:37,954 --> 00:21:40,116
We should learn from him.

265
00:21:49,496 --> 00:21:50,895
Official Wen.

266
00:21:50,896 --> 00:21:52,596
It's been a while.

267
00:21:54,135 --> 00:21:57,816
What brings you to the Ministry of Revenue?

268
00:21:58,456 --> 00:22:01,154
Not long ago, good scholars were being appointed.

269
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:04,656
I was chosen to be a political observer here.

270
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,814
Well, not only are we from the same batch, but we're also colleagues.

271
00:22:07,815 --> 00:22:10,675
Please look out for me in the future.

272
00:22:10,675 --> 00:22:12,695
You're being too humble, Official Mu.

273
00:22:12,695 --> 00:22:15,476
Now, you are the Director of the Ministry of Revenue,

274
00:22:15,476 --> 00:22:18,415
while I'm just a low-ranking political observer.

275
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:20,175
I'm in no place to act superior.

276
00:22:20,176 --> 00:22:22,416
If that's the case, not long ago,

277
00:22:22,417 --> 00:22:23,975
I was a low-ranking political observer, too.

278
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:25,534
I am ashamed of myself.

279
00:22:25,535 --> 00:22:26,895
Why are you ashamed?

280
00:22:26,896 --> 00:22:32,276
Because you are a man, but your ranking isn't as high as mine?

281
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,536
I...

282
00:22:36,536 --> 00:22:42,214
I was sort of pedantic in the past over the difference between men and women.

283
00:22:42,216 --> 00:22:46,356
I am truly... truly sorry.

284
00:22:46,356 --> 00:22:48,094
Just admit your wrongs and change.

285
00:22:48,095 --> 00:22:50,396
Bowing to me is unnecessary.

286
00:22:55,615 --> 00:22:57,795
I should get going.

287
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,535
Official Mu. Official Mu.

288
00:23:04,535 --> 00:23:07,696
Official Mu, are you married?

289
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:11,456
She is really popular with men.

290
00:23:15,335 --> 00:23:20,115
According to the law of Southern Chen, women can marry once they are 16.

291
00:23:20,115 --> 00:23:24,255
Have your elders in the family made any arrangements for you?

292
00:23:26,496 --> 00:23:30,995
I'm dedicated to serving my nation with no intention to marry.

293
00:23:34,135 --> 00:23:37,335
In that case, I will be frank.

294
00:23:40,936 --> 00:23:45,955
What do you think of me?

295
00:23:51,176 --> 00:23:54,175
Well, you are a gentleman.

296
00:23:54,176 --> 00:23:58,995
I have always respected you like an elder brother.

297
00:23:59,515 --> 00:24:02,075
Indeed, I am slightly older than you.

298
00:24:02,075 --> 00:24:04,094
But I wouldn't claim myself as your brother.

299
00:24:04,095 --> 00:24:08,856
A few days ago, I thought you and Official Shen were...

300
00:24:10,295 --> 00:24:12,916
I found out it was a misunderstanding later on.

301
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:19,016
That's why I made a bold confession to you today.

302
00:24:19,775 --> 00:24:21,275
I...

303
00:24:25,656 --> 00:24:28,954
- Greetings, Lord Ding. 
 - Greetings, Lord Ding.

304
00:24:28,954 --> 00:24:30,616
Be at ease.

305
00:24:32,176 --> 00:24:33,835
It's already late.

306
00:24:33,835 --> 00:24:36,996
Is the Ministry of Revenue still working?

307
00:24:36,996 --> 00:24:40,155
Your Lordship, we were just about to leave.

308
00:24:40,155 --> 00:24:42,256
You may leave first.

309
00:24:42,256 --> 00:24:44,716
I have something important to discuss with Official Mu.

310
00:24:59,256 --> 00:25:02,094
My Lord, I didn't want this to happen.

311
00:25:02,094 --> 00:25:03,916
I know that.

312
00:25:07,896 --> 00:25:09,334
I have an idea.

313
00:25:09,335 --> 00:25:11,574
It will stop him from bothering you.

314
00:25:11,575 --> 00:25:13,375
What is it?

315
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:15,315
Cater to his taste.

316
00:25:15,315 --> 00:25:17,315
Make him distant himself.

317
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,916
Well, I'm counting on you, My Lord.

318
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,393
   

319
00:25:29,016 --> 00:25:30,516
Official Mu.

320
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:33,595
Official Mu.

321
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:38,896
Official Mu,

322
00:25:38,896 --> 00:25:42,334
have you considered what I said to you the other day?

323
00:25:42,335 --> 00:25:45,215
I... Official Wen,

324
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:48,436
I have made it clear that day.

325
00:25:48,436 --> 00:25:51,216
I really have no intention to marry.

326
00:25:52,055 --> 00:25:53,555
Look.

327
00:25:53,555 --> 00:25:56,054
Marriage is a natural thing.

328
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,375
How can a woman not marry?

329
00:25:59,216 --> 00:26:01,016
To tell you the truth,

330
00:26:01,016 --> 00:26:06,295
the elders in the family often say that a woman without talent is virtuous.

331
00:26:06,295 --> 00:26:08,796
I initially thought so, too.

332
00:26:08,796 --> 00:26:12,735
But ever since I heard of what you did in Jiangnan,

333
00:26:12,735 --> 00:26:14,576
I changed my mind.

334
00:26:15,535 --> 00:26:19,935
I think women should be like you.

335
00:26:19,935 --> 00:26:21,774
Well-educated and well-mannered.

336
00:26:21,775 --> 00:26:24,355
Be exceptionalin both appearance and intellect.

337
00:26:25,135 --> 00:26:27,735
You are fine-looking and talented.

338
00:26:27,736 --> 00:26:30,054
But I don't share your feelings.

339
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:34,175
I really have no intention to marry.

340
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:38,396
Official Mu,

341
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:42,695
if you think I'm not good enough for you, just be frank with me.

342
00:26:42,696 --> 00:26:45,896
If I can improve it, I will change it for you.

343
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,094
Not at all.

344
00:26:47,095 --> 00:26:49,054
You are not lacking in any way.

345
00:26:49,055 --> 00:26:53,415
It's just that I... I am not good enough for you.

346
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:55,175
Not at all.

347
00:26:55,175 --> 00:26:56,895
I think...

348
00:26:57,696 --> 00:27:00,516
I think you are incredible.

349
00:27:00,516 --> 00:27:05,408
If we get married, we can surely help each other.

350
00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:09,294
- Greetings, Lord Ding. 
 - Greetings, Lord Ding.

351
00:27:09,896 --> 00:27:11,296
Official Mu.

352
00:27:12,936 --> 00:27:15,516
I have work to assign you.

353
00:27:15,516 --> 00:27:17,296
Come with me.

354
00:27:18,936 --> 00:27:20,536
Yes, My Lord.

355
00:27:33,896 --> 00:27:35,596
My Lord.

356
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:42,294
My Lord, I thought you said you had an idea to stop Wen Shizong from bothering me.

357
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:44,235
What exactly is it?

358
00:27:46,295 --> 00:27:48,415
What if you have offended me?

359
00:27:49,936 --> 00:27:51,976
Will he dare marry you?

360
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:59,056
You have shut the door so tightly.

361
00:27:59,056 --> 00:28:01,156
Others can barely see a thing.

362
00:28:02,235 --> 00:28:04,455
It would be best.

363
00:28:07,815 --> 00:28:09,596
I think so, too.

364
00:28:18,007 --> 00:28:21,857
♫  The flowing water bends and reflects the round moon  ♫

365
00:28:21,857 --> 00:28:26,007
♫  Gently sprinkling your eyebrows and eyes  ♫

366
00:28:26,007 --> 00:28:33,207
♫  The galaxy is like the sea, 
 the eyes are like the eaves covered with snow  ♫

367
00:28:33,207 --> 00:28:37,327
♫  The night rain hitting the sycamore tree disturbs a sparrow  ♫

368
00:28:37,327 --> 00:28:41,107
♫  The young maiden become acquainted with 
 the green robes in that moment  ♫

369
00:28:41,107 --> 00:28:47,507
♫  Afraid that the number of twists and turns will increase  ♫

370
00:28:47,507 --> 00:28:56,057
♫  You are like the flowers and moon, stretching while not breaking my time and drifting away  ♫

371
00:28:56,057 --> 00:29:02,637
♫  Thousands of words are not enough 
 to accompany the long journey  ♫

372
00:29:02,637 --> 00:29:08,457
♫  You are like the flowers and moon, 
 more graceful than a palace in the sky  ♫

373
00:29:08,457 --> 00:29:09,735
My Lord.

374
00:29:09,736 --> 00:29:11,276
What is this?

375
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:17,195
I gave you a mole that brings bad luck to your husband.

376
00:29:17,195 --> 00:29:19,876
Let's see who dares to covet you from now on.

377
00:29:21,095 --> 00:29:22,334
 My Lord. 

378
00:29:22,335 --> 00:29:24,935
 Official Xu, Minister of Revenue, wants to see you. 

379
00:29:28,176 --> 00:29:30,696
Please have mercy, My Lord!

380
00:29:31,456 --> 00:29:33,435
I was wrong.

381
00:29:36,176 --> 00:29:37,776
Were you?

382
00:29:38,496 --> 00:29:41,435
Do you know what you did wrong?

383
00:29:41,435 --> 00:29:47,516
I... I was wrong for... for...

384
00:29:47,516 --> 00:29:49,614
You are greedy and cowardly.

385
00:29:49,615 --> 00:29:50,935
You have a glib tongue.

386
00:29:50,936 --> 00:29:53,616
Bold as brass. Lack foresight.

387
00:29:55,615 --> 00:29:57,094
There's more.

388
00:29:57,095 --> 00:30:02,195
You acted in bad faith and went around attracting bad admirers.

389
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:07,815
What? Bad admirers?

390
00:30:12,235 --> 00:30:17,835
Anyway, go back now and reflect on yourself.

391
00:30:20,295 --> 00:30:23,136
Yes, My Lord. I shall take my leave.

392
00:30:34,055 --> 00:30:35,534
My Lord,

393
00:30:35,535 --> 00:30:39,375
was it that bad?

394
00:30:41,035 --> 00:30:42,435
Yes.

395
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,315
He's so petty.

396
00:30:45,315 --> 00:30:47,194
A mole that brings bad luck to my husband?

397
00:30:47,194 --> 00:30:49,236
Aren't you jinxing yourself?

398
00:30:52,055 --> 00:30:53,215
He was furious?

399
00:30:53,216 --> 00:30:54,616
Yes.

400
00:30:54,616 --> 00:30:56,429
Think of something.

401
00:30:58,095 --> 00:30:59,595
Official Mu.

402
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:01,775
Official Mu,

403
00:31:01,775 --> 00:31:04,976
we heard about what happened this morning.

404
00:31:04,976 --> 00:31:10,195
Though we haven't worked together for long, all of us truly admire your abilities.

405
00:31:10,195 --> 00:31:13,735
How could you be so careless and end up offending Lord Ding?

406
00:31:13,735 --> 00:31:16,816
I... I find it strange.

407
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:21,035
Could it be because you kowtowed a whole day two days go just

408
00:31:21,035 --> 00:31:24,095
to have him approve all the Ministry of Revenue documents?

409
00:31:24,095 --> 00:31:26,516
And that upset him?

410
00:31:27,896 --> 00:31:28,814
Exactly.

411
00:31:28,815 --> 00:31:33,136
I talked back to him that day so that I could get all the documents

412
00:31:33,136 --> 00:31:35,336
for the Ministry of Revenue.

413
00:31:36,216 --> 00:31:39,294
I guess I am getting my retribution today.

414
00:31:39,295 --> 00:31:41,776
And I am panicking now.

415
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:46,516
I just hope Lord Ding will forgive me and show mercy.

416
00:31:47,496 --> 00:31:49,196
That's our fault.

417
00:31:49,216 --> 00:31:50,895
It's our fault!

418
00:31:50,895 --> 00:31:52,436
I'm sorry.

419
00:31:53,696 --> 00:31:56,114
Official Li, I need to be alone for a while.

420
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:57,876
Please excuse me.

421
00:32:03,115 --> 00:32:05,375
I feel bad for Official Mu.

422
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:06,675
Yes.

423
00:32:08,396 --> 00:32:10,115
It's not easy for her.

424
00:32:10,115 --> 00:32:12,135
Let's go, Official Li.

425
00:32:20,236 --> 00:32:23,836
Uncle, I thought you'd always admired Mu Zhuohua.

426
00:32:23,836 --> 00:32:26,015
Why did you criticize her so badly this time?

427
00:32:26,016 --> 00:32:27,935
What did she do wrong?

428
00:32:27,935 --> 00:32:30,816
You caught wind of it so quickly.

429
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:32,395
That's for sure.

430
00:32:32,395 --> 00:32:35,835
After all, she and I have gone through thick and thin before.

431
00:32:35,835 --> 00:32:38,916
It's normal that I am concerned about her.

432
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:43,256
It was just a business trip to Jiangnan.

433
00:32:43,256 --> 00:32:45,515
That's barely thick and thin.

434
00:32:45,515 --> 00:32:47,536
How is it not?

435
00:32:47,536 --> 00:32:51,156
You see. The days we spent on disaster relief were tough days.

436
00:32:51,156 --> 00:32:54,176
Returning to the capital and being rewarded were good days.

437
00:32:57,635 --> 00:33:01,615
Uncle, you haven't answered me.

438
00:33:01,615 --> 00:33:05,216
You always admired Mu Zhuohua's talents.

439
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:08,596
Why are you giving her a hard time now?

440
00:33:10,435 --> 00:33:14,315
When young people have made a bit of achievements,

441
00:33:14,315 --> 00:33:18,155
they become impetuous and careless.

442
00:33:18,155 --> 00:33:20,456
I must humble her.

443
00:33:23,276 --> 00:33:27,916
Uncle, I'm sure it was just a careless mistake.

444
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:30,516
Don't be so hard on her.

445
00:33:30,516 --> 00:33:33,696
I heard that she cried after getting scolded by you.

446
00:33:42,096 --> 00:33:44,735
Why are you looking at me like this?

447
00:33:44,735 --> 00:33:49,976
Chen'er, you are 21 now, no?

448
00:33:50,836 --> 00:33:52,916
At the palace banquet back then,

449
00:33:52,916 --> 00:33:55,596
was there any young lady that caught your eye?

450
00:33:55,596 --> 00:33:59,116
His Majesty can arrange the marriage for you.

451
00:33:59,116 --> 00:34:03,116
Uncle, stop making fun of me.

452
00:34:03,116 --> 00:34:07,995
Are these noble young ladies out of their minds?

453
00:34:07,995 --> 00:34:09,955
I have avoided them so hard,

454
00:34:09,955 --> 00:34:12,535
but they still keep coming to me.

455
00:34:18,376 --> 00:34:20,675
It is not that they are foolish.

456
00:34:20,675 --> 00:34:24,295
It is that their families are crafty.

457
00:34:25,975 --> 00:34:28,334
This won't do. It's terrifying.

458
00:34:28,334 --> 00:34:30,875
I can't even have a meal at ease.

459
00:34:32,115 --> 00:34:35,636
I must find a way to end it once and for all.

460
00:34:37,896 --> 00:34:41,436
To be honest, if it were Mu Zhuohua,

461
00:34:41,436 --> 00:34:44,136
I think I can accept that.

462
00:34:52,195 --> 00:34:56,676
Uncle, why are you staring at me like that again?

463
00:34:56,676 --> 00:34:58,556
She's not for you.

464
00:34:58,556 --> 00:35:00,735
I know that.

465
00:35:00,735 --> 00:35:05,975
Mother and Grandmother have been nagging at me since the coming-of-age ceremony.

466
00:35:05,975 --> 00:35:09,635
They said I must marry a noble daughter as the Princess Consort.

467
00:35:09,635 --> 00:35:12,376
But I don't like it.

468
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:15,915
Just like you, Uncle. You have remained unmarried.

469
00:35:15,915 --> 00:35:19,616
It's because you refuse to be controlled by these noble families.

470
00:35:19,616 --> 00:35:22,935
If I don't marry, I won't have an heir.

471
00:35:22,935 --> 00:35:28,016
To some people, it is a good thing.

472
00:35:35,035 --> 00:35:37,275
Do you have it ready?

473
00:35:38,476 --> 00:35:42,516
Look. Just fresh out of the bank.

474
00:35:47,676 --> 00:35:50,095
She just got scolded by Uncle.

475
00:35:50,095 --> 00:35:52,156
She must be upset.

476
00:35:52,156 --> 00:35:55,015
If she sees this, she will cheer up for sure.

477
00:35:55,016 --> 00:35:56,516
Come on.

478
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:01,536
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

479
00:36:01,536 --> 00:36:03,355
Yes, Your Highness.

480
00:36:12,435 --> 00:36:14,676
Greetings, Your Highness.

481
00:36:14,676 --> 00:36:16,896
Have you seen Ms. Mu?

482
00:36:16,896 --> 00:36:19,115
Ms. Mu left very early today.

483
00:36:19,115 --> 00:36:23,056
She said she was going to dine with Official Shen at Xiaoqin Pleasure House.

484
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:25,195
Xiaoqin Pleasure House again?

485
00:36:28,376 --> 00:36:31,856
She invited Jinghong but not me.

486
00:36:34,376 --> 00:36:36,176
Your Highness.

487
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:39,376
I've finally found you.

488
00:36:39,376 --> 00:36:41,475
His Majesty has summoned you to Wende Hall

489
00:36:41,475 --> 00:36:44,856
to discuss your visit to the temporary imperial residence.

490
00:36:56,695 --> 00:36:57,725
Let's go.

491
00:36:57,726 --> 00:37:00,078
   

492
00:37:10,276 --> 00:37:13,395
Brother Sun, what are you doing?

493
00:37:13,395 --> 00:37:16,236
Recently, Yunyun has acted out of line

494
00:37:16,236 --> 00:37:18,916
and caused you a lot of trouble.

495
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:22,596
I feel really sorry.

496
00:37:22,596 --> 00:37:26,655
I apologize to you on my sister's behalf.

497
00:37:26,655 --> 00:37:28,276
Brother Sun, you don't have to do this.

498
00:37:28,276 --> 00:37:30,236
I'm not someone who'd take it out on others.

499
00:37:30,236 --> 00:37:32,455
I'm too ashamed to face you.

500
00:37:32,455 --> 00:37:34,535
She is she and you are you.

501
00:37:34,535 --> 00:37:37,276
Besides, she has left the Ministry of Revenue.

502
00:37:37,276 --> 00:37:39,716
It's water under the bridge now.

503
00:37:41,735 --> 00:37:45,035
- Come on, Brother Sun. 
 - All right. Stop standing there.

504
00:37:45,035 --> 00:37:46,935
We are at a place of entertainment.

505
00:37:46,935 --> 00:37:49,396
Let's just talk about entertaining things.

506
00:37:49,396 --> 00:37:52,015
- Come on. Sit down. 
 - He's right.

507
00:37:53,075 --> 00:37:56,996
- Brother Shen, let's drink to Brother Sun. 
 - Sure. Good.

508
00:37:56,996 --> 00:38:00,435
Then I shall drink to you two as well.

509
00:38:05,756 --> 00:38:09,155
Come on, we are not done drinking.

510
00:38:09,155 --> 00:38:11,376
- Drink up, Brother Sun. 
 - Carry on.

511
00:38:19,416 --> 00:38:23,276
I knew you two would quickly rise through the ranks.

512
00:38:23,276 --> 00:38:25,616
One is the Director of the Ministry of Revenue.

513
00:38:25,616 --> 00:38:28,275
Another one is the Director of the Ministry of Personnel.

514
00:38:29,976 --> 00:38:35,196
Among those from our batch, you two are the quickest to rise!

515
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:40,355
All right, Brother Sun. Don't be self-deprecating.

516
00:38:40,355 --> 00:38:42,295
You have true talent and knowledge, too.

517
00:38:42,296 --> 00:38:47,276
You would've been successful like us if you hadn't been burdened by your family.

518
00:38:47,276 --> 00:38:52,936
Brother Shen, are you talking about Jiangzuo?

519
00:38:53,816 --> 00:38:57,996
The Sun family already has Consort Shu and Minister of Works.

520
00:38:57,996 --> 00:39:00,995
So they can't have a director of the Ministry of Works.

521
00:39:02,756 --> 00:39:05,055
You know what?

522
00:39:05,055 --> 00:39:09,955
I am really willing to work as the administrator of the Ministry of Works

523
00:39:09,955 --> 00:39:12,535
until I retire.

524
00:39:15,196 --> 00:39:17,096
I get it now.

525
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:19,035
So do I.

526
00:39:19,035 --> 00:39:21,776
Brother Sun, what do you get?

527
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:30,316
The edge of this table isn't straight.

528
00:39:30,316 --> 00:39:33,035
Bring me my ruler. I'll straighten it out.

529
00:39:33,035 --> 00:39:35,996
Brother Sun is delighted after having drinks.

530
00:39:35,996 --> 00:39:39,014
 - It's not cut straight. 
 - Here, Brother Shen. 

531
00:39:39,014 --> 00:39:42,340
 Let's drink up. Cheers. 

532
00:39:46,115 --> 00:39:50,155
My Lord, why don't you join them?

533
00:39:50,976 --> 00:39:53,096
They are hanging out as peers.

534
00:39:53,096 --> 00:39:55,396
I shouldn't be a bother.

535
00:40:00,075 --> 00:40:04,916
While Official Mu is drinking and chatting happily with other men,

536
00:40:04,916 --> 00:40:06,514
not only is His Lordship waiting alone,

537
00:40:06,514 --> 00:40:09,455
but he also has to secretly protect her.

538
00:40:16,976 --> 00:40:18,976
 Drink another. 

539
00:40:20,995 --> 00:40:23,815
 Here. I'm feeding you. 

540
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:26,855
 Here. 

541
00:40:32,836 --> 00:40:35,955
His Lordship is truly magnanimous.

542
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:55,030


543
00:41:00,949 --> 00:41:08,408
♫  I can't forget the love that is still is nipping at my ears and temples  ♫

544
00:41:08,408 --> 00:41:15,608
♫  Memories keep slamming into rocks and have nowhere to berth  ♫

545
00:41:15,608 --> 00:41:23,048
♫  Both sides gaze at each other in the drizzling rain, but one has turned into clouds and mist  ♫

546
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:31,568
♫  Leaving the isolated heart's island, like waves without a shore  ♫

547
00:41:31,568 --> 00:41:35,308
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

548
00:41:35,308 --> 00:41:39,068
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

549
00:41:39,068 --> 00:41:42,988
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

550
00:41:42,988 --> 00:41:46,468
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

551
00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:49,988
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

552
00:41:49,989 --> 00:41:53,708
♫  Obviously willing to swear life and death 
 to be entangled for a lifetime  ♫

553
00:41:53,709 --> 00:41:58,008
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

554
00:41:58,008 --> 00:42:04,609
♫  Never parting ways, we made this promise long ago  ♫

555
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:24,808
♫  I can't forget the turmoil of love and hate, 
 even if the next day is far away  ♫

556
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:33,368
♫  Two souls embrace in chaos, how can it be written off?  ♫

557
00:42:33,368 --> 00:42:37,148
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

558
00:42:37,148 --> 00:42:40,888
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

559
00:42:40,888 --> 00:42:44,768
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

560
00:42:44,768 --> 00:42:48,108
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

561
00:42:48,109 --> 00:42:51,808
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

562
00:42:51,808 --> 00:42:55,588
♫  Obviously can't be erased, and haunted by lingering dreams  ♫

563
00:42:55,589 --> 00:42:59,468
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

564
00:42:59,468 --> 00:43:07,649
♫  Want to have one more glimpse of you, 
 even just for a second more  ♫
