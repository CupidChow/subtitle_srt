♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,000
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5

♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,779 --> 00:00:52,959
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7

♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:03,440
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,600
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11

13
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,139
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:36,910
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:42,960
   

16
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,039
   

17
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:50,510
   

18
00:02:19,485 --> 00:02:22,466
Uncle, are you here to pass judgment on me?

19
00:02:23,206 --> 00:02:27,506
Is it going to be decapitation or death by a thousand cuts?

20
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:35,126
The reason I put you under house arrest

21
00:02:35,126 --> 00:02:38,565
instead of throwing you into the dungeon

22
00:02:38,565 --> 00:02:42,990
is because I didn't want anyone to lynch you.

23
00:02:45,626 --> 00:02:52,465
It seems both of you haven't taken good care of yourselves either.

24
00:02:56,265 --> 00:03:00,820
Since you've decided to be biased, why pretend to be virtuous here?

25
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,584
Brother Yu has already said he didn't forge the imperial edict.

26
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:07,126
Yet, you insist on putting the blame on him.

27
00:03:07,126 --> 00:03:09,226
Second Prince,

28
00:03:10,086 --> 00:03:13,026
deep inside, you know...

29
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:20,326
that the heir favored by your father had never been you.

30
00:03:21,985 --> 00:03:26,845
You were just resentful.

31
00:03:28,485 --> 00:03:33,766
If Father had truly decided early on, why didn't he name his heir before?

32
00:03:36,545 --> 00:03:39,546
First Prince has a sincere heart.

33
00:03:39,546 --> 00:03:41,865
He may possess the virtues of a nobleman,

34
00:03:41,865 --> 00:03:44,265
but he tends to be impulsive.

35
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:47,226
It's a major flaw for a ruler.

36
00:03:48,746 --> 00:03:53,825
Your father took his time naming an heir

37
00:03:53,825 --> 00:03:58,966
because he wanted to give him more time to mature.

38
00:04:01,506 --> 00:04:03,906
As for you,

39
00:04:04,985 --> 00:04:07,746
you lack gratitude and compassion.

40
00:04:07,746 --> 00:04:10,626
If you were to ascend the throne,

41
00:04:11,865 --> 00:04:16,300
would you spare First Prince and let him live?

42
00:04:18,545 --> 00:04:23,545
Also, you shouldn't disregard sibling bonds

43
00:04:23,545 --> 00:04:26,426
for your own ambitions.

44
00:04:27,385 --> 00:04:33,580
You even used your younger brother from the same mother to your advantage.

45
00:04:35,426 --> 00:04:42,545
All this while, you've been trying to stir conflicts

46
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:47,745
so that his impulsive behavior would make your courteous and humble demeanor stand out.

47
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:53,625
And this is what your father didn't want to see the most.

48
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,466
What does this have to do with Brother Yu?

49
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,705
I did all these willingly.

50
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:22,886
Uncle, you say I lack compassion and gratitude.

51
00:05:23,505 --> 00:05:27,850
But when did Liu Chen treat us as siblings?

52
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:35,125
You and Father only cared about Liu Chen and tolerated him in every way!

53
00:05:35,146 --> 00:05:37,465
But what about me?

54
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:40,766
No matter how hard I tried,

55
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:43,926
I could never gain your approval.

56
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:47,005
So I could only fight for it myself.

57
00:05:49,846 --> 00:05:53,265
Had you shown even a bit of care for me,

58
00:05:54,485 --> 00:05:57,106
it wouldn't have come to this.

59
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:10,145
I didn't fulfill my duty as an uncle.

60
00:06:14,045 --> 00:06:16,506
I have...

61
00:06:18,106 --> 00:06:20,106
let both of you down.

62
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:27,566
After this,

63
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:31,345
both of you shall return to your fiefs...

64
00:06:33,385 --> 00:06:35,666
and live in peace.

65
00:06:45,866 --> 00:06:47,866
Brother,

66
00:06:50,066 --> 00:06:52,006
I...

67
00:06:56,485 --> 00:06:59,145
can't fulfill what you entrusted to me.

68
00:07:06,605 --> 00:07:08,405
My Lord.

69
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:22,626
Imperial Physician Zhao, how is His Lordship?

70
00:07:25,465 --> 00:07:29,365
My Lord, I am incompetent.

71
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,566
Just tell me.

72
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:36,126
Your pulse indicates you're at the end of your strength

73
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:39,225
with no hope of recovery.

74
00:07:40,265 --> 00:07:41,865
That's impossible.

75
00:07:41,865 --> 00:07:44,185
Imperial Physician Zhao, you must have diagnosed it wrong.

76
00:07:44,186 --> 00:07:46,646
Please check His Lordship again.

77
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:50,345
I wish I had diagnosed it wrong.

78
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:54,246
Please don't make it difficult for Imperial Physician Zhao.

79
00:07:54,246 --> 00:07:57,265
 My Lord, Official Mu requests an audience. 

80
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:00,185
That's right.

81
00:08:00,186 --> 00:08:03,830
We can ask Official Mu to check on His Lordship.

82
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,846
Come back here.

83
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:13,166
She must never know about this.

84
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,700
But, My Lord...

85
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,100
That's enough.

86
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,506
You can leave now.

87
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:25,825
Remember not to let her know.

88
00:08:26,645 --> 00:08:31,225
- Yes, My Lord. 
 - Yes, My Lord.  
 - Yes, My Lord.

89
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:39,205
My Lord, how are you feeling now?

90
00:08:39,205 --> 00:08:41,306
I'm fine.

91
00:08:43,906 --> 00:08:46,125
Are you sure?

92
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,566
Yes.

93
00:08:48,566 --> 00:08:50,666
Why?

94
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,806
Are you hoping for something to be wrong with me?

95
00:08:52,806 --> 00:08:54,265
Nonsense.

96
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:56,345
Of course not.

97
00:09:10,786 --> 00:09:13,706
Why are you looking at me like that?

98
00:09:13,706 --> 00:09:18,105
Is it because I look too attractive?

99
00:09:18,105 --> 00:09:20,486
Attractive, indeed.

100
00:09:32,345 --> 00:09:35,225
It's already late.

101
00:09:35,225 --> 00:09:39,430
You have to attend the morning assembly tomorrow.

102
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,365
Go back and rest early.

103
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:46,430
My Lord, I want to stay with you a bit longer.

104
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:49,586
No need.

105
00:09:49,586 --> 00:09:51,985
I also want to rest.

106
00:09:53,585 --> 00:09:55,585
Go home.

107
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:19,830
My Lord, rest well.

108
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,006
I'll leave first.

109
00:10:22,906 --> 00:10:24,906
Just go home.

110
00:10:57,005 --> 00:10:59,065
 Why be greedy? 

111
00:10:59,065 --> 00:11:02,865
 Leaving is the best choice. 

112
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:02,760
   

113
00:12:04,435 --> 00:12:08,105
   

114
00:12:08,105 --> 00:12:09,830
My Lord,

115
00:12:10,805 --> 00:12:13,146
are you really leaving?

116
00:12:14,505 --> 00:12:17,065
You're taking Zhijian and Zhimo with you.

117
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:20,546
Why... Why aren't you taking me?

118
00:12:20,546 --> 00:12:22,065
Please take me with you.

119
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:23,966
Even if...

120
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:30,126
Let me keep you company for a little longer.

121
00:12:31,706 --> 00:12:33,906
Mr. Zhang,

122
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:37,800
I've always considered you as my elder.

123
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:41,526
Over the years,

124
00:12:41,526 --> 00:12:45,930
you've been managing everything at Lord Ding Residence.

125
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:50,845
I had originally planned to take care of you until old age.

126
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:56,546
It's just a pity that my days are numbered.

127
00:13:01,985 --> 00:13:04,666
This residence in the suburbs...

128
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:07,646
may not be huge.

129
00:13:07,646 --> 00:13:09,926
But it's comfortable.

130
00:13:09,926 --> 00:13:14,266
Those servants have all been carefully selected.

131
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:18,310
With them looking after you in the future,

132
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,825
I'll be at ease.

133
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:21,825
My Lord!

134
00:13:22,765 --> 00:13:24,592
You were clearly getting better.

135
00:13:24,592 --> 00:13:27,571
Why did it relapse?

136
00:13:27,571 --> 00:13:31,000
You've worked hard for the country and the people.

137
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,305
You haven't done anything dishonest.

138
00:13:33,306 --> 00:13:36,546
How could Heaven be this cruel?

139
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:51,625
Is everything packed?

140
00:13:54,705 --> 00:14:00,030
After the late emperor's body is laid to rest in the imperial tomb, we will depart.

141
00:14:00,585 --> 00:14:02,185
My Lord,

142
00:14:03,585 --> 00:14:06,565
are you really not planning to tell Official Mu?

143
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:11,666
With her intelligence, she will eventually find out.

144
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:14,305
When that happens, she will still be sad.

145
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:20,306
As your subordinates, we've witnessed how you've been supporting each other along the way.

146
00:14:21,105 --> 00:14:23,865
She isn't someone who can't handle hardships.

147
00:14:24,505 --> 00:14:27,465
Isn't it better to have her company...

148
00:14:28,386 --> 00:14:30,786
on your final journey?

149
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:34,546
It's better this way.

150
00:14:34,546 --> 00:14:35,744
I'll go and get her now.

151
00:14:35,745 --> 00:14:37,445
Come back here.

152
00:14:39,386 --> 00:14:41,386
But, My Lord!

153
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:55,066
It's better to hate someone...

154
00:14:55,785 --> 00:14:59,105
than to miss someone.

155
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:04,986
Chen'er has just ascended the throne.

156
00:15:04,986 --> 00:15:08,710
Various factions in the capital are having subtle shifts in power dynamics.

157
00:15:10,545 --> 00:15:13,760
They're lying low for now

158
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,600
because I am still intimidating.

159
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,686
If I were to die in the capital,

160
00:15:21,686 --> 00:15:24,946
the city would likely plunge into chaos.

161
00:15:24,946 --> 00:15:29,846
At that time, Chen'er's path would be difficult as well.

162
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,706
So,

163
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:39,406
it's better to keep this matter hidden and buy more time for Chen'er.

164
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:49,820
I've already transferred all my assets to Zhuohua's name.

165
00:15:51,105 --> 00:15:56,386
When the time is right, give her this letter.

166
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:13,905
My Lord.

167
00:16:13,905 --> 00:16:16,226
Official Mu is waiting for you in the study.

168
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,864
She has come several times.

169
00:16:17,865 --> 00:16:19,905
But she didn't get to meet you.

170
00:16:19,905 --> 00:16:23,206
Do you want to... see her?

171
00:16:27,177 --> 00:16:33,510
♫  Helping you to accomplish your goals doesn't require an answer  ♫

172
00:16:34,985 --> 00:16:40,883
♫  My shoulder will be your eave  ♫

173
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:48,235
♫  Conquering the impermanence of fate  ♫

174
00:16:48,235 --> 00:16:54,624
♫  Only for you, a picturesque smile  ♫

175
00:16:54,624 --> 00:17:01,460
♫  Love is the concern that's burning in the heart  ♫

176
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:08,360
♫  Like the stars chasing the horizon  ♫

177
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:16,050
♫   It's burning within my heart and nourishing it for a lifetime  ♫

178
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:24,270
♫  Love is silent, no matter how far away it is, 
 it is measured by fate  ♫

179
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:31,560
♫  This untainted heart imprints your image  ♫

180
00:17:31,564 --> 00:17:38,044
♫  Like a shadow, it accompanies me around the world  ♫

181
00:17:38,044 --> 00:17:45,317
♫  This untainted love, makes two complete double rainbows  ♫

182
00:17:45,317 --> 00:17:51,110
♫  Longing is a home to love  ♫

183
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,900
Zhijian, has His Lordship returned?

184
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:12,006
His Lordship has been busy with official matters lately.

185
00:18:12,006 --> 00:18:13,504
It's already this late.

186
00:18:13,505 --> 00:18:15,586
He probably won't be back.

187
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,906
I haven't seen him in a long time.

188
00:18:22,906 --> 00:18:27,430
Even in the Department of State Affairs, I can never find him.

189
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,010
   

190
00:18:46,146 --> 00:18:51,186
Grandmother, I'm here to take care of you again.

191
00:18:55,305 --> 00:18:57,125
She's already paralyzed.

192
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,305
But still so sharp-tongued.

193
00:19:00,065 --> 00:19:01,766
Your Highness, calm down.

194
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:05,750
Now, she's just a crazy old woman.

195
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,805
She's not worth dirtying your hands.

196
00:19:08,805 --> 00:19:14,900
I have many ways to make her wish she could just die.

197
00:19:18,906 --> 00:19:22,026
You're always considerate of me.

198
00:19:22,026 --> 00:19:24,106
I'm truly grateful.

199
00:19:26,186 --> 00:19:30,720
Your mother and I went way back.

200
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,020
Back then, I promised her to take care of you.

201
00:19:35,985 --> 00:19:40,185
Everything I do for you is done willingly.

202
00:19:40,185 --> 00:19:43,960
Your Highness, no need to mind it.

203
00:19:48,705 --> 00:19:51,966
Your Highness, is something troubling you?

204
00:19:53,566 --> 00:19:56,106
You're not aware of this.

205
00:19:56,745 --> 00:20:01,985
About falsifying the imperial edict, it has never been kept hidden from Uncle's knowledge.

206
00:20:03,025 --> 00:20:07,906
From what I know, he's already investigating it.

207
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:10,386
If this matter is exposed,

208
00:20:10,386 --> 00:20:15,246
I fear it could result in irreversible disaster.

209
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,246
If I'm no longer here,

210
00:20:26,246 --> 00:20:30,230
I'll entrust Jishan Hall to you.

211
00:20:44,026 --> 00:20:46,206
Your Highness, don't worry.

212
00:20:46,206 --> 00:20:50,200
This matter will not implicate you in any way.

213
00:21:02,566 --> 00:21:07,200
Farewell, Your Highness.

214
00:21:30,386 --> 00:21:33,066
When Brother was alive,

215
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:38,105
he wished for a simple burial without a tomb.

216
00:21:38,105 --> 00:21:40,445
He would like to make the mountain his resting place.

217
00:21:42,146 --> 00:21:45,580
I hope he will like these green hills.

218
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,666
The Chief Eunuch took his own life this morning.

219
00:21:49,325 --> 00:21:54,246
He left behind a letter, wanting to accompany Father.

220
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,906
Such a loyal bond between a master and a servant.

221
00:21:57,986 --> 00:22:03,706
I've ordered someone to build a new grave near Father's mausoleum.

222
00:22:03,706 --> 00:22:06,546
So he can remain by Father's side.

223
00:22:08,826 --> 00:22:11,305
You can say this fulfills his final wish.

224
00:22:15,186 --> 00:22:19,786
Uncle, are you unwell?

225
00:22:22,106 --> 00:22:24,806
Just a bit tired, that's all.

226
00:22:29,305 --> 00:22:32,845
You've been working hard lately, Uncle.

227
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:41,246
Chen'er, now that you've ascended the throne,

228
00:22:41,246 --> 00:22:43,946
there's a decision I want to share with you.

229
00:22:50,046 --> 00:22:54,464
My Lord, I finally found you after searching for so long.

230
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:59,405
I've been worried sick for not being able to see you.

231
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:03,245
I've been busy with national matters lately.

232
00:23:03,245 --> 00:23:04,984
I'm sorry to have made you worry.

233
00:23:04,985 --> 00:23:07,585
Are you listening to yourself? I'm your physician, after all.

234
00:23:07,585 --> 00:23:09,806
Who should I worry about if not you?

235
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:12,364
So, you must follow the physician's advice.

236
00:23:12,364 --> 00:23:15,665
Even if you're busy, you must take care of your health.

237
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,466
Understood?

238
00:23:20,685 --> 00:23:24,245
You should take care of your health.

239
00:23:27,586 --> 00:23:32,505
When it comes to dealing with official matters, I'm not the only one who skips sleep and meals.

240
00:23:32,505 --> 00:23:36,445
You must take better care of yourself in the future.

241
00:23:37,985 --> 00:23:40,424
Of course! I'm a physician.

242
00:23:40,465 --> 00:23:43,425
How could I not know the importance of maintaining good health?

243
00:23:43,426 --> 00:23:48,125
My Lord, why are you suddenly telling me this?

244
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,946
No reason.

245
00:23:54,626 --> 00:23:57,866
I'm just worried you're too eager for progress.

246
00:23:57,866 --> 00:24:01,245
If your health deteriorates,

247
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,946
you won't be able to achieve anything.

248
00:24:05,785 --> 00:24:07,546
That makes sense.

249
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,426
I should cherish my life more.

250
00:24:10,426 --> 00:24:12,224
But striving for progress is important, too.

251
00:24:12,225 --> 00:24:16,665
If I don't strive, I'll become a stagnant figure in the court.

252
00:24:17,465 --> 00:24:19,665
I'm not stopping you from striving.

253
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:22,825
Striving is good.

254
00:24:22,825 --> 00:24:26,866
But remember not to be too brash.

255
00:24:28,065 --> 00:24:30,265
Yes, My Lord.

256
00:24:32,265 --> 00:24:38,365
My Lord, you seem rather unusual today.

257
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,345
Zhimo, did you strike it rich?

258
00:24:56,346 --> 00:24:58,304
Where did you find so many delicious treats?

259
00:24:58,305 --> 00:25:00,925
How long will it take to finish all of this?

260
00:25:00,925 --> 00:25:03,165
Oh, right. Young Lady likes this.

261
00:25:03,165 --> 00:25:05,686
I'll keep it for her.

262
00:25:05,686 --> 00:25:07,826
I like this one.

263
00:25:07,826 --> 00:25:10,946
Zhimo, you should have all of this.

264
00:25:10,946 --> 00:25:13,065
You like them, too.

265
00:25:13,065 --> 00:25:14,264
So you keep them.

266
00:25:14,265 --> 00:25:15,825
I do like them.

267
00:25:15,826 --> 00:25:17,504
But I'm not picky.

268
00:25:17,505 --> 00:25:19,605
So you can have them all.

269
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:24,185
By the way, Young Lady said this is called gaining favor with a token of kindness.

270
00:25:24,185 --> 00:25:25,865
They are all yours.

271
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:28,865
You can keep them.

272
00:25:32,065 --> 00:25:35,185
Then, we can keep them here.

273
00:25:35,186 --> 00:25:37,965
When you come next time, we can enjoy them together.

274
00:25:38,545 --> 00:25:40,045
Sure.

275
00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:14,286
 His Lordship is still not here yet. 

276
00:26:14,286 --> 00:26:17,165
 His Majesty has arrived. 

277
00:26:25,826 --> 00:26:29,980
   

278
00:27:07,265 --> 00:27:10,065
End of the court session.

279
00:27:21,586 --> 00:27:24,985
Lord Ding plans to travel to different countries.

280
00:27:24,985 --> 00:27:29,425
Why... Why did Lord Ding suddenly come up with such an idea?

281
00:27:29,425 --> 00:27:31,625
I can't figure it out either.

282
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,260
   

283
00:27:43,265 --> 00:27:44,865
Greetings, Your Majesty.

284
00:27:45,545 --> 00:27:46,984
You may drop the formalities.

285
00:27:46,985 --> 00:27:50,485
Official Mu, what brings you here?

286
00:27:50,485 --> 00:27:54,665
Your Majesty, when did Lord Ding start to have such a thought?

287
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:57,965
I've never heard him mention it before.

288
00:28:03,946 --> 00:28:09,346
Actually, it's not exactly about traveling to other countries.

289
00:28:09,346 --> 00:28:11,046
Then what is it?

290
00:28:13,106 --> 00:28:17,526
Uncle simply feels he has been working hard for too many years.

291
00:28:18,346 --> 00:28:19,846
 Chen'er, 

292
00:28:21,545 --> 00:28:24,765
 I've done what I wanted to do. 

293
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:31,566
 After this, I want to leave the court and get proper rest for a while. 

294
00:28:31,566 --> 00:28:33,286
 But, Uncle, I... 

295
00:28:33,286 --> 00:28:38,406
 Chen'er, with the recent Chief Eunuch's demise, 

296
00:28:38,406 --> 00:28:41,786
 there might be some changes both within and outside the court. 

297
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:48,166
 At that time, you must stay calm and not be hasty. 

298
00:28:54,346 --> 00:28:56,266
 I shall remember your words. 

299
00:28:58,025 --> 00:29:02,125
 But, Uncle, can't you stay? 

300
00:29:03,186 --> 00:29:05,125
 I'm exhausted. 

301
00:29:07,186 --> 00:29:11,345
 I've given the necessary instructions. 

302
00:29:12,826 --> 00:29:14,646
 I believe... 

303
00:29:16,946 --> 00:29:19,205
 you will do very well. 

304
00:29:26,505 --> 00:29:28,305
I shall take my leave.

305
00:29:34,186 --> 00:29:35,786
Young Lady.

306
00:29:36,906 --> 00:29:41,505
Young Lady, someone threw a letter into our courtyard.

307
00:29:52,146 --> 00:29:56,264
 Zhuohua, the matters of love have been deeply troubling 

308
00:29:56,264 --> 00:29:58,625
 and leaving one emotionally drained. 

309
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:02,105
 After bidding farewell, I hope you'll take care of yourself. 

310
00:30:02,105 --> 00:30:05,865
 When we meet again, we'll be mere strangers. 

311
00:30:11,305 --> 00:30:14,664
 Also, everything I've accumulated in my life 

312
00:30:14,664 --> 00:30:17,966
 has been left at your grandfather's old residence. 

313
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:21,325
 Now, I entrust them to you. 

314
00:30:21,325 --> 00:30:23,005
 Yours, Liu Yan. 

315
00:30:24,195 --> 00:30:31,610
♫  I can't forget the love that is still is nipping at my ears and temples  ♫

316
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:38,899
♫  Memories keep slamming into rocks and have nowhere to berth  ♫

317
00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:44,891
♫  Both sides gaze at each other in the drizzling rain, but one has turned into clouds and mist  ♫

318
00:30:44,891 --> 00:30:46,346
 A flower petal. 

319
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:54,890
♫  Leaving the isolated heart's island, like waves without a shore  ♫

320
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:58,603
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

321
00:30:58,603 --> 00:31:02,285
♫  Obviously love is locked and entwined in our eyes  ♫

322
00:31:02,285 --> 00:31:06,263
♫  For a hug, we burn for a lifetime  ♫

323
00:31:06,263 --> 00:31:09,616
♫  Thousands of sails have been used to search for you  ♫

324
00:31:09,616 --> 00:31:13,309
♫  Obviously you know, obviously I understand  ♫

 Don't fall sick again. 

329
00:31:31,785 --> 00:31:36,485
 My Lord, it's about what you asked me before. 

330
00:31:36,485 --> 00:31:38,526
 I know my choice now. 

331
00:31:40,146 --> 00:31:44,126
 I want to stay by your side and continue moving forward with you. 

332

 All right.

 If you like me too,

 then let me stay by your side. 

335

 If you don't marry anyone, I won't marry anyone either.

 can you really do that? 

339
00:32:20,886 --> 00:32:22,866
 Of course, I can.

362
00:34:18,346 --> 00:34:24,246
My Lord, instead of reminiscing by the peonies, why not invite Official Mu over?

363
00:34:24,246 --> 00:34:27,866
Even if you're unwell, her presence might improve your mood.

364
00:34:30,786 --> 00:34:32,885
Say no more.

365
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:38,545
I'm already as good as dead.

366
00:34:40,266 --> 00:34:45,846
It's just because I long for that bright ray of sunshine

367
00:34:45,846 --> 00:34:48,545
that I wanted to keep her by my side.

368
00:34:49,985 --> 00:34:54,526
You all think I've been protecting her all along.

369
00:34:55,145 --> 00:34:56,745
In reality,

370
00:34:58,145 --> 00:35:00,746
I need her even more.

371
00:35:02,585 --> 00:35:06,465
Now, I have no way to change my fate.

372
00:35:06,465 --> 00:35:08,565
So I don't want to burden her.

373
00:35:09,545 --> 00:35:14,085
She deserves a better future.

374
00:35:16,465 --> 00:35:19,185
Is there really no other solution?

375
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:27,225
Matters of life and death are beyond human control.

376
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:55,065
Young Lady, please have some congee.

377
00:35:55,065 --> 00:35:57,966
You haven't had a proper meal in days.

378
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:01,725
Young Lady.

379
00:36:05,346 --> 00:36:08,426
I used to think Lord Ding was a good person.

380
00:36:08,426 --> 00:36:11,619
But now, he's just like Old Master Mu.

381
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,745
He talked about retiring to a peaceful life before.

382
00:36:13,746 --> 00:36:16,545
But he's just fickle.

383
00:36:16,545 --> 00:36:21,244
Young Lady, I'm sure he's hiding somewhere, laughing at us.

384
00:36:21,244 --> 00:36:24,406
We mustn't let him look down on us.

385
00:36:30,866 --> 00:36:33,586
Uncle's favorite place?

386
00:36:33,586 --> 00:36:35,925
I hope Your Majesty can tell me.

387
00:36:43,545 --> 00:36:45,845
Uncle doesn't have any favorite place.

388
00:36:47,226 --> 00:36:51,345
Father suffered persistent illnesses when he was alive.

389
00:36:51,346 --> 00:36:54,345
He often reminisced about the time when he was the Crown Prince.

390
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:57,205
He and Uncle rode horses to Yuezhou overnight...

391
00:36:58,505 --> 00:37:00,984
to enjoy the green bamboo groves.

392
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:05,825
Whenever Father mentioned it, Uncle also remembered it fondly.

393
00:37:07,386 --> 00:37:13,986
Your Majesty, I wish to take some days off.

394
00:37:13,986 --> 00:37:16,166
I hope Your Majesty grants permission.

395
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:22,545
Are you planning to go to Yuezhou?

396
00:37:27,786 --> 00:37:29,825
Uncle has served the country for many years.

397
00:37:29,826 --> 00:37:32,225
He simply desires a few days of peace.

398
00:37:32,226 --> 00:37:34,586
Why do you insist on bringing him back?

399
00:37:36,585 --> 00:37:40,945
Lord Ding owes me something.

400
00:37:40,945 --> 00:37:44,544
I intend to collect it back.

401
00:37:44,545 --> 00:37:45,945
What does he owe you?

402
00:37:45,946 --> 00:37:47,966
I can repay you on behalf of him.

403
00:38:06,545 --> 00:38:08,445
Young Lady.

404
00:38:08,445 --> 00:38:14,064
Young Lady, what does Lord Ding owe you that even His Majesty can't repay it?

405
00:38:14,746 --> 00:38:17,005
It's my feelings, of course.

406
00:38:17,005 --> 00:38:20,205
He thinks he can cast me away by leaving a letter that doesn't make any sense.

407
00:38:20,205 --> 00:38:24,486
I must settle the score with him.

408
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:11,990
