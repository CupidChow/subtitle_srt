18
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,340
 Long live Your Majesty! 

19
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:39,221
All of you are the pillars of Southern Chen.

20
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:44,581
On this festive occasion, I'd like to thank you all with this wine.

21
00:02:48,581 --> 00:02:52,061
 Your Majesty, we wish you a long and happy life, 

22
00:02:52,061 --> 00:02:56,121
 and peace and prosperity in Southern Chen. 

23
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,320
Uncle.

24
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:34,381
Your Majesty.

25
00:03:44,881 --> 00:03:46,281
Cheers.

26
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,180
Official Mu. Cheers.

27
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,500
Your Majesty, it's time to propose a toast to the Dowager Empress.

28
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:13,621
I have to deal with the girls again.

29
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,160
Uncle.

30
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,400
Let's go.

31
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,590
 Come on. Guys, Happy Mid-Autumn Festival. 

32
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,760
 Happy Mid-Autumn Festival. 

33
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,441
Greetings, Mother.

34
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:21,160
Rise.

35
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,840
Thank you, Mother.

36
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:25,781
Your Majesty.

37
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,080
Your Majesty.

38
00:05:59,081 --> 00:06:02,620
Are you not feeling well, Mother?

39
00:06:04,861 --> 00:06:08,521
All the prominent ladies of the capital are here.

40
00:06:08,521 --> 00:06:11,240
I wonder what kind of girl can catch your eye.

41
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:16,759
 Official Mu. Cheers. 

42
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:20,321
 Why do I think of her? 

43
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,580
Your Majesty, do you already have a crush on someone?

44
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,380
No.

45
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,300
Mother, I have to go back to the imperial garden to entertain the fellow officials.

46
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,421
I shall take my leave now.

47
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,681
Fine. Since you don't want to stay, just leave.

48
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:55,061
It's a pity that the First Princess is sick,

49
00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:59,200
or the Mid-Autumn Festival banquet would be more lively.

50
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,901
Your Majesty.

51
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:13,800
I heard that today is an important day in Southern Chen.

52
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,480
On behalf of Northern Liang, I, Yemu Zhen, propose a toast to you.

53
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:24,461
Your Majesty,

54
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,521
Jing'an is really thoughtful.

55
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:30,740
You've taught her well.

56
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,821
I wouldn't dare take credit for that.

57
00:07:32,821 --> 00:07:34,981
It's that Jing'an is smart.

58
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:40,101
Your Majesty.

59
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,940
Lord Ding, I'd like to propose a toast to you.

60
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:12,241
Cheers.

61
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:18,960
Official Mu, please forgive me. I was too careless.

62
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,599
It's okay. I can just wipe it off.

63
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:22,421
Official Mu, did you get burned?

64
00:08:22,421 --> 00:08:25,460
It's okay. Thank you for your concern, Brother Shen.

65
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,899
I think I have another set of clothes at the Ministry of Revenue.

66
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,081
I'll head there to get it for you right away.

67
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:32,720
But His Majesty could return at any time.

68
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,800
If you don't mind, please come with me to the guest room for a while

69
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,781
and change your clothes when I get them.

70
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,281
That's a good idea.

71
00:08:42,281 --> 00:08:44,400
Brother Shen, I'll be right back.

72
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,800
Okay.

73
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,241
Your Lordship, I'd like to propose a toast to you, too.

74
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:22,320
Official Shen, you have a talent for contributing to the betterment of society and you shall use it well.

75
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,780
Thank you for the reminder, Your Lordship.

76
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:54,480
Official Mu, this is the guest room.

77
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:59,321
Take off this dirty robe and I'll get you a clean one.

78
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:02,580
All right. Thank you.

79
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,000
Have you seen Official Mu from the Ministry of Revenue?

80
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,140
I think I saw Official Mu heading that way.

81
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,640
Your Majesty, are you all right?

82
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,420
Are you feeling unwell?

83
00:10:37,421 --> 00:10:39,121
I'm fine.

84
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,761
I'm just a little drunk.

85
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:47,079
Your Majesty, that's the guest room up ahead.

86
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,499
Why don't I help you to take a rest over there first,

87
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,040
and I'll have the imperial physician check on you?

88
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,400
Isn't that Official Mu?

89
00:11:11,201 --> 00:11:12,801
Your Majesty.

90
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,360
Your Majesty.

91
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,840
Your Majesty.

92
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,940
Your Majesty.

93
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,660
Your Majesty, be careful.

94
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,901
I'm fine.

95
00:11:44,061 --> 00:11:47,779
- Your Majesty.  
 - I... I'm just a little drunk.

96
00:11:49,901 --> 00:11:52,440
Come on, have some water.

97
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,020
Your Majesty, are you all right?

98
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,060
Your Majesty!

99
00:12:00,061 --> 00:12:02,902
Your Majesty, I'll get the imperial physician now.

100
00:12:08,901 --> 00:12:12,301
Is anyone there? Is anyone there?

101
00:12:12,301 --> 00:12:14,781
Get the imperial physician here now!

102
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,241
Guards!

103
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:32,541
Your Lordship.

104
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,820
Your Lordship.

105
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:42,501
Let go.

106
00:12:43,141 --> 00:12:45,740
If you like Sister Mu,

107
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,120
you can marry her as your wife.

108
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,801
I...

109
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,800
I'm willing to be your concubine.

110
00:12:54,301 --> 00:12:56,001
Let go.

111
00:12:57,021 --> 00:12:59,300
How bad am I?

112
00:12:59,301 --> 00:13:02,701
Even if I am willing to be a concubine, I can't get you to agree to marry me.

113
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,941
It's because I don't want to make her suffer.

114
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,080
Your Majesty!

115
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,460
Your Majesty!

116
00:13:37,421 --> 00:13:41,621
Your Majesty, it's a good time to appreciate the moon today.

117
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:44,341
With all the ladies with us,

118
00:13:44,341 --> 00:13:47,499
why don't we take a walk in the imperial garden together?

119
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,781
It's nice to appreciate the flowers and the moon.

120
00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:54,639
That's a good idea.

121
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,640
Let's do as you suggest, then.

122
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:13,601
Your Majesty.

123
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,940
Stop there.

124
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,520
Your Majesty.

125
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,721
What's with the panic?

126
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:42,421
In the guest room...

127
00:14:42,421 --> 00:14:45,641
In the guest room, there are a man and a woman

128
00:14:45,641 --> 00:14:47,420
who are...

129
00:14:48,141 --> 00:14:52,160
I'd like to see who has the audacity

130
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,340
to defy the rules of the palace.

131
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,899
Outrageous!

132
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:06,481
Am I the emperor or is he the emperor?

133
00:15:07,301 --> 00:15:09,219
I just wanted a reply from my subordinate,

134
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,500
but he came straight to the door to question me.

135
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,380
Will he fight me head-on in the future?

136
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,081
Your Majesty, why are you so angry?

137
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:25,161
Who is the one who is so bold as to defy you?

138
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,020
Who else in Southern Chen

139
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,901
would dare talk back to His Majesty like that?

140
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:38,201
Liu Yan is too cocky.

141
00:15:46,421 --> 00:15:48,180
It was a close call tonight.

142
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:50,541
Thankfully, you got there just in time.

143
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,819
 You're too weak. 

144
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,020
 Save your strength. 

145
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,940
 By the time I've regained my strength, 

146
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:02,801
 that door won't be able to hold us back. 

147
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:09,281
 By the time you've regained your strength, 

148
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,240
 I'm afraid... 

149
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,499
 I'm afraid those who want to accuse us of having an affair will be here. 

150
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,960
 I don't dare get involved in any more scandals, 

151
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,621
 or... 

152
00:16:25,021 --> 00:16:28,100
 or someone will get jealous. 

153
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:34,580
 You've have a crush? 

154
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:45,360
 What kind of a man is he? 

155
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:50,821
 Speaking of which, actually... 

156
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,721
 Actually, I've long fallen for him. 

157
00:16:54,721 --> 00:17:01,600
 At that time, you thought I was just a smooth-talking candidate. 

158
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,120
 But he was different. 

159
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,300
 At first, he didn't have a good impression of me, 

160
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,981
 but he never doubted my talent. 

161
00:17:13,981 --> 00:17:20,681
 He thought that one day, I would be able to gain a foothold in the imperial court. 

162
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,501
 He's a nobleman, 

163
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:28,621
 but he's very understanding and knows me well. 

164
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,220
 He's so powerful, 

165
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,461
 but he never pushes me. 

166
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:43,081
 I think he's different from all the other men in the world. 

167
00:17:43,081 --> 00:17:46,981
 Just thinking of him makes me feel 

168
00:17:46,981 --> 00:17:51,260
 that I can pull through whatever difficulties come my way. 

169
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,120
 That person is... 

170
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,640
 - My Lord. 
 - Uncle. 

171
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,739
They're so bold.

172
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,960
How dare they use such underhanded tactics against His Majesty?

173
00:18:16,661 --> 00:18:19,281
This matter must be investigated thoroughly.

174
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:22,881
But it's not difficult to tell who's behind this.

175
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,720
Today's incident must have been planned a long time ago.

176
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,820
It's a common tactic used in the harem.

177
00:18:31,821 --> 00:18:35,181
But this time, it was designed for His Majesty and you.

178
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:38,920
Roujia wants the throne,

179
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,641
so she has to do anything to get rid of a stumbling block like me.

180
00:18:42,641 --> 00:18:45,100
Last time, she used power as an inducement.

181
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,900
This time, she used love as a strategy.

182
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,400
It's all to put me at odds with His Majesty.

183
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:57,220
However, I'm afraid she won't stop when her plans fail one after another.

184
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:20,721
How dare you mess around at a royal banquet?

185
00:19:20,721 --> 00:19:25,219
Haven't you always wanted to keep your distance from me?

186
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,520
But today, you're not afraid to let others know about our relationship?

187
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,900
Not bad for a mooncake of your choice.

188
00:19:32,901 --> 00:19:34,601
It tastes good.

189
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:43,500
"Actually, I'd long fallen for him.

190
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,440
He's different from all the other men in the world.

191
00:19:48,141 --> 00:19:52,961
His existence makes me feel that I can pull through whatever difficulties

192
00:19:52,961 --> 00:19:55,020
come my way."

193
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:59,481
My Lord, when did you hear that?

194
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:07,440
So, you fell in love with me so long ago...

195
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,860
that you want to be with me all the time?

196
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,501
As if you don't want to.

197
00:20:16,501 --> 00:20:18,860
I wonder who used the royal family's splendor

198
00:20:18,861 --> 00:20:23,421
to get rid of Wen Shizong in the first place.

199
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,059
When was I ever so petty?

200
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,121
Shall I help you recall it?

201
00:20:30,121 --> 00:20:34,432
♫  Fortunately, you are here, not afraid of the repeated trips 
 and hanging around with me  ♫

202
00:20:34,432 --> 00:20:42,762
♫  You are like the flowers and moon, stretching while unbroken my time and drifting away  ♫

203
00:20:42,762 --> 00:20:49,342
♫  Thousands of words are not enough 
 to accompany the long journey  ♫

204
00:20:49,342 --> 00:20:57,462
♫  You are like the flowers and moon, 
 more graceful than a palace in the sky  ♫

205
00:20:57,462 --> 00:21:03,662
♫  Accompanying you, calmly waiting 
 for the clouds to fade away  ♫

206
00:21:06,821 --> 00:21:10,941
Mu Zhuohua was so lucky to get away with it last night.

207
00:21:10,941 --> 00:21:13,339
If she's convicted of having unethical conduct,

208
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:17,081
she would be too ashamed to show up in the imperial court.

209
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,841
It was supposed to be the best of both worlds.

210
00:21:20,841 --> 00:21:23,300
First, it could fulfill His Majesty's wish,

211
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,300
and second, it could bring you and Uncle back together.

212
00:21:27,081 --> 00:21:31,181
But in the end, it was all for naught.

213
00:21:31,181 --> 00:21:33,200
Nothing worked out.

214
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,821
It's such a pity.

215
00:21:55,321 --> 00:21:57,821
Are you really the one...

216
00:21:58,521 --> 00:22:00,840
behind last night's incident in the guest room?

217
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,901
Yes, it was me.

218
00:22:03,901 --> 00:22:05,621
So what?

219
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:08,980
I only gave them a push.

220
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:13,320
If they didn't have any ill intentions, they'd be fine.

221
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,481
It's up to them to make their own choices.

222
00:22:31,521 --> 00:22:35,859
Is it because you can't bear to see His Majesty being disdained by the people?

223
00:22:37,521 --> 00:22:41,560
But we must sacrifice something now.

224
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,381
Have you forgotten our wish?

225
00:22:46,961 --> 00:22:49,621
To rid the imperial court of any malpractice

226
00:22:49,621 --> 00:22:52,341
and return peace to the people.

227
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:59,380
I think you're the one who's forgotten first.

228
00:23:11,801 --> 00:23:14,220
Let's call it quits.

229
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,560
Let's stop going down the wrong path, shall we?

230
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,640
What nonsense are you talking about?

231
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,441
Has what we're doing now really changed Southern Chen for the better?

232
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,200
I thought you were a man of vision,

233
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,481
not a man who would be so short-sighted.

234
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:41,660
So, your deliberation is to use everything within your reach,

235
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,400
including Mu Zhuohua?

236
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:56,920
I forgot it's not the first time

237
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,281
you've used her.

238
00:24:00,661 --> 00:24:03,160
I've come to the point...

239
00:24:03,801 --> 00:24:09,180
where it's to succeed or die trying.

240
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:13,241
Don't you think it's childish of you to come here and tell me that?

241
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:32,840
I didn't get to watch the show in the palace, so now I got to watch it in the Princess's Residence.

242
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,080
How interesting.

243
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,040
Which show do you mean?

244
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,641
I was just providing you with some convenience.

245
00:24:43,641 --> 00:24:48,361
Did I force you to set a trap for His Majesty?

246
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,960
Go ahead and stay clear of it.

247
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,920
I don't care about fame.

248
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,001
I admit what I did.

249
00:24:57,001 --> 00:24:59,061
You want Southern Chen to be in chaos.

250
00:24:59,061 --> 00:25:01,467
Northern Liang also wants Southern Chen to be in chaos.

251
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:06,480
Let's see who will be the winner.

252
00:25:07,661 --> 00:25:10,220
Jinghong must have gotten mad.

253
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,260
I have to go comfort him.

254
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:36,460
Young Lady, why haven't you eaten yet?

255
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,220
Young Lady.

256
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:44,019
Young Lady, you're distracted this early in the morning. What's on your mind?

257
00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:46,581
Juli, it's better sooner rather than later.

258
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:50,799
Go and buy some wedding items for me today and clean up the courtyard.

259
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:55,340
I've decided to acknowledge His Lordship as my man.

260
00:26:00,241 --> 00:26:02,821
All daily items are available here.

261
00:26:02,821 --> 00:26:04,721
Miss, what do you want?

262
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,880
It's handmade.

263
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,999
- Come and take a look. All right. 
 - Get me some more.

264
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:13,741
Come and take a look.

265
00:26:13,741 --> 00:26:15,019
- Miss. 
 - Can I have a look?

266
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:18,180
Sure. Is there going to be a wedding in the house?

267
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,979
- My young lady is getting married. 
 - Get some brightly colored fabrics, then.

268
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,200
Okay. Thank you.

269
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,640
- All right. Take care. 
 - Okay.

270
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,021
Please come again.

271
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:30,321
I feel like something's missing.

272
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,159
A pair of swan geese. The most important thing in the bride price.

273
00:26:40,901 --> 00:26:42,501
Young Lady.

274
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:44,961
Young Lady, you're back.

275
00:26:44,961 --> 00:26:46,680
Look.

276
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,901
Didn't you say it's better sooner rather than later?

277
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:51,920
I had nothing better to do, so I bought everything back.

278
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,559
Well done, Juli. That's a nice decoration.

279
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,281
I was called upon to help with so many of Old Master Mu's weddings as I'm strong.

280
00:26:58,281 --> 00:27:00,621
So I'm familiar with it.

281
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:04,021
Juli...

282
00:27:05,721 --> 00:27:07,321
are you going to cook braised duck tonight?

283
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:09,841
Young Lady, don't say that.

284
00:27:09,841 --> 00:27:12,001
The pair of swan geese is part of the bride price.

285
00:27:12,621 --> 00:27:14,621
Swan geese?

286
00:27:14,621 --> 00:27:17,821
I was lucky enough to find two ducks that look like swan geese.

287
00:27:17,821 --> 00:27:20,340
Do you think Prince Regent has never seen swan geese?

288
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,540
We've promised not to get married, so I don't think we need the swan geese.

289
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,941
I forgot about it, Young Lady.

290
00:27:30,661 --> 00:27:32,161
They're cute.

291
00:27:32,161 --> 00:27:35,062
Young Lady, Prince Regent seems to have arrived.

292
00:27:37,353 --> 00:27:38,920
    
  My Lord.

293
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,820
Something's come up at my home today. Please come again some other day.

294
00:27:45,561 --> 00:27:47,361
What is it?

295
00:27:47,361 --> 00:27:49,220
- Do you need me to help you? 
 - No.

296
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,881
No, thanks

297
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,100
Did I just get kicked out?

298
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,680
Did the girl say anything?

299
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:18,810
   

300
00:28:20,721 --> 00:28:22,121
Let's go.

301
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,460
   

302
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:05,060
You really are the best guqin player in the capital.

303
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:11,801
Your Highness, you flatter me.

304
00:29:11,801 --> 00:29:15,521
You're beautiful and talented.

305
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:20,341
I'm sure no young men in Southern Chen would not want to marry you.

306
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:28,521
It's a pity Uncle has poor taste and treats that straw as a treasure.

307
00:29:28,521 --> 00:29:32,341
Now, he's being dragged down even further.

308
00:29:34,101 --> 00:29:36,521
Although he's His Majesty's uncle,

309
00:29:36,521 --> 00:29:41,421
His Majesty is still the emperor, so how can anyone contradict the emperor?

310
00:29:43,661 --> 00:29:48,460
Mu Zhuohua is smooth-talking, cunning, and devious.

311
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,520
His Lordship must have been deceived by her.

312
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:56,680
As a female official, how could she be of such poor character and entangle herself with His Lordship?

313
00:29:58,481 --> 00:30:00,599
His Lordship may not be a good judge of character,

314
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:05,181
But I can't just watch His Lordship being dragged into the abyss by her.

315
00:30:21,081 --> 00:30:23,920
Young Lady, are you sure you don't need my help?

316
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,320
Yes, I can do it myself.

317
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:36,200
Young Lady, if you keep cutting it, you won't have enough for a garment.

318
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,781
It seems like...

319
00:30:39,781 --> 00:30:42,281
This is okay, no?

320
00:30:44,821 --> 00:30:46,621
I'll get the door.

321
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,341
That's enough fabric for a pouch. Right?

322
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,820
Where's Official Mu?

323
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,220
She's inside. Please come in.

324
00:31:02,421 --> 00:31:05,580
- Official Mu. 
 - Chief Eunuch.

325
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,320
His Majesty summons you to the palace.

326
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,780
Stop idling. Come with me now.

327
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,381
- His Majesty summons me? 
 - Yes.

328
00:31:13,381 --> 00:31:17,660
I heard that someone had complained about you before His Majesty.

329
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,381
Complained about me?

330
00:31:22,145 --> 00:31:23,400
   

331
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,690
Your Majesty,

332
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:28,379
I've received a letter from Sun Yunyun saying that the Director of Revenue, Mu Zhuohua,

333
00:31:28,379 --> 00:31:33,341
has a close relationship with Prince Regent, and that they have been making secret deals with each other.

334
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,501
Sun Yunyun is just the daughter of a criminal.

335
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,880
Can she be trusted?

336
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,421
Your Majesty,

337
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,621
I'm responsible for monitoring all officials' conduct.

338
00:31:55,621 --> 00:32:01,361
Since there is a suspicion, we must find out the truth and give everyone an explanation.

339
00:32:01,361 --> 00:32:04,821
Official Mu, what do you think?

340
00:32:09,381 --> 00:32:13,420
Official Mu, are you admitting it?

341
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,860
Your Majesty, please look into it.

342
00:32:20,241 --> 00:32:22,341
Your Majesty,

343
00:32:22,341 --> 00:32:26,080
by the law of the nation, a woman may serve as an official,

344
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,060
but she may not hold an official position after her marriage.

345
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:34,120
Official Mu, I admire your talents.

346
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,860
But you can't have it both ways.

347
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,981
You'll have to make a decisionwhether to resign your post

348
00:32:40,981 --> 00:32:44,181
or leave your personal feelings behind.

349
00:32:46,721 --> 00:32:48,921
Your Lordship, something bad has come up.

350
00:32:48,921 --> 00:32:51,221
Why the panic?

351
00:32:51,221 --> 00:32:55,899
Miss Sun and the Imperial Censor are accusing Official Mu of making secret deals with you.

352
00:32:57,661 --> 00:33:01,321
- Where is she? 
 - She's confronting the Imperial Censor in Wende Hall.

353
00:33:03,521 --> 00:33:05,480
Your Lordship.

354
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,020
Have you thought of a way to solve it?

355
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,320
No.

356
00:33:11,381 --> 00:33:12,940
Your Majesty,

357
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:17,061
Official Mu has deliberately violated the law and disrupted the orderly imperial court.

358
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:20,260
This must not be tolerated.

359
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,580
- Your Majesty... 
  - Official Mu is still single. 

360
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:27,321
 How has she violated the law? 

361
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,221
Greetings, Your Majesty.

362
00:33:44,181 --> 00:33:47,661
Prince Regent, you may rise.

363
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,621
Prince Regent has arrived just in time.

364
00:33:51,621 --> 00:33:53,660
I'd like to ask if...

365
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,460
Save it.

366
00:33:56,281 --> 00:34:00,850
I do have a relationship with Ms. Mu...

367
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,300
But I am her man out of wedlock.

368
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:25,201
Yes.

369
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,101
Ms. Mu is unmarried.

370
00:34:28,101 --> 00:34:31,420
So which law has she violated?

371
00:34:39,941 --> 00:34:41,541
Your Majesty,

372
00:34:42,701 --> 00:34:47,121
as an official of the imperial court, I would never violate the law.

373
00:34:49,261 --> 00:34:52,580
As Prince Regent said,

374
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:57,381
I do have a relationship with him.

375
00:34:57,381 --> 00:34:59,421
But we're not married.

376
00:35:00,701 --> 00:35:02,661
Fellow officials,

377
00:35:02,661 --> 00:35:05,560
is there any law in our nation that prohibits female officials

378
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,321
from having a normal relationship with men?

379
00:35:08,321 --> 00:35:11,820
Official Mu, you're such a disgrace!

380
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,901
Your Majesty, Mu Zhuohua's character is too rotten to be an official.

381
00:35:15,901 --> 00:35:18,860
She must be severely punished.

382
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:22,001
Imperial Censor, I beg to differ.

383
00:35:22,001 --> 00:35:24,680
How is she a disgrace?

384
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:31,240
I'm the one who has fallen for Official Mu.

385
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,261
I know her ambition,

386
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:40,201
so I don't want to bind her wings with marriage.

387
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,801
As long as I can stay by Official Mu's side,

388
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,201
I'm happy to be

389
00:35:52,201 --> 00:35:55,801
her man out of wedlock.

390
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,600
This... Shameless. They're so shameless!

391
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,941
Your Majesty, this is ridiculous!

392
00:36:04,941 --> 00:36:06,541
Enough!

393
00:36:13,121 --> 00:36:17,921
Uncle, I'll ask you one last time.

394
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,380
Is what you just said...

395
00:36:22,941 --> 00:36:25,160
true?

396
00:36:28,221 --> 00:36:29,821
Yes.

397
00:36:31,467 --> 00:36:37,380
♫  My shoulder will be your eave  ♫

398
00:36:37,381 --> 00:36:41,059
It's simply a joke in the world.

399
00:36:45,221 --> 00:36:47,150
Prince Regent...

400
00:36:48,221 --> 00:36:50,520
acts and speaks ill-advisedly.

401
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,980
He does not keep up with royal decorum...

402
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,899
and will therefore be punished by kneeling for four hours.

403
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:01,060
Prince Regent, go to the Imperial Ancestral Temple

404
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:05,561
and reflect on yourself in front of the ancestors.

405
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,281
Yes, Your Majesty.

406
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:17,080
♫  Love is silent, no matter how far away it is, 
 it is measured by fate  ♫

407
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,260
As for Official Mu,

408
00:37:20,801 --> 00:37:24,502
she will be forfeited a month of salary to reflect on her mistakes.

409
00:37:27,741 --> 00:37:29,879
Yes, Your Majesty.

410
00:37:29,879 --> 00:37:34,662
♫  Like a shadow, it accompanies me around the world  ♫

411
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:38,941
Your Majesty, Official Mu's punishment is too lenient.

412
00:37:38,941 --> 00:37:40,441
Enough!

413
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:44,222
Say no more.

414
00:37:48,376 --> 00:37:54,039
I can't believe Prince Regent admitted that he's Ms. Mu's man out of wedlock.

415
00:37:55,301 --> 00:37:58,420
What a disgrace to men.

416
00:38:00,721 --> 00:38:06,821
After today, rumors will spread that you've become a woman's man out of wedlock.

417
00:38:06,821 --> 00:38:10,960
Will you regret it?

418
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:21,641
After today, your reputation for moral turpitude

419
00:38:21,641 --> 00:38:24,581
will spread throughout the capital.

420
00:38:24,581 --> 00:38:26,480
Will you regret it?

421
00:38:30,081 --> 00:38:34,199
I have to go back to my duty at the Ministry of Revenue. So I'll just see you off here.

422
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:35,761
Okay.

423
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,100
Let's have dinner together tonight.

424
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,680
Okay.

425
00:39:09,901 --> 00:39:11,741
Official Mu.

426
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:13,641
Official Li.

427
00:39:18,001 --> 00:39:21,241
Official Li, why are you looking at me like that?

428
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:25,801
The first time I saw you, Miss Mu... No, it's Official Mu.

429
00:39:25,801 --> 00:39:27,921
I've always thought you were something.

430
00:39:27,921 --> 00:39:31,640
You could do things no ordinary man could.

431
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,441
It's true indeed.

432
00:39:34,721 --> 00:39:36,321
Official Mu, don't be modest.

433
00:39:36,321 --> 00:39:39,341
We all know what happened at Wende Hall today.

434
00:39:39,341 --> 00:39:45,300
Yes. You are really something to make a hero like Prince Regent fall for you.

435
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,900
- You have brought great honor to our ministry. 
 - Yes, that's true.

436
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:53,580
Don't you think I'm a disgrace

437
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:58,601
and that His Lordship has disgraced all men in the world?

438
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,820
How could you say that?

439
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:07,139
You and Prince Regent are in love, but you can't get married in the open due to our laws.

440
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:10,080
So how are you a disgrace?

441
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,881
Yeah. I think Official Mu and His Lordship

442
00:40:12,881 --> 00:40:16,580
are like Lv Bu and Diaochan, Xiang Yu and Consort Yu,

443
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,021
Mr. Li and Mrs. Li.

444
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,719
In short, you're a perfect match for each other; a match made in heaven.

445
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:30,400
- Thank you, sirs. 
 - I wish you happiness ever after.

446
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,121
- Thank you, sirs. 
 - Height matters not, as long as divinity resides within.

447
00:40:33,121 --> 00:40:35,620
You were just born for each other.

448
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,560
- I'll treat you all to a meal. 
 - Sure.
