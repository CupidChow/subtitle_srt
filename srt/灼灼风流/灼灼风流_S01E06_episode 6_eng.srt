2
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,459
♫  Happily tossing and turning in the spring and autumn  ♫

3
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:35,080
♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

4
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:41,099
♫  Over thorny roads, across treacherous heights  ♫

5
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:47,779
♫  After a thousand sails have passed, who will swim with you  ♫

6
00:00:47,779 --> 00:00:53,160
♫  I'm willing to go through the ups and downs of the world for the sake of the people  ♫

7
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,259
♫  Still embracing the original innocence  ♫

8
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,480
♫  The sound of vows falling to the ground, 
 this heart can be proved by Heaven and Earth  ♫

9
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,580
♫  The darker it is the more dazzling like stars there are  ♫

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,679
♫  I wish to stride through the ups and downs of fate, and live towards the sun  ♫

11
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:18,739
♫  Moments turn into eternity, fleeting years become forever  ♫

12
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:24,100
♫  The road ahead is long, 
 and there is an unquenchable light in my heart  ♫

13
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,239
♫  Because someone is waiting for me  ♫

14
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:36,919
♫  There is one person who will complete the dream  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,020
   

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,160
   

17
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,940
   

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
   

19
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,951
Yun Xiangyue?

20
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,990
So, after rescuing his wife and daughter, he led the pursuers away.

21
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:10,251
It seems the person using the hawk-claw-like weapon had tried to capture him alive.

22
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:14,070
The one using needles wanted to kill him.

23
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:16,530
They are not from the same group.

24
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,331
Logically speaking, the human skull is quite tough.

25
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:25,390
Only a few weapons are capable of piercing through the skull.

26
00:02:26,391 --> 00:02:31,970
I heard that the Tang Sect, known as the masters of hidden weapons in Shu, has a similar weapon.

27
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,491
It's called...

28
00:02:34,491 --> 00:02:38,411
It's called Stormy Pear Blossom Needles.

29
00:02:38,411 --> 00:02:41,151
The needles are as fine as cow's hair, too thin to be seen.

30
00:02:41,151 --> 00:02:43,651
And it can pierce through bones.

31
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:50,231
But I've only read about all these things in books.

32
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:52,551
I don't know if it's true or not.

33
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,710
I've seen them before.

34
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:06,470
It's Wandering Needle, the Imperial Shadow Guards' unique and powerful weapon.

35
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,990
Don't speak recklessly.

36
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,200
 Emperor Brother. 

37
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,270
 Emperor Brother? 
   

38
00:03:32,691 --> 00:03:34,990
 Emperor Brother, stop writing. 
   

39
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,152
 Let's go and play. 
   

40
00:03:37,152 --> 00:03:39,091
 Just go without me. 

41
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,570
 - What's this? Let me play with it. 
 - Your Highness, this isn't a toy. 

42
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,711
 - Let me play with it. Just a little while. 
 - You can't play with this. 

43
00:03:52,711 --> 00:03:56,090
 - Just let me pay with it. 
 - Yan. Yan. 

44
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,851
 Emperor Brother, I want to play with it. 

45
00:03:58,851 --> 00:04:01,351
 Little Brother Yan, that's the Imperial Shadow Guards' Wandering Needle. 

46
00:04:01,351 --> 00:04:03,731
 It's a lethal weapon. You can't play with it. 

47
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:09,710
 But if you like it, I'll make one set for you when you grow up. 

48
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,110
 It can be kept as a self-defense weapon. 

49
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,290
 Fine, all right. 

50
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,350
 Help! 

51
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,430
 - Little Brother, hang in there! 
 - Help! Emperor Brother! 

52
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:38,011
 Your Majesty, the Crown Prince has been in poor health. 

53
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,330
 I'm afraid it has damaged his fundamental well-being this time. 

54
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,311
 In the future, he'll need to take extra care of himself. 

55
00:04:43,311 --> 00:04:46,191
 Any carelessness can lead to illness. 

56
00:04:46,191 --> 00:04:49,210
 We will make every effort to maintain his health. 

57
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,930
 It's just that His Highness has to suffer a lot. 

58
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:02,490
 Mother, forgive me. 

59
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,690
 It was all my fault. 

60
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,251
 No, it wasn't 

61
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:16,671
 Little Brother Yan. 

62
00:05:19,937 --> 00:05:21,537
 Emperor Brother. 

63
00:05:22,591 --> 00:05:28,751
 Little Brother Yan, didn't you promise not to be a crybaby anymore? 

64
00:05:39,051 --> 00:05:44,211
 I didn't expect even the invincible Lord Ding to be in this state. 

65
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:52,011
Put the body away.

66
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:54,891
We'll return to the capital.

67
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,350
Protect His Lordship.

68
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,350
My Lord, leave first.

69
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:54,911
My Lord, make way!

70
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,510
It's so high up.

71
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,851
Why do you have poison with you?

72
00:07:15,851 --> 00:07:17,451
Poison?

73
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:19,390
Oh, you mean the one I threw at the man just now?

74
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:22,671
That's not poison. It's lime powder.

75
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:24,810
Lime powder?

76
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:29,871
What's wrong?

77
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,470
I think I caught a cold.

78
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,950
What should I do now?

79
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,750
The metropolitan examination is around the corner.

80
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,571
Where are you going?

81
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:54,050
Find His Lordship and Miss Mu.

82
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:58,130
His Lordship said not only does this operation aim to expose the mastermind,

83
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,530
but it's also to test Miss Mu.

84
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,451
We can't be present.

85
00:08:09,431 --> 00:08:11,131
Thank you, My Lord.

86
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:18,270
My Lord, I... You have to be responsible for this.

87
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,011
Despite anything, you're the chief examiner.

88
00:08:21,011 --> 00:08:26,530
You see. It won't be too much to help me secure a place

89
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,230
through the back door. Right?

90
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,710
I don't need a high rank.

91
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,370
Just as long as I can take the palace examination.

92
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,830
You should learn how to treat your subordinate from First Prince.

93
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:39,871
I can't do that.

94
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:48,210
My Lord, are you in a better mood now?

95
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,611
Were you trying to please me?

96
00:08:50,611 --> 00:08:52,551
Well, I dare not try to please you.

97
00:08:52,551 --> 00:08:56,790
But I noticed you were in a bad mood.

98
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,810
The ones who tried to kill you

99
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,910
didn't seem like Shadow Guards. Right?

100
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,310
If they were not Shadow Guards, who do you think they were?

101
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,271
How... How would I know?

102
00:09:14,411 --> 00:09:17,491
My Lord, are you suspecting me?

103
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:19,110
Your memory is really poor.

104
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,030
I just saved your life.

105
00:09:24,471 --> 00:09:30,870
I just think that this Wandering Needle is like a silent killer.

106
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,190
If they were really Shadow Guards, we would have been dead by now.

107
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,931
If Shadow Guards were really here, what would you do?

108
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,110
Mu Zhuohua.

109
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,350
My Lord, didn't you want to lure the enemy into the trap?

110
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,470
So I'm doing you a favor here.

111
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:00,071
Five years ago, 30,000 soldiers of the Cangwu Army perished at Juma River.

112
00:10:00,071 --> 00:10:02,231
That included our father.

113
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:06,350
His Lordship has always believed that he carelessly lives alone in this world.

114
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,971
That's why he does everything himself, never relying on others.

115
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:13,851
I'm also a survivor.

116
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,810
The Falcon Squad consists of former Cangwu Army members.

117
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,370
You would never disobey His Lordship's orders.

118
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,471
But we're different.

119
00:10:23,471 --> 00:10:26,311
My father traded his life to save His Lordship.

120
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:29,050
So I won't allow anything to happen to him.

121
00:10:32,271 --> 00:10:35,391
I shall entrust His Lordship's safety to you two.

122
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,470
Let's go.

123
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,870
 What... 

124
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,510
 I thought he didn't have any urges because he was injured. 

125
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,230
 I thought the rumor was true. 

126
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,350
 After all, Father said all men have urges. 

127
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,951
 Unless he's not a man. 

128
00:11:02,951 --> 00:11:06,030
 What's happening now? 

129
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:21,290
 What... What is he planning to do? 

130
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,290
 No, no, no. 

131
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,530
 I need to stay away from him. 

132
00:11:48,911 --> 00:11:51,150
 It was a repeating crossbow? 

133
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,530
 What was I thinking? 

134
00:11:57,031 --> 00:11:59,551
You didn't even release the arrows.

135
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:01,750
How did they die?

136
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,050
- This is...? 
 - Wandering Needle.

137
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,470
Wandering Needle?

138
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,070
Where are we going?

139
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,251
This thing is indeed powerful.

140
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,951
My Lord.

141
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:47,632
    
 We were late. Please leave first.

142
00:12:49,191 --> 00:12:50,691
Let's go.

143
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:53,611
Who's there?

144
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,910
   

145
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,031
You don't need to be too restrained.

146
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:17,130
Based on seniority, you should call me Great-Grandaunt.

147
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,971
Your Majesty, it's very nice of you.

148
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:22,791
    
 I know my place.

149
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:23,591
   

150
00:13:23,591 --> 00:13:26,750
I'm just an orphan of the Zhou clan's collateral line.

151
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,111
It's all thanks to Your Majesty's care that I'm where I am today.

152
00:13:30,111 --> 00:13:32,411
I dare not overstep my bounds.

153
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,350
Well, well.

154
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:39,991
All of you can be excused.

155
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,271
Mother, you promised me before.

156
00:13:53,271 --> 00:13:54,951
Why did you eat your words?

157
00:13:54,951 --> 00:13:57,530
Do you think I'm willing to do this?

158
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,630
To harm your dear little brother?

159
00:14:03,191 --> 00:14:09,271
Ju'er, everything I've done is for you.

160
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,371
Liu Yan holds great power and influence.

161
00:14:18,371 --> 00:14:21,830
If he were to rebel one day, who could control him?

162
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,131
He would never do such a thing.

163
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:27,350
We've been brothers for many years. I trust him.

164
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:32,670
Then, what if he finds out the truth behind the war at Juma River five years ago?

165
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:38,371
What if he discovers that I wanted him gone forever?

166
00:14:46,071 --> 00:14:49,350
You plotted the war at Juma River all by yourself back then.

167
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,410
I only learned about it afterward.

168
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,330
I helped you handle the aftermath to protect you.

169
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:58,470
Deceiving Yan like this made me feel deep remorse.

170
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,491
But why do you still have to take his life now?

171
00:15:01,491 --> 00:15:04,771
- He's the one who doesn't want to let me go. 
 - You—

172
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:08,301
That's why he discovered Yun Xiangyue and Yuan Chengming.

173
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:09,791
Ju'er,

174
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,791
only when he's dead can you truly feel at ease.

175
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,491
Mother!

176
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:21,631
Yan has always considered you his birth mother.

177
00:15:21,631 --> 00:15:24,871
You protect him time and time again.

178
00:15:24,871 --> 00:15:27,871
If he were to learn the truth behind these events,

179
00:15:27,871 --> 00:15:30,551
would he still remember the sibling bond he shares with you?

180
00:15:30,551 --> 00:15:31,951
Yes.

181
00:15:32,571 --> 00:15:34,550
I believe he would.

182
00:15:40,191 --> 00:15:43,991
Mother, a mother's debt is repaid by her child.

183
00:15:43,991 --> 00:15:48,971
Back then, when you wanted Yan to drown, I risked my life to save him.

184
00:15:48,971 --> 00:15:51,431
And I ended up with a lifelong ailment.

185
00:15:51,431 --> 00:15:56,351
Now, if you still want his life,

186
00:15:56,351 --> 00:16:01,870
I can only follow suit as I did back then.

187
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,671
Are you trying to threaten me?

188
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,471
I dare not.

189
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:38,171
My Lord, I lost your cloak.

190
00:16:38,171 --> 00:16:39,671
It's all right.

191
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,430
What is it again this time?

192
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:54,750
My Lord, I've finally figured it out.

193
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,910
The clues pointed to the Shadow Guards,

194
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:01,050
so you deliberately took this risk

195
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:04,890
to see if His Majesty would show up to save you.

196
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:11,130
Now that the Shadow Guards have appeared,

197
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,691
do you...

198
00:17:13,391 --> 00:17:17,370
Do you now believe that it wasn't His Majesty?

199
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:23,351
The ones who can mobilize the Shadow Guards can only be His Majesty or...

200
00:17:23,351 --> 00:17:25,110
Mu Zhuohua.

201
00:17:28,591 --> 00:17:32,331
Are you truly that bold or timid?

202
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,130
Forgive me for speaking out of turn.

203
00:17:48,831 --> 00:17:50,970
 Chen'er is honest and impulsive. 

204
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,450
 Roujia doesn't care about worldly disputes. 

205
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,750
 The one who can mobilize the Shadow Guards and knows my health condition 

206
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,170
 could only be Dowager Empress. 

207
00:18:01,191 --> 00:18:04,030
 Yet we have a strong bond even if we're not biologically related. 

208
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:06,750
 Our mother-and-son bond has lasted for thirty years. 

209
00:18:21,951 --> 00:18:25,711
My Lord, you can only drink it after boiling it.

210
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:28,590
You'll get sick if you drink it like this.

211
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:34,450
We're on the run now.

212
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,990
So just make do with this.

213
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,191
What should I do now?

214
00:18:56,191 --> 00:18:59,351
I won't be able to make it for the examination now.

215
00:18:59,351 --> 00:19:01,271
If so, sit for the next one.

216
00:19:02,571 --> 00:19:04,351
I can't wait until then.

217
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,770
I've been preparing for so many years.

218
00:19:07,671 --> 00:19:10,130
Let's hurry on with our journey, then.

219
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,490
I...

220
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,570
Get on.

221
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,090
I'll carry you.

222
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,631
But... But it's not appropriate, My Lord.

223
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:53,131
I...

224
00:19:53,951 --> 00:19:56,231
I'll just rest here for a while.

225
00:19:56,231 --> 00:19:58,151
I'll be able to walk after resting.

226
00:19:58,151 --> 00:20:00,811
Just let me rest for a while.

227
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,790
Then, prepare to sit for the exam next time.

228
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,890
But I still feel it's inappropriate, My Lord.

229
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,390
Get on.

230
00:20:33,591 --> 00:20:35,391
Why are you so light?

231
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,170
My birth mother passed away when I was young.

232
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,591
No one cared about me.

233
00:20:39,591 --> 00:20:42,030
They often bullied me for being an illegitimate daughter.

234
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,531
They didn't give me enough food.

235
00:20:43,531 --> 00:20:46,511
That's why I've grown so thin and petite.

236
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,852
I don't think the Mu family would go to the extent of being stingy with food.

237
00:20:50,852 --> 00:20:55,070
My Lord, you have no idea servants in prominent households like this

238
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,470
tend to treat those who are powerless with disdain.

239
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:00,950
It was because I never had enough to eat as a child that I made a vow.

240
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:05,970
When I grow up, I must succeed in the metropolitan examination and make sure I get to eat my fill.

241
00:21:08,391 --> 00:21:10,371
Eat more from now on.

242
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:16,250
 His Lordship has a well-shaped head. 

243
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,520
   

244
00:21:32,871 --> 00:21:34,310
Don't kill me.

245
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,010
Please don't kill me.

246
00:21:36,951 --> 00:21:38,651
Don't kill me.

247
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,431
Please don't kill me.

248
00:21:42,391 --> 00:21:43,891
Don't kill me.

249
00:21:43,891 --> 00:21:45,930
Stay away from me.

250
00:22:23,831 --> 00:22:25,431
Don't kill me.

251
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,250
Don't kill me!

252
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,030
Please don't kill me.

253
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,730
Don't kill me.

254
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,090
- Don't be scared. 
  - My Lord! 

255
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,771
My Lord, are you all right?

256
00:22:43,911 --> 00:22:44,870
Don't kill me.

257
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,750
Looks like you're safe and sound.

258
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,151
We don't have to worry anymore.

259
00:22:48,151 --> 00:22:49,191
Let's go.

260
00:22:49,191 --> 00:22:50,550
No, don't kill me.

261
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,250
Don't kill me!

262
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,171
Go and decoct some medicine.

263
00:22:57,171 --> 00:22:58,951
 Yes, Your Lordship. 

264
00:23:03,151 --> 00:23:04,551
No...

265
00:23:23,671 --> 00:23:25,151
The decoction is ready.

266
00:23:25,151 --> 00:23:26,470
Why don't you deliver it?

267
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,970
Me?

268
00:23:29,251 --> 00:23:32,711
I lost my temper the other day and scared Miss Mu.

269
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:35,091
I didn't know His Lordship still needed her.

270
00:23:35,091 --> 00:23:37,310
I'm afraid I may mess it up for him.

271
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,130
Just go and do this favor for me.

272
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,631
Hurry. Go quickly.

273
00:23:45,351 --> 00:23:47,231
She has a fever.

274
00:23:47,231 --> 00:23:49,410
Metropolitan examination.

275
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:51,431
I'm going to be late.

276
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:54,571
I can't make it for the exam.

277
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,290
Here's the medicine.

278
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,470
Are you expecting me to feed her?

279
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,911
"The benevolent do not doubt;

280
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:13,731
the wise do not worry, the virtuous do not fear."

281
00:24:13,731 --> 00:24:15,210
What... What does that mean?

282
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,090
"The virtuous do not fear."

283
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,470
She's reciting scriptures to prepare for the metropolitan examination.

284
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,531
"The benevolent do not doubt."

285
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,570
Don't...

286
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,470
Don't you know how to feed someone?

287
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:31,571
Zhijian does.

288
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,471
Then, tell him to come inside now.

289
00:24:34,471 --> 00:24:35,871
He...

290
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:38,790
He's upset.

291
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:42,110
Zhijian seems seems lively and cheerful.

292
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,810
In fact, his knot is heavier than yours.

293
00:24:45,671 --> 00:24:47,371
Let me do it, then.

294
00:24:47,371 --> 00:24:49,870
You can go and comfort him.

295
00:25:01,631 --> 00:25:03,710
Just say it if you have something to say.

296
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,390
Stop flipping through your notes. Or I'll ignore you.

297
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:11,351
I'm looking for a phrase to comfort you.

298
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,911
His Lordship refuses to believe that His Majesty is behind all this.

299
00:25:25,911 --> 00:25:29,050
He's even willing to put his life at risk as a stake.

300
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:31,371
Fortunately, it ended well.

301
00:25:31,371 --> 00:25:34,310
His Majesty really sent his men to protect His Lordship.

302
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,310
But this time,

303
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,270
our investigation is in vain again.

304
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,571
We'll get to the bottom eventually.

305
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:48,351
After news that our father and brothers had died on the battlefield reached us,

306
00:25:48,351 --> 00:25:54,171
our relatives were too busy fighting over the family wealth to care about our lives.

307
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:59,470
It was His Lordship who stormed into the residence on a rainy night

308
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,731
and took us both away,

309
00:26:02,871 --> 00:26:05,331
giving us a chance to survive.

310
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:12,190
From that night on, you could no longer speak,

311
00:26:13,051 --> 00:26:14,951
and I lost my heart.

312
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,750
Yes.

313
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,450
But I never thought about...

314
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:25,671
what His Lordship had lost.

315
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:30,010
Everything.

316
00:27:16,191 --> 00:27:18,611
My Lord, let me feed her the medicine.

317
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:36,251
Which of you two can come and feed her?

318
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,630
Come here.

319
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,290
"It is said..."

320
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:59,470
"It is said in history, a wise person should speak and act with caution."

321
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,210
But you're far from cautious in your words.

322
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:03,631
Your talk is full of nonsense.

323
00:28:04,731 --> 00:28:06,431
"It is said...

324
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,790
to trust the capable without doubt."

325
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,730
"T-Trust the capable without doubt."

326
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:23,450
How can you still think of currying favor when having a fever?

327
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,431
This phrase has a well-known meaning.

328
00:28:25,431 --> 00:28:29,710
It indicates that one should trust and utilize capable individuals without hesitation.

329
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:34,711
But, My Lord, she sounds like she's ironically criticizing.

330
00:28:34,711 --> 00:28:37,271
It sounds like she's saying that you are...

331
00:28:37,271 --> 00:28:38,770
Enough.

332
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:43,210
Can you stop talking nonsense and focus on feeding her the medicine?

333
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:45,170
"It is said..."

334
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:50,651
"It is said, a wise person should speak and act with caution.

335
00:28:50,651 --> 00:28:55,591
The benevolent do not doubt, the wise do not worry, the virtuous do not fear."

336
00:28:55,591 --> 00:28:56,671
All right, I get it.

337
00:28:56,671 --> 00:28:58,271
Just drink your medicine.

338
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,711
 Are you sure you want 

339
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:17,510
 to use the rewards granted to you in exchange for allowing females to attend the imperial exam? 

340
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,591
 Yes. 

341
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:20,351
 When I was among the common people, 

342
00:29:20,351 --> 00:29:24,390
 I witnessed women with extraordinary talents, strong character, and determination. 

343
00:29:24,391 --> 00:29:25,871
 They're no less knowledgeable than men. 

344
00:29:25,871 --> 00:29:28,450
 But due to outdated beliefs, 

345
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:32,711
 they can't take the exam and contribute to the country. 

346
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,391
 Their lives are not easy. 

347
00:29:35,391 --> 00:29:38,491
 I believe if knowledgeable women 

348
00:29:38,491 --> 00:29:41,571
 can stand in the court based on their abilities, 

349
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:47,150
 they will be like a flag for the world to see and remember. 

350
00:29:47,631 --> 00:29:51,231
 Over time, their mindset will gradually change. 

351
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,571
 I ask that you give women all over the nation a chance 

352
00:29:55,571 --> 00:30:00,611
 to prove themselves by allowing them to attend the imperial exam. 

353
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:16,211
 The path of the imperial exams is like the rivers and seas with undercurrents. 

354
00:30:16,211 --> 00:30:19,570
 You think that passing the exams might change your destiny. 

355
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:23,890
 Yet none of these paths will be like a stroll. 

356
00:30:30,951 --> 00:30:32,451
 Mother? 

357
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,570
 Mother. 

358
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:43,870
 Mother! 

359
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:51,991
 Mother, 

360
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:55,251
 I miss you so much. 

361
00:30:57,291 --> 00:31:01,191
 Mother, you were right. 

362
00:31:01,191 --> 00:31:04,991
 You told me that I must study. 

363
00:31:04,991 --> 00:31:10,071
 After studying, I would gain knowledge, and my understanding will expand. 

364
00:31:10,671 --> 00:31:14,151
 You also said that medical knowledge was beneficial. 

365
00:31:14,151 --> 00:31:19,630
 Even if we can't save anyone's life, we can still save ourselves at a critical moment. 

366
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,270
 Mother. 

367
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,290
 Mother! 

368
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:32,770
 Mother! 

369
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,950
 Mother. 

370
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:39,511
 Mother. 

371
00:31:40,911 --> 00:31:42,411
 Mother. 

372
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:45,731
 I failed to save you. 

373
00:31:45,731 --> 00:31:48,170
 But you saved me. 

374
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:50,250
 I'm your mother. 

375
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,551
 I can even trade my life for you. 

376
00:31:53,351 --> 00:31:57,791
 I was incompetent that you have to strive for your future on your own. 

377
00:31:57,791 --> 00:32:01,850
 Every parent would plan everything for their children. 

378
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:03,311
 Mother. 

379
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,370
 Mother! 

380
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,970
 Mother! 

381
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:22,531
 Mother, I will grow up someday. 

382
00:32:22,531 --> 00:32:26,651
 And I will be a parent someday. 

383
00:32:26,651 --> 00:32:29,731
 So I must strive for my future myself. 

384
00:32:29,731 --> 00:32:30,831
 Look at me now. 

385
00:32:30,831 --> 00:32:33,390
 Am I not in the capital now? 

386
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:35,671
 I'll sit for the metropolitan examination soon. 

387
00:32:35,671 --> 00:32:37,230
 The metropolitan examination... 

388
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,310
 The metropolitan examination. 

389
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,010
I'm going to miss it. I'm going to miss it.

390
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:45,190
Metropolitan examination! The metropolitan examination.

391
00:32:47,151 --> 00:32:49,711
We're already on our way back to the capital.

392
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,711
We are, My Lord?

393
00:33:07,911 --> 00:33:10,891
That's great. That's great.

394
00:33:10,891 --> 00:33:12,490
My Lord,

395
00:33:13,631 --> 00:33:14,930
thank you.

396
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,830
Thank you very much.

397
00:33:29,151 --> 00:33:34,851
 Could it be that His Lordship looked after me for the past two days? 

398
00:33:34,851 --> 00:33:36,030
 That's impossible. 

399
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:38,470
 What virtues or abilities do I even possess to deserve that? 

400
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:43,511
 The dignified, prestigious, 

401
00:33:43,511 --> 00:33:46,650
 and approachable Lord Ding 

402
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:50,990
 isn't as arrogant and cruel as rumored. 

403
00:33:54,871 --> 00:33:57,750
 What are you going to do now, Mu Xiaoqi? 

404
00:33:59,111 --> 00:34:03,210
 You even told Mother in your dream that you'd strive for your own future. 

405
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,811
 How can you think about relying on him now? 

406
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:13,230
 I used to consider First Prince to be the perfect candidate for the throne. 

407
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:16,311
 Lord Ding and First Prince have a good relationship. 

408
00:34:16,311 --> 00:34:20,430
 Then, Lord Ding must be a stable support for me. 

409
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:24,571
 But I've overheard shocking secrets 

410
00:34:24,571 --> 00:34:27,971
 and run into powerful individuals who want to take Lord Ding's life. 

411
00:34:28,751 --> 00:34:32,971
 Even if it weren't His Majesty, it must be someone prominent. 

412
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:37,630
 So should I rely on him or not? 

413
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:46,251
 If he abandoned me in the woods back there, I would betray him without hesitation. 

414
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:51,970
 But Lord Ding never abandoned me. 

415
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:56,110
 He even carried me on his back and took care of me in person. 

416
00:34:59,871 --> 00:35:01,131
 Wake up! 

417
00:35:01,131 --> 00:35:04,991
 Come on, don't be soft-hearted. 

418
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:19,151
It looks like you've almost recovered.

419
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:27,611
My Lord, we can arrive at the examination hall on time. Right?

420
00:35:28,911 --> 00:35:31,550
My Lord, you're the examiner.

421
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:35,750
So, you'll definitely be there on time. Right?

422
00:35:35,751 --> 00:35:37,650
I am the examiner,

423
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:42,270
but if I have another engagement, I can find someone else to replace me.

424
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,870
So you're not going?

425
00:35:44,951 --> 00:35:46,490
That won't do.

426
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:49,630
Then, I must get off the carriage and ride a horse back.

427
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,630
Calm down.

428
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:54,351
- My Lord... 
 - We have one day left. We'll make it.

429
00:35:54,351 --> 00:35:58,651
Wait, My Lord. If I don't make it in time for the examination, what should I do?

430
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,711
You can sit for the next one.

431
00:36:00,711 --> 00:36:02,511
The next one?

432
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:10,390
My Lord, have you ever heard of a folk tale...

433
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:14,390
about Cao Cao and Hua Tuo?

434
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:16,271
Yes, I've heard of it.

435
00:36:16,271 --> 00:36:18,231
Do you know the lesson from that story?

436
00:36:18,231 --> 00:36:21,630
Helping others doesn't always lead to a good outcome.

437
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,676
Enough.

438
00:36:23,676 --> 00:36:25,511
Stop trying to feel me out.

439
00:36:26,231 --> 00:36:29,951
If you fail the examination, I'll support you for three years.

440
00:36:29,951 --> 00:36:32,251
But what if I can never make it?

441
00:36:32,251 --> 00:36:34,911
Then, I might as well support you for a lifetime.

442
00:36:40,751 --> 00:36:43,011
What if I do well in the exam?

443
00:36:45,391 --> 00:36:48,351
Then, I'll reward you with a gift.

444
00:36:48,351 --> 00:36:50,451
I get a gift for doing well?

445
00:36:50,451 --> 00:36:51,791
What gift do you want?

446
00:36:51,791 --> 00:36:53,291
I...

447
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,911
Can I have this jade pendant?

448
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:03,090
Sure.

449
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:05,450
We shall see how well you do, then.

450
00:37:30,935 --> 00:37:33,660
   

451
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:37,391
   

452
00:37:37,391 --> 00:37:39,191
What should I do?

453
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:43,111
Why is Young Lady not back yet?

454
00:37:45,811 --> 00:37:47,891
This is bad. This is really bad.

455
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,180
   

456
00:38:17,831 --> 00:38:19,431
Young Master Shen.

457
00:38:25,311 --> 00:38:27,970
Is there anything I can help you with, Your Highness?

458
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:30,670
It's an important day for the imperial exam.

459
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,890
I can't ask you to do anything for me.

460
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:37,590
I'm giving you the Four Treasures of the Study from Qingzhou for your exam.

461
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:39,491
May everything go smoothly.

462
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,751
Your Highness, please rest assured.

463
00:38:45,751 --> 00:38:48,750
For this examination, I shall not disappoint you.

464
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:20,010

00:41:13,526 --> 00:41:17,206
♫  Obviously can't be erased, and haunted by lingering dreams  ♫

485
00:41:17,206 --> 00:41:21,186
♫  For a moment of heartbeat, paying homage to Heaven  ♫

486
00:41:21,186 --> 00:41:28,666
♫  Want to have one more glimpse of you, 
 even just for a second more  ♫
