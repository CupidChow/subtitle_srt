♫  Nothing but love and freedom  ♫

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,120
   

16
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,160
   

17
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,040
   

18
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,910
   

19
00:01:53,635 --> 00:01:56,035
Young Lady, how was it?

20
00:01:56,035 --> 00:01:57,914
It's fine. Don't worry.

21
00:02:25,894 --> 00:02:29,515
My Lord, I...

22
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:32,175
I haven't done an autopsy before.

23
00:02:32,175 --> 00:02:33,374
What?

24
00:02:33,374 --> 00:02:36,814
Why are you afraid of a dead body when you had the guts to one-up His Lordship?

25
00:02:44,795 --> 00:02:46,055
Be careful.

26
00:02:46,055 --> 00:02:48,254
The blood on the body is poisonous.

27
00:02:48,674 --> 00:02:50,894
Thank you for your kind reminder.

28
00:03:39,515 --> 00:03:42,534
I thought you wanted to eat. Why don't you take it?

29
00:03:54,254 --> 00:03:56,394
What poison did she get?

30
00:03:58,795 --> 00:03:59,874
My Lord,

31
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:03,275
I need more references before making a judgment.

32
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:09,375
My Lord, could you please describe the symptoms of Yun Xiangyue before and after the poison took effect?

33
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:14,075
At first, she was normal.

34
00:04:15,075 --> 00:04:20,755
About ten minutes later, she spit up blood, fell, and died.

35
00:04:20,755 --> 00:04:25,294
Besides, her body was bleeding.

36
00:04:26,014 --> 00:04:28,574
Did you touch her last night?

37
00:04:28,574 --> 00:04:32,514
I held her when she collapsed.

38
00:04:32,514 --> 00:04:36,195
My Lord, may I take your pulse?

39
00:04:46,535 --> 00:04:52,135
Last night, I noticed something weird about your pulse.

40
00:04:52,135 --> 00:04:55,895
Two different energies intertwine inside you.

41
00:04:55,895 --> 00:05:00,455
Strangely, your qi and blood surged in your body,

42
00:05:01,254 --> 00:05:03,134
and the pulse was unstable.

43
00:05:04,454 --> 00:05:09,915
My Lord, could you tell me about your past sickness?

44
00:05:10,515 --> 00:05:12,535
His Lordship was poisoned by Yuanluo before.

45
00:05:14,195 --> 00:05:15,895
The Yuanluo flower?

46
00:05:17,474 --> 00:05:19,374
Do you know this flower?

47
00:05:19,374 --> 00:05:21,694
I read about it before.

48
00:05:21,694 --> 00:05:24,314
 This is the Yuanluo flower. 

49
00:05:24,314 --> 00:05:28,315
 It's the most poisonous flower in the world. 

50
00:05:28,315 --> 00:05:32,596
The Yuanluo flower grows in the deep abyss where toxic bugs and venomous snakes gather.

51
00:05:33,354 --> 00:05:38,175
Once afflicted by this poison, one's blood will coagulate within three days.

52
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,734
When the poison penetrates the bones, the victim will die in seven days.

53
00:05:41,734 --> 00:05:44,475
Precisely.

54
00:05:45,315 --> 00:05:50,334
But you survived this poison.

55
00:05:51,215 --> 00:05:55,135
I remember that this poisonous flower has no antidote.

56
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:57,655
Bone-scraping treatment.

57
00:05:57,655 --> 00:05:59,455
Have you heard about it before?

58
00:05:59,455 --> 00:06:01,315
Bone-scraping treatment?

59
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:04,854
It's as excruciating as the Yuanluo flower's torment.

60
00:06:06,014 --> 00:06:10,634
What about the other energy in your body?

61
00:06:10,634 --> 00:06:11,875
It's the Snow Dust pill.

62
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,655
Snow Dust pill?

63
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,894
It's new to me.

64
00:06:18,894 --> 00:06:22,435
Snow Dust pills can detoxify all kinds of poison.

65
00:06:22,435 --> 00:06:25,734
His Lordship took the last pill.

66
00:06:28,494 --> 00:06:31,775
If so, the two intertwining energies inside your body

67
00:06:31,775 --> 00:06:34,834
should be the Snow Dust pill and the Yuanluo flower.

68
00:06:35,755 --> 00:06:39,075
But another energy seeped into your body last night,

69
00:06:39,075 --> 00:06:42,095
ruining the harmony of both poison and antidote.

70
00:06:43,115 --> 00:06:45,894
I had many doubts,

71
00:06:45,894 --> 00:06:49,354
but now I started figuring them out.

72
00:07:41,175 --> 00:07:43,955
The poison was soaked in her clothes?

73
00:07:43,955 --> 00:07:44,995
Yes.

74
00:07:44,995 --> 00:07:48,315
The poison seeped into her veins through her garment.

75
00:07:48,315 --> 00:07:49,995
However, this is not a poison.

76
00:07:49,995 --> 00:07:53,455
It's a potion named Revival Powder.

77
00:07:53,455 --> 00:07:55,274
Revival Powder?

78
00:08:00,474 --> 00:08:03,114
Revival Powder is the most efficient supplementary medicine.

79
00:08:03,114 --> 00:08:05,934
A tint of it at the nose can take effect.

80
00:08:05,934 --> 00:08:09,734
Due to its powerful function, ordinary men will experience an energy surge inside their bodies.

81
00:08:09,734 --> 00:08:12,914
While women have too slender veins to cater to the energy surge,

82
00:08:12,914 --> 00:08:15,315
and they will die after the veins burst.

83
00:08:17,315 --> 00:08:23,575
Since you can tell it's Revival Powder, do you know its origin?

84
00:08:24,955 --> 00:08:28,794
The ingredients of Revival Powder are precious,

85
00:08:28,794 --> 00:08:31,575
especially the main ingredient, Immortal Fruits.

86
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:34,814
It bears only ten fruits per year.

87
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,895
Besides, its concoction process is demanding,

88
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:40,634
and the chance of failure is more than half.

89
00:08:40,634 --> 00:08:44,934
I'm afraid the place that can afford the hefty expenses can only be...

90
00:08:44,934 --> 00:08:48,934
Are you suggesting it comes from the Imperial Academy of Medicine?

91
00:08:49,975 --> 00:08:51,694
I daren't make any wild guesses.

92
00:08:51,694 --> 00:08:53,854
You won't be punished. Go on.

93
00:08:56,634 --> 00:09:01,814
I reckon the perpetrator is discreet.

94
00:09:01,814 --> 00:09:03,314
On top of that,

95
00:09:05,474 --> 00:09:07,995
this person knows about your sickness well.

96
00:09:07,995 --> 00:09:14,194
As this person predicted that the Snow Dust pill would dissolve the ordinary poison inside you.

97
00:09:14,994 --> 00:09:17,054
I found that something is off, too.

98
00:09:17,994 --> 00:09:23,235
I'm curious about why Miss Yun put on the maidservant's clothes.

99
00:09:24,354 --> 00:09:27,694
And the murderer of Miss Yun

100
00:09:27,694 --> 00:09:32,874
wouldn't have foreseen this and applied the poison to the maidservant's clothes in advance.

101
00:09:32,874 --> 00:09:38,515
Thus, I suspect that the murderer bribed her maidservant beforehand.

102
00:09:38,515 --> 00:09:41,455
My Lord, you should interrogate the maidservant.

103
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:44,795
She was killed last night.

104
00:09:51,555 --> 00:09:53,155
She was killed?

105
00:09:54,874 --> 00:09:57,375
My Lord, I'm clean and innocent.

106
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,175
I was involved in this accidentally.

107
00:09:59,175 --> 00:10:06,314
If I were to harm you, I should've left you there last night to avoid trouble...

108
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,895
No.

109
00:10:07,895 --> 00:10:10,315
I didn't mean your matter is trouble.

110
00:10:10,315 --> 00:10:13,474
It's a great pleasure to serve you, My Lord.

111
00:10:13,474 --> 00:10:15,674
However, I...

112
00:10:17,175 --> 00:10:18,574
I don't want to be killed.

113
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:22,974
Zhijian, have Zhimo escort them back.

114
00:10:22,974 --> 00:10:24,575
Yes.

115
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,134
My Lord.

116
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:40,275
He Xin looked into Mu Zhuohua's background when the accident happened last night.

117
00:10:41,175 --> 00:10:42,675
Read it to me.

118
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:49,474
Mu Zhuohua, born in Huaizhou.

119
00:10:49,474 --> 00:10:51,354
The seventh daughter of the wealthiest man in Jiangnan.

120
00:10:51,354 --> 00:10:52,954
Her real name is Mu Qi.

121
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:55,414
How bold she is.

122
00:10:55,414 --> 00:10:57,534
She changed her name and birth origin.

123
00:10:59,915 --> 00:11:03,395
Her father, Mu Rong, has many wives and children.

124
00:11:03,395 --> 00:11:06,314
Her mother, Gu Yixiao, was a prostitute.

125
00:11:06,314 --> 00:11:09,514
She was the third youngest among the wives and concubines, and died at a young age.

126
00:11:10,874 --> 00:11:14,314
Given her family and background,

127
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:18,934
no wonder she has no concern...

128
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:21,835
about staying in Flower Alley.

129
00:11:27,714 --> 00:11:28,915
Juli,

130
00:11:28,915 --> 00:11:33,554
actually, I ran into Lord Ding in Xiaoqin Pleasure House last night.

131
00:11:34,315 --> 00:11:35,915
Hold on.

132
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:40,675
Come with me.

133
00:11:40,714 --> 00:11:45,355
Here writes that she's known as a "bookworm" in the residence and has no specialty.

134
00:11:45,355 --> 00:11:47,395
She never left Jiangnan over the past two decades.

135
00:11:47,395 --> 00:11:49,615
This is her first time in the capital.

136
00:11:51,255 --> 00:11:54,734
A few days ago, Mu Rong just married his eighteenth concubine.

137
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:59,774
She managed to study and acquire medical skills

138
00:11:59,774 --> 00:12:02,214
growing up in this kind of family.

139
00:12:02,994 --> 00:12:05,095
She's truly exceptional.

140
00:12:05,095 --> 00:12:08,794
Young Lady, you did such a great thing last night.

141
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,474
It's not something great.

142
00:12:10,474 --> 00:12:12,375
I'm beginning to worry...

143
00:12:13,155 --> 00:12:17,554
I'm worried that our life will be troublesome from now on.

144
00:12:19,075 --> 00:12:23,834
Do you mean we're on Lord Ding's radar now?

145
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:25,654
That's right.

146
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:30,854
That night, I had no choice but to play dumb before him.

147
00:12:30,854 --> 00:12:34,595
Because he was able to take my life even though he was poisoned.

148
00:12:34,595 --> 00:12:38,094
Therefore, I did everything I could to save his life,

149
00:12:38,094 --> 00:12:42,495
hoping that he could show me some mercy and not kill his savior.

150
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,554
But why did you help him earlier today?

151
00:12:45,554 --> 00:12:47,255
Yun Xiangyue is dead.

152
00:12:47,255 --> 00:12:51,115
I could only turn myself in, instead of exposing him.

153
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:55,514
That's why I must perform my skills before him to show my loyalty.

154
00:12:55,514 --> 00:12:57,075
Because playing dumb wouldn't help much.

155
00:12:57,075 --> 00:12:59,654
I had to make myself more valuable to him.

156
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:03,294
Young Lady, are we safe now?

157
00:13:03,294 --> 00:13:07,694
As long as Lord Ding reckons that I was involved in this involuntarily,

158
00:13:07,694 --> 00:13:12,255
I think we're safe for the time being.

159
00:13:12,255 --> 00:13:17,995
Under the alias of Mu Zhuohua, Mu Qi ranked 25th in the provincial examination.

160
00:13:18,675 --> 00:13:20,995
Gosh, she's actually a provincial graduate.

161
00:13:20,995 --> 00:13:24,815
The 25th is a mediocre rank.

162
00:13:25,334 --> 00:13:29,554
Given her competency, she should've reached higher ranks.

163
00:13:29,554 --> 00:13:33,115
But she chose to stay in low profile.

164
00:13:34,395 --> 00:13:37,215
My Lord, this woman is scheming indeed.

165
00:13:37,215 --> 00:13:40,035
But we have no idea if her plot is to protect herself

166
00:13:40,035 --> 00:13:42,235
or to be exploited by the one behind her.

167
00:13:43,315 --> 00:13:45,115
This is still a mystery to us.

168
00:13:46,395 --> 00:13:51,535
Do you remember what I told you when we first came here?

169
00:13:51,535 --> 00:13:55,495
I have always thought that Lord Ding is a strange character.

170
00:13:55,915 --> 00:13:59,715
Back then, Tutor Shang said to me

171
00:13:59,754 --> 00:14:02,675
that Lord Ding's meritorious reputation had surpassed the emperor.

172
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:07,614
If not for the fatal defeat five years ago, most officials

173
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:11,434
would've held Lord Ding in higher regard than the emperor.

174
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:12,675
Guess what.

175
00:14:12,675 --> 00:14:15,655
The emperor has been in poor health.

176
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,894
He has three sons.

177
00:14:17,894 --> 00:14:19,614
But the three princes don't agree with each other.

178
00:14:19,614 --> 00:14:25,834
Hence, Lord Ding must act prudently and stay in a low profile to protect himself.

179
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:32,394
But I'm confused why he returned to the capital in a high-profile manner.

180
00:14:32,394 --> 00:14:34,595
What was the show for?

181
00:14:35,355 --> 00:14:38,514
But her words do make sense.

182
00:14:39,435 --> 00:14:41,314
Which one?

183
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:45,255
She said the perpetrator must know your sickness very well.

184
00:14:45,255 --> 00:14:49,794
There are not many who know your condition well.

185
00:14:51,094 --> 00:14:53,034
We haven't found the truth.

186
00:14:53,034 --> 00:14:55,015
I know what to do.

187
00:14:56,415 --> 00:15:02,055
Have Imperial Physician Zhao investigate the Revival Powder Mu Zhuohua mentioned.

188
00:15:02,055 --> 00:15:04,474
Leave no stone unturned.

189
00:15:04,474 --> 00:15:06,774
Do it quietly.

190
00:15:08,614 --> 00:15:14,114
Besides, have Zhimo keep a close eye on Mu Zhuohua.

191
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:15,655
Yes.

192
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:20,560
   

193
00:15:22,094 --> 00:15:23,795
Move your hands and feet quickly.

194
00:15:23,795 --> 00:15:26,455
- Do your work well. 
 - Sure.

195
00:15:26,455 --> 00:15:28,255
 Coming. 

196
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,314
Today is the imperial birthday.

197
00:15:31,315 --> 00:15:33,855
Everyone will be celebrating the emperor's birthday.

198
00:15:33,855 --> 00:15:35,636
Each year after the banquet ends,

199
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:38,915
His Majesty will come to Lord Ding Residence and have a drink with Lord Ding.

200
00:15:38,915 --> 00:15:40,795
Go. Keep a close eye on that.

201
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,355
Two of you.

202
00:15:44,355 --> 00:15:46,655
Stop being clumsy.

203
00:15:47,354 --> 00:15:49,754
Do you want me to do this for you?

204
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:52,574
Do your work well.

205
00:15:52,574 --> 00:15:53,914
Yes.

206
00:15:58,195 --> 00:16:00,035
What a merry day.

207
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:06,294
Sadly, there's no lady owner to deal with the affairs.

208
00:16:06,294 --> 00:16:09,055
An old man like me has to bear this burden.

209
00:16:10,975 --> 00:16:12,575
Do a good job.

210
00:16:28,315 --> 00:16:29,734
 Good! 

211
00:16:29,734 --> 00:16:32,215
 Good! 

212
00:16:32,215 --> 00:16:35,154
 Bravo! 

213
00:16:38,795 --> 00:16:41,075
 Good! 

214
00:16:42,395 --> 00:16:44,754
 Great! 

215
00:16:45,275 --> 00:16:47,595
 Wonderful! 

216
00:16:51,354 --> 00:16:55,275
Well, I don't regret encountering Lord Ding and having this interaction with him.

217
00:16:55,275 --> 00:16:58,694
I'll likely gain a good promotion chance if he acknowledges my talent.

218
00:16:58,694 --> 00:17:02,134
Young Lady, don't you think Lord Ding is stingy?

219
00:17:02,134 --> 00:17:03,574
You're his savior.

220
00:17:03,574 --> 00:17:05,074
And yet he didn't pay you for the treatment.

221
00:17:05,074 --> 00:17:06,234
Bite your tongue.

222
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:09,375
The paltry sum of his treatment charges isn't what we aim for.

223
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,915
What do we aim for, then?

224
00:17:10,915 --> 00:17:12,515
His good-looking face?

225
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:15,195
Guo Juli, you're bold enough.

226
00:17:15,195 --> 00:17:17,974
How could you assume that I'm after his good-looking face?

227
00:17:17,974 --> 00:17:21,374
In that case, what do you aim for?

228
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:26,374
I tell you. If Butler Zhou catches us one day,

229
00:17:26,374 --> 00:17:29,314
I hope Lord Ding will give us a hand.

230
00:17:30,314 --> 00:17:31,374
You're right, Young Lady.

231
00:17:31,374 --> 00:17:33,215
But you ought to be careful in this place.

232
00:17:33,215 --> 00:17:35,835
No worries, this place is close to the palace.

233
00:17:35,835 --> 00:17:38,655
Look right in front of you. That's the gate tower.

234
00:17:38,655 --> 00:17:40,794
He doesn't have the guts to act in front of everyone.

235
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:42,835
 His Majesty ascends the gate tower! 

236
00:17:42,835 --> 00:17:45,355
Young Lady, look.

237
00:17:45,994 --> 00:17:47,514
Lord Ding is up there, too.

238
00:17:47,514 --> 00:17:48,474
Let's go to the front.

239
00:17:48,474 --> 00:17:51,435
 His Majesty ascends the gate tower! 

240
00:17:51,435 --> 00:17:59,355
 Your Majesty! 

241
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:05,714
 Your Majesty! 

242
00:18:07,285 --> 00:18:12,135
   

243
00:18:12,135 --> 00:18:17,210
     

244
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:21,785
     

245
00:18:23,414 --> 00:18:25,714
 Your Majesty! 

246
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:33,295
 Only the royals knows about my sickness. 

247
00:18:34,034 --> 00:18:35,834
Prince Brother,

248
00:18:35,835 --> 00:18:43,014
whenever I see my people and nation are in peace, I always feel glad that you're still by my side.

249
00:18:43,014 --> 00:18:44,655
Your Majesty,

250
00:18:44,655 --> 00:18:47,395
this is your blessing as well as all of the nation.

251
00:18:48,435 --> 00:18:53,714
Without me, there will be someone here to fulfill your dream.

252
00:18:54,474 --> 00:18:56,374
You see.

253
00:18:56,374 --> 00:18:59,635
You shouldn't always deny your credit.

254
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:05,094
I just made a request to you,

255
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,200
and you agreed to reopen the female imperial exams.

256
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,375
I didn't deny this reward from you, though.

257
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,475
Emperor Brother,

258
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:22,575
Are you thinking about Roujia?

259
00:19:25,474 --> 00:19:28,614
I always feel bad for Jiao.

260
00:19:28,614 --> 00:19:30,695
She lost her mother at a very young age,

261
00:19:30,695 --> 00:19:33,695
and I can't look after her.

262
00:19:33,695 --> 00:19:39,395
When she came back to the capital and met her true love,

263
00:19:39,975 --> 00:19:42,915
again, she lost him.

264
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:46,834
The capital is a sad place for her.

265
00:19:48,195 --> 00:19:50,894
Since she left for Jiangnan,

266
00:19:50,894 --> 00:19:55,415
I haven't seen my dear daughter for over five years.

267
00:19:59,695 --> 00:20:02,775
Roujia is an unbending child.

268
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:06,934
Despite her deep-rooted sorrow these years,

269
00:20:06,934 --> 00:20:09,714
she still keeps herself together.

270
00:20:11,195 --> 00:20:12,795
I know.

271
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:16,875
Jishan Hall, which she has been running, has branched out nationwide, and people celebrate her kind deeds.

272
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,495
 Holy Maiden is back! 

273
00:20:18,495 --> 00:20:22,495
 Holy Maiden! 

274
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:29,474
 Holy Maiden! 

275
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:36,875
 Holy Maiden! 

276
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:43,075
Father.

277
00:20:45,255 --> 00:20:47,015
I'm back.

278
00:20:47,015 --> 00:20:48,914
I'm glad that you're back.

279
00:20:52,535 --> 00:20:54,794
   

280
00:20:54,794 --> 00:20:57,155
You're cruel, my girl.

281
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,895
I've been waiting for you.

282
00:20:59,895 --> 00:21:02,054
Finally, you're home.

283
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:05,775
Grandmother, I'm back.

284
00:21:10,934 --> 00:21:12,734
Greetings, Mother.

285
00:21:13,554 --> 00:21:15,535
Greetings, Uncle.

286
00:21:16,414 --> 00:21:20,575
Young Lady, why does everyone call her Holy Maiden?

287
00:21:20,575 --> 00:21:22,355
She's Princess Roujia.

288
00:21:22,355 --> 00:21:24,575
The favorite daughter of His Majesty.

289
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:27,835
Five years ago, when His Lordship suffered a fatal defeat in the Juma River,

290
00:21:27,835 --> 00:21:30,514
a man sacrificed in the battle too.

291
00:21:30,514 --> 00:21:34,535
That was Princess's fiance, General Xue Xiaotang.

292
00:21:34,535 --> 00:21:36,895
Aren't they separated forever?

293
00:21:36,915 --> 00:21:41,614
After General Xue's death, Dowager Empress wanted to choose a new husband for the princess.

294
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,915
However, Her Highness insisted on being in mourning for General Xue

295
00:21:44,915 --> 00:21:46,794
and turned down all marriage requests.

296
00:21:46,794 --> 00:21:48,195
After returning to Jiangnan,

297
00:21:48,195 --> 00:21:50,074
she reinstated the operation of Jishan Hall

298
00:21:50,074 --> 00:21:54,254
and has been helping the needy and impoverished families.

299
00:21:54,254 --> 00:21:58,035
When I was in Huaizhou, I met her once.

300
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,410
 - Greetings, Your Highness. 
 - Greetings, Your Highness. 

301
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,930
   

302
00:22:06,955 --> 00:22:11,914
 Old Master Mu, I came here to offer my gratitude to you on behalf of Jishan Hall. 

303
00:22:12,994 --> 00:22:16,135
 You're so benevolent and kind to offer financial relief for the flood. 
   

304
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:18,855
 I can help out too. 
   

305
00:22:22,435 --> 00:22:24,915
 You sure do. It's good to have aspirations. 

306
00:22:24,915 --> 00:22:26,635
 Let's help the refugees. 

307
00:22:26,635 --> 00:22:29,355
 We welcome another pair of hands. 

308
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:37,135
Finally, our family can reunite today.

309
00:22:37,135 --> 00:22:41,355
Jiaojiao, we should raise a glass to Heaven as appreciation.

310
00:22:41,355 --> 00:22:43,355
Yes, Father.

311
00:22:51,935 --> 00:22:57,195
May the sky be clear and the earth be peaceful, and the souls and valleys full!

312
00:23:21,994 --> 00:23:26,895
With the dark sky and the yellow soil, the universe was born in chaos.

313
00:23:26,895 --> 00:23:29,555
Young Lady, I saw candied haws over there. I want to get one for myself.

314
00:23:29,555 --> 00:23:31,835
Don't go too far.

315
00:23:43,395 --> 00:23:45,295
Miss Seventh.

316
00:23:46,915 --> 00:23:50,295
It was quite an effort to find you.

317
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:59,135
Please help me! Robbery!

318
00:23:59,135 --> 00:24:00,195
What are you up to?

319
00:24:00,195 --> 00:24:02,554
Robbing a woman in public? Do you want to go against the law?

320
00:24:02,554 --> 00:24:03,635
Robbing a woman in public?

321
00:24:03,635 --> 00:24:05,396
Folks. Folks, please.

322
00:24:05,396 --> 00:24:07,354
Please listen to me.

323
00:24:07,354 --> 00:24:10,634
She's going to be the concubine of my master, but she ran off before the wedding.

324
00:24:10,635 --> 00:24:13,754
So, I have to bring her back and teach her a lesson.

325
00:24:13,754 --> 00:24:15,695
You should go home.

326
00:24:15,695 --> 00:24:18,195
Nonsense! Young Lady isn't betrothed to anyone.

327
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:19,715
She has nothing to do with you.

328
00:24:19,715 --> 00:24:22,274
Miss Seventh, the Mu family has already accepted betrothal gifts from us,

329
00:24:22,274 --> 00:24:23,955
and yet they renege on this marriage.

330
00:24:23,955 --> 00:24:28,135
If we were to report this to the government office, you don't stand a chance of winning.

331
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:32,255
Everyone, this is the engagement letter of Miss Mu Qi.

332
00:24:32,255 --> 00:24:34,655
Today, I...

333
00:24:34,655 --> 00:24:36,234
Run!

334
00:24:36,234 --> 00:24:38,134
Come on.

335
00:24:38,134 --> 00:24:39,635
She ran away.

336
00:24:39,635 --> 00:24:41,535
Go after her.

337
00:24:41,535 --> 00:24:44,255
Useless bunch.

338
00:24:50,675 --> 00:24:52,575
Quick.

339
00:25:04,474 --> 00:25:06,674
Excuse me, please.

340
00:25:09,115 --> 00:25:10,155
Scram!

341
00:25:10,155 --> 00:25:12,814
You're not allowed to meet Uncle alone.

342
00:25:12,814 --> 00:25:16,155
Third Brother, you need to be polite to our elder brother.

343
00:25:16,155 --> 00:25:20,714
Eldest Brother, please keep your manners in check, too.

344
00:25:20,714 --> 00:25:22,694
Shut your mouth!

345
00:25:36,554 --> 00:25:38,514
You will get a reward with correct answers.

346
00:25:38,514 --> 00:25:40,955
It's the Princess. Let's go.

347
00:25:40,955 --> 00:25:44,875
What five-letter word can be read the same upside down or right side up?

348
00:25:46,435 --> 00:25:48,435
Swims.

349
00:25:48,435 --> 00:25:50,295
Well done.

350
00:25:50,295 --> 00:25:52,934
Miss, listen to the question carefully.

351
00:25:52,934 --> 00:25:56,314
I'm tall when I'm young and short when I'm old.

352
00:25:56,314 --> 00:25:57,835
What am I?

353
00:25:57,835 --> 00:25:59,735
A candle.

354
00:25:59,735 --> 00:26:02,115
You're smart, Miss.

355
00:26:05,134 --> 00:26:07,234
Which eye cannot see?

356
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:09,174
It's a metaphor.

357
00:26:10,115 --> 00:26:12,214
Eye of a needle.

358
00:26:12,975 --> 00:26:15,474
What comes down and goes up repeatedly?

359
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:17,454
It's a certain weather.

360
00:26:19,055 --> 00:26:20,655
Rain.

361
00:26:22,434 --> 00:26:25,535
What color do you eat?

362
00:26:25,535 --> 00:26:28,274
What color do I eat?

363
00:26:28,915 --> 00:26:30,515
Orange.

364
00:26:30,515 --> 00:26:33,234
Good job, Miss.

365
00:26:33,234 --> 00:26:35,055
Give me a moment.

366
00:26:35,675 --> 00:26:36,875
Where have they gone?

367
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:38,675
Search over there.

368
00:26:44,754 --> 00:26:46,554
How sly.

369
00:26:48,134 --> 00:26:50,074
Who are you talking about?

370
00:26:55,914 --> 00:27:01,014
I wonder if I have the pleasure of having a taste of Shiduanxiang Tea in your residence.

371
00:27:02,234 --> 00:27:05,455
These are your rewards for answering the lantern riddles.

372
00:27:05,455 --> 00:27:07,055
Here you go.

373
00:27:07,055 --> 00:27:09,114
Please pick one.

374
00:27:09,975 --> 00:27:12,514
All right.

375
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:15,755
- Thank you. 
 - Welcome.

376
00:27:17,514 --> 00:27:18,714
Where are they?

377
00:27:18,714 --> 00:27:20,614
Go over there.

378
00:27:22,835 --> 00:27:24,994
You're smart, Miss.

379
00:27:26,654 --> 00:27:30,574
No, Your Highness is indeed talented.

380
00:27:30,574 --> 00:27:32,795
Do you know me?

381
00:27:32,795 --> 00:27:36,935
Though you were high up on the city tower, no one could ever forget after seeing you.

382
00:27:36,935 --> 00:27:41,994
Not only that, you'd enlightened me when I was little.

383
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,095
How fated we are.

384
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:45,815
Was it in Jiangnan?

385
00:27:45,815 --> 00:27:48,715
Your Highness, do you remember?

386
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:55,774
No. Your accent sounds like folks from Huaizhou, Jiangnan.

387
00:27:56,955 --> 00:27:59,814
I... I'm from Yanzhou, actually.

388
00:27:59,814 --> 00:28:02,134
Well, my mistake.

389
00:28:10,074 --> 00:28:14,414
Miss Mu Qi is talking to Princess Roujia now.

390
00:28:20,274 --> 00:28:21,774
Let's leave.

391
00:28:22,654 --> 00:28:24,714
We'll find another way.

392
00:28:34,735 --> 00:28:40,675
Miss, am I standing here long enough to solve your problem?

393
00:28:42,575 --> 00:28:49,095
Your Highness, you figured that out?

394
00:28:49,095 --> 00:28:51,794
I did. But it's fine.

395
00:28:51,794 --> 00:28:56,714
If I could help you by just standing here, I'm more than glad to do it.

396
00:28:57,855 --> 00:29:01,515
Do you have any problems that need my help, too?

397
00:29:01,515 --> 00:29:03,794
Your Highness, you're so kind.

398
00:29:03,794 --> 00:29:07,734
No wonder everyone sings praise of you.

399
00:29:07,734 --> 00:29:13,054
You still helped me even though you knew I was taking advantage of you.

400
00:29:14,115 --> 00:29:16,574
Everyone has their own difficulties.

401
00:29:16,574 --> 00:29:18,495
I don't think you were taking advantage of me.

402
00:29:20,414 --> 00:29:21,675
I've made up my mind now.

403
00:29:21,675 --> 00:29:26,435
I must pass all the imperial examinations and become an official in the court.

404
00:29:26,435 --> 00:29:31,415
I'll forge my way out to success and never give up.

405
00:29:31,415 --> 00:29:35,075
Oh, you're a provincial graduate.

406
00:29:36,714 --> 00:29:39,014
Impressive.

407
00:29:39,014 --> 00:29:40,955
Tomorrow is the literary gathering in Wenzheng Parlor.

408
00:29:40,955 --> 00:29:42,435
Will you attend it?

409
00:29:42,435 --> 00:29:44,835
Literary gathering?

410
00:29:44,835 --> 00:29:46,314
No.

411
00:29:46,314 --> 00:29:50,914
If you're going to sit for the metropolitan examination, how could you not go to Wenzheng Parlor?

412
00:29:52,435 --> 00:29:58,354
I... I'm in trouble now, and I can't go anywhere as I wish.

413
00:30:01,414 --> 00:30:05,955
Since the reopening of the female imperial exams, female provincial graduates have been rarely seen.

414
00:30:05,955 --> 00:30:07,855
We are both women.

415
00:30:07,855 --> 00:30:12,935
This is the only thing I can do for a female provincial graduate I just met.

416
00:30:12,935 --> 00:30:15,395
Tomorrow, you may go to Wenzheng Parlor.

417
00:30:15,395 --> 00:30:17,295
Use my name as your reference.

418
00:30:17,295 --> 00:30:20,275
Someone will take you in.

419
00:30:20,275 --> 00:30:22,055
Thank you, Your Highness.

420
00:30:22,935 --> 00:30:24,455
Are you all right now?

421
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,475
Yes, I'm all right.

422
00:30:26,475 --> 00:30:28,394
Please take care, Your Highness.

423
00:30:36,055 --> 00:30:39,134
Young Lady, Her Highness wanted to help you just now.

424
00:30:39,134 --> 00:30:41,334
Why did you turn down her kindness?

425
00:30:42,214 --> 00:30:45,955
Juli, I'm a person with a conscience.

426
00:30:45,955 --> 00:30:47,535
Her Highness is a kind lady.

427
00:30:47,535 --> 00:30:50,474
How could I take advantage of her again?

428
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:53,374
Are we going to Wenzheng Parlor?

429
00:30:53,374 --> 00:30:56,955
Wenzheng Parlor? Of course.

430
00:31:08,795 --> 00:31:10,395
Your Majesty.

431
00:31:10,395 --> 00:31:11,555
I'll have the last shot.

432
00:31:11,555 --> 00:31:13,795
The imperial physician said you can't drink so much.

433
00:31:14,614 --> 00:31:16,635
You're not any better.

434
00:31:16,635 --> 00:31:18,154
Your Majesty.

435
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:24,395
Fine, I'll listen to you.

436
00:31:28,814 --> 00:31:31,595
Jiaojiao has invited a skilled physician from Jiangnan,

437
00:31:31,595 --> 00:31:34,554
known as the Great Healer of Jiangnan.

438
00:31:34,554 --> 00:31:36,375
She's so thoughtful.

439
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:39,455
She's always concerned about my sickness.

440
00:31:39,455 --> 00:31:42,554
And you, you always tend to hide your true thoughts from others.

441
00:31:48,595 --> 00:31:50,474
Don't overthink.

442
00:31:51,374 --> 00:31:54,055
My sickness has nothing to do with you.

443
00:31:54,894 --> 00:31:56,735
You're my closest brother.

444
00:31:56,735 --> 00:32:00,114
I'd never let you die without doing anything.

445
00:32:01,115 --> 00:32:06,295
If I could trade my death for your healthy and long life...

446
00:32:06,935 --> 00:32:09,694
and the peaceful nation,

447
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,255
I'm willing to die.

448
00:32:11,255 --> 00:32:12,654
Ridiculous.

449
00:32:12,654 --> 00:32:14,395
Don't say ominous things.

450
00:32:16,814 --> 00:32:19,074
You must live on well.

451
00:32:19,074 --> 00:32:21,095
I need you.

452
00:32:24,955 --> 00:32:26,734
I understand.

453
00:32:30,474 --> 00:32:33,074
Lord Ding took away the body of Yun Xiangyue.

454
00:32:33,074 --> 00:32:36,474
Regarding Yuan Chengming, they seem to have found something.

455
00:32:38,954 --> 00:32:42,895
Can't he idle his life away comfortably?

456
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:46,234
Why did he get his hand dirty instead?

457
00:32:46,234 --> 00:32:48,095
It's been five years.

458
00:32:48,095 --> 00:32:51,414
He did find something now.

459
00:32:51,414 --> 00:32:55,034
He managed to dodge the attack from Yun Xiangyue.

460
00:32:56,514 --> 00:32:58,154
This time,

461
00:32:59,454 --> 00:33:02,075
he won't be so lucky.

462
00:33:03,395 --> 00:33:04,695
Yes.

463
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,940
   

464
00:33:30,495 --> 00:33:33,635
My Lord, the letter...

465
00:33:40,614 --> 00:33:41,975
My Lord,

466
00:33:41,975 --> 00:33:45,174
should we let Butler Zhou take Mu Zhuohua away?

467
00:33:45,174 --> 00:33:47,035
She knows something about Revival Powder.

468
00:33:47,035 --> 00:33:48,774
She can't leave the capital.

469
00:33:48,774 --> 00:33:51,574
If so, should we release Butler Zhou?

470
00:33:51,574 --> 00:33:53,335
I still need him, too.

471
00:33:54,514 --> 00:33:58,155
Mu Zhuohua is going to Wenzheng Parlor tomorrow.

472
00:34:01,074 --> 00:34:02,915
What are the odds?

473
00:34:03,535 --> 00:34:06,635
Well, that just hits the spot.

474
00:34:16,385 --> 00:34:19,560
   

475
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:23,900
   

476
00:34:27,215 --> 00:34:29,034
Literary prowess reigns supreme.

477
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:31,020
Share your thoughts on history's gleam.

478
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,900
   

479
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:35,614
Wenzheng Parlor.

480
00:34:35,614 --> 00:34:38,115
Juli, which character do you recognize?

481
00:34:38,115 --> 00:34:39,475
It reminds me of Wenyun Restaurant in Huaizhou.

482
00:34:39,475 --> 00:34:41,614
Their sour fish is the best.

483
00:34:41,614 --> 00:34:43,954
What a foodie. Let's go in.

484
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,650
   

485
00:34:55,315 --> 00:34:57,575
Young Lady, it's crowded here.

486
00:34:57,594 --> 00:34:58,894
Let's go.

487
00:34:59,554 --> 00:35:02,755
In Wenzheng Parlor, they value talents over status.

488
00:35:02,755 --> 00:35:06,075
This place is swarming with talented people from everywhere before and after the metropolitan examination.

489
00:35:06,075 --> 00:35:09,734
Everyone is trying to make a name for themselves in the capital

490
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:11,954
to gain favor from the dignitaries.

491
00:35:11,954 --> 00:35:15,595
The imperial examination highly regards candidates' performance in the exam.

492
00:35:15,595 --> 00:35:19,195
However, their fame of talent is of great help, too.

493
00:35:20,415 --> 00:35:21,715
Look.

494
00:35:24,774 --> 00:35:27,714
Yong Lady, what's he doing?

495
00:35:27,714 --> 00:35:29,534
The question will be revealed soon.

496
00:35:30,915 --> 00:35:33,294
There is a wine jar over there.

497
00:35:33,294 --> 00:35:34,794
That's the question jar.

498
00:35:34,794 --> 00:35:38,914
The owner of Wenzheng Parlor invited the most renowned literary figures in the capital

499
00:35:38,914 --> 00:35:42,854
to anonymously provide questions and they're placed inside this jar.

500
00:35:42,854 --> 00:35:48,715
Every day at this hour, a question will be drawn from the jar for the debate.

501
00:35:48,715 --> 00:35:52,114
The winner can write their name on the literary examination list.

502
00:35:52,114 --> 00:35:53,255
Look up there.

503
00:35:53,255 --> 00:35:57,134
Sheng Jinghong, 5 strokes.

504
00:35:57,134 --> 00:36:00,634
It means he has won five rounds.

505
00:36:00,634 --> 00:36:02,975
Five rounds aren't many, though.

506
00:36:02,975 --> 00:36:05,074
Just one more round than the second.

507
00:36:05,074 --> 00:36:08,514
But he just reached here six days ago.

508
00:36:08,514 --> 00:36:09,734
What?

509
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,815
He's on a winning streak?

510
00:36:11,815 --> 00:36:13,055
Exactly.

511
00:36:13,055 --> 00:36:15,034
Ranging from poetry to principles of philosophy and political strategies.

512
00:36:15,034 --> 00:36:16,495
- He's on a winning streak? 
 - He never lost a round.

513
00:36:16,495 --> 00:36:17,734
- He's amazing. 
 - Rightfully so.

514
00:36:17,734 --> 00:36:21,474
I guess he'll top the rank this year. 
    

515
00:36:28,614 --> 00:36:30,615
Raising tigers is a threat?

516
00:36:30,615 --> 00:36:33,875
 I have no idea at all. 

517
00:36:34,474 --> 00:36:35,874
Let's go.

518
00:36:38,114 --> 00:36:39,774
- Go ahead. 
 - Excuse me.

519
00:36:39,774 --> 00:36:43,114
I'd like to ask if Princess Roujia reserved a table here.

520
00:36:43,114 --> 00:36:44,674
Please tell me your surname.

521
00:36:44,674 --> 00:36:46,654
Surname Mu.

522
00:36:46,654 --> 00:36:47,755
Oh, that's right.

523
00:36:47,755 --> 00:36:50,014
Princess Roujia sent the message over this morning.

524
00:36:50,014 --> 00:36:53,155
But most of the chambers were taken earlier since the metropolitan examination is around the corner.

525
00:36:53,155 --> 00:36:55,935
The storekeeper has reserved a table on the second balcony.

526
00:36:55,935 --> 00:36:58,195
That's good enough.

527
00:36:58,195 --> 00:37:00,234
Ms. Mu, please come with me.

528
00:37:00,234 --> 00:37:01,855
- This way. 
 - Let's go.

529
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:04,454
They've got everything ready. Great.

530
00:37:05,054 --> 00:37:06,275
This way.

531
00:37:06,275 --> 00:37:08,235
- Ms. Mu, this is your table. 
 - Thank you.

532
00:37:08,235 --> 00:37:09,535
Sure.

533
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,760
   

534
00:37:21,514 --> 00:37:23,114
Young Lady.

535
00:37:27,734 --> 00:37:32,034
Young Lady, Princess Roujia is so reliable.

536
00:37:32,034 --> 00:37:33,275
Certainly.

537
00:37:33,275 --> 00:37:35,555
That's why many people revere her.

538
00:37:35,555 --> 00:37:38,755
There's zero negative word of mouth about her in this country.

539
00:37:41,555 --> 00:37:44,335
By the way, Young Lady, you mentioned gaining fame of talent here.

540
00:37:44,335 --> 00:37:46,735
Why are we sitting here?

541
00:37:46,735 --> 00:37:53,034
You see, this question is a dangerous one.

542
00:37:53,955 --> 00:37:57,375
Why is raising a tiger dangerous?

543
00:37:57,375 --> 00:38:01,894
That's the point, the tiger.

544
00:38:10,214 --> 00:38:11,495
Uncle,

545
00:38:11,495 --> 00:38:14,035
why did you put yourself as the topic of the debate?

546
00:38:14,755 --> 00:38:16,155
Why not?

547
00:38:16,935 --> 00:38:18,775
Any problem with that?

548
00:38:19,635 --> 00:38:22,434
I don't like people calling you a tiger.

549
00:38:23,354 --> 00:38:24,935
What should they call me, then?

550
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:26,235
A dog?

551
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:31,214
No, that won't do.

552
00:38:31,214 --> 00:38:34,315
A mighty tiger sounds much better.

553
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:40,354
But those who peg you as a tiger,

554
00:38:40,354 --> 00:38:43,175
why are they so eager to start internal royal strife?

555
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:51,074
Can't we have a common and harmonious family relationship?

556
00:38:53,015 --> 00:38:56,815
 She said the perpetrator must be very familiar with your sickness. 

557
00:38:56,815 --> 00:39:01,395
 There are not many who know your condition well. 

558
00:39:01,395 --> 00:39:02,355
It's hard.

559
00:39:02,355 --> 00:39:04,055
How so?

560
00:39:04,055 --> 00:39:06,035
I treat you wholeheartedly, Uncle.

561
00:39:06,035 --> 00:39:08,315
Have you forgotten about your two brothers?

562
00:39:10,754 --> 00:39:13,334
Let's hear what others say about this.

563
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:14,695
All right.

564
00:39:15,975 --> 00:39:18,934
Raising tigers is a threat.

565
00:39:20,555 --> 00:39:25,615
The point is, who raises the tiger?

566
00:39:27,274 --> 00:39:31,575
His Majesty or the three princes?

567
00:39:32,455 --> 00:39:35,974
This question seems simple, but with a profound meaning behind it.

568
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:40,035
In fact, it's a test for the people.

569
00:39:40,774 --> 00:39:45,314
Young Lady, what has it got to do with His Majesty and the three princes?

570
00:39:45,955 --> 00:39:50,895
Because this tiger is referring to Lord Ding, obviously.

571
00:39:51,855 --> 00:39:53,555
That nefarious demon?

572
00:39:54,415 --> 00:39:58,534
He's a nefarious demon to Northern Liang and the god of war to Southern Chen.

573
00:39:58,534 --> 00:40:00,535
Be that as it may,

574
00:40:00,535 --> 00:40:05,254
some might think his meritorious reputation has surpassed the emperor.

575
00:40:07,235 --> 00:40:09,975
Lord Ding is scary.

576
00:40:09,975 --> 00:40:11,315
He's like a tiger.

577
00:40:11,315 --> 00:40:13,474
And worst, a giant tiger.

578
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:31,080
