How many industries belong to Baxian Residence?

Miss, you can clearly investigate that.

The forces of Qianyue Cave have been gathered half a month earlier.

These are also for the tea houses and hotels.

Surprisingly, it includes banks and escorts.

53
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,420
More than that, it even includes medicine shops, rice shops,

silk shops, carts, and horse shops.

how could you do this?

57
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,550
I've used many tricks to collect these.

58
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,870
Please show us, Miss Feng.

59
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,920
People in the restaurants and tea houses are sophisticated.

60
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,660
They can't deal with the silly, reckless guys.

61
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,610
They cherish their harmony and reputation,

62
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,420
or they won't have customers in the future.

63
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,360
But people from the escorts are totally different.

64
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,270
They can be persuaded by reason but don't bow to force.

65
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,180
Normally, they are tough guys in the martial arts world.

66
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,850
So they can't resist a heartwarming request.

67
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,140
Cosmetic shops are all small business.

68
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,760
As long as you are generous, you can get the account books quite easily.

69
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,840
As for the bank,

70
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,840
it's protected by both the government and local bully.

71
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,520
It's not a place to trifle with.

72
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,710
However if one is just and generous to talk to them about vital interests,

73
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,730
then they willingly cooperate.

74
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,430
In front of the personal charisma of Miss Feng,

75

What are you saying? Weren't you the person who thought of it first?

83
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:41,740
You wanted the account books of all the hotels, which is why there are so many.

I will honor my responsibilities.

These values do not match what we initially thought.

After the auction of the Longevity fruit, Master Shi has earned more than one million.

When you think about it,

95
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,150
Baxian Residence wouldn't have that much money.

Qin Liufeng, please go and find Healer Bu quickly.

99
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,910
Master Bu'er is probably Master Shi.

100
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,740
Are you sure you want to ask his help for Chun Hua?

101
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,260
You still must find the person with the best medical skill.

102

Chun Hua?

103
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,020
Miss Chun Hua is not injured, but poisoned.

104
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,770
Poisoned?

105
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,850
You knew of this.

106
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,810
Did Shangguan Qiu Yue poison you?

107
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,470
Young Chief Master, it is better if we concentrate on how to cure her.

108
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,230
Let's listen to Healer Bu'er.

109
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,600
I'm not afraid of being a fool but the poison in Young Chief Master's wife

110
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
is something that I've never heard of.

111
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,560
I feel guilty for my brother's reputation of Healer.

112
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,370
How about this? Let me get Li Yu to make some medicine.

113
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,180
- Li Yu—
- Hold on.

114
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,940
With such a strong poison, I don't trust Li Yu's experience.

115
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,950
I would like to humbly ask you to do it personally.

116
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,310
Young Chef Master, you are right.

117
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,170
Li Yu is just a naughty child, playing around everyday.

118
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,060
In medicine skills, he really doesn't make any progress.

119
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,130
Then I'll go personally. I'll go personally.

120
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:43,320
Young Chief Master, I have something to tell you.

121
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,240
I met Li Yu today.

122
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,760
He also told me that the person who makes use of a dead body has the surname Zhong.

123
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,440
Zhong?

124
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,360
Baxian Residence doesn't have any person with the surname Zhong.

125
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,160
However, among the people we suspect, there is one related to Zhong.

126
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,600
Zhong?

127
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,240
Bo Zhong Shu? (One, two, three in Chinese.) Bu'er?

128
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,130
I just came to the same conclusion.

129
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:24,000
So if he makes Miss Chun Hua's medicine, it may work.

130
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,110
Miss Chun Hua could get back the Stone Lotus.

131
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,150
It means Shangguan Qiu Yue regarded her with special respect.

132
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,310
If Shangguan Qiu Yue really poisoned her,

133
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,940
then he just wanted to control Chun Hua.

134
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,640
He won't kill her.

135
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,650
As for Bu'er,

136
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,080
if he poisoned the medicine,

137
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:52,650
after we find out the truth, then we can know who Master Shi is!

138
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,460
Young Chief Master,

139
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,660
it's inappropriate to do this, isn't it?

140
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,040
Do not worry! I will definitely save Miss Chun Hua.

141
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,200
I will not let this matter degrade further.

142
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,920
I got it.

143
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,640
Miss Feng and the Young Chief Master really have lots of difficulties to go through.

144
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,270
Qin Liufeng, may we speak?

145
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,080
Qin Liufeng!

146
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,900
I will be back soon.

147
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,800
How long since we last met?

148
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,320
I had almost forgotten you were my cousin.

149
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,330
It's normal to forget.

150
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:08,310
I'm at Qianyue Cave so naturally, I can't contact you.

151
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,860
It was my father's doing.

152
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,060
Every time you were mentioned, he would sigh.

153
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,720
Also, places like Qianyue Cave...

154
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:22,060
If I died along with my parents, then you could gain a reputation of being a hero.

155
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,170
Unfortunately, I let everyone down.

156
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,990
I was saved by Shangguan Qiu Yue.

157

In the whole of martial arts circle, no one believes Shangguan Qiu Yue would save other people.

158
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,100
There is a rumor that you went and sought refuge with him.

159
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,870
That's the reason why you caused a disaster for the entire family to be exterminated.

160
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:44,100
Although my dad knows the truth, the old chief came to talk to him again and again.

161
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,720
He did not allow him to speak the truth.

162
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,700
It has all passed.

163
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,290
Why did you come?

164
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,440
Has Miss Chun Hua been poisoned?

165
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,760
Miss Chun Hua's poison is called Hundred Flower Tribulation.

166
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,020
If she doesn't become emotional, then it won't be activated.

167
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,310
Xiao Yan...

168
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,050
take care of yourself!

169
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,010
I do not believe you.

170
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,560
Miss Leng, she really is my cousin.

171
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,200
I think you just want to be doubly related!

172
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,680
She is Shangguan Qiu Yue's subordinate.

173
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,450
How can we get together?

174
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:02,420
So if she wasn't Shangguan Qiu Yue's subordinate, would there be a possibility?

175
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,590
We grew up together, what are you saying—

176
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,750
I think I overheard you speak of Shangguan Qiu Yue.

177
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:23,970
I was planning to tell you this, Leader Ye of Qianyue Sect is my cousin.

178
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:29,660
So Shangguan Qiu Yue indeed is near.

179
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,650
Miss Chun Hua, it's time to take your medication.

180
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,190
Please take this, Miss Chun Hua.

181
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,810
Hurry!

182
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,820
What is this?

183
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,690
Snow Lotus Seed!

184
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,490
Miss Feng, you are so generous!

185
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,540
This is Snow Lotus Seed.

186
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,840
It can detoxify the normal poison.

187
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,500
My illness is not worth using such a precious ingredient.

188
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,950
Miss Chun Hua, do not speak such nonsense.

189
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,590
If...

190
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,490
If I thought it over at that time,

191
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,080
Miss Caicai, you are a good person.

192
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,280
You fit well with Xiao Bai.

193
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,310
There is no "if" in this world.

194
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:01,120
People decide their own path.

195
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,250
Right now, you should concentrate in healing your body.

196
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,270
Then you can continue with Young Chief Master.

197
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:11,440
I genuinely wish you both well.

198
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,050
Thank you.

[Humanities Propitious Prosperity]

200
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,380
I've never heard of it.

201
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,480
I've never heard of such a thing.

202
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:57,170
Currently, the problem is that Miss Chun Hua's poison has no cure.

203
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,220
It's okay normally, but it will attack if its person becomes enamored.

204
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,650
He said that Miss Chun Hua should have a flower in her palm.

205
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,260
Once it turns black, the poison will turn deadly

206
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,890
and the results will be fatal.

207
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,590
Is there actually such a poison?

208
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,110
Regarding this poison in Miss Chun Hua,

209
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,030
don't let Xiao Bai know about it, okay?

210
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,430
Qin Liufeng?

211
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,480
Shangguan Qiu Yue is the one who most likely poisoned Miss Chun Hua.

212
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,120
I need to find him quickly.

213
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,250
Shangguan Qiu Yue comes and goes as he pleases.

214
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,200
Where do you think we can find him?

215
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,980
The way to find Shangguan Qiu Yue is through Miss Chun Hua.

216
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,520
How so?

217
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,930
In terms of everything else, you know a lot more than me.

218
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:57,230
But regarding Miss Chun Hua, I'm definitely more knowledgeable than you.

219
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:06,430
You are right! Every time Miss Chun Hua is in danger,

220
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:09,230
Shangguan Qiu Yue appears.

221
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,960
Now that Miss Chun Hua won't see Shangguan Qiu Yue, this might turn into a good thing.

222
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:25,170
I do not want Miss Chun Hua to be in between our feud anymore.

223
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,470
I just want her to be safe.

224
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:32,340
Find Shangguan Qiu Yue and force him to cure Chun Hua.

225
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,610
This poison has no cure.

226
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,920
What can we do?

227
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,350
Xiao Chun Hua, are you thinking of me?

228
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,960
Are you insane? Why are you here?

229
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,230
If you can sleep peacefully, that would be great.

230
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,830
Is Xiao Chun Hua worried about me?

231
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,610
But in my mind,

232
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,910
the safest place is wherever Xiao Chun Hua is.

233
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,180
I fear your Hundred Flower Tribulation may break out so I dare not see you.

However, I can't help missing you.

So we have to meet this way.

236

Fengming Mountain Manor is too dangerous. Leave now!

237

The toxicity of Hundred Flower Tribulation is reducing now.

238
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,620
Is it because you don't miss me recently?

239

I dare not.

I didn't know Master was still here.

However, having nerve is not always a bad thing.

Now, Xiao Chun Hua will not think

288
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,200
that I was trying to harm anyone.

289
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,850
Master, everyone from Qianyue Cave has gathered outside Baxian Town.

However, the martial arts circle show a huge power strength.

What we had done, has caught their attention.

It doesn't matter.

293
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,210
Qianyue Cave will want to be in the clear this time around.

294
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,560
We need to let the martial arts circle know

295
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,500
who controls the situation in the pugilist world

296
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,340
and who has let them act freely without hindrance.

297
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,620
What news is there from Fengming Mountain Manor?

298
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,660
They are troubled by clues to Master Shi's identity.

299
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,830
So annoying!

300
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:19,850
Should I personally help them if they are this weak?

301
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:24,170
The day after tomorrow, Bu'er will raise a big uproar to entertain the martial arts circle.

302

By then, if Xiao Bai still hasn't noticed that something is wrong,

303
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,510
I fear that it will affect Miss Chun Hua negatively.

304
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:36,550
It doesn't have a lot of time but many sects still harbor evil intent.

305
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:39,740
So we don't know what trouble will be brewed up.

306
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:45,020
Ye Yan, if we have a battle, you must be prepared first.

307
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,050
If all goes smoothly that day,

308
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:51,760
I will be able to take Xiao Chun Hua back to Qianyue Cave.

309
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,410
Yes.

310
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,220
I just want to beg you, Master,

311
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,880
you should better go to a safer place for the time being.

312
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,290
Safer place?

313
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:08,200
Xiao Chun Hua is nervous about her poison everyday.

314
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,980
It doesn't matter.

315
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,210

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,170
Now, we have two suspects. One is the disciple of Baxian Residence, Li Yu.

319
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:00,130
The other one is his master, Bu'er.

320
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,450
Li Yu is not Master Shi.

321
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,950
Miss Chun Hua, how are you so sure?

322
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,250
However, what you said is logical.

323
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:16,690
Young Master Qin found out that the landlady of the restaurant is the mother of Li Yu.

324
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:20,910
She was pregnant in the brothel before so she got kicked out.

325
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:23,020
The Healer took her in.

326
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:26,110
Li Yu was naughty when he was young. Others deluded him so he became a gambler.

327
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:30,430
It's also the Healer who corrected and got him out from gambling; thus, he became his disciple.

328
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:34,670
I never imagined they have such a sad past.

329
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:40,150
Since it was like this, those two would appreciate the Healer.

330
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,440
If they weren't threatened by others,

331
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,210
they wouldn't do evil with the Healer's skills.

332
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,490
You are right.

333
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,360
Moreover, Li Yu's life currently is also pitiful.

334
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,840
He doesn't show any sign of wanting to get rich.

335
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,460
As for this Bu'er, two years after the Healer died,

336
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,660
his business has spread all over Baxian City.

337
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:04,050
So are you saying that every piece of evidence

338
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:07,060
all points to Master Bu'er?

339
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,710
The most interesting thing is Li Yu surrendered to me yesterday.

340
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,840
Bu'er, Bu'er.

341
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:27,010
We probably need to seriously consider if he is Master Shi.

342
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:31,170
This deduction is very convincing indeed.

343
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,340
However...

344
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,730
Bu'er seems to be very nice.

345
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,510
I really can't believe it.

346
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:42,920
We didn't expect human's greed and darkness would pan out to be like this.

347
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:47,210
It's just that by selling the Longevity fruit, he should have become rich already.

348
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,480
However, after checking the accounts for a long time,

349
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,890
I didn't find any abruptly change.

350
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:56,490
Hence, these can't become evidence.

351
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,760
Greed and stinginess are two sides of one thing.

352
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,690
Bu'er accumulated wealth through unfair means

353
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,510
but that still does not mean he plans to spend all that money.

354
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:15,430
I suspect he might have hidden his wealth somewhere.

355
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:18,790
This is his seized fortune after all. Yes!

356
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:21,750
Furthermore, the place he hid it

357
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:25,840
must be somewhere that he can reach easily and get to quickly,

358
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,810
then he could feel at ease.

359
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:33,810
Miss Chun Hua, do you mean that his precious fortune

360
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,130
is hidden in the Baxian Residence?

361
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:41,530
I think a person like Bu'er would definitely believe

362
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:46,190
that the more public a place is, indeed the safer it is.

363
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,130
What you said makes sense.

364
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:09,750
Then, Miss Chun Hua, why don't you stay and rest here?

365
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,070
[Baxian Residence]

366
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,360
Baxian Residence is not big.

367
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,510
It should be easy to find these stolen treasures.

368
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,100
I even searched the aisles.

369
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,980
The inside is empty and there is no space to store things.

370
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,440
This is where the problem lies.

371
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,930
We spent so many hours but there is no clue at all.

372
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:57,000
That's right, Miss Feng! Why didn't Young Chief Master come with you?

373
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,880
He is still troubled by Miss Chun Hua's poison.

374
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,750
All day, he is racking his brain for answers.

375
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,970
However, Miss Chun Hua and Shangguan Qiu Yue clearly have—

376
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,220
Young Chief Master likes Miss Chun Hua.

377
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:10,060
Miss Chun Hua is coincidentally here.

378
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,570
We shouldn't rain on his parade (spoil his joy).

379
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:16,140
Besides, I predict that

380
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,980
the bird I saw yesterday was indeed Shangguan Qiu Yue's.

381
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,630
How do you know?

382
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,660
The mark I saw on Miss Chun Hua's palm today

383
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,200
is deeper in color now.

384
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,220
We cannot continue like this anymore.

385
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,860
Shangguan Qiu Yue cannot be by Miss Chun Hua's side for much longer.

386
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:38,190
No good will come from this for Chun Hua or the Young Chief Master.

387
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:42,300
Maybe it will even cause more trouble.

388
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:47,060
Miss Feng, we meet again!

389
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:03,150
This Li Yu seems to have fallen for our Caicai.

390
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:06,350
This brat really has some guts.

391
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,280
However...

392
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,160
You still have me and I have you.

393
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:32,560
Did you look for me for something earlier?

394
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,140
You came at the right time as I have some questions for you.

395
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,670
I will answer without reserve.

396
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,460
You has come to Baxian Residence for over a year.

397
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:46,100
Do you know where to store goods here?

398
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:53,130
Although I was manipulated and instructed by Master Bu'er,

399
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,490
he has always been cautious.

400
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:58,970
He just forced me to do some menial, dirty work.

401
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:01,460
He keeps everything else private.

402
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,700
This kind of person worships money like his life.

403
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,370
There's no way he'd willingly give away his precious things to another person.

404
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:11,940
It might also be true! If he told you, it's likely you'd have run away with the money.

405
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,920
If that is the case,

406
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,260
then would I lose the chance to get to know Miss Feng?

407
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,950
Do you know what quirks Master Bu'er has?

408
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,640
He doesn't like the company of women.

409
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,530
He does not like alcohol.

410
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:39,150
He wakes up earlier than anyone but goes to sleep later than most.

411
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:42,590
To an outsider, compared to those respectable lords,

412
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,840
he is even more self-disciplined.

413
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:50,000
However, if you ask me about his specific quirks,

414
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,610
there still is something.

415
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:54,770
Tell me quickly!

416
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,990
Bu'er has a very interesting habit.

417
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:02,260
He likes to sweep this hallway himself.

418
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:05,090
He does it three times a day at least.

419
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:07,230
I do not know if it is just a habit,

420
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:10,370
or he is unwilling to spend money to hire people.

421
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,580
- Sweep the common hallway?
- Yes.

422
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,750
This has nothing to do with his money nor treasure.

423
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,510
Are you looking for me?

424
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:40,900
A brother who wears white,

425
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,060
told me to find the laziest young miss in this village.

426
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:48,660
All the female villagers told me that it's you.

427
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:54,680
- What did you need me for?
- Give me my money!

428
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,650
He drew me this flower

429
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:00,110
and said you would give me money if you saw this flower.

430
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,040
What else did this uncle say?

431
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,720
That brother is still very young, how can you call him uncle?

432
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,400
He only said two words, "Chun Hua."

433
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:32,600
Go back and tell him that Chun Hua is not coming today.

434
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,890
I will give you twice as much money.

435
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:39,080
Brother told me not to be greedy.

436
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:49,310
Shangguan Qiu Yue,

437
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:52,630
don't you know that the situation is very dangerous right now?

472
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,210
♫  For you, I pieced together the predetermined storyline  ♫

473
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:42,020
♫  That passing moment that we missed  ♫

474
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:47,380
♫  Yet this insatiable longing seems like it will go on for years  ♫

475
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:51,670
♫  The falling snow and blossoming flowers carpeted the ground  ♫

476
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:54,970
♫  I left behind distinct traces from loving you  ♫

477
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:59,820
♫  The brightness of the moon changes as the years press on  ♫

478
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:07,150
♫  Yet how can you still not see it?  ♫
