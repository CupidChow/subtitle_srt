[Love Better Than Immortality]

31
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,380
When will the spring flower and autumn moon end?

32
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,620
Today is the distinguished gathering for our martial arts circle of the Right Path but this girl let her tongue wag too freely.

33
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,810
Is it possible that she's an enchantress of a demon sect?

34
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,260
Miss is not at fault. Were it not for the havoc stirred up by the Demon Sect,

35
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,010
how could the martial arts circle be in such a state of anxiety?

36
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,390
As a righteous sect of the martial arts circle, we do things fairly.

37
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,020
We shouldn't suspect anyone without good reason.

38
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,300
Brother Xiao is not blaming Miss Chun Hua.

39
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,660
However, if you intentionally fool him,

40
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,710
Brother Xiao's will become suspicious.

41
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,190
By then, your Xiao Bai will be quickly stolen by others.

42
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,900
Just don't blame me for not warning you.

43

[Episode 7]

44
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,450
Feng Caicai, Feng Caicai!

45
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,980
To think that you would go as far as to use such a dirty,

46
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,680
underhand, and shameless method.

47
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,330
What exactly do you want to do?

48
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,990
Implementing moral governance for the good of people and thoroughly exterminating evil.

49
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,350
- What did you say?
- I am doing my duty as someone who’s righteous.

50
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,780
Feng Caicai! Feng Caicai, you—

51
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,700
Good!

52
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,770
Daughter, you can indeed undertake a task alone now.

53
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,700
Father, you flatter me. I still have to interrogate her.

54
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,840
You should stay out of it.

55
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,230
- But there isn’t enough evidences, Father.
- Wait a minute. Where are we going?

56
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,890
No! Where are we going? Feng Caicai?

57
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,930
Feng Caicai!

58
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,560
I say, aren't you—

59
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,090
All of you, listen up! The person I’m meeting this time

60
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,070
is the Demon Sect, Chuanqi Sect’s Fu Lou.

61
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,160
You don't need to know the reason.

62
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,550
- Understand?
- Yes.

63
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,180
- Watch this young enchantress carefully!
- Yes.

64
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,680
Let's go!

65
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,440
Older Brother, what are you guys trying to do?

66
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,100
Our Chief Feng said that he would give you to me

67
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,170
to be my concubine.

68
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,650
I...

69
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,380
You even dare marry me? Do you know who I am?

70
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,390
Do you know who my older brother is?

71
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,350
My older brother...

72
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,400
is Shangguan Qiu Yue.

73
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,890
I'm telling you, if my brother finds out about this,

74
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:01,320
he will definitely kill all of you.

75
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,620
You dare glare at me? Glare again!

76
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,800
I'm telling you! My brother likes gouging people's eyes.

77
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,800
He'll surely gouge your eyes out and play ball with them.

78
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,420
Okay, I get it! Let's go.

79
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,050
You even dare carry me like this?

80
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,990
I'm telling you, if my older brother finds out,

81
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:24,130
he'll certainly chop off your hands.

82
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,920
Gorge Master Fu!

83
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,190
Gorge Master Fu,

84
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,490
I have fulfilled my promise.

85
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,170
Gorge Master, please keep yours.

86
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,490
Sure enough, Chief Feng do things resolutely and swiftly.

87
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:07,140
If you are such a capable person, how can I let you go that easily.

88
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,780
In the future, if I have anything,

89
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,500
I must ask Chief Feng for help.

90
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,800
I brought the person.

91
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,610
Gorge Master, you shouldn't break your promise.

92
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,300
Who gave you the guts to speak like that to me?

93
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,760
Gorge Master Fu, if you don't keep your promise,

94
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,980
I'd rather kill this girl

95
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,330
and never hand her over to you.

96
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,030
I knew it was you from the get-go.

97
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,790
Then that's just boring.

98
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,950
Older Brother!

99
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,870
Xiao Chun Hua is going to get me killed.

100
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,780
Older Brother!

101
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,990
Shangguan Qiu Yue actually has a younger sister.

102
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:41,840
I didn't expect that you are Shangguan Qiu Yue's younger sister.

103
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,930
I didn't expect it, either.

104
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:52,610
But... But... I am indeed a treasured girl.

105
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:58,760
Please be magnanimous and don’t stoop down to my level.

106
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,710
Friend, which sect are you from?

107
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:15,800
Why have you followed me this entire way and still don't show yourself.

108
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,220
Xisha Sect, Feng Caicai.

109
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,550
Miss Caicai.

110
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,920
Since you came yourself,

111
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,810
- Go quickly.
- then I will do the honors

112
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,720
to keep you at the gorge as a guest.

113
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,970
Miss Chun Hua and Miss Feng left together?

114
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:55,000
Impossible! Miss Chun Hua is hostile to Miss Feng.

115
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,400
You know her very well?

116
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:02,710
I don't dare. Young Master certainly knows Miss Chun Hua the best.

117
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:07,280
Also, even the scar on her chest, Young Master...

118
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,130
Don't talk nonsense!

119
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:16,260
As young master's wife, she must be generous and tolerant.

120
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,800
But outside the door, I heard the voice imitation technique.

121
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,680
When I opened the door, I found only Miss Chun Hua. How to explain this?

122
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,050
Young Master, you only hear what you want to hear.

123
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,920
Perhaps Miss Feng dropped in and wanted to have a chat with Miss Chun Hua?

124
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,190
However, we still should think about some countermeasures.

125
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:39,000
Is it regarding Young Master's future wife?

126
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,400
- Have you tracked down Shangguan Qiu Yue yet?
- My weak kung fu is too inferior to his.

127
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,600
So I couldn't keep up with him.

128
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,460
Chuanqi Gorge.

129
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,960
You, good-for-nothing! There's no use in keeping you around.

130
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,410
I even have to kill you.

131
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,570
You want to run?

132
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,360
You are Shangguan Qiu Yue's younger sister

133
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,100
and even have an unclear relationship with Xiao Bai.

134
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,010
Interesting!

135
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,360
What kind of relationship do you have with Xiao Bai?

136
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,200
I'm... I'm his relative.

137
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,400
Relative?

138
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,370
Xiao Bai really attaches great importance to a relative of unknown origins.

139
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,910
He even told the healer to give you the Longevity Fruit.

140
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:18,060
I... I'm his wife.

141
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:30,050
His... his future wife.

142
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:33,310
We have had an agreement.

143
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:36,890
Because he saved me, I pledged to marry him.

144
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,690
It wasn't your older brother who saved you?

145
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,740
What kind of relationship do you have with Fu Lou?

146
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,300
If you have nothing to do with him, then why did he save you?

147
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,580
You're the one who saved me.

148
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:56,300
My Older brother wouldn't allow me to marry Xiao Bai, so he left me.

149
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,880
Surely you don't want me to pledge to marry you, too?

150
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,930
You have proven yourself to be someone who has eaten the Longevity Fruit.

151
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,840
You have truly dragged so many people into this.

152
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,790
Make proper arrangements.

153
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,020
Do not neglect our distinguished guest.

154
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,870
Yes.

155
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,420
Then, how about that one?

156
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,480
Useless! Just kill her.

157
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,070
Don't!

158
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,010
If you want to kill her, then just kill me first.

159
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,420
Gorge Master, your wife wants to see you.

160
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,600
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

161
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,190
Keep her alive, for now.

162
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,790
I am really a saint.

163
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:08,140
you are not only my rival in love but you are also doubting me in all respects.

164
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,990
But I just cannot bear to see you harmed.

165
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,800
What do I do? Who will come to save us?

166
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:20,790
Last night, the wind blew and lots of the forget-me-nots fell off.

167
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,070
I told Yanhong to gather some and bring them back.

168
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:28,820
I made some nail polish because I think it's pretty,

169
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,900
so I called you here to take a look.

170
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,900
Where is the rest? I'll apply some for you.

171
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,570
Xiao Chun Hua, how can you be so careless?

172
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,280
Why did you leave me behind?

173
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,100
You called me 'Older Brother' in front of Fu Lou.

174
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,500
Of course, you're my brother.

175
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,380
Foolish Little Sister!

176
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,340
If he were to know that, he would certainly take advantage of you to deal with me.

177
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,600
So, of course, I could not let him know how important you are in my heart.

178
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,090
I just considered it for your safety.

179
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,700
My hand is already broken.

180
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,230
Let me take a look.

181
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,550
Hurts! It hurts.

182
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,370
Silly Sister, it's not broken but dislocated.

183
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,240
I'll treat you.

184
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,210
Initially, you left me behind

185
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:25,630
and now, you're using this method to buy me over.

186
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,540
Then, Xiao Chun Hua, what do you want from me?

187
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,670
After I'm better, I'm going to act frivolously with you.

188
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:36,020
There's no need for that long, you can do it now.

189
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,770
See! I not only acted frivolously with you,

190
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,070
but I could also treat your wound as well.

191
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:39,810
You... just now...

192
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,420
What were you doing?

193
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,870
Xiao Chun Hua, didn't you ask me to act frivolously with you?

194
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,190
I was afraid again that you would shout or make a sound to attract others.

195
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,010
Unfortunately, both of my hands are not free

196
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:54,730
so I could only treat your wound with this method.

197
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,480
I'm your older brother, what are you afraid of?

198
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:08,300
Xiao Chun Hua, did Xiao Bai act frivolously with you?

199
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,920
- You—
- Oh, right!

200
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,870
He is a decent person and a man of integrity.

201
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,130
Naturally, he wouldn't be like this with you.

202
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,660
I should ask, have you acted frivolously with Xiao Bai?

203
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:30,360
Fu Lou thought that Xiao Bai, for my sake,

204
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,650
begged for the Longevity Fruit from the healer.

205
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,580
If he thinks like this, that's also good.

206
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,580
What "good" is it?

207
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,740
All right, I'll be going now. Be a good girl, Younger Sister.

208
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,610
No, no, no!

209
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,300
Aren't you taking me along?

210
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,970
What kind of place do you think this is?

211
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:55,740
The outside is closely guarded so how could I get a person out of this gorge?

212
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,780
So you're going to leave me behind again?

213
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,400
How could I leave you behind?

214
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,580
It's not too difficult if you want to get out of here.

215
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,200
Come! I will tell you a way.

216
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,360
Go to the flower garden and look for Fu Lou’s wife.

217
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,680
She will definitely save you.

218
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,840
- Really?
- When have I lied to you?

219
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,710
Oh right! Can you quickly...

220
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,570
Isn't this so beautiful?

221
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,400
Sure enough! the most beautiful person needs to live in the most beautiful place.

222
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,870
Save me!

223
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,660
Madam, save me! Hurry!

224
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,930
Miss, are you all right?

225
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,330
No wonder Fu Lou married his teacher’s wife by force.

226
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,600
The most beautiful woman in the world.

227
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,180
Sure enough! She lives up to her reputation.

228
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,260
You are…?

229
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,060
- I am–
- My Lady, she is the Gorge Master’s guest.

230
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,970
She is unaware of the customs and crashed into you. I will take her away now.

231
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,940
He wants to kill me.

232
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:08,630
Miss, don’t be afraid! He won’t dare to kill anyone.

233
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,230
But Fu Lou wants to kill people.

234
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,590
I was fortunate enough to be able to escape.

235
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,990
My husband won’t kill anyone.

236
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,850
Then why did he capture us for?

237
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,780
My Lady, don’t listen to her nonsense.

238
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,770
The friend of this girl is constantly causing trouble for Chuanqi Sect.

239
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:30,280
Gorge Master is simply inviting them over as guests to chat with them.

240
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,670
I knew it! My husband is a good person.

241
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:39,700
He’s not speaking the truth. It wasn't like that.

242
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,600
Madam, my friend is also a weak lady.

243
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,110
She is currently locked in the dungeon, close to dying.

244
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:50,230
I heard that Gorge Master Fu had committed the serious crime

245
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:53,890
of killing his teacher to marry you and even kept you trapped in this place.

246
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:58,560
Let alone the fact that you don’t hate him, but how can you say that he’s a good person?

247
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,480
It’s not his fault.

248
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,230
He’s a good person.

249
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,700
He isn't in the wrong.

250
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,220
- Madam, you–
- Scoundrel!

251
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,890
Wait!

252
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,380
Let her go! About that lady in the dungeon,

253
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,380
let go of her also.

254
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,450
Madam, I misspoke.

255
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,830
Gorge Master Fu is a good person.

256
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:39,180
It was just a misunderstanding earlier. Don’t take it to heart!

257
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,860
However, Madam, we can only look for you to rescue us now.

258
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,550
Let’s do this.

259
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:55,100
Prepare a carriage for these two ladies to send them off.

260
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,750
My Lady, should we wait for Gorge Master to come back?

261
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,820
It is not logical of us to force the guests to stay.

262
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,180
Madam, the scenery here is really great.

263
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:14,840
I presume that it’s even better outside the gorge so why don't you go out with us and have a look?

264
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:19,040
While you’re there, you can also send us off, lest they don’t let us go.

265
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,550
Besides, this is my first time at Chuanqi Gorge.

266
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:26,320
I even would like to get to know you better.

267
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,820
I promised my husband before that I won’t leave this place.

268
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,530
Then…

269
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,650
Then you can just send us to the carriage.

270
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,970
All right.

271
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,510
That is inappropriate.

272
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,410
I am just sending them to the carriage,

273
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,280
and not outside of the gorge.

274
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,570
That is already very impolite of me.

275
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,290
Then I will excuse myself.

276
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:06,500
When my husband returns, I will definitely talk with him.

277
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,650
Miss, what’s your name?

278
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,530
I’m Chun Hua. Madam, what’s yours?

279
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,100
Chun Hua?

280
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,000
- I’m You Si.
- Madam You Si.

281
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:23,210
Gorge Master Fu indeed treats you really well.

282
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,830
My husband treats me very well.

283
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,030
This time, both of you, ladies, have been frightened.

284
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,200
Please don’t blame him!

285
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,630
- My Lady, we should–
- Si Si.

286
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:44,050
Husband, I am just sending these two ladies off.

287
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,770
How could you force your guests to stay?

288
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,920
I originally wanted to send them off.

289
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,470
However, one of them had accidentally injured herself,

290
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,410
so I kept them to allow her to recuperate.

291
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:01,230
That’s good! I even thought that you were trying to make things difficult for them.

292
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,330
That’s what happened! Gorge Master Fu is a very nice person.

293
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:10,710
How could he make things difficult for us? Right! That could never happen.

294
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:19,680
Then… we can take our leave first, can't we?

295
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:26,000
It’s so cold, yet you came out.

296
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,780
Be careful! Don’t catch a cold. Go back in then.

297
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:36,690
Husband, don’t you be angry! I’ll go back in a minute.

298
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,950
This horse doesn’t seem easy to rein.

299
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:41,550
Why don't you send them back?

300
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:45,320
No need, no need! We can go back on our own.

301
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,640
- Don’t worry! They can go back on their own.
- You must be joking.

302
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,490
If your husband sends us back, we’d be done for.

303
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,620
Horse! Horse, why are you not moving?

304
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,350
Quickly move!

305
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:06,430
Quickly move. Go! Go!

306
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:12,190
Miss Feng. Miss Feng!

307
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,330
What should I do now?

308
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:38,500
Why are you squatting on the ground?

309
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,450
Older Brother, this horse refuses to move and Miss Feng is unconscious.

310
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,440
I really don’t know what to do.

311
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,680
What are you afraid of? Aren’t you alive and well?

312
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,610
Older Brother, I beg you! Please save her.

313
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:57,410
She had previously plotted against you but you still want me to save her?

314
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,910
But if she’s not saved soon, she will lose her life.

315
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,730
Then just let her die! Accompanying me is more important.

316
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,210
Let’s go! I’ll take you for a stroll.

317
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:07,830
I’m not going! If you want to go, you go yourself.

318
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,910
In any case, I have to save her.

319
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:17,770
Miss Caicai. Miss Caicai.

320
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,400
Miss Caicai, please wake up.

321
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,300
Miss Caicai.

322
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:37,330
Older Brother, I beg you! Please save her.

323
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,910
Could it be that you did something to her?

324
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:47,780
What are you thinking of? She suffered from Fu Lou’s blow originally, and thus, will not be able to live long.

325
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:50,350
You don't need to bother about her and I won’t need to do anything to her, either.

326
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,800
Older Brother!

327
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,420
As a matter of fact, I still need to thank Xiao Chun Hua.

328
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:59,200
Otherwise, I won’t even know that Fu Lou has such a kindhearted wife.

329
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:04,340
That's true! Lady You Si is beautiful and warmhearted,

330
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,900
but unfortunately, she is in poor health.

331
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:12,170
If such a frail lady is lost in some unknown place.

332
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:15,830
I think Gorge Master Fu will be so vexed.

333
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:24,720
Xiao Chun Hua, you shouldn't relay Lady You Si's matter to anyone.

334
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:29,820
Just like how you don't want anyone to know that I am your younger sister, right?

335
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,500
I just want to protect you better.

336
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,170
Older Brother.

337
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:45,240
Why does your body feel so cold every time I touch you?

338
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,970
It's because I grew up on ice.

339
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:51,650
Then am I the same when I was a child?

340
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:54,500
Not really! I held you in my arms when you grow up.

341
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,150
Then, what about our mother?

342
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,760
She's dead!

343
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,600
She died because of Fengming Mountain Manor's people.

344
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,080
Before she passed away, she called out both of our names.

345
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,720
She wants us to avenge her.

346
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,710
Really?

347
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:27,190
When will spring flowers and the autumn moon end?

348
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:31,850
Now, you should probably know the reason why I want the Xiao family's Xing Fa.

349
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:53,010
Let her take this pill and then after an hour, she should be fine.

350
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,250
Thank you for saving me.

351
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,400
Of course, you should thank me.

352
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,950
In Chuanqi Gorge, I competed with Fu Lou in wit and bravery.

353
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:26,700
It's not easy for us to escape but you still need to apology to me.

354
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:31,090
If you and your dad hadn't kidnapped me, none of this would've happened.

355
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:37,070
I was wrong in this matter.

356
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:42,090
- But...
- Forget it, forget it! All because I'm beautiful and kind, I won't argue with you.

357
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,980
Moreover, I don't want Xiao Bai to worry about me.

358
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,540
Miss Chun Hua, these are two separate matters.

359
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,640
Today's matter is rather suspicious.

360
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,490
- How could you—
- Your father and Fu Lou's relationship is the most suspicious.

361
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:55,390
Your father wanted to kill me to start with.

362
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:58,430
Now, he even wants to sent me to Fu Lou.

363
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:01,280
Tell me, why would he do this?

364
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,250
This matter I will definitely ask my father for a clear answer.

365
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:10,780
If father is really colluding with the Chuanqi Sect, I won't practice favoritism.

366
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:14,510
However, this matter will require solid evidence.

367
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,750
If not...

368
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:22,960
If not, I will think you are intentionally creating discord between me and Xiao Bai.

369
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:36,620
Miss Feng, Miss Chun Hua, it's good to see both of you come back safe and sound.

370
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,570
By the way, where did both of you go?

371
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,140
Miss Feng and I had a bit of a misunderstanding.

372
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,230
So we went out for a walk.

373
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:49,370
We walked and talked, and lost track of time.

374
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:52,410
However, we've cleared the misunderstanding.

375
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,880
- Is that right, Miss Caicai?
- But I am still suspicious of Miss Chun Hua's identity.

376
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,150
- Young Master.
- How could you still...

377
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,430
Miss Chun Hua has a lively personality.

378
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:12,830
The voice imitation technique, I think she was joking around while drunk.

379
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,720
I heard wrong.

380
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:18,570
Its all good now that the misunderstanding is cleared.

381
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:21,380
Sorry that we've made you worried all day.

382
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,610
If there is any misunderstanding, it's good to talk it out.

383
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,220
Xiao Bai.

384
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,910
