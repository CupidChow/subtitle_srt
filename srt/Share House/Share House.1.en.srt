1
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,660
Welcome~

2
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,620
You're the new guy moving in right?

3
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,860
Yeah that's me hi.

4
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,420
Here let me grab that.

5
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,060
Thanks.

6
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,060
Hi there.

7
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,100
Where did you come from?

8
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,220
Cheonan

9
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,500
Lived there my whole life.

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,060
Must have been a long ride.

11
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,540
Did you take the subway here?

12
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,860
Yeah kinda.

13
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,820
I grabbed a cab from the station.

14
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,100
So it was pretty quick.

15
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,300
These guys are the roommates you'll be living with.

16
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,580
Nice to meet you.

17
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,460
You know we've got a double room and a triple room right?

18
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:06,980
Yeah sure.

19
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,340
I signed up for the double room.

20
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:08,940
Got it.

21
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,380
That one's the double.

22
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,820
And that one's the triple.

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,860
And this is the kitchen.

24
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,420
We've got the basics like the rice cooker and all.

25
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,260
But you know guys living together,

26
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,380
We mostly order out.

27
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,500
We mostly just for instant rice.

28
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,860
Right...

29
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,740
The rent's due every month.

30
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,060
Same day you moved in.

31
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,140
We collect utilities on the 10th each month.

32
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,580
Trash and recycling.

33
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,020
Over there if you take a look.

34
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,580
Why so late?

35
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,500
We were introducing ourselves.

36
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,500
This is your roommate for the double room.

37
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,140
Hey.

38
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,500
Need a hand?

39
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,700
It's okay.

40
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,620
I'm almost done.

41
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,020
How old are you?

42
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,060
Twenty-six.

43
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,020
So you're older.

44
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,140
You can drop the formal stuff.

45
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,380
We're gonna be living together anyway.

46
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,980
Uh... sure.

47
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,340
You too.

48
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,220
Yeah.

49
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,580
What's your name?

50
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,660
Nam Yoon Su.

51
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,580
You?

52
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,860
Ha Jin.

53
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,500
Ha is my family name and Jin's my given name.

54
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,300
Pretty name.

55
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,900
Thanks.

56
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,380
Dinner's ready!

57
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,540
Come on out.

58
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,180
Yeah coming.

59
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,580
You must be hungry right?

60
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,780
Let's eat first.

61
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,700
What are you so focused on/

62
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,420
Huh?

63
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,860
Oh just a drama!

64
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,380
Yeah?

65
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,020
Which one?

66
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,500
Uh... nothing special.

67
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,460
I think I'll crash first.

68
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,900
Already?

69
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,460
I'm home~

70
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,020
Everyone out?

71
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,820
What are you looking at?

72
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,980
Shit!

73
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,060
That...

74
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,940
Work stuff.

75
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,340
Just analyzing something.

76
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,940
Oh yeah?

77
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,980
Actually,

78
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,020
I've got a meeting soon.

79
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,300
Ah fuck.

80
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,020
He definitely saw.

81
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,060
I'm so screwed.

82
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,700
How am I supposed to go back in there.

83
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,540
Wait, no.

84
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,940
Maybe he didn't see it clearly.

85
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,220
He waled in...

86
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,740
and I shut my laptop.

87
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,820
No, he saw everything.

88
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,860
All of it.

89
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,100
I'm doomed.

90
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,540
He saw right?

91
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,740
Of course he did.

92
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,660
He totally did.

93
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:40,620
Text Message: Hey Yoon Su where are you?

94
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,380
Shit!

95
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,980
Yoon Su you're so late.

96
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,620
We've been waiting forever.

97
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,140
Sorry things piled up and I had to work late.

98
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,780
How was the meeting?

99
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,100
Huh?

100
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,660
Come in already the food's getting cold.

101
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,140
Hurry up hurry up.

102
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,020
You must be starving.

103
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,780
Cheers~

104
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,980

108
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,100
I washed mine today.

109
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,500
Please you overslept and skipped it again.

110
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,220

Not me though.

120
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,140
Liar.

121
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,020
Never once in your room really?

122
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,460
At least not in the shared room.

123
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,060
Wait do you seriously do that in here?

124
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,780
No.

125
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,700
Hello?

126
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,260
I've seen enough to know.

127
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,620

128
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:16,980
Okay whatever!

129
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,660
Let's do the thing already.

130
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,980
That?

131
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,220
Time flies huh?

132
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,820
The... the thing?

133
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,020
House rule exclusive to us.

134
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,340
We play a game every month.

135
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,820
The bottom two

136
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,300
have to go on a date together on the weekend

137
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,100
and come back with proof pics.

138
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,940
It's just to get closer.

139
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,260
No pressure okay?

140
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,180
So the game is...

141
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,220
Simple one this month rock paper scissors!

142
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:49,780
Rock paper scissors!

143
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,380
Oh yes.

144
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,180
Yoon Su's last.

145
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,980
Congrats Yoon Su!

146
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,460
One more loser to go.

147
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,580
Rock paper scissors or you lose!

148
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,180
All right!!

149
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,460
Oh come on.

150
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,020
- I already have a date! - As long as it's not Jin!

151
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,020
No way... Is this going to be picked?

152
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,140
Rock paper scissors or you lose!

153
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:08,980
Yes.

154
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,740
Hs Jin is in!

155
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,580
Well well look at the roommates pairing up.

156
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,580
Enjoy some cozy alone time this weekend.

157
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,420
Real cozy.

158
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,180
Didn't expect that.

159
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,540
Since it's happening anyway.

160
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,860
Let's have fun yeah?

161
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,220
Yeah sure.

162
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,860
So... anything you wanna do?

163
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,860
Somewhere you wanna go?

164
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,340
Hmm not sure.

165
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,380
I'll have to think about it.

166
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,540
You?

167
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,140
Plenty of things I wanna do with you.

168
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,860
Huh?

169
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,700
Is he... on purpose?
