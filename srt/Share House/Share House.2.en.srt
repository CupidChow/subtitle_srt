1
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,100
Rock paper scissors or you lose!

2
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,620
Hs Jin is in!

3
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,700
Wait... did he just lose on purpose...?

4
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,340
So... anything you wanna do?

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,700
Somewhere you wanna go?

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,340
Hmm not sure.

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,500
You?

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,540
Plenty of things I wanna do with you.

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,020
Huh?

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,460
Damn it... what's with him making me all nervous like that...

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,580
Now that I think about it, don't you have a girlfriend?

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
There's this coworker of mine.

13
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,780
She's a girl obviously.

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,300
Really pretty and super friendly

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,500
Kinda caught my eye.

16
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,340
But everyone seems to like her.

17
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,180
She's pretty popular you know.

18
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,020
So uh...

19
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,380
Not sure how to get closer to her.

20
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,140
Hmm~

21
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,620
Why isn't he saying anything... I'm dying here.

22
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,580
Hey! That video you watched before.

23
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,820
What was it called again?

24
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,260
Why're you asking all of a sudden?

25
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,900
Just curious.

26
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,660
You seemed really into it that day.

27
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,780
I wasn't into it okay.

28
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,420
You're really bad at hiding things.

29
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,540
It's fine to like that kind of stuff.

30
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,500
Nothing worong with it right?

31
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,100
You could just own it you know.

32
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,060
Hey.

33
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,460
You know why this share house splits guys and girls right?

34
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,180
Why bring that up?

35
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,340
To keep anything messy from happening.

36
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,460
They made that rule for a reason.

37
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,820
But if everyone found out

38
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,380
that you were into guys,

39
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,180
you'd probably get kicked out wouldn't you?

40
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,940
You gonna tell them?

41
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,100
Should I not?

42
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,740
Please don't.

43
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,780
Alright.

44
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,060
Really?

45
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,900
On one condition.

46
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,900
From now on you do what I say.

47
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,420
What's that supposed to mean?

48
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,260
It means exactly what if sounds like.

49
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,220
You don't want to?

50
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,500
If you do, say it now.

51
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,220
No.

52
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,620
I'll do it whatever you say.

53
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,820
You promise?

54
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,980
Then first.

55
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,180
Why're we here...

56
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,500
Did you forget our punishment?

57
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,700
We have to go on a date and take a photo together.

58
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,660
We still need proof, right?

59
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,700
Stand over here.

60
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,700
Got it.

61
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,460
Not bad.

62
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,900
Let's take a few more and pick the best one.

63
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,700
Look this way.

64
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,620
You're not actually...

65
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,340
showing them to the others right?

66
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,260
Should I?

67
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,620
Pretty sure one of them caught you... getting a little excited.

68
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,700
I won't.

69
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,300
but what?

70
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,620
Didn't you say you'd listen to me?

71
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,940
All I hear are excuses.

72
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,460
Guess I'll have to teach you huh?

73
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,420
No it's not like that I just...

74
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,980
Relax I'm kidding.

75
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,580
As long as you do what I say,

76
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,780
I won't mess with you too much.

77
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,420
Cheers?

78
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,660
What are you doing right now?

79
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,060
Didn't you say you'd do what I say?

80
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,420
Oh you're back.

81
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,620
What've you two been up to?

82
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,420
Getting along better now?

83
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,860
Oh yeah we did plenty.

84
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,060
Spent the whole day together right?

85
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,940
Uh well...

86
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,820
So?

87
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,460
Did you take proof pics?

88
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,260
Proof pics?

89
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,300
We got some amazing ones, hang on.

90
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:11,820
Seriously?

91
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,460
Didn't you say we'd show them as soon as we got home?

92
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,180
What's wrong with him?

93
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,500
What proof?

94
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,860
I'd say!

95
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,060
Why do you keep putting me in a corner?

96
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,700
So you don't like me?

97
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,740
What?

98
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,700
You like me don't you?

99
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,220
You react to every little thing I do.

100
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,340
I touch you once and you tense right up.

101
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,380
Am I wrong?

102
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,740
What... are you talking about?

103
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,420
That's not it.

104
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,020
You were like that all day today.

105
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,980
I could feel how worked up you were.

106
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,300
That's cause you kept messing with me.

107
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,100
You kept touching me over and over.

108
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,620
Oh really?

109
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,340
Okay then.

110
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,420
See?

111
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,620
There you go again.

112
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,220
What?

113
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,740
You just looked at my body.

114
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,100
What were you picturing huh?

115
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,100
What...

116
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,820
Get off

117
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,260
I'm going to bed...

118
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,740
Look.

119
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,100
I didn't even touch you this time.

120
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,020
So why are you getting all worked up again?

121
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,980
What are you talking about?

122
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,100
You never admit how you really feel.

123
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,380
You like guys don't you?

124
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,340
Yeah, fine, you're right! I do!

125
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,780
It's easy for you to talk when it's not your life.

126
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,660
How am I supposed to say that out loud like it's nothing?

127
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,300
Why do you have to hide who you are?

128
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,580
You think it's that simple.

129
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,860
You wanna see what it means
to be honest with your feelings?

130
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,060
I like you.

131
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,700
From the moment I saw you,

132
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,020
I thought you were kinda cute.

133
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,780
And the more time we spent together the more I liked you.

134
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,860
Half the time I just wanted to kiss you.

135
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,980
And right now I wanna do a lot more than that.

136
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,540
You're joking... right?

137
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,860
Does this look like a joke to you?

138
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,620
No.

139
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,700
What about you?

140
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,340
I wanna know what you're really feeling.

141
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,300
I...
