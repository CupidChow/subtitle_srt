1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,420
This show's pretty good huh.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,460
First time watching it.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,740
Didn't you already see this one?

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,740
No I just saved it to watch later.

5
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,380
Here try this too.

6
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,820
How is it?

7
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,420
Good right?

8
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,340
Yeah it's good.

9
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,260
You eat well.

10
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,700
Keep that up.

11
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,300
Front and back.

12
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,060
Oh come on!

13
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,740
You two are up early.

14
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,820
Uh yeah.

15
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,380
Wanted him to eat something before work.

16
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,580
Oh sure.

17
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,660
Is it good?

18
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,940
Want something else?

19
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,380
Hey seriously shh.

20
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,740
Why are you this cute?

21
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,020
You seem different lately.

22
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,660
Something good happen?

23
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,420
Huh?

24
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,780
No nothing like that.

25
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,780
You sure it's not because you're seeing someone?

26
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,980
No I'm not... dating anyone.

27
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,700
Sounds like you are.

28
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,420
You're dating aren't you.

29
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,380
You are right? you're totally dating.

30
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,620
I said it's not like that.

31
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,340
Sure doesn't sound like it.

32
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,020
Hey Jin, you asleep?

33
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,100
No, why?

34
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,700
Can I come over to your bed?

35
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,220
Yeah.

36
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,740
What's up you can't sleep?

37
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,660
No it's not that.

38
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,340
What are we exactly?

39
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,580
Why're you asking me that?

40
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,700
Huh?

41
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,700
Why does it matter what we are?

42
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,340
I like things just the way they are.

43
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,220
Don't you?

44
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,860
Uh...

45
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,340
You came over just to ask that?

46
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,020
Not really...

47
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,220
Let's go to bed now...

48
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,740
Night.

49
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,780
Yeah you too.

50
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,380
Why is the toilet paper always gone?

51
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,620
I swear the house manager's a total slob.

52
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,700
Yoon Su!

53
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,740
You two don't need anything else now right?

54
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,180
Huh?

55
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,100
Isn't that Jin?

56
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:02,660
What the?

57
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,700
Yeah.

58
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,980
Who's the next to him?

59
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,020
Looks like he's having fun.

60
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,460
Jin?

61
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,940
Yoon Su must be bummed,

62
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,340
since he's moving out.

63
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,340
Huh?

64
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,580
What do you mean?

65
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,260
You didn't know?

66
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,980
He's only staying here till the end of this week.

67
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,940
He didn't tell you?

68
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,380
What...?

69
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,740
So where are you gonna live after you move out?

70
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,900
Got a few places in mind.

71
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,300
Probably somewhere near campus.

72
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,340
You're really living on your own now huh.

73
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,700
Yeah once I move out,

74
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,140
I wanna try actually dating for real

75
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,580
and have some time for myself.

76
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,940
So we were just getting in your way is that it?

77
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,220
Why would you twist it like that?

78
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,980
How can you act like this?

79
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,140
Everything that happened here

80
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,740
meant nothing to you?

81
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,100
It meant something to me...

82
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,900
You're totally misunderstanding right now.

83
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,980
Misunderstanding?

84
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,340
So all those things you did to me were a misunderstanding too?

85
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,740
That's not what I meant I'm saying...

86
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,980
Why didn't you tell me

87
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,700
you're moving out?

88
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,060
Why do I have to hear it from someone else?

89
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,100
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

90
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,340
Is that why you're upset?

91
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,980
You were seeing someone else.

92
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,380
And you still acted like that with me?

93
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,980
So I was just something you messed around with

94
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,740
and tossed aside when you were done?

95
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,580
What?

96
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,780
What are you talking about...

97
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,900
I heard everything earlier

98
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,700
that you had someone else.

99
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,260
Earlier today?

100
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,100
Ah... that...

101
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,820
You told me to be honest with my feelings.

102
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,780
But you're the one who wasn't honest at all.

103
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,180
You done saying everything?

104
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,340
Cuz it's my turn now.

105
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,940
Everyone come here.

106
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,460
I need to say something.

107
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,260
I'm moving out of the share house.

108
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,380
Because I'm planning

109
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,780
to live with someone I like.

110
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,460
And earlier today,

111
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,060
I was out with the realtor checking places.

112
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,860
Oh okay...

113
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,460
And the person I like

114
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,020
is you, Yoon Su.

115
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,300
What?

116
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,100
What are you talking about...

117
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,140
Huh? why... why all of a sudden?

118
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,540
What does that even mean?

119
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,220
I like Yoon Su.

120
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,900
I like him a lot.

121
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,460
Why are you saying this now...?

122
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,780
You're the one who told me to be honest.

123
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,900
I just kept it quiet because I wanted it to be a surprise.

124
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,940
Didn't expect it to blow up the second I walked out...

125
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,860
But honestly you two look good together.

126
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,140
Right? don't you think so?

127
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,020
Yeah you guys actually look great.

128
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,060
Come on give it up.

129
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,700
Yeah.

130
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,580
You look good together.

131
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,220
Seriously you two fit.

132
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,180
We're rooting for you!

133
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,700
Why are you saying that too?

134
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,540
There's nothing to root for.

135
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,300
Hey, you awake?

136
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,940
You're not sleeping right?

137
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,260
What is it?

138
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,580
You still haven't answered me.

139
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,020
Are you gonna live with me or not?

140
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,860
I...

141
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,860
You don't have to answer right now.

142
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,940
Take your time and think about it.

143
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,540
I always thought a confession would feel good but...

144
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,820
Thanks everyone I really had a good time.

145
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,940
Take care.

146
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,380
Come visit if you get bored.

147
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,860
And call us time to time.

148
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,060
Get home safe.

149
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,460
Yeah.

150
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,500
Let's go inside.

151
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,460
You really don't wanna come with me?

152
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,500
I've got work.

153
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,220
And my lease here isn't up yet.

154
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,980
It's just... not he right time.

155
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,900
And you confessed in front of everyone today.

156
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,460
If I suddenly move out now,

157
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,300
What do you think they'll assume?

158
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,740
That we're dating obviously.

159
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,740
So what?

160
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,620
You might not care what people think.

161
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,140
but I'm... not there yet.

162
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,060
Alright then

163
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,100
If you ever change your mind just call me.

164
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,140
And if you come over

165
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,140
You can watch all the porn you want without hiding it.

166
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,580
Seriously knock it off!

167
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,700
Get home safe.

168
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,380
Text me when you get there.

169
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,500
Okay.
